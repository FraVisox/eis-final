Recent initiatives, such as the PRS Foundation’s Keychange pledge to achieve a 50/50 gender split on lineups by 2022, go some way in tackling the issue, but artists, festival bosses and promoters say more needs to be done. “There’s still a big imbalance being programmed on festival stages,” said Vanessa Reed, CEO of the PRS Foundation. “The urgency for change has really grown. One of the biggest challenges has been: where do we start?” Last week, Keychange announced that 40 additional festivals and conferences have signed up, bringing the total to 85. Festivals taking part include the Proms, Kendal Calling and Liverpool Sound City. The announcement comes after an outcry about male-heavy lineups at some of the UK largest’s festivals. In January, Lily Allen and Annie Mac were among the celebrities to criticise Wireless festival – which specialises in rap, grime and hip-hop – for announcing a lineup that included only three female acts across three days of music. In the world of indie, only four of the top 20 acts at this year’s Green Man festival are all-female, while this month’s three-site punk festival Slam Dunk has only two bands featuring women across the 16 on its two biggest stages. Melvin Benn, the managing director of Festival Republic, the promoter behind Wireless, said the festival – which sold out in 24 hours – had approached “17 or 18 more acts” but was unable to secure them because of touring diaries and record schedules. He added: “Within the genre, there are insufficient women across the board that are strong ticket sellers.” Green Man director Fiona Stewart, part of the festival’s “roughly 90%” female curatorial team, said: “We want to have more women at the top of the bill, but it has been hard this year and there is an industry-wide issue of fewer female acts available at all levels that has affected the booking process.” Benn said that this year’s controversy over Wireless was not the first time his festivals have come under fire for their lineups. Reading and Leeds festival was strongly criticised in 2015 for having only nine acts featuring women, but its 2017 edition was launched with 57 men and one woman making up the first 20 announced artists. One of the ways Festival Republic is addressing the problem is through a project launched last year called ReBalance, which offers female artists studio recording time. “I couldn’t think how to address it because the acts weren’t there,” Benn said. “I got the idea to start encouraging more women to start recording music.” Nabihah Iqbal, a DJ and producer, said the problem lies at the top of the industry. “If there’s no diversity among the decision-makers,” she said, “you won’t see diversity reflected in their decisions.” Iqbal, who is playing a number of UK festivals this year including Latitude and Field Day, said: “I’ve been doing music full-time for the last five years and I can only think of two instances where I’ve dealt with female promoters.” Ele Beattie, a booker for Bestival, agreed that more women were needed in decision-making positions within the industry. She said that while there are fewer female headliners to pick from than men, that does not mean fewer women should appear on lineups. “You can book them for that second headline slot, or headline slot on second biggest stage,” she said. “Support women now so that further down the line they will be that headliner.” Bestival, which has signed for the Keychange pledge, has a 33% representation of women at this year’s festival. Iqbal said that while she welcomes the Keychange pledge, she remains sceptical that quotas will solve problems endemic to the industry. “Real change only comes when the people in those positions of power change the way they think and they don’t feel like they’re trying to fill a quota for the sake of it,” she said. “If you’re putting together a roster of musical artists, it should be done purely on merit, and gender shouldn’t be a part of it.” Yaw Owusu, music curator at the Liverpool international music festival, agreed and said that when he books the festival, he aims for diversity over box-ticking. “I come from a minority demographic myself,” he said. “I’m very cautious to avoid tokenism.” Owusu added that for a smaller festival, one of the biggest challenges in adding women to the lineup is exclusivity clauses in contracts that prevent artists from playing events in the same region if they have been booked by the larger festivals. “As an independent festival, you can’t really get to some of those bigger artists because they’re locked up in exclusivity clauses,” he said. “Every year when I put my list together, I’ve got a majority female artists in my top 20, but when it comes down to it, I might only be able to get three or four through the door.” Experts agreed that the need for change has gathered steam in 2018, but that the problem is far from new. According to data gathered by Pitchfork, female representation at music festivals has increased to 19% this year from 14% in 2017. Last year, a BBC study of 14 major UK festivals for the last decade found out of 660 headline appearances, only 37 were all-female acts. “Festivals are meant to promote a utopia where the regular rules don’t apply,” Beattie said. “I want to see that reflected in the lineups. It’s really important, as promoters and festival bookers, to represent the world that we want to see.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/10/cloud-gate-dance-theatre-review-sadlers-wells-london-formosa-lin-hwai-min","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T12:48:02Z","webTitle":"Cloud Gate Dance Theatre review – exquisitely turbulent testament to Taiwan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/10/cloud-gate-dance-theatre-review-sadlers-wells-london-formosa-lin-hwai-min","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/10/cloud-gate-dance-theatre-review-sadlers-wells-london-formosa-lin-hwai-min","fields":{"headline":"Cloud Gate Dance Theatre review – exquisitely turbulent testament to Taiwan","bodyText":"It will be an epochal moment when Lin Hwai-min retires next year from Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, the company he founded in 1973. Not only was Lin among the first choreographers to bring contemporary dance to the Chinese world, he also established his company as Taiwan’s proudest cultural product. Choreographing his work in a pioneeringly eclectic blend of eastern and western styles, Lin became emblematic of the Taiwanese’s own national struggle to establish an identity for themselves, perched between communist China and the wider world. Formosa is Lin’s farewell work for his company and also a valedictory meditation on the history of his nation. Ilha Formosa, “beautiful island”, was the name that Portuguese sailors gave to Taiwan when they arrived in the 16th century. But, working in a style that looks dramatically more conflicted, turbulent and edgy than his typical creations, Lin evokes the darker story that lies behind Formosa’s beauty, the story of an island that has been shaped by cataclysmic natural disasters, and by the violence of human invaders. The stage at first is a clear, empty, innocent space, in which the 22 dancers establish a busy, harmonious community. Lin’s narrative is more metaphorical than linear, and the dancers’ briskly patterned walks, workmanlike partnering and simple cotton costumes make them appear simultaneously ancestral and modern, agrarian and urban. They represent a timeless ideal of orderly Formosan society, and there’s parallel tracking between time and place that’s also reflected in the accompanying soundtrack of Chinese texts and indigenous songs; and in Chou Tung-yen’s elegant design, which is created from the projection of Chinese poems and individual Chinese characters on to the stage. Exquisite moments bloom throughout this first half: a transcendently strange slow dance of unfurling balances and winged flight, in which a woman is transformed into the beautiful egret of poet Yang Mu’s imagining; a weaving swaying ensemble that flows like water across the stage, while behind it the projected text starts to drift and dissolve, forming a river of words. There is always the possibility of threat in this metaphorical paradise; when the river of words starts to darken into a flood, the dancers’ orderly groupings become tremulous with panic. But it’s in the second half that Lin and his collaborators shockingly evoke the waves of natural and human violence that have riven Formosa during the course of its history. As the soundtrack is invaded by Kaija Saariaho’s percussive score, the projected characters distort and explode, appearing to crash land on stage like rocks or bombs. Within this blasted landscape the dancers are locked into pummelling, shaking duets, solos of catatonic fear, group dances of adversarial tension. If, at very occasional moments, Lin’s choreography teeters towards the over literal, he sweeps the work onwards to an apotheosis as visionary as it is unexpected. Having extinguished his stage in blackness, Lin seems to promise a rebirth as stars begin to glimmer on the back wall, as the dancers regroup, and words such as “Love” and “Formosa” appear. Yet within moments all this is washed away by video footage of crashing waves, and only one dancer remains, as if contemplating the transience of his own species. Lin, the consummate master of his very particular art, has moved from choreographing a history of Taiwan, to choreographing a meditation on history itself. • At Sadler’s Wells, London, until 12 May.

Yet five years ago, that’s what I had to do. It went against every parental and human instinct, but I held my daughter, told her I loved her and that she could die. Nyah was 21 months old and had previously been healthy, headstrong and full of life. When I was meant to be thinking about how to celebrate her second birthday, I was planning her funeral. Sepsis led us to live every parent’s worst nightmare. At that time I’d never heard of sepsis. When Nyah had a rash and was unwell, we took her to A&amp;E. They discharged her after a few hours and the message from the GP two days later seemed to be along the lines of “Calpol and cuddles”. Everyone said it was a viral infection and that she would get better. I had no idea she was so ill and it seems neither did the health professionals who saw her. The following morning she woke up in her cot at home and by the end of the day was on life support at the Royal Brompton hospital. The paediatric intensive care staff worked so hard to give Nyah every chance. She survived six surgeries during her week in intensive care. We couldn’t have asked for more resources and effort to be put in to saving her. Her heart got stronger as her body fought off the infection but she had received CPR for 90 minutes before being put on the life support machine and her brain had been starved of oxygen. Each day in hospital was a rollercoaster filled with hope and despair about whether she would survive and what kind of life she might have. I appreciated the staff’s honesty throughout. I recall one consultant talking in terms of the quality of life he would want for his own daughter. Every decision about turning off a child’s life support machine is unique. For us that decision was both the hardest and easiest one to make. We felt the quality of life available to Nyah was not what she would have wanted. Her brain was too damaged. She had been too full of life. When the day came to switch off the machines the staff were incredible. I can’t imagine a worse day in the office than starting a shift knowing you have to care for a child who will die that night. I will never forget the two nurses who gave us space, respect, hugs and tea. They helped me wash and dress her and change her nappy – as they had done all week. We could stay with Nyah for as long as we wanted after she had taken her last breath. No one rushed us. After a week of bleeping machines and medical interventions I could finally cuddle her. I have worked as a clinical psychologist in the NHS for over 15 years. I also train clinical psychologists and believe in our healthcare system. I don’t find it the easiest place to work and increasingly think about leaving, especially in the climate of pay freezes, limited resources and being overworked. I imagine that the staff who cared for Nyah faced similar circumstances. I will probably always be frustrated that the bacterial infection that led to sepsis was missed more than once. Perhaps earlier detection would have changed the outcome? That is a question no one can answer. I am hopeful that parents and professionals seem to be increasingly aware of sepsis. This might result in a reduction in sepsis deaths from the current 44,000 a year. For me, the richness of the NHS comes from those individuals who go above and beyond what might be expected of them: those for whom it isn’t just a job. I’m grateful for the medical expertise we encountered that week but, more than anything, I’m grateful for the humanity of the staff who genuinely seemed to care.

Abrahams was sacked on Tuesday after an investigation into allegations of bullying that she insists was not conducted thoroughly or fairly. She strongly denies the allegations. Burnham, who is now mayor of Greater Manchester, was speaking on his regular BBC Radio Manchester programme on Wednesday. “It feels to me like she’s almost been kind of hounded out of her position and I have a huge amount of sympathy for her,” he said. Abrahams, the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said after her dismissal that she had experienced “aggressive, intimidating and wholly unprofessional” behaviour from “certain individuals” in Jeremy Corbyn’s office. She said she would make a formal complaint to the party and the parliamentary authorities. Burnham said he had been absolutely astonished by Abrahams’ sacking. “That is not the Debbie Abrahams that I know. She is one of the kindest, warmest most decent people you could ever hope to meet,” he said. “If Debbie is saying the investigation hasn’t been fair or thorough then I believe her. I think this matter now has to be put to the NEC to have independently adjudicated. “I’ve been in the cabinet and shadow cabinet and I’ve never seen someone taken out of a cabinet or shadow cabinet job in this way, and I’m very worried about it. If there are allegations, make sure they’re fairly investigated ... I find it very very sad that we’re in this position.” The party’s defenders say that there would be no reason to pursue charges unless there were allegations. Members of the shadow cabinet serve entirely at the discretion of the party leader, who can hire and fire as he sees appropriate. On Tuesday, Abrahams said: “I strongly refute the allegations of bullying made against me. I believe the investigation was not thorough, fair or independent. I will continue to represent the people of Oldham East and Saddleworth, and to hold this government to account, from the backbenches.” There were reports that several allegations of bullying were made against Abrahams, and the Guardian understands the initial investigation was as a question of good employment practice. Only after an internal human resources investigation upheld the complaints was her conduct referred to the NEC, as all those involved were Labour party members. The Labour backbencher John Woodcock was suspended from the party last week over sexual harassment claims, which he denies. The Barrow MP, a fierce critic of Corbyn, has also questioned the “integrity of the process” that led to the charges against him being made public during a “politically charged time”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/28/return-of-the-bison-herd-makes-surprising-comeback-on-dutch-coast","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T04:00:43Z","webTitle":"Return of the bison: herd makes surprising comeback on Dutch coast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/return-of-the-bison-herd-makes-surprising-comeback-on-dutch-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/28/return-of-the-bison-herd-makes-surprising-comeback-on-dutch-coast","fields":{"headline":"Return of the bison: herd makes surprising comeback on Dutch coast","bodyText":"Eighty years after they were hunted to extinction, the successful reintroduction of a herd of wild European bison on to the dunes of the Dutch coast is paving the way for their return across the continent. The largest land-living animal in Europe was last seen in the Netherlands centuries ago, and was wiped out on the continent by 1927. Despite successful efforts to breed the species again in the wilds of Poland in the 1950s, and renewed efforts in the last decade in western Europe, the European bison remains as endangered as the black rhino. The 7,000 bison, or bison bonasus, that exist in Europe today are often given supplementary feed by rangers to get through the winter months. Yet a study of a herd of 22 bison living in Kraansvlak, 330 hectares of dunes and natural ponds making up part of the Zuid-Kennemerland national park in north Holland, is now offering a more optimistic assessment of the bison’s chances of survival. A series of research papers from the Dutch study further questions the belief that European bison are forest-dwelling creatures, a development that opens up their reintroduction to a whole host of new European environments. Nature organisations in Sweden, Switzerland and the UK are looking on with interest, and knowledge is being shared with established projects in Spain, France and Germany. “People thought, ‘Bison on dunes? The crazy Dutch’,” said Yvonne Kemp, the bison project leader in the Zuid-Kennemerland park, and the co-author of the latest published research. “But it is working, you can see the herd, they are having calves and doing well. “The general view for decades was that European bison were a forest animal. But we were not so sure. We believed that they are not so suited to forests because today, still in winter time, in lots of areas, they feed the bison. They come to the hay, which is not super natural.” Three bison were first introduced into the Kraansvlak, in the municipality of Bloemendaal, in April 2007, and a further three in 2008, at the start of a 10-year attempt to fight back against encroaching grasses and shrubbery stamping out the area’s biodiversity. Managed by the water company, PWN, which exploits the natural filtration system of the dunes to supply north Holland, there was a pressing need for grazers to eat back the vegetation. And the appetite of bison is legendary. “The bison is the largest terrestrial animal in Europe and it needs a lot of food and it needs not only grasses, but quite a lot of intake year round of weed species,” Kemp explained. “The thinking was that, combined with roe and fallow deer, cattle and rabbits, they could stop the encroachment [of the vegetation].” The chief finding of the study was that European bison can survive without supplementary feeding, even in relatively small nature reserves, by grazing on grasses, herbs and woody plants. And, as their success in Europe’s most densely populated country shows, they can also live close to humans. “Those are wild animals and this is a very urban area so at first we didn’t know what it would take [to reintroduce the herd],” said Kemp. “We had fences of 2.2 metres like a military zone. They are really big, they can jump, they are very powerful ... so we thought we would need really high electric fences. But we have learned what it takes; we have a fence now of 1.2 metres. “At first we would come into the area in cars, but now we have a bison trail for the public to follow. There is a general rule not to go within 50 metres of them, and that’s sensible. But it is safe, and the bison are not stressed.” The bison’s work is evident on the undulating dunes, which are situated between the Zandvoort racing track, whose stand is visible from the highest points, and the city of Haarlem to the east. The animals are impervious to the scratchy hawthorns that would cut up other grazers, and with an average weight of 610kg (96 stone), debarked trees are felled with ease as the bison roam, opening up areas of dense growth for other species. They leave a calling card in the shape of tufts of their winter coat on stumps and bushes. “It is also exciting to see how nature adapts here,” Kemp said. In sub-Saharan Africa the oxpecker has a symbiotic relationship with the buffalo, picking off the parasites in their coats. “Here we have seen magpies doing that job, standing on the bison.” East of Amsterdam, a re-wilding project on the Oostvaardersplassen, where red deer, horses and cattle roam free on low-lying marsh, has been criticised for allowing the grazers to reproduce to such a degree that food became scarce and animals shot to avoid starvation. The Kraansvlak keeps a tight control on numbers, and rotates the bulls, of which they currently have two, with other projects internationally. “These are wild animals, we never forget that, and we are learning all the time,” Kemp said.

Hostilities erupted after Donald Trump’s announcement on Tuesday that the US was pulling out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, a move that infuriated Tehran and raised tensions across the Middle East. Already roiling from civil wars in Syria and Yemen, in recent months the region has seen Israel and Iran increasingly warn of an impending conflict. Both the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres and the EU’s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini appealed for restraint. “The Secretary-General urges for an immediate halt to all hostile acts and any provocative actions to avoid a new conflagration in the region already embroiled in terrible conflicts with immense suffering of civilians,” a spokesman for Guterres said. In a phone call to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Theresa May condemned the Iranian rocket attacks, but called for “calm on all sides.” On Thursday, Israel claimed it hit nearly all key Iranian military targets in Syria during strikes launched in response to a rocket attack on its troops in the occupied Golan Heights it blamed on Iran. The alleged Iranian barrage just after midnight, which Israel said failed to hit its targets, and the latter’s extensive response appeared to be the most significant encounter between the enemies. It would be the first time, if confirmed, that Iran has fired rockets directly at Israeli forces in a conflict that for years has been fought through proxies, such as the Lebanese group Hezbollah. Israel’s response was the biggest strike in Syria since the 1973 Yom Kippur war. The confrontation follows a months-long shadow war campaign during which Israel has been accused of repeated air assaults in Syria, the latest of which was reported on Tuesday night. The Israeli military said it had hit the logistics headquarters of the Iranian Quds forces and military compounds south, north and east of Damascus, including a munition warehouse at the capital’s international airport. Observation and military posts near the occupied Golan Heights were also hit, while Syrian air defence engaged its anti-air batteries to intercept Israeli missiles. The Israeli defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, told a security conference: “We hit nearly all the Iranian infrastructure in Syria … They need to remember the saying that if it rains on us, it’ll storm on them. I hope we’ve finished this episode and everyone understood. “We don’t want an escalation, but won’t let anyone attack us or build an infrastructure to attack us in the future.” Hesaid Iran had also been attempting to bring anti-aircraft systems close to the Israeli border. The occupied Golan Heights has been on high alert since Trump announced he would withdraw from the Iran deal. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through a network of sources, said the Israeli strikes had killed at least 23 fighters, including government troops and allied forces. It did not say if Iranians were among the dead. “The rules of the game are worked out by trial and error, by push and shove. The pushing and shoving has become more intense,” said Heiko Wimmen, of the International Crisis Group. “We are getting closer to the brink.” A White House statement condemned Iran’s “provocative rocket attacks” and said the US supported Israel’s right to defend itself. It said Iran’s Revolutionary Guards bore “full responsibility for the consequences of its reckless actions.” Russia said the Israeli strikes marked a dangerous escalation and urged both Israel and Iran to avoid provoking each other. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, discussed the Middle East in a meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who called for “level-headedness”. “We know that we face an extremely complicated situation here. The escalation of the last few hours shows it is truly a matter of war and peace, and I can only call on all involved to exercise restraint,” she said. Moscow, which supports the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, said 28 Israeli warplanes took part in the raid and 70 missiles were fired. Israel said it had notified Russia before the strikes began. The Syrian capital was shaken with explosions in the early hours of Thursday as jets flew overheard. Residents posted videos online of what appeared to be air defence missiles running bright streaks through the sky and reported loud noises rocking their buildings. Syria’s state news said Damascus had intercepted dozens of missiles, but several had hit radar and other military posts. Israel said about 20 rockets were fired from an Iranian-operated launcher at its forces in the Golan Heights and either fell short of their targets or were intercepted. Tensions between Iran and Israel rose in February when Israel said it had shot down an Iranian drone in its airspace. Since then, Syria and Iran have not retaliated to what they claimed were multiple Israeli attacks, although Israel’s intelligence community had braced itself for a response. Iranian authorities were muted in Tehran on Thursday, neither confirming nor denying the reported rocket strike. State-run Press TV said Syrian air defences had “intercepted several rockets fired from Israeli aircraft after the Tel Aviv regime targeted Syrian army positions in the occupied Golan Heights”. Hossein Salami, second in line of command of the Revolutionary Guards, boasted about Iran’s military prowess on Thursday without mentioning the confrontation, saying Tehran had “gained such immense power and deterrent capabilities that the enemies would not come to think of taking military action against the country”. Throughout the Syrian war, Israel has carried out dozens of airstrikes, mostly on weapon convoys believed to be heading for Hezbollah fighters, but the overnight raids were the most intense to date."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14986","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T23:00:11Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,986","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14986","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14986","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,986","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14984","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T23:00:12Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,984","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14984","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14984","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,984","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/may/10/bt-to-axe-13000-jobs-and-move-out-of-london-hq","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T09:49:01Z","webTitle":"BT to axe 13,000 jobs and move out of central London HQ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/bt-to-axe-13000-jobs-and-move-out-of-london-hq","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/10/bt-to-axe-13000-jobs-and-move-out-of-london-hq","fields":{"headline":"BT to axe 13,000 jobs and move out of central London HQ","bodyText":"BT is to axe about 13,000 jobs over the next three years and move out of its central London headquarters after almost 150 years, as it seeks to cut £1.5bn in costs after a torrid 18 months. The telecoms company said the job losses would come mainly from back office and middle-management roles. About two-thirds of the job cuts will fall on its UK workforce of about 83,000, with the remainder coming from the 23,000 staff it employs internationally. BT is also moving out of its central London headquarters in St Paul’s, where it has been headquartered since 1874 when the group was known as the General Post Office, as part of a wide-ranging restructuring. “This is probably the most significant transformation we have made in the last 10 years,” said Gavin Patterson, the chief executive of BT. “We need to do this to be competitive in the future. If we are compared with our peers we are frankly too complex and overweight. While I recognise the pain, ultimately it is the right thing to do for the business.” The group also said it would be hiring about 6,000 new staff, primarily in customer service and engineering. BT’s standalone subsidiary Openreach, which is responsible for building and managing most of the UK’s broadband infrastructure, has already announced 3,500 of the new jobs. It is looking to hire engineers this year as part of a plan to speed up the rollout of fibre broadband and eliminate “not-spots” in cities and suburban areas. The job cuts, which amount to about 13% of BT’s total global workforce, mean the company will ultimately be cutting about 17,000 jobs over a four-year period. Last May, it cut 4,000 jobs, with about half coming from the UK, to save £300m over two years. BT said the move out of St Paul’s formed part of a plan to cut the number of locations it owns across the UK. Patterson said that about 80% of its staff were based in around 50 offices across the UK. That number will be cut to 30 “modern, strategic sites to create a more collaborative, open and customer-focused working culture”. “In many cities we have multiple offices, it is about consolidating in key towns,” said Patterson. “We will certainly have a headquarters in London; this is not BT moving out of London. It is more likely to be in a smaller, future-oriented working environment.” The company said it is looking at “all options” for the future of the St Paul’s site. It would not comment on the value of the property, which has a varied history including being damaged in the first and second world wars. Prospect, the union representing 140,000 public and private sector workers such as engineers and managers said the larger-than-expected cuts would be a “devastating blow” to its members and sounded “unrealistic”. “Decisions like this are not easy to make,” said Patterson. “And I recognise it is going to affect a lot of people.” The large-scale redundancies are the biggest since 2008 and 2009 when 30,000 jobs went, largely as a result of the poor performance of its global services division. BT’s share price fell as much as 8% in early trading, reflecting concern from investors at the group’s forecast of lower revenue and profits this year. BT reported profits of £7.5bn, down 2%, with revenue down 1% to £23bn in the year to the end of March. Patterson, who has endured a torrid 18 months including an accounting scandal at BT’s Italian unit that cost £530m to clean up, said the company had “proved its mettle” over the last year. He said successes included closing the final salary pension scheme and agreeing a multibillion-pound deficit recovery plan, legally separating Openreach and striking a new Premier League rights deal at £295m a season, saving £25m annually ending years of spiralling inflation. Patterson also announced an increase of about £200m in capital expenditure to £3.7bn in each of the next two years, to drive the rollout of superfast broadband and 5G mobile networks. BT said it would hold the dividend unchanged for last year and the next two years, given the outlook for earnings and cashflow, but added that it remained committed to a long-term policy of growing the dividend. The company also agreed a 13-year plan to reduce its pension deficit, which stands at £11.3bn, including payments of £2.1bn over three years and a further £2bn to be raised from a bond issue. Patterson said that BT would also look at the sale of non-core assets and that its under-performing global services operation, which provides IT and communications services to clients ranging from the BBC to Bromley council, would be streamlined. BT is the exception as FTSE 350 firms reduce pension deficits BT’s pension travails aside, Britain’s biggest companies have recently enjoyed a decent run on final salary schemes. Buoyant stock markets, especially on the continent and in the US, and a rise in the interest rate paid on government bonds, which form the backbone of every pension scheme, have tended to bring final salary scheme deficits down. According to Mercer, a leading pensions consultancy, deficits at firms listed on the FTSE 350 fell to £76bn at the end of last year, from £84bn the year before. Rival pension consultancy Hymans Robertson, which produces more conservative estimates, said deficits across the FTSE 350 stood at about £100bn. Both figures are well down on the £137bn collective deficit seen at the end of 2016 by Mercer’s calculations, illustrating how an unusual rise in both stock and bond markets last year improved pension scheme finances. Still, the improvement has a long way to go before falling back to the £18.2bn FTSE 350 deficit estimated by Goldman Sachs in 2014. It was only last year that BT said its deficit was £13.9bn, double the previous year’s total. Since then it has fallen to nearer £9bn, partly because it decided BT pensioners would die a little earlier than expected, saving about £1bn, only to rise again to £11.3bn. Pension schemes forecast their liabilities over a 50-year period and changes in inflation, interest rates, investment returns and life expectancy can all alter the trajectory. The rise in long-term interest rates calculated by BT’s pension trustees may be a canary for other schemes and herald another rise in deficits across the board.

Two weeks ago, Datuk Khairul Anwar Rahmat, the former head of Najib’s United Malay National party’s youth wing, flew to Sydney and, with the approval of Australia’s department of home affairs, went straight to meet in private with Sirul Azhar Umar, a former police commando and hitman. In 2009, Sirul was convicted in Malaysia and sentenced to death for the sensational murder of a Mongolian woman, Altantuya Shaariibuu, in a case widely suspected to have links to Najib. A source told the Guardian that the Malaysian visitor was in Australia to deliver a message to his countryman: “Don’t say anything”. Sirul is under pressure from Australian authorities to prove he did not mastermind the killing if he is to be deemed not a threat to the Australian community and granted a protection visa. His case is due to he heard within months and questions remain over whether he will be willing to implicate others in order to secure freedom in Australia for himself. The killing of Altantuya Shaariibuu One night in October 2006, Sirul and another member of Najib’s elite security contingent kidnapped and killed Altantuya Shaariibuu. Altantuya, a Mongolian translator, was the former lover of Najib’s adviser and confidant, Razak Baginda. She was abducted in front of Baginda’s Kuala Lumpur home and driven to a remote clearing on the outskirts of the city. There she was shot dead with a high-powered semi-automatic gun and her body destroyed with military grade explosives. Sirul and his fellow officer were found guilty of the murder in 2009 but no motive has ever been established. Neither of them had met Altantuya until they forced her into the back of a car. They had been directly engaged by Baginda to stop her harassing him for an alleged US$500,000 she claimed she was owed for her assistance in negotiating a French submarine deal. The crime dogged Najib’s time in office – but a direct link between him and the murder has never been established. Najib has always denied any involvement or ever knowing Altantuya. ‘Boss, I am in difficulties here’ Sirul escaped to Australia in late 2014 when he was out on bail waiting for the judgment on an appeal against his conviction. When that conviction and death sentence were upheld by the Malaysian federal court in January 2015, Australian Federal Police arrested Sirul in Queensland after an Interpol alert. He had overstayed his tourist visa and was later transferred to Villawood. With no time to pack, he left behind a thick trail of evidence as reported by Al Jazeera’s 101 East program in 2016. Page after page of his diaries listed high-powered government contacts, such as the chief of security for the prime minister and various other senior officials in the deputy prime minister’s office. Three days before he was taken into custody in Australia, Sirul sent an SMS message to a close associate with ties to Malaysia’s intelligence agency. “Greetings boss. I am in difficulties here. I want 2 million Australian dollars before boss (you) come to meet me… after that I want 15 million ... I will not return to Malaysia ever boss. I won’t bring down the PM.” Four and a half hours later, the man replied: “They want to discuss.” When Sirul was first incarcerated in Australia journalists were able to visit him. Just weeks after his arrest he reportedly told Malaysia’s online newspaper, Malaysiakini: “I was under orders, the important people with motive (to murder Altantuya) are still free.” He told the Sydney Morning Herald: “I am the scapegoat.” After his detention, it was suggested that Sirul was gearing up to do a “tell all” interview from behind bars in Villawood. But soon after, Sirul had become off limits to journalists. Multiple requests from the Guardian have been rejected by the Australian government. However, the government has allowed Malaysian officials and their middlemen to meet with him regularly. In early 2016, three video recordings of Sirul surfaced on Malaysiakini’s news website. In them he recanted his previous testimony and exonerated Najib. “I understand that it is the intention of certain quarters with vested interests to topple a certain someone ... In God’s name … the most honourable prime minister Najib Abdul Razak was never involved and had no links to the case,” he stated. At the time the videos were released, Najib was battling for his survival. It was the height of Malaysia’s multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal where it was discovered that US$681m from the state investment fund had been transferred into the prime minister’s personal bank accounts. He claimed it was a gift from the Saudi Royal family. Najib cleared himself of any wrongdoing, but now that he has been removed from power he could be investigated and prosecuted for his role in the 1MDB scandal. Greg Lopez, a Malaysia expert at Western Australia’s Murdoch University, says the new government in Kuala Lumpur is likely to re-open the Altantuya case. “The fact no motive for the murder has ever been established leaves open the question that it was a state-sponsored killing and that needs to be thoroughly investigated. Najib could find himself in a very precarious situation.” He believes the new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, will be looking to commute Sirul’s sentence and get him back to Malaysia. From the Australian perspective, he says: “Questions need to be answered as to the relationship between the Australian government and Najib. “How is it that an individual, who was standing trial for murder in one of the region’s most high-profile cases was allowed to come to Australia on a tourist visa and why were Malaysian officials allowed to visit and seemingly manipulate him in detention? Those questions have never been answered satisfactorily by the Australian government.” ‘My daughter did nothing bad’ For three years Sirul has languished in Australia’s highest security detention centre at a cost of at least $800,000. In 2017 Sirul received official notification from the department of immigration and border protection that his application for a protection visa was likely to be rejected on the grounds he had committed a non-political crime before entering Australia. The letter also stated the department had received “unfavourable information that does not support your application”. The substance of that unfavourable information has not been disclosed publicly. In recent weeks there have been teleconferences between Sirul’s Australian lawyers and the department. The timeline is now set for a hearing of his case in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. By Friday 11 May, he had to give “any additional evidence” he “intends to rely on and a statement of issues, facts and contentions”. The department must reply by 30 May. By 1 June both Sirul and the department must “give a hearing certificate” in which they need to list witnesses, experts and their legal representatives. For Sirul, he can’t remain silent any longer if he’s to prove why he isn’t “ineligible for the grant of a protection visa”. What sparked Datuk Khairul’s visit two weeks ago also remains unclear, but it is known that since Sirul was incarcerated Datuk Khairul has visited him three to four times a year – his previous visit was only in February. This time he stayed for about an hour and a half. Datuk Khairul is yet to respond to an email requesting him to confirm his visit to Sirul, his relationship to him and why he came to see him. In 2016 Altantuya’s father, Setev Shaariibuu, a now retired professor at Mongolia’s Ulaanbaatar University, was still trying to come to terms with what happened, telling Al Jazeera’s 101 East : “My daughter did nothing bad to (Malaysia), maybe she made someone furious or mad, but she wasn’t a terrorist, she didn’t kill anybody, she didn’t illegally cross borders. There must be a huge amount of money, power and possibly crucial operations behind this. It’s obvious.” “Altantuya’s life was taken away, she was executed. Someday those people who did this crime will be punished.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/20/we-still-have-hearts-homeless-on-the-streets-of-kettering","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T17:15:50Z","webTitle":"'We still have hearts': homeless on the streets of Kettering","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/20/we-still-have-hearts-homeless-on-the-streets-of-kettering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/20/we-still-have-hearts-homeless-on-the-streets-of-kettering","fields":{"headline":"'We still have hearts': homeless on the streets of Kettering","bodyText":"It is lunchtime in the large market town of Kettering, Northamptonshire, and 38-year-old Ethan is sitting on a black bench in the centre of town as shoppers flow past. Dressed in a black jacket and jeans, he says he has been destitute for nearly a decade – with periods spent sleeping rough – although he is now living in temporary accommodation. Much of his time has been spent in Kettering, he says, and he has seen the town change over the years. In 2016, the council introduced a public space protection order (PSPO) which, among other things, makes it an offence to beg in the area. This has had a big impact on people like Ethan. If he puts a container on the ground or gives any indication he is asking people for money, he could end up in prison. “It adds to all the stress and makes it harder to be homeless … it makes you feel like you are not welcome, like you are being pushed out,” he says. The council says it implemented the policy – which also outlaws loitering, alcohol and swearing – to tackle antisocial behaviour in the town centre. Those prosecuted for begging can be fined up to £1,000. Upon prosecution, they receive criminal behaviour orders preventing them from drinking alcohol or begging. If they re-offend, they face imprisonment. To date, 13 people have been successfully prosecuted and fined by the borough council. In May 2017, the local authority hailed what it believed to be “the most criminal behaviour orders issued at once on the back of convictions” for begging after they took 10 people to court for breaching the PSPO. Nine were convicted, fined hundreds of pounds and given criminal records. The council has also banned loitering and obstructing the carriageway of a street. “You have to sleep anywhere that is out of sight of cameras – otherwise you will be arrested for trying to get your head down,” Ethan says. “Sometimes when you are trying to do something positive it feels like they just want to kick you back down again.” His friend Wayne, who is also homeless, walks past. Wayne was recently given a criminal behaviour order preventing him from begging. Kettering council had said he often targeted older people in car parks and became aggressive when challenged. If he breaches the order he faces five years in prison. Wayne holds back tears as he says he is having a bad day and does not want to speak. The only thing he will divulge is that he is now not allowed to even sit down in the area for more than 45 minutes. Ethan says he was fined when he was caught sleeping in a doorway. “All the stress from that forces you to do silly things … I just want to be treated as a person.” Stewart Corke, 40, who volunteers at the Salvation Army store says shop fronts have been boarded up to prevent rough sleepers using doorways for shelter. “People are trying to push them out somewhere, boarding up the shop fronts, but they are not dealing with the problem. It’s just pushing it out of town,” Corke says. Not everyone sees the PSPO as completely negative. Amy (not her real name), who used to be homeless, says begging can make some vulnerable older people feel threatened. The Labour councillor Mick Scrimshaw says the practice can be intimidating and that some people asking for money are not genuine rough sleepers. “The concern is that by cracking down on that, by default you are also cracking down on those who need genuine support. When there is a rule that is black and white, that is what happens,” he says. In a statement, the council said that most of its enforcement of the PSPO was related to street drinking and begging but none of those prosecuted were homeless. “It is possible that some, at the time, may have been in temporary accommodation and indeed their circumstances may now have changed ... We are not shying away from taking enforcement action against those who are intentionally homeless, who refuse help and display anti-social behaviour,” the statement read. The number of rough sleepers in Kettering has risen from three in 2016 to 14 a year later. Scrimshaw says a lack of affordable housing is behind the rise. “There is not enough social housing in Kettering, so the council spent over £1m last year on emergency accommodation.” Kettering has no hostels, although community volunteers are trying to open one. The main charity supporting people is Accommodation Concern, which offers housing advice to those in need. But even it is struggling, with funding often hard to find. “Centres like us, charities who deal with the most vulnerable care, are closing. I am not saying we are at risk of closure but we are one funding stream away from real danger,” says Ralph Blackledge, the charity manager at Accommodation Concern. Ethan thinks that instead of focusing on criminalising homelessness, efforts should be focused elsewhere; tackling the issues that are leading to the problem and addressing the needs of the homeless community. “What would make it easier for people like me? If the help we got was quicker and people could be housed in accommodation that suited them. “It should also not take so long, for example, if you have an alcohol or drugs problem. Instead of giving you a seven-day detox and no aftercare help, they should offer counselling to address the underlying problem. “I want to be treated as a person – the council are not compassionate or anything. But we still have hearts and we still bleed.” • This article was amended on 21 May 2018 to provide further details about the circumstances of an interviewee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/14/premier-league-2017-18-review-pundit-of-the-season","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T12:50:28Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2017-18 review: pundit of the season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/14/premier-league-2017-18-review-pundit-of-the-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/14/premier-league-2017-18-review-pundit-of-the-season","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2017-18 review: pundit of the season","bodyText":"Frank Lampard The Ferdinand-Gerrard-Lampard axis has carried BT Sport through its Champions League campaign in some style, and though it will presumably be hoping that Gerrard’s decision to dip his toe into managerial waters ends with Nevillesque haste, it has so far retained the more essential duo. Lampard also has plans to move into management, but in the meantime approaches his commentating duties with diligence and speaks with confidence and authority. Pat Nevin Radio commentators are inevitably less noticeable than those who work on television, partly because we never see their faces and partly because we often give the television our undivided attention but listen to the radio only while driving and/or being loudly instructed by other members of the family to turn on something more interesting instead, ideally involving Camila Cabello. But Nevin is always a good listen and earned additional respect after revealing this year that he was once accosted by a knife-wielding football fan and used a flying fist and the winger’s familiar turn of pace to make good his escape, leaving him only a few rungs below Spider-Man on the crime-fighting ladder. Gary Neville Since retiring as a player in 2011 Neville has never been absent from this list and his glorious run is not about to end. It remains puzzling that no rival broadcaster has sought to copy the format that makes the first 50 minutes of Monday Night Football so compelling and illuminating, but though he has started to focus a little too much on furiously criticising footballers whom he spots walking, often but not always Mesut Özil, he remains enlightening before and during matches. Ian Wright If there were an award for most improved pundit, Ian Wright would take it. There was a time when he appeared to believe his brand of matey bonhomie was all it would take to indefinitely earn a living out of punditry, and that an absence of actual analysis would go unnoticed amid all the joshing, chuckling and unexpected use of flat caps. This was very much the tactic also used by Alan Shearer, only he stripped away the geniality and headwear to leave something that was neither animated nor insightful nor thermally insulated. Both have managed to reinvent themselves, and Wright – who has never previously been mentioned in our review, not even mockingly – is now something of an up-and-comer. Chris Sutton Curmudgeonly and over-opinionated, Sutton operates as if having consciously decided that the fastest and surest way of standing out amid a heaving morass of aspiring pundits was to aggressively irritate everyone. Sutton has a particular shtick, and it is not to everybody’s liking. Thus when the Mirror ranked every television football pundit in regular action earlier this season, Sutton was at No 37 (out of 39, one place ahead of Garth Crooks and two above Michael Owen). He is, in his way, like a cut-price Robbie Savage, only without the preening narcissism. However, I find him entertaining. So there. “I watch a lot of TV and find some of it extremely tedious and boring because people don’t want to say the things they should be saying,” Sutton says. “I am not always right, but I think it is important to have an opinion.” It certainly helps. Graeme Souness The leaf miner moth presents a serious threat to that most beloved of British trees, the horse chestnut. These tiny mites have attacked one particular breed of tree and done so with such cruel efficiency that it has rendered the future of conkers in Britain tragically uncertain. Meanwhile ash dieback is a fungus that attacks its prey with savage speed, killing juvenile trees with the efficiency of an assassin. In the 1970s Dutch elm disease destroyed millions of elms across the country. So if it can happen to trees, what if some foreign critter crept into the country undetected and started to attack football pundits? Granted, this is scientifically impossible, but go with me here. Let’s say that, as soon as the problem was identified, a house was built within a totally safe exclusion zone but only big enough to house one pundit’s ego. Who would you put inside? I would unhesitatingly send in Souness, whose tactical acumen is strong, who hands out praise and condemnation with even-handed sense and whose range of exasperated facial expressions is second to none."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/11/robots-take-our-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T14:20:00Z","webTitle":"Will we fall apart when the robots take our jobs? | Christina Patterson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/robots-take-our-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/robots-take-our-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Will we fall apart when the robots take our jobs?","bodyText":"Five years ago, I lost the thing that mattered to me most. I received a letter about “synergies” and “integration”, and was told that the “synergies” would “reduce costs”. I didn’t like the sound of “synergies”. But the worst moment was when an executive looked out of a window and told me that he wanted to “freshen the pages up”, and I knew that I was losing both my job as a writer on a national newspaper and the contract for a column I thought I had been promised to sugar the pill. It’s interesting what happens to the body when it’s in shock. You can’t stop shaking. Your heart thumps in your chest like a mad prisoner trying to hammer a way out. I lost 8lb in four days and didn’t stop shaking for two weeks. I always thought so many things mattered more than work. I had lost my sister. I had lost my father. I had lost relationships. I had lost my breast to cancer. I never set out to be a “career woman”, which is what tabloid newspapers sometimes call women who pay their own bills. But I didn’t have a partner or a family, and so my work played a huge part in my life. And without it, I discovered, I was no longer quite sure who I was. “Middle-class woman loses nice job” is not a headline to bring out the violins, especially in these difficult times. I will probably always find a way to pay my bills. But many middle-class people are now losing their jobs; jobs that will not come back. Newspapers – like book publishers, the music industry and other parts of the knowledge economy – are feeling the pressure of “disruption”. And, as even Mark Zuckerberg has now discovered, disruption isn’t always fun. “We are now living in a world where insurgents are much better able to challenge incumbents,” said Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, at a conference on “the age of self-employment” the other day. “Success in the modern economy is going to be about the disruptors, the innovators.” She and her government colleagues thought that self-employment and the gig economy were “a wholly positive trend”. It all sounded very exciting. I looked around the room to see if people were feeling the buzz. On a quick glance, it was hard to tell. Some people were there for work: sitting in a room, drinking coffee and fiddling with their phones, and still being paid by their employer. Others, like me, were freelancers, there in the vague hope that we would learn something new. We knew that it was yet another day when we would earn no money, but we put it down to “networking” – one of the things that everyone says self-employed people have to do. There were discussions about savings. We learned that only 17% of self-employed people pay into a pension. Perhaps that’s because many self-employed people don’t have much money to put aside: according to the Office for National Statistics, the most common income for self-employed people is around £240 a week, while employees earn around £400 a week. Since I have been freelance, there have been some weeks when I have struggled to earn £240. Once, I worked on an article that took 10 days to research and write for a fee of £250, but it was not published. Like most freelance journalists, I’m paid by the word on publication, not for time spent on the project. Of course, we don’t have to be freelance journalists. We could try something else: PR perhaps, though PR companies are hardly rushing to employ middle-aged writers who have been fired. Many of us prefer to earn our living, or try to earn our living, by doing the thing we love. But most are earning a fair bit less than they did before. The average freelance journalist earns around £20,000 a year, £7,600 less than the average salary. I don’t expect much sympathy. Journalism is more fun, and still better paid, than many jobs, though we are not often held in very high esteem. But bear in mind that where journalists and publishers, and other providers of so-called “content”, lead, others will follow. If you’re an accountant, a financial adviser or a shop worker, you should be afraid. The robots are coming to get about a third of us, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report on the future of employment, with “the potential to bring great economic benefits”. But not, perhaps, to the people who have lost their jobs. And let’s not even think about driverless cars, which some estimates believe could see the end of 3 million driving jobs in the UK. We will all need help in finding other work. Help in training, in transferring our skills and, in the meantime, in paying our bills. Since I lost my job, I have talked to many people about change, in the course of writing a book about how we cope when our lives go wrong. I have talked to people who have lost jobs, relationships, loved ones, their health. And through these conversations, and through five years of a “portfolio life”, I have learned that the skills we need when our lives go belly up are also the skills we need to cope with a changing world. We need to keep learning, keep adapting, and keep trying, even when it all feels pretty damn hard. In our lives we do this, all the time. And as we face what many economists are calling the second machine age, we will all have to learn how to do this more. It’s going to be interesting. It’s going to be tough. It would be nice if our politicians acknowledged this – particularly the ones with titles such as chief secretary to the Treasury, who are on salaries of more than £110,000. • Christina Patterson is author of The Art of Not Falling Apart.

Thanks to Nato air strikes, and perhaps British bombs, clear evidence emerged that MI6 was directly complicit, indeed had helped to set up, the rendition of Abdel Hakim Belhaj, a leading opponent of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and Belhaj’s pregnant wife, Fatima Boudchar. The bombs destroyed the Tripoli office of Gaddafi’s foreign intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa. His files were scattered. They included a letter from Mark Allen, MI6’s counter-terrorism chief, dated March 2004 – a year before Straw was assuring MPs – congratulating Koussa on the “safe arrival” of Belhaj. Allen added: “This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years.” Though he noted that the CIA had provided the aircraft for the rendition operation, “the intelligence … was British”. When the evidence emerged of British involvement in the operation, Straw explained: “No foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time.” He said today: “In every case where my approval was sought I assumed, and was entitled to assume, that the actions for which my approval was sought were lawful.” Shortly before the rendition, in which Belhaj was shackled and his wife bound from head to toe throughout a 17-hour flight from Bangkok to Tripoli, Richard Dearlove, the head of MI6, led a high-powered delegation of intelligence officers to discuss close cooperation with Gaddafi and his security chiefs. Whitehall officials have described the rendition of Belhaj and his wife as the result of “ministerially authorised government policy”. After a four-year police investigation, Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service announced that neither Straw nor Allen would face charges, because of insufficient evidence; though it said Allen had “sought political authority for some of his actions, albeit not within a formal written process nor in detail…”. For six years government lawyers fought tooth and nail in the courts to prevent the disclosure of any more incriminating evidence. After today’s statement to MPs by the attorney general, Jeremy Wright, we are none the wiser about where the responsibility lies. In what he called an out-of-court “full and final settlement”, Wright emphasised that there was “no admission of liability”. Despite Wright’s clear implication that British officials had not acted “in line with our values and in accordance with the rule of law”, no member of the Blair government, and no member of MI6 or anyone else in Whitehall’s security establishment, is going to take responsibility for what Theresa May, in her letter to Belhaj, described as “deeply troubling and appalling treatment”. Instead, we had mealy-mouthed references to how British intelligence officers “should have done better to reduce the risk of ill-treatment”. MPs were told how MI6 was slow to understand the practices of “our partners” – a reference in particular to torture and the CIA. This is a tired excuse that has been used before. And it is scarcely credible, given that MI5 and MI6 chiefs were made aware soon after the 9/11 attacks on the US in September 2001 how the CIA was going to treat “terror suspects”. But to make sure that ministers – then and now – will be protected from any blame, Wright told MPs that “cultural” and “behavioural changes” as well as “system” changes were needed in Britain’s intelligence agencies. It is not the first time we have heard that; ministers have said the very same for decades whenever MI5 or MI6 has been caught in a scandal. When he was prime minister, David Cameron set up a judge-led inquiry under Peter Gibson into evidence that MI5 and MI6 were colluding in the rendition of British citizens and residents to the US military jail at Guantánamo Bay. They received millions of pounds in compensation in out-of-court settlements designed to prevent incriminating evidence from being disclosed. The Gibson inquiry was halted when evidence of the Belhaj case emerged. Cameron decided to hand it all over to the prime minister’s intelligence and security committee of MPs and peers. That committee, which meets in private, is no match for a judge-led public inquiry or an open trial in the courts. It seems we will never know who was responsible for the torture of Belhaj and his pregnant wife. • Richard Norton-Taylor is a former Guardian defence and security writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/may/11/david-beckham-appointed-ambassador-of-british-fashion","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T04:00:32Z","webTitle":"David Beckham appointed ​ambassador of British fashion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/11/david-beckham-appointed-ambassador-of-british-fashion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/11/david-beckham-appointed-ambassador-of-british-fashion","fields":{"headline":"David Beckham appointed ​ambassador of British fashion","bodyText":"David Beckham is to take on a leadership role in the fashion industry, a move that consolidates the standing of Beckham and his wife, Victoria, who is a designer, as the first couple of British fashion. As newly appointed ambassadorial president, Beckham will on Friday visit educational fashion projects and clothing manufacturers in Manchester. The post, which Beckham described in a statement as “the chance to get under the skin of an industry I love”, will comprise two parts. The British Fashion Council hopes to leverage Beckham’s fame to attract a new generation of domestic creative and business talent into the industry by encouraging young people to view fashion as a potential career. Meanwhile at a global level, the draw of the Beckham name is expected to bring international investors to the table and secure financial backing for talented young designers. “I’m really excited about promoting fashion as an opportunity to all kids across the country, regardless of their background or their gender,” Beckham told the Guardian, adding: “That means creating more awareness for boys to get involved with fashion ... helping them understand that creative opportunities are available to them too.” Beckham appears to have form in encouraging young men to pursue careers in the industry: his eldest son, Brooklyn, is studying photography at the New York fashion school Parsons. Stephanie Phair, the newly appointed chair of the British Fashion Council, described Beckham’s role as that of a “global figurehead”. Beckham will host an event at menswear shows in London in June Trips to China and the US are in the pipeline. But he will take a backseat during September’s London Fashion Week in order to give Victoria, who is bringing her catwalk show home from New York to celebrate her 10th anniversary in fashion, her turn in the spotlight. The role is another step in a striking evolution from brashly dressed footballer to a front row regular who already has a place at fashion’s top table as the majority owner of the Savile Row label Kent &amp; Curwen. The British Fashion Council hopes that the power of the Beckham brand – which has proved hugely valuable to the designer names he has promoted and the magazines he has appeared in, and has spawned trends from tattoos to flat caps – will prove lucrative on the global stage for British fashion, an industry Beckham described on Thursday as “one of our best performing exports”. Beckham, keen to restore his public reputation after a furore last yea r around leaked emails in which he appeared to bemoan not having been given a knighthood, said he wanted “to support an industry that’s been so good to me”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/may/10/whirlpool-should-be-made-to-recall-tumble-dryers-say-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T16:50:29Z","webTitle":"Whirlpool should be made to recall tumble dryers, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/10/whirlpool-should-be-made-to-recall-tumble-dryers-say-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/10/whirlpool-should-be-made-to-recall-tumble-dryers-say-mps","fields":{"headline":"Whirlpool should be made to recall tumble dryers, say MPs","bodyText":"Whirlpool should be ordered to recall millions of tumble dryers as they pose a serious risk of bursting into flames, a group of MPs has told the government. Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, has written to ministers calling for them to take action over Whirlpool’s refusal to “take proper responsibility” for the defects. Since 2004, more than 750 domestic fires are thought to have been started in homes by the affected tumble dryers. Fluff in contact with the heating element catches fire. The risk applies to older dryers sold under the Hotpoint, Creda, Indesit, ProLine and Swan brands. The company has been replacing or repairing an estimated 3.8m dryers across the UK after identifying the fault in November 2015. Whirlpool did not issue a product recall, initially telling customers they could continue to use their dryer while waiting for modification, provided it was not left unattended. That changed in February 2017 when it said customers should unplug and stop using the machines. However, a number of the “upgraded” machines have also gone up in smoke, prompting the new demand for a formal recall. “Whirlpool continue to refuse to take proper responsibility for defects in their tumble dryers, leaving many people still in the frightening situation where machines are acting as potential fire hazards in their own homes,” Reeves said. “We need the government to step in and ensure consumers get the protection they deserve. Given the woeful paucity of Whirlpool’s actions to remedy this situation, the Office for Product Safety and Standards must now act and consider a full recall of defective machines to ensure this national product safety issue is resolved.” Alex Neill, of the consumer group Which?, said Whirlpool has admitted that at least a million of their tumble dryers still in people’s homes could be a potential fire risk. “Their approach to handling the issue for customers has been an absolute shambles. There are still serious concerns about whether Whirlpool’s modification programme is actually effective. It’s time for a full recall,” he said. Whirlpool said: “We proactively raised this product safety issue in 2015 and have worked diligently and responsibly to resolve it. “The scale of this campaign has been unprecedented as we have achieved a resolution rate more than three times the industry average for a product recall. We have provided resolutions to all consumers who have registered, and resolved over 1.7m affected tumble dryers. “We have total confidence in the modification, it was extensively tested before and after being implemented, and there have been no incidents where it has shown to be ineffective. “An external review with the input from three independent experts in fire safety, product safety, and engineering, concluded that the modification remains the most effective way of rectifying this issue for consumers. “Recent criticisms of the effectiveness of the modification are based on fundamental technical misunderstandings of what it addresses. “We have cooperated with Trading Standards and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy at every stage of the campaign. Trading Standards confirmed, following an internal review by independent experts, that the modification programme remains the most effective way of resolving this issue. “We continue to urge consumers to contact us immediately if they believe they still own an affected appliance. We can assure consumers that if they contact us now, they can receive a resolution within one week.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/11/mod-faces-21bn-budget-shortfall-warns-spending-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-10T23:01:25Z","webTitle":"MoD faces £21bn budget shortfall, warns spending watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/11/mod-faces-21bn-budget-shortfall-warns-spending-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/11/mod-faces-21bn-budget-shortfall-warns-spending-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"MoD faces £21bn budget shortfall, warns spending watchdog","bodyText":"The UK’s armed forces are facing a £21bn funding shortfall over the next decade, a critical report from parliament’s spending watchdog has warned. The public accounts committee said the Ministry of Defence (MoD) “simply does not have enough money to buy all the equipment it says it needs” and accused it of not being clear with politicians or the public about the financial risks. The warnings have emerged as Jeremy Corbyn prepares to call on Friday for navy shipbuilding contracts to remain in the UK. In a speech in Glasgow, aiming to underscore that Corbyn takes an interest in defence, the Labour leader will insist that three new Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels must be built in British shipyards. Corbyn will say: “Workers in British shipyards, from Plymouth to Rosyth, share a proud tradition – building the best ships in the world. “But the Conservative government is trashing that tradition by offering up the Ministry of Defence’s most recent contract for three new fleet solid support ships to overseas companies to build abroad. “This decision is wrong. Today we are calling on the government to guarantee that these three new ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary will be built in domestic shipyards.” The PAC inquiry said the “affordability gap” in the MoD’s equipment plan for 2017 to 2027 had worsened since it reviewed it last year, and criticised officials for still being “unable to determine the size” of it accurately. The most conservative estimate is £4.9bn, rising to a worst-case scenario of £20.8bn more than the 10-year £179.7bn equipment budget, they found. This budget accounts for 40% of the MoD’s planned spending in that period. The PAC’s 2017 review found a budget shortfall of £7bn. The report criticised the plan as “not realistic”, and identified weaknesses in controlling costs. The construction of the next generation of nuclear missile submarines and the F-35 fighter programme were among those singled out for criticism. The report, released on Friday, said the biggest concern was over a need to bring forward some of the costs of building the next generation of nuclear missile submarines, the £31bn Dreadnought class, plus its nuclear warheads. The committee heard evidence that while the cost of the four planned submarines may not increase, some of the money may need to be spent sooner than previously thought, putting extra strain on the budget. MPs also highlighted a failure to include the cost of buying an entire new class of frigate for the Royal Navy, the F31e, in the original equipment plan in 2017. That plan was also missing £9.6bn of “additional costs” but the MoD had been unable to say what they were, the report found. The report also highlighted a lack of “flexibility” in spending that could undermine the armed forces’ ability to combat new threats, such as cyber-attacks and artificial intelligence, because so much money is tied to large-scale, long-term projects. It said the Modernising Defence Programme, announced by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, in January, should explain how it intended to build long-term capability yet retain “sufficient flexibility to respond to changes in the defence landscape”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/a-quick-note-to-say-thanks-to-my-dad-for-always-encouraging-me-to-act","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"A quick note to say… thanks to my dad for always encouraging me to act","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/a-quick-note-to-say-thanks-to-my-dad-for-always-encouraging-me-to-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/a-quick-note-to-say-thanks-to-my-dad-for-always-encouraging-me-to-act","fields":{"headline":"A quick note to say… thanks to my dad for always encouraging me to act","bodyText":"I’d like to say thank you to my dad, Rod Cambridge, who encouraged me to get into acting.

Public Health England had called for a cut of 20% of sugar in the products we buy to take home and eat in cafes by 2020, with 5% in the first year. In a massive new report, PHE shows food manufacturers and supermarkets have cut out 2% over the first 12 months, but much more has been achieved in some areas and by some companies than others. Only three food groups of the eight measured have managed at least a 5% reduction: sweet spreads and sauces, yoghurts and fromage frais, and breakfast cereals. There has been no sugar reduction in biscuits and chocolate bars, although we consume less because they have become smaller. Puddings, meanwhile, have actually become sweeter. While PHE applauded the industry’s efforts, some critics slammed them as inadequate. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) described the results in the first year as “hugely disappointing” and said the government would soon have no choice but to ditch the voluntary approach for mandatory targets. “At best, this is industry being slow to react. At worst – and in reality – it seriously calls into question industry’s engagement with the voluntary approach,” said Prof Russell Viner, president of the RCPCH. The Obesity Health Alliance also spoke of disappointment and called for a revamped obesity plan. “We have seen the success of the soft drinks industry levy in turbo-charging reformulation in sugary soft drinks,” said its lead, Caroline Cerny. “We also know that stronger marketing restrictions, including a 9pm watershed on TV, would help protect children from relentless exposure to junk food, and encourage manufacturers to make their foods healthier. Now is the time for the government to protect our children’s health with a truly world-leading obesity plan.” Chocolate confectionery has a very long way to go. A Terry’s Chocolate Orange contains 58.5g of sugar per 100g. A Cadbury Crunchie contains 65g per 100g. Of the top 20 brands, only Nestlé’s Kit Kat Chunky has decreased in sugar (now at 52.7g per 100g) – by reducing the portion size and calorie count – and Cadbury’s Double Decker has actually gone up. Among ice creams, Wall’s Cornettos and Magnums contain a bit less sugar, but its Soleros contain more. Starbucks has reformulated its chocolate brownies and carrot cake with less sugar. Tesco and Waitrose are among the supermarkets to cut the sugar in their own-brand breakfast cereals and so has Jordans, although Dorset muesli still has 23.4g of sugar and Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut contains 35.3g per 100g. The puddings category, however, has failed to make progress. Ambrosia rice pudding, Mr Kipling sponge pudding and Nestlé Aero chilled mousse were all found to have increased in sugar content and/or calories. The detail of the report is designed to incentivise the food industry to do more and provide a baseline for measuring what it does over the coming years. PHE says next year’s report will give a clearer picture of the adequacy of the industry’s response. Steve Brine, public health minister, hinted that the industry could be compelled to do more. “We lead the world in having the most stringent sugar reformulation targets and it is encouraging to see that some progress has been made in the first year,” he said. “However, we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge we face. We are monitoring progress closely and have not ruled out taking further action.” By contrast with the voluntary 5% sugar reduction in foods, the tough measure taken against sugary drinks in the form of the sugar tax is getting results. The PHE report said that sugar has been reduced by 11% in soft drinks and the average calories in single drink are down by 6%. The data also shows that people are buying more drinks with less sugar – below the 5g per 100ml where the tax kicks in. That could be a result of publicity around high-sugar drinks or because of price. Juice and milk-based drinks for children are now to be included in the PHE sugar-reduction programme, because they are not subject to the tax. PHE wants manufacturers and retailers to cut the sugar levels in juice-based drinks by 5% by 2021 and end sales of single drinks, including smoothies, with more than 150kcals. Milk-based drinks should have 20% less sugar and no single drink should contain more than 300kcals. PHE’s chief executive, Duncan Selbie, said “tackling the obesity crisis needs the whole food industry to step up, in particular those businesses that have as yet taken little or no action”. A quarter of children who start primary school are overweight or obese – and that rises to a third by the time they leave for secondary school at 11. “This is about tackling the nation’s obesity crisis,” said Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE. “Too many children and adults suffer the effects of obesity, as does society, with our NHS under needless pressure. Obesity widens economic inequalities, affecting the poor the hardest.” The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said companies were engaging with what are sometimes difficult technical issues. “As PHE correctly point out, reformulation takes time – it can’t happen overnight,” said Tim Rycroft, director of corporate affairs. “Sugar reduction has considerable technical challenges; sugar plays a variety of roles beyond sweetness in food including colour, texture and consistency. It is for these reasons that we have long said that the guidelines are ambitious and will not be met across all categories or in the timescale outlined. “Obesity poses a huge public health challenge in the UK, and food and drink companies are well aware of their role in addressing this issue. For the last decade the UK’s food and drink companies have been reformulating their products to reduce sugar, calories, fat and salt, as well as limiting portion sizes. In fact, over the last five years FDF members have reduced calorie content in the average basket by 5.5%, and sugar content by 12.1% – and there is more work in the pipeline.” He also called for cafes and restaurants to do more. “In many categories, the calorie content per portion of food served in cafes, coffee shops and restaurants is almost double that of manufacturers and retailers,” he said. “This is at a time when 25% of total calorie consumption takes place outside the home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/22/brexit-vote-cost-uk-mark-carney-bank-of-england","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T16:46:54Z","webTitle":"Brexit vote has cost each UK household £900, says Mark Carney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/22/brexit-vote-cost-uk-mark-carney-bank-of-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/22/brexit-vote-cost-uk-mark-carney-bank-of-england","fields":{"headline":"Brexit vote has cost each UK household £900, says Mark Carney","bodyText":"British households are more than £900 worse off after the vote to leave the EU, according to the governor of the Bank of England, in comments that risk a renewed confrontation with senior Brexit supporters in the government. Comparing the current state of household finances with forecasts made by the Bank before the referendum, prepared on the basis of a remain vote, Mark Carney told MPs that household incomes were now significantly lower than expected. “Real household incomes are about £900 per household lower than we forecast in May of 2016, which is a lot of money,” he said, referring to the total lost growth for incomes in the two years since the 2016 referendum. Speaking in front of the Treasury select committee of MPs, Carney also said the economy was 2% smaller than forecast before the EU referendum, despite the strength of the global economy and the Bank’s emergency cut in interest rates after the Brexit vote. That was “a reasonable difference” to forecasts for the economy made in May 2016, he added. The governor’s comments provoked angry reactions from Brexit supporters, who have previously been critical of Carney and his forecasting record. Jacob Rees-Mogg told MailOnline Carney was “crying wolf”, while Boris Johnson, speaking on a visit to Argentina, insisted Brexit had not damaged the interests of the country. “I believe that the chancellor of the exchequer has given a definitive answer on this matter, which is that it is not the case that Brexit has damaged the interests of this country,” Johnson said. However, opponents of Brexit seized on Carney’s remarks as evidence of the pain being inflicted on households by Britain’s EU exit. Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said the cost of Brexit was “cutting into people’s everyday lives”. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, said: “Being £900 worse off might not seem a lot to Tory cabinet ministers but for many people it pays for their family’s summer holiday.” Although Carney admitted it was difficult to say with certainty that Brexit was the sole reason for lower household incomes, he suggested the referendum outcome played a significant role. Previous analysis by economists has put the potential cost for each British household of voting to leave the EU at £600 a year. Consumers have come under significant financial pressure from rising inflation since the Brexit vote, as the immediate drop in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain. At the same time wage growth has remained weak despite the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-70s. But after a year of falling living standards, earnings finally began to rise above inflation in February, signalling the worst of the pressure on household finances could be coming to an end. Still, average pay remains below its pre-financial crisis peak once inflation is taken into account. Carney said investment spending by companies, which could drive up the productivity of firms and help to boost wages, had been weaker than expected since the Brexit vote. The strength of the world economy and availability of finance from the banking sector should have helped encourage companies to invest more, boosting the economy, he said. “Over the course of the last year and a half, there has been an impact [from Brexit] relative to what we would’ve expected – even with some pretty good tailwinds at the back of this economy,” he said. Despite the warnings over the short-term consequences of the vote for British households, Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, told MPs the likely long-run negative impact of Brexit would be “modest”. Pointing out that the economy did not weaken as much as the Bank forecast before the referendum, he said: “It is likely that that long-run narrative is probably still intact. Obviously that’s something we will learn more about over time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/25/linda-sarsour-israeli-intel-firm-spied-palestinian-american","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T06:38:07Z","webTitle":"Israeli intel firm spied on Palestinian-American Linda Sarsour, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/25/linda-sarsour-israeli-intel-firm-spied-palestinian-american","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/25/linda-sarsour-israeli-intel-firm-spied-palestinian-american","fields":{"headline":"Israeli intel firm spied on Palestinian-American Linda Sarsour, report says","bodyText":"An Israeli private intelligence firm spied on the Palestinian-American activist and Women’s March co-chair Linda Sarsour and her family in an apparent attempt to collect damaging information, according to a report by Haaretz. Israel Cyber Shield (ICS), supplied information to a rightwing pro-Israel group associated with American billionaire and Donald Trump backer Sheldon Adelson, the Israeli newspaper reported. Haaretz claimed ICS delivered the dossier to the Act.IL group, and the material was used to dissuade US colleges from allowing the activist, who supports a boycott of Israel, to speak on campus. Sarsour, who lives in Brooklyn, has been a frequent target of pro-Israel pressure organisations. She is a supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a Palestinian-led global effort to persuade companies, artists, governments and universities to boycott Israel over its occupation of the Palestinian territories, as well as other demands. Modelled on South African anti-apartheid campaigns, BDS is seen as a strategic threat by Israel’s government, and it has banned members of organisations it deems pro-BDS, including a Jewish anti-occupation non-profit, from entering the country. The blacklist has been condemned as an assault on free speech. Haaretz cited a student who it said volunteered for Act.IL and claimed the Sarsour dossier included a password-protected file containing information on her parents, as well as a court case in which she was involved. The dossier included allegations that Sarsour applauded violence toward Israeli soldiers and a tweet of hers that said, “Nothing is creepier than Zionism”. It concluded with “an executive summary that highlighted her apparent weak points”, the report said. Act.IL, which says its primary goal is to battle BDS and the “delegitimization of Israel”, used the information to prepare a letter that was distributed to the heads of universities where Sarsour had appeared, Haaretz said. After the article was published, a US-based pro-Israel thinktank, which says it “protects western values from Middle Eastern threats”, said it had compiled the document. In a statement, the Middle East Forum said it “publicly and openly tracked Linda Sarsour’s career since 2010” and created the dossier in December. One of the US’s most prominent activists, Sarsour is co-chair of the Women’s March movement and spoke at its main Washington rally after Trump’s inauguration. Haaretz said Act.IL’s CEO, Yarden Ben Yosef, confirmed that his group received materials from ICS but did not pay for it. The head of ICS and a former officer in Israel police’s international crime division, Eran Vasker, was quoted in the article as refusing to disclose if he had worked for Act.IL. “ICS operates lawfully, engaging in research and information on anti-Israeli activity, the delegitimisation movement and its activists – as reflected in their visible activity on social media. We do not engage in building files on activists or their families. It seems you must have confused us with other organisations,” he was quoted as saying. The Guardian has contacted Act.IL, ICS and Sarsour for a response."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/23/donald-glover-solo-a-star-wars-story-lando-calrissian-frasier-in-space","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T08:05:22Z","webTitle":"Donald Glover's 'Frasier in Space' sounds ace – but it'll never happen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/23/donald-glover-solo-a-star-wars-story-lando-calrissian-frasier-in-space","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/23/donald-glover-solo-a-star-wars-story-lando-calrissian-frasier-in-space","fields":{"headline":"Donald Glover's 'Frasier in Space' sounds ace – but it'll never happen","bodyText":"Solo: A Star Wars Story has endured more strife on its way to the screen than anybody would care to tally, but this last piece might be its biggest: people are more excited about a potential spinoff for Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian than they are about the film. Solo, manhandled and mish-mashed between directors, you can take or leave. But a standalone Lando Calrissian movie? Now that’s something worth getting excited over. Especially because Glover seems to know exactly where he’d take it. “It would be cool to see, like, Frasier in Space – like, a high-end guy in space,” the actor-rapper told Entertainment Weekly Radio. “All of these characters are very specific and they have very specific points of view, so it’s always going to be fun to see them traveling around to a planet that is the opposite of what they’re used to.” Already, that sounds far better than Solo. A big, weird shaggy dog story – completely unshackled from the rest of the Star Wars mythology – about a band of uptight pansexual hustlers fumbling their way through the dregs of the galaxy, with no heroic motivation and no great stakes, sounds like exactly what the Star Wars universe needs right now. Star Wars is already getting staid, with old ground being churned up so often that it’s beginning to lose all definition. An idea as decisively “other” as this Lando movie would open the franchise up in the same way that Guardians of the Galaxy has opened up the Marvel universe. Especially if it was also written by Donald Glover. His is a talent so monumental he could shepherd Star Wars away from the good v bad Skywalker dynasty and push it towards a more sustainable future. He wrote Atlanta, which is tremendous. Even the mock Deadpool script he wrote when FX yanked that project from him managed to be hilarious and incredibly sad. Imagine what he could do with a canvas as large as a tentpole Disney property. However, let’s be very clear: this will not happen. Never in a million years will Glover be able to bring his vision of Frasier in Space to fruition. You just have to see the wreckage of Solo to realise that. Disney is so profoundly jumpy about anyone tinkering with its cash cow that it obliterates all alternative thought on sight. Watching a Star Wars movie these days is like going to church: everything is dry and formal and unwaveringly drawn from scripture. You don’t go because you want to see anything new. You go because the repetition of going has become habit. For now, that’s what Star Wars wants. A Lord and Miller Han Solo movie might not have had the polish of Ron Howard’s version. It might have strayed from canon in a variety of difficult and messy ways. It might have been slightly too niche for an audience as crushingly mainstream as the Star Wars crowd. But it would have had a livewire energy that’s been absent from the series. That energy, however, might have been divisive, and divisiveness would be death for Star Wars. And that’s Solo, for crying out loud. That’s a down-the-line hero story. Imagine how much harder it’d be to get a film about a velvet-clad black space-pansexual across the line, let alone one based on a Kelsey Grammer sitcom. So Donald Glover might never get to make the Lando Calrissian film he wants to make. But if he’s smart, he’ll keep the idea, and three years from now we’ll all pack into cinemas to watch his copyright-independent Mando Blalrissian film. It sounds great."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/dear-diary-this-week-chickenpox-struck-our-house","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"Dear Diary: this week chickenpox struck our house | Nikesh Shukla","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/dear-diary-this-week-chickenpox-struck-our-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/dear-diary-this-week-chickenpox-struck-our-house","fields":{"headline":"Dear Diary: this week chickenpox struck our house","bodyText":"The pox descended on our house recently, throwing family life into turmoil. We battened down the hatches for five days. We stayed inside, waiting for the blisters to scar and life to return to normal. I kept a diary. Day 1: Denial I look at a spot on my eldest daughter’s back and one on her arm and another on her stomach. No, I think, that’s not the pox. Definitely not. That’s just some sort of allergic reaction. It’ll all be fine. I think about cancelling things the next day, just in case, but I’m convinced she’s had chickenpox before. It was mild. I happened to be away at the time, doing some work in America. She got through it. Done, we thought. All sorted. So I look at these spots, and think, nah, she’s OK. By 5.30pm she’s lying on the sofa complaining of aches and pains, her nose is streaming and one of those spots is now a fully functional blister. A trip to the pharmacist confirms that this is chickenpox. There’s no use denying it any more. Day 2: Anger I stay at home with her. Apparently, we have to stay inside for five days because we don’t know who we’re going to come into contact with. But she has to come with me to drop the youngest off at nursery. And we’ve run out of medicine. So she has to come with me to the shop. In the shop, I quickly skirt the aisles, avoiding everyone, I’m terrified. What if we’re patient zero for some sort of outbreak? What if she high-fives someone with a weak immune system? What am I going to do with five days inside our house? I’m going to lose it. We run into her uncle and his dog. The dog licks my daughter. I hope the dog doesn’t catch the pox. We return home. I look at our hallway. I get a call about some work I’ve forgotten to cancel. Everything feels stressful. Day 3: Bargaining The television is on so I can work. We manage a lacklustre game of hide and seek at her insistence. I get a phone call from a student who is interviewing me for their university magazine. “I need a poo,” my daughter shouts as she runs to the toilet. I hear the student laugh. Afterwards, as I clean up a delicious lunch my daughter can’t manage, I turn around to see she has made a bed for herself on the floor. She is asleep. I manage to get some work done. When she is awake, she has no energy. At all. She can only lie on the sofa and watch television. She manages to watch the same episode of Shipwrecked twice. Two of her blisters look infected. A friend suggests bathing her in bicarbonate of soda. There’s one blister by her mouth that is sore and has cream on it and old tomato soup and chocolate from the one bite of a croissant she managed. I’ve given up on work. In the middle of the night, I wake up to her crying. Going upstairs, I find her, confused, with a temperature, climbing into her Spider-Man tent, saying she’s going on a trip. I lead her back to bed. Day 4: Depression It’s the sunniest day of the year and we’re inside. She has more energy in the morning. A somersault off the sofa takes it out of her and she spends the rest of the morning sitting on a chair in the shade, cuddling her bear, letting the calamine lotion seep into its poor, beleaguered fur. I make an excuse to leave the house. A trip to buy some milk. Fresh air! People are in the streets, smiling, chatting, drinking. The smell of barbecue is thick in the air. I take a long time buying milk. We convince her to have a bath that night. I don’t dare broach the subject of a hairwash. We manage three books before bed and then she’s asleep within seconds. Day 5: Acceptance She is ready to go back to nursery. Her energy levels are up. She’s smiling, and spotty, but smiling, and off the sofa and the TV is off. It’s blissfully off. The first spots appear on our youngest that night. I start working out what work I need to manage, while standing outside my front door, gulping in the delicious fresh air of the outside world before another week of chaos."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/may/22/rohingya-militants-massacred-hindus-in-myanmar-says-amnesty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T16:57:47Z","webTitle":"Rohingya militants massacred Hindus in Myanmar, says Amnesty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/rohingya-militants-massacred-hindus-in-myanmar-says-amnesty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/22/rohingya-militants-massacred-hindus-in-myanmar-says-amnesty","fields":{"headline":"Rohingya militants massacred Hindus in Myanmar, says Amnesty","bodyText":"The Rohingya military group Arsa carried out deadly massacres and abductions of the Hindu community in Myanmar’s Rakhine state last year, a new report by Amnesty International has revealed. Testimony collected by Amnesty from dozens of witnesses and survivors of the attacks in Rakhine in August have detailed how up to 99 Hindu men, women and children were killed by Arsa militants armed with knives, swords and sticks. Only those who agreed to convert to Islam were spared. According to the report, on 25 August last year, Arsa militants, aided by some local Rohingya, descended on the village of Ah Nauk Kha Maung Seik, in the northern Maungdaw township in Rakhine. They rounded up all 69 Hindu men, women, and children, before executing 53 of them. Some who agreed to convert from Hinduism to Islam were freed. Raj Kumari, 18, who witnessed the attack, told Amnesty: “They slaughtered the men. We were told not to look at them. They had knives. They also had some spades and iron rods. We hid ourselves in the shrubs there and were able to see a little. My uncle, my father, my brother – they were all slaughtered.” Another witness, Formila, 20, told Amnesty that the Arsa fighters had taken the men away to kill them, then “came back with blood on their swords, and blood on their hands”. She said: “I saw men holding the heads and hair [of the women] and others were holding knives. And then they cut their throats.” The report also details other Arsa attacks on 26 August, on the outskirts of Maungdaw town, near Myo Thu Gyi village, where more Hindus and Buddhists were killed. Arsa – the Arakan Rohingya Salvation army – are a group of trained fighters estimated to be in their hundreds. It was formed in around 2012 in reaction to long-term systematic discrimination against the Rohingya community in Rakhine, but only came to prominence in October 2016 after a series of attacks on Myanmar’s security forces. The Amnesty report, which has been verified through hundreds of witness accounts, is likely to be controversial because it backs up the assertion by Myanmar’s military and government that their campaign of violence carried out in Rakhine last year was in response to Arsa’s actions. It was following attacks on the military that the security forces descended on northern Rakhine, attacking, killing and raping Rohingya people in their path. About 700,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh where they are now living in camps in Cox’s Bazar. Amnesty has described the actions of Myanmar’s security services as “crimes against humanity” and the UN has said they bear the “hallmarks of genocide”. Arsa’s actions have not yet drawn the same international denouncements and calls for accountability. Tirana Hassan, crisis response director at Amnesty International, said it was important to stress that justice was needed for those who suffered at the hands of the Myanmar military and Arsa. “Both must be condemned – human rights violations or abuses by one side never justify abuses or violations by the other,” Hassan said. “It’s hard to ignore the sheer brutality of Arsa’s actions, which have left an indelible impression on the survivors we’ve spoken to. Accountability for these atrocities is every bit as crucial as it is for the crimes against humanity carried out by Myanmar’s security forces in northern Rakhine state.” It has taken months for the full account to come out mainly because of lack of access to northern Rakhine state. The accounts by witnesses also reveal the level of fear that victims had about telling the truth, and that eight Hindu women who fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh were pressured by Arsa to make videos claiming the Myanmar military carried out the violence against them. Since the Rohingya were forced to flee from northern Rakhine, Arsa’s presence has mainly been online, though the group has been quiet on social media since January. It is not known whether it has plans to mobilise again. Laura Haigh, an Amnesty researcher who helped compile the report, said it had been “very difficult to get people to open up about Arsa, they are a very elusive group, and there is a fear among the community now in Bangladesh, with the informant killings last year, not to speak out and that there could be reprisals against those who do.” She added: “There is some concern among people that shedding light on the abuses means in some way that the actions of the military were justified, that it will undermine the need for accountability for the crimes against humanity, which it absolutely does not. This is just another aspect of what happened in August that needs to be investigated.” The Myanmar government did not respond to request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/23/boris-johnson-south-america-tour-political-pageantry-and-self-parody","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T16:45:54Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson's South America tour: political pageantry and self-parody","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/23/boris-johnson-south-america-tour-political-pageantry-and-self-parody","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/23/boris-johnson-south-america-tour-political-pageantry-and-self-parody","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson's South America tour: political pageantry and self-parody","bodyText":"Boris Johnson is standing on the balcony of a remote school on an island in the Peruvian Amazon, in the sweltering heat. With his rumpled shirt and trademark tousled hair, Britain’s top diplomat must cut an unlikely figure to the children and teachers crowded along the balconies and on the grass below. The foreign secretary, who landed by helicopter half an hour or so earlier with his Peruvian counterpart, Néstor Popolizio, is here to mark the fact that British taxpayers have made a series of donations to the school, including buying a lithium solar battery, which will help to power lighting and computers. “I’m so impressed by your school and the hard work that you’re all doing. And I’m pleased that we have been able to supply a British battery – which works!” he says, each line being painstakingly translated. “It comes from Wales.” “I hope you’ll go to Wales!” he adds, glancing across at the pack of lobby journalists travelling with him. It seems unlikely. Some of the children in the crowd hold up placards calling for proper toilets, and a new healthcare centre in their tiny settlement. A few armed police, equipped incongruously with riot shields, lope about in front of the crowd. But at every stop on this colourful tour, Johnson finds it hard to resist leavening his diplomatic duties with a quip, or an arch remark more directed to fans back home than his South American hosts. All of this is significant for a foreign secretary whose greatest political power back at home lies in the fact that he hasn’t resigned – and the threat that he might. Far away from Peru, his presence in Theresa May’s cabinet is a symbol of the trust the Leavers in her party still – just – have, in her ability to make Brexit happen, and in a way they can stomach. That trust has been severely tested of late; but as he jetted between three South American countries this week, Johnson didn’t seem like a man about to walk away. The question is: could he ever give it up? Later that day, asked to say a few words at a formal ceremony, where he and Popolizio have signed a series of memoranda of understanding between their respective governments, he begins: “I’ve done so much today. I’ve fed a manatee, who reminded me vaguely of one of my beloved colleagues in parliament – I won’t tell you who.” Later still, after a long, hot day, he can’t stop himself telling onlookers at a building site visit that, “personally speaking”, he could really do with a shower. It’s not quite “undiplomatic” behaviour – and in Buenos Aires, a wreath-laying ceremony for the victims of the Falklands conflict goes off without a hitch. His counterparts from all three stops on the trip respond to him with warmth. But watching at close hand, it feels like politics as performance – at times, almost as self-parody. Johnson has a tic of turning to aides or even to the assembled dignitaries and asking, “how about that?” or “will that do?” after a speech or a gag – like the journalist he once was checking in with the editor. And as he carefully parried questions from journalists in the plush surroundings of the British embassy residence in Buenos Aires, he stood up at one point and mimed batting them away, in the style of the prime minister’s childhood idol, Geoffrey Boycott. When the foreign secretary talks about the White House approach to constraining Iran’s nuclear ambitions, or the refugee crisis in the region sparked by the parlous state of the Venezuelan economy, he is lucid and convincing; but the streak of mischief is never far beneath the surface. He allows journalists to lead him into a conversation about whether a “Brexit plane” – to go with the commemorative stamps and a new Royal yacht he has already backed – would help Britain to do trade deals. “We have the Voyager [the government aircraft, on which the prime minister travels], do we need a plane?” he says. Most politicians would stop there; but Johnson muses on – “what I will say about the Voyager, I think it’s great, but it seems to be very difficult to get hold of. It never seems to be available. I don’t know who uses it, but it never seems to be available ... And also, why does it have to be grey?” His remarks duly ended up on the front page of the Daily Mirror under the headline “JUMBOJO JET”. His Labour shadow, Emily Thornberry, who has watched him throughout his time at the foreign office, says: “Personally, I’ve got no problem with Boris posing with monkeys and manatees, or dancing with kids. I think immersing yourself in the culture of the country you’re visiting is an essential part of being a foreign secretary. “My problem with Boris has never been the pictures, it’s always been the words.” Johnson’s grand tour follows a tough week back home, in which he and fellow Brexit hardliners found themselves unexpectedly outnumbered in May’s inner cabinet, and forced to sign up to a “backstop” deal for Northern Ireland that would keep the UK in key aspects of the customs union beyond 2020. Bit by bit, the prime minister appears to be proceeding one minor compromise at a time towards an end-result Johnson and the Vote Leave veterans will loathe – but without ever committing a single outrage that would quite justify them crying “betrayal”. Johnson’s political reputation – or legacy, for a man who thinks as he does in terms of the grand sweep of history – is inextricably bound to Brexit. Yet he’s less involved in the day-to-day detail than his Leave colleagues in cabinet, David Davis and Liam Fox – or even Michael Gove, busy devising what will replace EU farm subsidies and fishing quotas. Instead, at times he seems like a kind of roving dispenser of Brexit bombast. “It’s something people are really fired up about,” he says. In Argentina, he talks about the “booming” prospects for trade; Peru is “desperate to do more business with the UK”, he insists; Chile “desperately wants to integrate more closely with the UK”. But the political pageantry in South America was also meant to underscore a serious point about the kind of Brexit Johnson believes in. In each of the countries he arrives at, as he never tires of saying, he is the first foreign secretary to visit in more than two decades – 50 years, in the case of Peru. He believes that’s because Britain became too Eurocentric over the period it has been tied to the European Union, as policy coordination on trade, and increasingly foreign policy, constrained London’s room for manoeuvre. In Buenos Aires, he compares Brexit to Argentina’s “intelligent reinsertion” into the international community, after the isolationism of the Cristina Fernández de Kirchner years. To him it’s about rediscovering long-lost political alliances and exploring new markets – not turning inwards. That’s why leaving the customs union, including the external tariff the EU applies to imports, has become such a touchstone for the cabinet Brexiters – and Johnson’s zeal on this point was only confirmed by his Latin American adventures. Meanwhile back home, Brexit hardliners on the Tory backbenches, with the redoubtable Jacob Rees-Mogg as their figurehead, are losing patience with the string of Brexit compromises – and becoming increasingly vocal. If Johnson still harbours hopes of being prime minister – and nothing in his demeanour suggests he has given up – he will need their backing. So throughout the trip, he plays a kind of cheeky rhetorical game – impeccably delivering the government line; but each time putting the words into May’s mouth. “The prime minister is the custodian of the plan,” he said in Buenos Aires. “She’s got a very clear prospectus and a clear mandate and it’s all there in the Lancaster House and Mansion House speeches and various other excellent speeches.” It couldn’t possibly be read as outwardly disloyal; but it is also a reminder – a warning – and a nod to his constituency in the Tory party, as other, younger contenders – Gavin Williamson on the right flank, Ruth Davidson on the left – thrust themselves forward. He and the other cabinet Brexiters believe their “max-fac” answer to the question of Britain’s future customs arrangements is winning through over May’s “customs partnership” approach, which Johnson publicly denounced as “crazy” (and which Rees-Mogg suggested would mean Britain hadn’t left the EU). But it’s far from clear if they would walk out if they lost. For now, Johnson doesn’t seem like a man about to throw off the trappings of high office on a point of principle. And what trappings: the agreeable embassy residences, with their period furniture and their wine cellars; the motorcycle outriders; the whip-smart staff. Does he really trust May, the “custodian” of Brexit, to deliver? Does he believe in his heart that it will deliver the economic bounty and the political reboot he hoped for when he crossed the Thames to the Vote Leave headquarters two years ago? He’s such an adept performer that it’s all but impossible to say. Perhaps he doesn’t even know himself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/quiche-watercress-asparagus-soup-salad-frittata-recipe-rosie-birkett","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T15:00:28Z","webTitle":"More quick packed lunch ideas for busy people | Rosie Birkett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/quiche-watercress-asparagus-soup-salad-frittata-recipe-rosie-birkett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/quiche-watercress-asparagus-soup-salad-frittata-recipe-rosie-birkett","fields":{"headline":"Quick packed lunch recipes for busy people","bodyText":"Carrot, radish and almond salad (above) Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4.

Indiana’s 1966 pop masterpiece Love originally said Fuck. Even after he changed it to the more heartwarming and universally acceptable word – he would spend the rest of his life turning it into sculptures and even adapting it to Hope to support Barack Obama – there was a secret meaning to this artwork. Indiana’s original print uses three colours. The word Love, with the O falling on its side, is inscribed in fiery red capitals against planes of blue and green. Why blue and green? The answer is obvious when you know that Indiana was the lover of the abstract painter Ellsworth Kelly. Blue and green – this precise blue, this exact green – were Kelly’s most recognisable colours, beautifully combined in many of his most uplifting works. His 1963 painting Blue Green Red also has the third colour of Indiana’s print. Love was created as Indiana’s relationship with Kelly ended. So it is a sad love poem, perhaps even an angry one. Yet it instantly became a beacon of idealism, optimism, youth and revolt. In 1967, the Beatles performed All You Need Is Love in a live international TV broadcast and Jefferson Airplane asked: “Don’t you need somebody to love?” It was as if Indiana reached into the heart of the age and plucked out its perfect artistic encapsulation. It is not a dead word, by any means. “Love is power,” declaimed Bishop Michael Curry in an address at the royal wedding on Saturday that invoked the spirit of the 1960s as a loving radical force. Is he right? The undying fame of Indiana’s artwork is proof that love still has blazing energy as both political and private forces, the milk of human kindness. We don’t need to ask why Love is such a beloved work of art, any more than why Stand By Me is still being performed to crowned heads in a gothic chapel. Indiana was fascinated by the artistic properties of words. The glib description of pop artist doesn’t quite do him credit. He was part of a generation whose subtle experiments pointed not just to pop but also to conceptualism. Just as Jasper Johns painted flags and numbers, Indiana selected and isolated words such as Eat and Die. Theand there is stark word-images he created in the early 1960s are rooted in the Americana of neon signs and giant hoardings. Indiana also recognised that he was working in an older tradition of American art. In his 1963 painting The Figure Five, he pays homage to Charles Demuth’s 1928 painting I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold. Andy Warhol said pop artists made art about “all the great modern things”, and there is nothing more modern, or American, than streets full of words and numbers. Indiana was a serious artist of the word, whose paintings, prints and sculpture powerfully home in on the totemic quality of language. Yet his most effective work goes beyond concept into the realm of ecstasy. Love is a kind of spell. It is an enchanting word that spreads happiness and hope. There may be more revered, more respectable modern artists. But how many have hit the heart like Robert Indiana?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/may/29/advances-medical-science-nhs-save-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:28:26Z","webTitle":"Nine advances in medical science that help the NHS save lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/may/29/advances-medical-science-nhs-save-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2018/may/29/advances-medical-science-nhs-save-lives","fields":{"headline":"Nine advances in medical science that help the NHS save lives","bodyText":"Vaccines Within five years of the birth of the NHS, a mass vaccination programme was in place to immunise children against some of the most serious diseases of the day: tuberculosis, smallpox, diphtheria and whooping cough. In 1956, the polio vaccine was introduced, followed in 1968 by a vaccine for measles. The next big step forward was the introduction of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in 1988, and by the early 2000s, children were also receiving vaccines against different forms of meningitis. The HPV vaccine to protect girls against cervical cancer was introduced in 2008. Vaccination has been hugely successful, eradicating smallpox altogether and nearly eradicating polio and other diseases such as diphtheria; only a handful of such cases are now reported each year and they rarely prove fatal. Keyhole surgery Keyhole surgery, or laparoscopy, in which surgeons make small incisions through which they insert thin instruments and a tiny camera to see what they’re doing, has been widely used since the 1990s. An operation that would once have involved a large incision can now be carried out with minimum impact. Helgi Johannsson, a consultant anaesthetist at Imperial College Healthcare, describes keyhole surgery as “one of the greatest advances in surgery of recent times”, adding that it has “significantly reduced complication rates, pain, and the time in hospital. Operations that previously would have resulted in a long stay in hospital now [allow patients to] go home after a few hours, thanks to keyhole surgery and improvements in anaesthetic drugs and techniques.” Antibiotics The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 arguably represents the greatest medical advance in the 20th century, though a team of researchers at the University of Oxford carried out the critical steps that enabled the substance to be used to cure bacterial infections. Other antibiotics soon followed, and diseases that once killed millions of people, such as tuberculosis, could now be cured. The NHS now issues more than 30m prescriptions a year for antibiotics, but a new threat has emerged: 5,000-12,000 people die each year in the UK from antibiotic-resistant infections. Unless we alter prescribing patterns, warns Dr Hamira Ul-Haque, medical officer at Push Doctor, we could “potentially return modern medicine to the pre-antibiotic era of untreatable and fatal infections.” Medical imaging X-rays have been available since the 19th century, but the 1970s saw the advent of two other revolutionary technologies: the computed tomography (CT) scan, sometimes referred to as a Cat scan, and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Both can produce very clear images of the inside of the body, including internal organs, blood vessels and bones, making it possible to detect and diagnose diseases such as stokes and cancer, as well as joint damage or internal organ damage. The number of scans carried out by the NHS rises annually, however, it currently stands at 40m a year, a figure that includes X-rays and ultrasound as well as MRI and CT scans. Combined with a growing shortage of radiologists, this increased demand is adding to the pressure on the NHS. Organ transplants In 1954, just six years after the NHS was founded, surgeons Joseph Murray and J Hartwell Harrison in Boston, US, carried out the first successful organ transplant, taking a kidney from one donor and transferring it to his identical twin brother. Other organ transplants followed, including the first successful heart transplant in 1967, carried out by Dr Christiaan Barnard. The same year saw the first successful liver transplant. In 2016-17, the NHS carried out 4,139 organ transplants, the vast majority from donors who had died, though the figure includes 921 kidney transplants and 30 partial liver transplants from living donors. Many more lives could be saved, however, if more people joined the Organ Donor Register: about 7,000 people in the UK are waiting for an organ transplant at any one time. Safety culture in anaesthesia Sometimes the simplest of changes can make a huge difference. “There have been enormous strides forward in understanding how human behaviour causes error,” says Johannsson. He cites the introduction of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist in 2008, which has a series of checks to make before and after surgery, as having a major impact – research has shown that implementation of the checklist reduces complication resulting from surgery by one-third and deaths from surgery by half. Safety checks include confirming enough blood is on hand and medical staff introducing themselves, which is crucial to clear communication in an operating environment that contains health professionals of different specialisms and backgrounds. Pacemakers The cardiac pacemaker was invented in 1949 by a Canadian electrical engineer, John Hopps, who discovered that electrical stimulation could keep the heart beating in hypothermic dogs. Nine years later, Arne Larsson, a 43-year-old Swede, was suffering from cardiac arrhythmia, which had worsened as a result of a viral infection, and had a heartrate of only 28 beats a minute. Cardiologist Rune Elmqvist carried out the operation to insert the pacemaker, after which Larsson survived to the age of 86. Today, about 25,000 people in the UK have a pacemaker fitted each year. GP May Jay Ali has seen the impact on patients with a very slow heartrate: “They go into hospital and have a pacemaker and come out two days later – and that’s their life saved. It has been significant.” Antiretroviral therapy for HIV When Aids, caused by the HIV virus, took hold in the 1980s, there was no cure. The first case of Aids was diagnosed in the UK in 1981 and over the next few years Aids/HIV became an epidemic, killing almost 9,000 people before 1994. Development of a treatment using a combination of antiretroviral drugs in the late 1990s means that HIV can be managed: approximately 100,000 people are now living with the virus in the UK. “When I was a medical student in 1994 HIV was a death sentence,” Johannsson recalls. “The HIV wards were overflowing with incredibly sick patients and death was a daily occurrence. Two years later when I returned, the service had transformed, and death was rare. However, there is still a long way to go to eradicate HIV worldwide.” Understanding the human genome Since the human genome was mapped in 2003, it has helped scientists better understand diseases caused by mutations in a single gene inherited from parents, such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease. Doctors now hope that they will be able to treat inherited diseases through gene therapy, which involves either introducing “good” genes into targeted cells to treat a patient, or modifying the genes in egg or sperm cells. In other diseases, combined mutations in multiple genes can lead to a predisposition to certain illnesses, such as breast cancer. By understanding a patient’s genetic make-up, doctors will be able to predict the development of a disease and intervene early. There is still a long way to go, but genetics holds out a great deal of promise. Join the Healthcare Professionals Network to read more pieces like this.

That’s me done for the afternoon. Stay on the site for William Fotheringham’s report and analysis, on a day when that Simon Yates moved another step closer to a magnificent Giro d’Italia triumph. Thanks for your company and emails. Bye. Here’s our race report: Simon Yates speaks: “I’m really happy [with the gap on the chasing pack],” he tells Eurosport. “In the first half I had a good rhythm, I wasn’t losing so much time and really trying to hold my position. The final 10k I really died a thousand deaths and thought I’d lose a lot more time, but I didn’t. It really changes my tactics for the coming days. Unfortuantely for fans I can be a lot more defensive, as I have a bigger gap to the guys behind me now. It’s a good gap and I’ll see what I can do.” Dennis takes to the podium after a stunning stage win – his fourth on grand tours – that has propelled him five places up the overall standings. So Yates has survived a major examination to put the title within reach. Some tough mountain stages remain but the British rider has risen to every challenge put before him these last couple of weeks, though not all of our readers are convinced: 1 Yates (66hrs 39:14) 2 Dumoulin (+0:56) 3 Pozzovivo (+3:11) 4 Froome (+3:50) 5 Pinot (+4:19) 6 Dennis (+5:04) 7 Moreno (+5:37) 8 Armentia (+6:02) 9 Carapaz (+6:07) 10 Bennett (+7:01) Stage 16 result: 1 Rohan Dennis 40:00; 2 Tony Martin (+14sec); 3 Tom Dumoulin (+22 secs) 4 Van Emden (27) 5 Froome (+35 secs) Yates has done what he has to, revealing his temperament and nerve, and rides into Rovereto to finish in 41:37, holding on to the Pink Jersey by 56 seconds. The overall title is within reach. Dumoulin crosses the line in 40:22, third in the stage! A strong display by the Dutchman by the Dutchman, but it’s almost certainly not enough for pink. But Dumoulin’s on the charge coming up to the finish … It doesn’t look as if Dumoulin’s going to rein in Dennis today … the home hope Pozzovivo ends his underwhelming afternoon crossing the line in 30th place Pinot’s dismal run ends with him crossing the line in 43:19, 61st today, three minutes and 19 seconds off the lead, and his Giro chances are in tatters. Yates almost misjudges at a sharp corner, going perilously close to the kerb – a tricky moment, but he’s a minute and seven down at the second split, and holding his own, 48 seconds behind Dumoulin at that point. Meanwhile, Carapaz of Ecuador is another leading rider who’s had a poor afternoon, crossing the line at +2.57. The flags, roadside interlopers and fancy-dress “banter” merchants are out in force to cheer Dumoulin along his way, but he’s only third in 29:56 at the second split. Yates is looking good though, and shouldn’t be yielding too much ground to his challenger. Froome has put a real wriggle on in the final part of his run, and crosses the line in 40:35 to move into fourth place on today’s stage. That was one of his best recent performances. The sluggish Pinot, meanwhile, is in 65th place at the second split. He could be out of the top five today Yates records a time of 16:05 at the first split, in 16th place at that stage, 38 seconds down on the lead, which should keep him on course for staying in pink tonight. Work to do yet though. Froome is seventh at the second split, in 30:08, 31 seconds down. So he’s got some work to do in the latter stages. Dumoulin, meanwhile, is only fourth at the first split, 17 seconds off the lead. Pinot and Pozzovivo are both struggling. Rohan Dennis takes the stage lead! The Australian, heads down, sprints for the line out on the edge of the road, and overhauls Martin in 40 minutes exactly. Brilliant stuff. And a gauntlet laid down for Dumoulin. Thibaut Pinot, fourth overall this morning, is having a bit of a shocker, 49th at the first split. This could be ominous for his overall Giro prospects. Dumoulin looks as confident and sprightly as you’d expect, but he needs two minutes 11 on Yates today to take the overall lead, which on today’s overall evidence looks unlikely. Yates is perched right on the tip of his saddle, not looking enormously physically comfortable, but today’s all about hanging in there for him. Dennis is still storming ahead further towards the finish. Yates is off! Meanwhile Rohan Dennis reaches the second split in 29:37, a whole SIX seconds ahead of Martin. The Australian BMC Racing rider is looking mightily impressive. This is where they stand at the moment in today’s time trial: 1. Tony Martin (Katusha-Alpecin), 40:14 2. Jos Van Emden (LottoNL-Jumbo) + 13s 3. Fabio Aru (UAE Team Emirates) + 23s Dumoulin is off! To great roars from the assembled. In front of him, Froome is sixth at the first split, 24 seconds down. Simon Yates is at the start line, towel on head, going through his exercises, as Domenico Pozzovivo sets off. Only the big two to start now. The conditions look to have become more benign again now, which could be bad news for Tony Martin. Fabio Aru meanwhile is driving, straining for the finish line, crossing the line in 40:37 to take third place. That was an excellent ride, and pushes Dowsett down to fourth. But will Dennis maintain his pace and overhaul the lot of them. He’s riding pretty smoothly at the moment. Back in Trento, Pinot and Lopez have set off. A challenge! Rohan Dennis records the fastest time of the day at the first split (12.7km) in 15:40, 12 seconds ahead of Van Emden, the previous fastest through that phase. Tony Martin still has the clubhouse lead. Froome is off and running, appearing to be heartily cheered by the considerable crowds thronging the streets of Trento, not a reception he gets everywhere. Aru is still fighting, fourth at the second split, as Chris Froome readies himself on the start line. Another Italian, Diego Ulissi, just fails to dislodge Dowsett from third place by a fraction of a second, but that was a fine run. Jose Goncalves has faded after a bright start, 12th at the second split. We’re at the business end now, Rohan Dennis, Patrick Konrad having now set off. Martin is still ahead on this stage. Will he be overhauled by the front-runners in what could be trickier conditions? Fabio Aru, who’s had a tough Giro, is looking rather sprightlier today, third quickest through the first time-split, and Jose Goncalves is looking good too, though Martin picked up his pace in the later stages. Look out for Diego Ulissi too, third at the second split. There’s some rain out there now towards the end of the course, it should be reported, which could add to the intrigue and drama later on and give an advantage to those who’ve already finished. Talking of which, a prediction: “I’m going with Froome,” roars Andrew Benton. “I think he’ll blast a few minutes off the leaders and get right back into contention. It’s only him and the clock today.” Chad Haga, Dumoulin’s domestique, finishes strongly to record a time of 40:47 to move into fourth place today, immediately behind Dowsett, with Martin leading and Van Emden second. David de La Cruz is also going well as he approaches the finish. Just another word on some of the earlier action – Ryan Mullen of Ireland looked to be in contention until he appeared to cramp up in the later stages, crossing the line in 41:09. “Can you recommend staying in the sunny park and suffering not knowing how Yates will go other than through sporadic updates or suffering by going inside and watching it?” asks Philip Smisson. “The park is very nice and sunny.” Sounds like you’ve convinced yourself there Philip, unless you’re a hay fever sufferer. No major movements at the top end of today’s leaderboard for a while – Jacques Janse van Rensburg and Davide Ballerini have been ambling along almost beside each other as if out for a leisurely Sunday afternoon ride – so Martin still 13 seconds out in front. A reminder that the top 10 will be setting off from 3pm BST, with Dumoulin going at 3.27pm BST and Yates three minutes later. “Afternoon Tom.” Afternoon Phil Laing, who brings back memories of my teenage paper round by describing himself as “slowly cycling somewhere near Chingford”. “Alex Dowsett, as an Essex lad, appears on my Strava feed a lot, often riding up hills at twice my speed, on rides that are twice as long as mine, that he’s labelled ‘nice to have a gentle spin now and then.’ Disheartening isn’t the half of it.” Martin is not to be denied, storming home in 40:14 to lead by 13 seconds – the German hasn’t won a time trial since last June, and he’s never won a stage at the Giro, but he rolled back the years there. The Dutch rider Van Emden, a fine time-trialler, nabs the lead from Dowsett powering to the line to finish in 40:27. But how long will that last with Martin on the charge? Dowsett is second, and Vasil Kiryienka third. Anyway, leader in the early runnings today is the British rider Alex Dowsett, who has just stormed into the lead with an impressive time of 40:40, a whopping 24 seconds faster than today’s previous fastest, Mads Pedersen. But Jos Van Emden, less than 6km from the finish, is going to challenge that lead hard. As is Tony Martin, who at the 25.6km marker is the fastest so far Afternoon everyone. Sometimes things are simple. And today’s action boils down to one rider against another. One leading, one chasing. One a young-ish outsider, the other a defending champion on familiar ground. Thus is today’s stage set between Simon Yates and Tom Dumoulin. Yates’s sensational performance in winning Sunday’s stage has somewhat upset calculations that Dumoulin’s time-trialling superiority can today wrench him the Pink Jersey, and the British Mitchelton-Scott rider has some time in hand now. Of course, Yates isn’t much of a time-trialler – it’s somewhat refreshing to hear a top-level sportsman utter the phrase “I’m not very good anyway” – whereas Dumoulin, world individual time trial champion and winner of the opening time trial in the Giro this year, most certainly is. It’ll make for a fascinating conclusion to today’s stage. Elsewhere, Chris Froome is fighting for a place on the podium but he could have his work cut out against the in-form climbers Domenico Pozzovivo and Thibaut Pinot. Today’s stage, a 34.2km schlepp from Trento, south to Roveroto, is largely flat though, despite its Alpine location. Dumoulin’s dominance today is almost a given but the extent of that dominance will be pivotal. Yates, as the leader, will go last at 3.30pm BST, with Dumoulin off at 3.27pm. Froome goes at 3.12pm, Pinot at 3.21 and Pozzovivo at 3.24pm. We’ll be coming to you live very soon but here’s how they stood in the general classification at the start of the day: Simon Yates - 65h 57’ 37” Tom Dumoulin - 2’ 11” Domenico Pozzovivo - 2’ 28” Tibaut Pinot - 2’ 37” Miguel Angel Lopez Moreno - 4’ 27” Richard Carapaz - 4’ 47” Chris Froome - 4’ 52” Tom will be here shortly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/22/junior-doctors-recall-harrowing-aftermath-manchester-arena-bombing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T12:08:33Z","webTitle":"Junior doctors recall harrowing aftermath of Manchester bombing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/22/junior-doctors-recall-harrowing-aftermath-manchester-arena-bombing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/22/junior-doctors-recall-harrowing-aftermath-manchester-arena-bombing","fields":{"headline":"Junior doctors recall harrowing aftermath of Manchester bombing","bodyText":"A group of junior doctors who were among the first medics on the scene at the Manchester Arena bombing a year ago have said they think about the victims they treated that night every day. Vicky Wijeratne, David Dolan and Matthew Burrows all attended the Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on the evening of 22 May 2017. As they were waiting to leave the building, they heard a bang as Salman Abedi detonated an improvised bomb at 10.31pm. They had not been worried until they began to see people with injuries. “We asked one officer if there was anything we could do and I remember her exact words,” said Burrows, 25. “She said: ‘I need to tell you that there has been an explosion and there have been fatalities and if you go back in it’s at your own risk. We have not secured the area.’” The three doctors, who are in their second and third years of training, were led by the officer to a makeshift treatment area where injured people were being taken and they stayed there helping until about 3.30am. The group recalled how the injured were carried on stretchers fashioned from pieces of carpet and tarpaulin banners. A merchandise seller brought them T-shirts to use as bandages. The doctors mainly treated people for fractures and shrapnel injuries, working to stem bleeding. “I remember thinking: how can there be so many different injuries? What exactly has happened?” said Burrows. “We’ve been talking recently about the people who were hurt in the attack and how we don’t have any contact with those people,” he said. “We’ve not seen any of them since and I don’t know whether they would remember us, but we wanted to use this interview as an indirect way of contacting them and saying: we still think of you every single day.” The three junior doctors scoured the papers following the bombing to try to find out what had happened to those they treated. “There was a period immediately afterwards where the number [of deaths] was going up and you kept on thinking about the people you saw who were really poorly,” said Wijeratne, 26. In March, a report by Bob Kerslake into the emergency response to the attack found that the fire service played “no meaningful role” as firefighters were prevented from attending the arena over concerns the attack was ongoing. “There are clearly things to be learned [from the response to the attack] and there was clearly an access issue, but it was a new situation that people hadn’t had to deal with before,” said Wijeratne. “At a bigger organisational level it didn’t necessarily work as well as it could have done, but the other side of it is that on an individual level people did well above anything you could have expected.” The trio paid tribute to the arena staff and stewards, the first aid professionals staffing the concert, and bystanders, all of whom worked tirelessly throughout the night to help people. The doctors said they had a greater appreciation for the police after the attack. “They were doing anything they could [to help treat people] and asking us to tell them what to do,” said Wijeratne. “I remember one officer who said he was in his first week,” said Burrows. The doctors spoke of finding themselves in a position for the first time where they could not turn to a more senior colleague for advice. “It was hard because in a hospital environment you can always ask someone for help,” said Dolan, 26. “But in this situation you would get to a certain point and then just think: I don’t know what else I can do now.” They said it did not feel like a whole year had passed. Instead of attending one of the official events to mark the anniversary on Tuesday, the group are going out for a quiet dinner. Burrows is from Manchester, and Wijeratne and Dolan have lived there for about eight years. They agree the bombing has sharpened the city’s sense of identity. “It definitely brought the city together,” said Dolan. “It wasn’t like I didn’t love Manchester before, but the response has made me love it even more.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/22/diet-prada-the-instagram-account-that-airs-the-fashion-industrys-dirty-laundry","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T16:00:00Z","webTitle":"Diet Prada: the Instagram account that airs the fashion industry’s dirty laundry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/22/diet-prada-the-instagram-account-that-airs-the-fashion-industrys-dirty-laundry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/22/diet-prada-the-instagram-account-that-airs-the-fashion-industrys-dirty-laundry","fields":{"headline":"Diet Prada: the Instagram account that airs the fashion industry’s dirty laundry","bodyText":"When future historians identify the definitive fashion moments of 2018, they will surely alight on the meteoric rise of Diet Prada. With 489,000 followers – including power players such as Naomi Campbell, Edward Enninful and Gigi Hadid – the Instagram account is on a mission to expose copycat design. Its popularity says more about fashion’s mood than any shoe, silhouette or hemline. Diet Prada’s methods are simple. Photographs of new designs are juxtaposed with images of older, all-too-similar work. Followers are invited to “tsk tsk” along in the comments. Embarrassment ensues. Sometimes, designers issue clarifications, as Kim Kardashian did when Diet Prada said that her childrenswear line looked like Vetements and Comme des Garçons. (Kardashian said the designs were homages, not copies.) On other occasions, products are pulled. The account calls out other failings, too: cultural appropriation, lack of model diversity, toleration of abuse. In the fashion industry – which is run on a sort of weaponised niceness, all bouquets of flowers and handwritten thank-you notes – dirty laundry has never been a good look. Until recently, such candour was unheard of. Diet Prada was run anonymously until the names of its founders – Tony Liu and Lindsey Schuyler – starting appearing on fashion blogs earlier this year. They confirmed their identities in an interview a fortnight ago. Both are freelance designers and product developers, part of the usually silent majority working at labels you may not even have heard of. The account began for fun, as an archive of conversations they were having anyway. Now, Diet Prada has legions of fans with their own collective noun: “dieters”. Those who provide the best tipoffs are “star dieters”. Some of these devils wear Diet Prada. Because, as has become customary for an internet sensation, there is merch. Most covetable are the hoodies celebrating their highest-profile scalp, Kardashian, emblazoned with the logo: “Kim des Garçons”. Diet Prada’s popularity is related to the “call-out” culture of the internet, but it also represents a shift in attitudes where shopping is concerned. “I think we are in a time when everyone is really questioning the choices that they make and there is this move towards more consciousness as consumers,” says Liu. Copycatting is far from a victimless crime, says Schuyler, “especially for small designers. It can wreck their businesses.” The most satisfying element of Diet Prada, adds Liu, is “helping out small companies that don’t have financial resources to litigate”. Bigger companies have such marketing power that, if they rip off a design, most consumers never become aware of the original, he says. “If they do come across it, they may think: ‘Who is this making a more expensive version of this piece?’” This winner-takes-all model of global design may explain a lot about the way we all dress. It is often said that fashion has not created a definitive silhouette in the past 20 or 30 years, particularly when compared with shifts in style between the 40s and the 70s. Global brands ripping off and watering down designs before their makers have the chance to establish themselves is surely the ultimate impediment to creativity. Diet Prada is not alone in its quest to shame copycats. The same tools it uses – advances in image search technology, comprehensive archives of catwalk shows, the unprecedented speed of internet communication – fuel viral outrage over knockoffs, offensive T-shirt slogans and cultural appropriation in fashion. In March, a Vogue journalist criticised Vivienne Westwood for ripping off young British designers Rottingdean Bazaar and Louise Gray. (The label has since apologised for failing to ask for permission for what it described as a celebration of the original work.) Last summer, Gucci was accused of copying 80s bootlegger Dapper Dan, a charge that came directly from the Instagram account of Olympic runner Diane Dixon, who wore the original outfit in 1989. (Gucci described the work as a homage. In a fashion-is-eating-itself development that has become its own microtrend, Gucci and Dapper Dan have since become collaborators.) According to Liu and Schuyler, fear of public shame could change fashion for the better. Many designers, they say, are so frightened of being caught out that they are completely rethinking their approach. Consumers have a responsibility, too, says Liu. He urges shoppers to eschew cheaply constructed knockoffs in favour of vintage, garments tailored to their own specifications or “pieces that will last longer in terms of style”, even when they are inexpensive. “Even taking the time to learn what makes a quality garment can help people make better choices and put less stuff in the landfill,” says Schuyler. Despite the Robin Hood element to its work, Diet Prada has been accused of using its voice unfairly. One of its most powerful detractors, Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s Stefano Gabbana, has clashed with them so often – and so vehemently – that Liu and Schuyler claim he is the hand behind an anonymous Instagram account – Diet Ignorant – devoted to calling out Diet Prada. (Dolce &amp; Gabbana declined to comment.) In another awkward exchange, Diet Prada faced the ire of many well-known British fashion-industry names when it accused London-based designer Richard Quinn of making Balenciaga references. (The fashion insiders defended Quinn, arguing that he had explored the aesthetic to which they referred before Balenciaga; Liu and Schuyler say they “stand by” the post.) Clearly, the fact that a pair of unknowns can rile established names is testimony to the power of the internet. Their emergence also feels like part of a gradual, generational shift: Liu is 32; Schuyler is 30. Their attitudes are at odds with the self-censorship so often adopted by the tribal elders of the industry. They say, for example, that they feel no guilt when they call out designers (“If people think we are ruining the fashion industry then they need to come up with their own ideas,” says Liu), nor do they worry about their future careers (“If someone won’t hire me because they see that I stood up for workers’ rights then that’s their problem,” says Schuyler). Still, the moment that Diet Prada blew its cover, impartiality became more difficult. Why not remain anonymous? Liu says that they needed to “control the narrative” around the reveal and that it came at a point “when we had earned our place in the industry”. Also, he says “there are business opportunities that would only work out if we were in the open. There are things we are working on that may be up our alley and we wouldn’t have to compromise what we do – we are very conscious of that.” Earning money as Diet Prada has already proved challenging. In February, Liu and Schuyler were accused of losing their teeth after attending fashion shows and being paid to take over Gucci’s Instagram Stories. Although the pair insist they remained unbiased – they posted a criticism of Gucci’s use of turbans at the show they attended – they agree that future work will have to be managed very carefully. The plan, says Schuyler, is to “continue to build this community that has come together to support transparency and make it a constructive force”. Brands are interested in Diet Prada, she says, “because I think we are becoming known for having a voice of authenticity. But that’s also why it’s very hard to align with any brand. Because who is 100% authentic?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/22/arsenal-unai-emery-ian-wright-new-manager","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T08:00:49Z","webTitle":"Wind of change at Arsenal blows in another left-field appointment | Amy Lawrence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/22/arsenal-unai-emery-ian-wright-new-manager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/22/arsenal-unai-emery-ian-wright-new-manager","fields":{"headline":"Wind of change at Arsenal blows in another left-field appointment","bodyText":"Well, that took a very sudden left turn. In keeping with the Arsenal tradition of appointing unexpected managers, it seems the board have lurched from favouring a 36-year-old former player who had never managed a game to a totally new face in the frame which provoked a stunned Ian Wright to query: “Where’s Unai Emery come from?” As a reaction it is not quite in the realms of Arsène Who? but it captures the mood of curious bewilderment. A quick flick through the club’s history books demonstrates that unexpected does not always mean bad. In the 1930s George Allison moved from the boardroom to the dugout and won the league. Bertie Mee had been the club’s physiotherapist and engineered the double win in 1971. George Graham came from Millwall in English football’s second tier and collected a cluster of trophies between 1987 and 1994. Arsène Wenger famously arrived from Nagoya Grampus 8 in Japan and, according to the sceptical players, looked more like a geography teacher than a football manager. The surprise here is that all the signs were that Arsenal were looking elsewhere. Emery’s background is hardly so arcane to make this truly shocking. He brings his own brand of clout and experience. Repeated third placed finishes at Valencia, making his teams the best of the rest behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, were eye-catching. A hat-trick of Europa League victories with Sevilla enhanced his status enough for Paris Saint-Germain to give him that chance to try to take the team towards their holy Champions League grail. It didn’t quite work out on that front but the current scene at Arsenal, and what is needed, has more of a nod towards the calibre of work Emery did in Spain. In the post-Wenger world the next appointment was always going to feel pivotal. Loaded. For the triumvirate put together by the chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, to make the key footballing decisions, this process has been a test for a new team behind the team. Gazidis has been working with Raúl Sanllehí (head of football relations) and Sven Mislintat (head of recruitment) for only a few months and they have knocked their heads together and come up with Emery. He is another football obsessive, a man who references “emotion” and “responsibility” when he thinks about his role – only this one has a different character to his predecessor. Arsenal’s players will return to London Colney for the new season to find an environment with cranked-up demands and expectations. Emery’s nature is to be meticulous, tactically smart, with a disciplinarian streak. He is minded to push his players. After a long time listening to the same manager, Arsenal’s squad will soon learn that there is no room for any complacency, for allowing themselves to go through any motions. They can also expect to be drilled into a more intense and resilient style. The force of an attitude shock, exactly what they need, will be felt. “Either we all work or let’s just burst the ball,” he says. That philosophy is a bit more George Graham than Arsène Wenger but given the requirement to shake up the comfort zone, to instil some defensive organisation, at this moment in time it’s no bad thing. Having been around several blocks (Arsenal would represent a seventh job in a fourth different country) Emery offers that weight of experience Mikel Arteta didn’t have. But his career has not pointed to long-term spells, with four seasons at Valencia his longest run in any one club, so that’s another change of pace Arsenal will have to get used to. It is all about building new relationships now, as quickly as possible. As well as getting to know his new players, Emery also has to develop some mutual trust with Gazidis, Sanllehí and Mislintat. There is adjustment to be done on the squad, even with the relatively limited funds available for a club hoping to compete with other teams vying for a Champions League finish. The process of deciding who to target, and who is expendable, is on the agenda during this shortened World Cup summer window. Best get to work, rather than bursting the ball."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/22/bob-corker-turns-down-offer-from-trump-to-be-us-ambassador-to-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T00:20:26Z","webTitle":"Bob Corker turns down offer from Trump to be US ambassador to Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/22/bob-corker-turns-down-offer-from-trump-to-be-us-ambassador-to-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/22/bob-corker-turns-down-offer-from-trump-to-be-us-ambassador-to-australia","fields":{"headline":"Bob Corker turns down offer from Trump to be US ambassador to Australia","bodyText":"Senator Bob Corker has turned down an offer from President Donald Trump to be the US ambassador to Australia. The Guardian has confirmed that Corker, the retiring chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, rejected an approach to serve in the position. In an interview with the Tennessean, Corker said he had spoken to both Trump and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, about the position over the past three weeks. But he had decided against accepting the position, saying: “At the end of the day though … it just felt like it wasn’t the right step.” Corker has had a tumultuous relationship with Trump. The two-term Republican was an early Trump endorser and had been a candidate to be both vice-president and secretary of state. But he has become a vocal Trump critic at times, saying the White House had “become an adult day care center” and told the New York Times that Trump could put the US on “the path to world war III”. Trump called Corker “Liddle Bob” on Twitter in response. The news that Corker was being considered for the position was first reported by the Australian Financial Review, which also floated another retiring senator, Orrin Hatch of Utah, for the position. But in a statement to the Guardian,Hatch’s deputy chief of staff, Matt Whitlock, said: “Senator Hatch has not had any conversations about an ambassadorship but looks forward to a well-deserved retirement filled with early-bird specials at all-you-can-eat buffets and long walks through Costco.” Trump had previously nominated Admiral Harry Harris, the commander of the US Pacific command, for the post in February. But in April, he withdrew Harris’s nomination and selected him to be the US ambassador to South Korea instead. The US has not had an ambassador in Canberra since September 2016 and has been represented by James Caruso, the embassy’s chargé d’affaires, since then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/24/us-customs-money-seize-texas-nurse-anthonia-nwaorie-lawsuit","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T08:00:47Z","webTitle":"Nurse who saved for Africa clinic left in limbo after US Customs seized $41,377","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/24/us-customs-money-seize-texas-nurse-anthonia-nwaorie-lawsuit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/24/us-customs-money-seize-texas-nurse-anthonia-nwaorie-lawsuit","fields":{"headline":"Nurse who saved for Africa clinic left in limbo after US Customs seized $41,377","bodyText":"Anthonia Nwaorie was only a few metres from boarding a plane when customs agents stopped her and started asking questions. How many people are you carrying money for? How long have you been in the United States? How many people are travelling with you? “I said, ‘I’m travelling alone’,” she recalled. “Whatever money that I have is my money.” Nwaorie soon discovered that the reality was not so simple. The 59-year-old nurse was travelling to Nigeria via Frankfurt, bringing medical supplies and $41,377 in cash – most of which she had saved up for years herself. She was planning to start a medical clinic for women and children in a village in Imo state, where she grew up before moving to the US in 1982 and becoming an American citizen 12 years later. Nwaorie knew that travellers entering the US have to declare currency over $10,000. But she was completely unaware, she said, that the requirement also exists for anyone exiting the country. On the basis that Nwaorie failed to declare the money on that October afternoon, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized it. When the US attorney’s office declined to charge her with a crime or try to keep her savings by initiating civil forfeiture proceedings, CBP wrote to Anthonia in April. “It is our decision to remit the currency seizure in full” within 8-10 weeks, the letter said. Just one thing: she needed to sign a “hold harmless agreement” in which she would agree never to pursue any kind of legal action against the government over the seizure, and to reimburse the US for “any necessary expenses, attorney’s fees, or costs incurred in the enforcement of any part of this agreement”. Nwaorie did not sign. More than six months later , she still does not have her money back. And now she is the named plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit taking aim at CBP’s practice of demanding that people whose property was seized by the government have to waive rights in order to get it back. Asset forfeiture has long attracted scrutiny in cases when local law enforcers seize and keep the property of people who in many instances are never charged with a crime, often using it in a questionable manner, such as one example in a Texas county where proceeds were used to pay for a margarita machine at a barbecue cook-off. It is also a considerable source of revenue for the federal government and a practice backed by leading figures in the current administration. “I love that programme,” the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said in a speech last year. “We had so much fun doing that, taking drug dealers’ money and passing it out to people trying to put drug dealers in jail. What’s wrong with that?” In 1986 the Department of Justice’s asset forfeiture fund took in $93.7m, according to figures obtained by the Institute for Justice, a not-for-profit law firm that is fighting Nwaorie’s case. By 2014, the figure was $4.5bn, inspiring a memorable headline in a 2015 Washington Post article: “Law enforcement took more stuff from people than burglars did last year.” “Anthonia’s case really demonstrates how abusive civil forfeiture is,” said one of her lawyers, Anya Bidwell, “because she’s an outstanding individual, she’s a US citizen, she wants to do good in the world and if she’s not safe from civil forfeiture then nobody is safe from civil forfeiture. “We want to make sure that it doesn’t happen to people ever again, that these kind of hold harmless agreements are declared unconstitutional,” she added. CBP declined to comment on the case, citing pending litigation. Nwaorie said she tried to board her flight at Houston’s George Bush intercontinental airport at about 4.15pm, but was held until 10.30pm. “By the time it was finished I was having the worst migraine I’ve ever had in my life,” she said in an interview at her home in the Houston suburb of Katy. “Oh, God, they surely made me very angry.” Bidwell said that more plaintiffs are likely to be added to the suit and hopes that through the discovery process the government, which has until 9 July to provide a response, will reveal more data about the sums and number of people affected by asset forfeiture at the border. Nwaorie eventually made it to Nigeria a few weeks later and operated a week-long free clinic, as she has in previous years. But, the lawsuit alleges, on her return she was singled out for additional luggage screening in which a CBP officer ruined her purse by slitting open the lining and she was told that because of the previous seizure, CBP will “follow her wherever she goes” when she travels abroad. Still, Nwaorie intends to return to Imo this year and pursue her ambition of setting up a facility that could help thousands of people in need of basic medical care. She hopes her ordeal will raise awareness and force the government to change its practices. “Nobody needs to be treated that way I was treated, nobody deserves that,” she said. “It’s unreal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/26/american-liberals-politics-left-messaging","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T10:00:53Z","webTitle":"The problem with Democrats is substance, not style | Samuel Moyn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/26/american-liberals-politics-left-messaging","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/26/american-liberals-politics-left-messaging","fields":{"headline":"The problem with Democrats is substance, not style","bodyText":"American liberals continue to play out the five stages of grief in response to Donald Trump’s win. Rubbing their eyes the morning after, they were in denial, as Hillary Clinton waited to concede. Once reality began to set in they responded in anger. Now they appear to be in bargaining mode, trying to figure out just how little they might need to evolve – not merely to keep Trump in his box, but also to keep him from winning again. If the pattern continues to hold, depression will soon follow when American liberals reckon with just how intractable the opposition is across the country. And acceptance, finally, might someday allow for more productive moves, to reinvent themselves beyond their loss. “Why not secede from the union?” a colleague asked at one funereal Massachusetts gathering I attended, days after the election. Some Californians have proposed “Calexit”; in a liberal daydream, blue states could become social justice utopias were they to sever their ties to their God-fearing and gun-toting fellow citizens in the red ones. It was a classic attempt to pivot from denial and rage to seeking some way to soften the blow. Born in St Louis, Missouri, where I lived half my life, I pointed out that stranding such social justice on the coasts hardly seems, well, just. Not least when much of the revolt against American liberal elites currently under way is traceable to coastal policies, and many of thecountry’s most intractable problems, like de facto segregation in schooling or racialized mass incarceration, cut across all sections of the country. The most regular version of bargaining, however, has been changing the liberal brand, with a focus on messaging and optics. If too many Americans in “flyover country” will not support liberalism, this half-measure says, the problem must be a failure to sell them our candidates, if not our values. By this account, our values need not change, provided the rhetoric of politics convinces voters to punch the ballot for the Democratic party rather than the Republican one. In the most notorious example, Mark Lilla likened trawling for voters to a fishing trip, and indicted “identity politics” as a misbegotten bait for the electoral hook. Liberals, he charged, currently yell at fellow citizens for discriminating against African Americans, gay people, and women, as if an angler at the pond could scold fish into his net. For Lilla, the remedy is to fool them more craftily by deploying a new rhetoric of American nationalism. Waving the American flag is the gist of Lilla’s approach for liberalism, as if a politics of symbolism that presents the country as unified would cover over its actual fissures. In a similar vein, the politics professor Gerard Alexander recently opined in the New York Times that liberals continue to come off as judgmental scolds, and as a result have been “more effective at causing resentment than in getting people to come their way”. Alienating the very people with whom they need to connect – or at least attract, if liberals are going to win the next presidential election – is a colossal error. Were elites to wield their “cultural prominence” less obtrusively and offensively, this tactician recommends, victory would come to them. “Even if liberals think their opponents are backward, they don’t have to gratuitously drive people away,” Alexander advised. But policy matters much more than politeness. The trouble with American liberalism is not the rhetoric, the selling or the advertising; it is not even the product to sell, as if politics were marketing. Rather, liberals need to forge policies that allow Americans to identify or imagine common interests. The problem is not the bait chosen to lure voters but the whole idea of politics as fishing – as if voters across the country are suckers to be lured into one camp or another. Perhaps liberals, searching for a path forward into the hearts and minds of voters, need to pay heed to Missouri’s state motto: not “rule me more nicely”, but “show me”. Not that it is easy to decide on the right policies, but two that stand out – in part because both have already had obvious traction with voters – are ending the endless war on terror and pushing for less economic inequality. The last two presidents of the United States have each been elected as antiwar candidates, even though each went on to govern militaristically. An antiwar coalition in the making – starting with proposals to drastically reduce America’s counterproductive use of force abroad – is likely to be powerful in future elections too. But liberals will have to give up their concessions to the national security state and their fears of coming off as unpatriotic in order to exploit this opportunity. And Trump’s otherwise repellent white nationalism has carried with it a fair emphasis on economic stagnation and the travails of a working class left further and further behind a wealthy elite. Liberals can borrow from his playbook – in part because it has already proved successful in the unexpected breakthrough of Bernie Sanders in the last presidential campaign. Neither of these reforms demand from liberals an abandonment or even soft-pedaling on their traditional emphasis on social justice for the excluded and oppressed. More even than “white male workers” (often cited as the principal reason for Trump’s win), it was the fact that urban African Americans failed to show up to the polls that did liberals in. In the successive elections of Barack Obama, Democrats could depend on charisma and identification to attract record numbers of African American votes. Clinton, by contrast, could run on her party’s recent policies alone, and urban African Americans were clearly not impressed. Not less emphasis on policies to counteract historic discrimination, but more, is what American liberalism needs if it is to return to power durably.

The striker has become a peripheral figure at Chelsea since the January arrival of Olivier Giroud and will not be involved in Russia after the Spain coach Julen Lopetegui went with Diego Costa, Iago Aspas and Rodrigo as his strikers. “It’s always a difficult decision,” Lopetegui said. “There wasn’t anything negative about [Morata]. But we thought there were other players in the position who could help us.” “Best of luck in the World Cup,” Morata wrote on Twitter. “I’ll be supporting and cheering through the end, as always.” Instead of picking a fourth striker, Lopetegui opted to take eight defenders, including Arsenal’s Nacho Monreal, the only other surprise on the list. Chelsea’s Marcos Alonso and Marc Bartra were among the defenders left out. The squad features six players from Real Madrid and four from Barcelona. The Madrid players will report to the team’s training camp later than the other players because of their Champions League final commitments against Liverpool. Meanwhile, England’s Group G opponents Belgium have picked Christian Benteke despite his lack of goals for Crystal Palace in their preliminary 28-man squad. The striker, who scored just three times in the Premier League last season, got the nod from Roberto Martínez while Liverpool’s Divock Origi misses out. The Roma midfielder Radja Nainggolan reacted to missing out of the squad by announcing his international retirement.

The women accused nine different supervisors by name. Two of the women said they were retaliated against for making harassment claims, according to complaints filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The women, which include current and former employees, allege the incidents occurred between October 2014 and March 2018. One of the women who complained, Angela Caldwell, said in an EEOC complaint that she was retaliated against after reporting a supervisor who she said had rubbed against her and told her he liked how she looked in work pants. Another woman, Annie Whilhite, had been a temporary employee at New Breed Logistics, the predecessor to XPO Logistics, in August 2014 and was made a staff employee about five months later, according to the EEOC complaint. She left the company in January “due to work pressures and discriminatory treatment”, the complaint said. XPO Logistics provides supply chain workers, such as truckers and inventory clerks, to major corporations including Verizon, Disney and Pepsi. The company said that at this stage in the investigation it had no evidence that the EEOC claims were true. “We take any allegation of misconduct seriously,” an XPO spokesperson said in a statement. “When we learned about claims in one of our facilities in Memphis, we immediately retained a third party to conduct a thorough investigation. The investigation is almost complete and, to date, there’s no evidence to support the allegations of sexual harassment.” The workers rights legal group A Better Balance is providing legal representation to one of the women who filed a complaint. The group also provided a list of recommendations to XPO on how it could improve its harassment reporting practices and is encouraging XPO employees who have experienced harassment to contact its hotline. The sexual harassment claims are part of a flurry of other informal complaints made against the warehouse by an employee and the Teamsters trade union. “Those products are reaching them with our blood, sweat and tears, and some of our last breaths,” Lakeisha Nelson, an inventory curator for the Memphis warehouse, told the Guardian. The most alarming allegation made by Nelson was that an employee who died of a heart attack on the warehouse floor in October 2017 had been denied a break by her supervisors before collapsing. Some of the coworkers of the woman, Linda Neal, approached the Teamsters with concerns about the circumstances around her death. Nelson said it was unusual for Neal to ask for a break and should have been a red flag to her supervisors that something was wrong. “Linda doesn’t ask to go home, she never leaves,” Nelson said. “She is always volunteering to stay because she has kids and grandkids to take care of.” The XPO spokesperson said Neal’s death: “is now being shamefully exploited through a distortion of information by a labor union in its effort to organize workers at this facility”. “Here are the facts: when our employee collapsed, we immediately called emergency services and cleared the area for first responders,” the spokesperson said. “EMTs were on the scene within 10 minutes, and we complied with their direction to restrict access until the Memphis police arrived. Our colleague’s passing was upsetting to everyone, especially her co-workers, who were told they could go home for the rest of the day.” Nelson said she had previously raised concerns about the circumstances around Neal’s death and sexual harassment in the warehouse with Verizon’s CEO Lowell McAdam at the company’s shareholder meeting earlier this month because its phones and other products are shipped out of the warehouse. In a 2 May letter to XPO Logistics, attorneys for Verizon said: “As we discussed, we expect frequent and prompt updates on the progress of your investigation and any measures that XPO plans to take if these allegations are substantiated. We will be monitoring XPO’s actions in response to this matter closely, and it will inform the basis of any decisions Verizon makes regarding the future of our contractual relationship with XPO.” “We continue to work closely with XPO in investigating the accusations that we were levied and that’s ongoing,” said James Gerace, a spokesperson for Verizon. On Thursday of last week, Neal’s son, Dean Turner, and Nelson brought their concerns directly to XPO Logistics CEO Bradley Jacobs at the company’s annual shareholders meeting in a Rye Brook, New York, country club. “I’m not interested in finding a new job; I want this one to be better and suitable for me to work in,” Nelson said. “And not just me, the generations behind me need a decent place to work with respect and safety” Ashley Latimer, a communications specialist for the Teamsters, said the CEO was sitting in front of the group and did not turn around when they spoke or respond directly to their questions, which were handled by other senior management figures. “It was like we were talking to a wall,” Latimer said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/21/unai-emery-set-to-replace-wenger-arsenal-manager","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T21:11:54Z","webTitle":"Unai Emery set to be named as new Arsenal manager","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/21/unai-emery-set-to-replace-wenger-arsenal-manager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/21/unai-emery-set-to-replace-wenger-arsenal-manager","fields":{"headline":"Unai Emery set to be named as new Arsenal manager","bodyText":"Arsenal have moved to appoint Unai Emery as the successor to Arsène Wenger. The club have conducted a thorough recruitment process as they look to replace Wenger – their manager of almost 22 years – who departed at the end of the season and Mikel Arteta had been considered as the favourite for the past week or so. However, the signs on Monday were that Emery, the former Paris St-Germain and Sevilla manager, was set to be chosen. The club have spoken to him and a decision is expected to be confirmed later in the week. Emery is a safer bet in terms of his experience and, in the end, it is this factor that has swayed the decision of Ivan Gazidis, the Arsenal chief executive, who has led the recruitment drive. Arteta, the former Arsenal player, who is now a member of Pep Guardiola’s coaching staff at Manchester City, has not yet managed a club whereas Emery has been in the business since 2005, when he cut his teeth at Lorca Deportiva in his native Spain. The 46-year-old has gone on to take charge at Almería, Valencia, Spartak Moscow, Sevilla and, most recently, PSG – clubs of mounting profile – and he has impressed Gazidis, even though he is not fluent in English. Emery is happy to work within the management structure that Gazidis has put in place at the Emirates Stadium – in which there are prominent recruitment roles for Raúl Sanllehí and Sven Mislintat. He enjoyed eye-catching success at Sevilla, where he won three consecutive Europa Leagues, and he won the championship at PSG in this past season, although his relative failure in the Champions League, in the shape of a last-16 exit against Real Madrid, cost him his job. He has been replaced by Thomas Tuchel – the one-time Arsenal target. Arteta had a meeting with the Arsenal hierarchy last week and he was confident that he would get the job. Guardiola had said he would not stand in Arteta’s way and talks had progressed to the point where the potential make-up of his backroom staff had been discussed. Arteta ticked plenty of boxes for Gazidis, who was looking for somebody to represent the club’s values, including giving youth a chance, and play fast and attractive football. Gazidis had made it clear he was not afraid to make a left-field appointment, noting on the day Wenger’s departure was confirmed that the Frenchman had not been “on many people’s radar screens” in 1996. But Emery, too, ticked the boxes and, crucially, he came to look like less of a gamble. It is understood that Arteta was told his lack of experience came to count against him. Gazidis is not a man synonymous with risk-taking. After careful consideration, analysing each argument from every conceivable angle, he has come to see Emery as the outstanding selection. The new manager is expected to have around £50m, plus money generated from sales, to spend on reshaping the squad, which is broadly in line with what Wenger was granted, annually, in recent seasons. It is not a lavish budget and it is clear that the new man’s coaching skills will have to be up to scratch from the outset. Santi Cazorla, the Arsenal midfielder, had been linked with a possible player-coach role under Arteta but he has now left the club upon the expiry of his contract. He has not played since he injured his achilles in October 2016, although he remains determined to carry on as a player. Gazidis said: “Santi is always one of my favourite players to watch. His natural ability with both feet, his speed of thought and movement were central to our best performances in recent years. He plays with a joy and freedom which is very rare. We wish him well for the future and thank him for his important contribution to our club.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/22/morning-mail-pompeo-threatens-iran-victoria-treaty-doubts-sweden-ready-for-war","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T21:04:45Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: US threatens Iran with 'strongest sanctions in history'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/22/morning-mail-pompeo-threatens-iran-victoria-treaty-doubts-sweden-ready-for-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/22/morning-mail-pompeo-threatens-iran-victoria-treaty-doubts-sweden-ready-for-war","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: US threatens Iran with 'strongest sanctions in history'","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 22 May. Top stories The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has threatened Iran with the “strongest sanctions in history”, if it does not comply with a list of a dozen US demands. “The Iranian regime should know this is just the beginning,” Pompeo said. His speech did not explicitly advocate regime change, but in remarks immediately afterwards Pompeo suggested it would be up to the Iranian people to end the US pressure campaign by changing their own government. “The Iranian people will get to make a choice about their leadership. If they make the decision quickly that will be wonderful.” Pompeo said the Trump administration would not separate negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program from other issues such as regional conflicts and missile development. However, he did not make clear how the US would be able galvanise international support for isolating Iran after Trump violated the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, responded by asking Pompeo: “Who you are to decide for Iran and the world?” Voters are more attracted to Bill Shorten’s tax and economic plans than Malcolm Turnbull’s, but the contest between the major parties appears to be tightening, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The survey of 1,025 voters found 45% backed Shorten’s tax plan outlined in budget week, compared with 33% who supported the Coalition’s tax package. Similarly, 44% of the sample supported Labor’s plan to increase spending on health and education while giving a tax cut to low and middle-income earners, with 38% supporting the Coalition’s approach, which is to give both companies and workers a tax cut. But the gap between the major parties has narrowed over the past fortnight on the two-party-preferred measure. Women are still living in “a climate of fear and vigilance” more than three decades since Australia introduced the Sex Discrimination Act, gender researcher Prof Catharine Lumby says. Her comments follow the release of a report by Plan International that found a quarter of women surveyed in Sydney said they were harassed on the street once a month or more, while 69% said they sometimes or always avoided going out at night out of concern for their safety. Four out of five respondents said they first experienced street harassment when they were under 18, more than one-third were first harassed between the ages of 11 and 15, and one in three of those harassed once a month or more reported experiencing anxiety, depression or mental health issues as a direct result. Victoria’s only Aboriginal MP may vote against legislation intended to be the first step towards signing a treaty with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people if amendments recognising sovereignty are not adopted. The Greens MP Lidia Thorpe, a Gunnai-Gunditjmara woman, has drafted nine amendments, beginning with editing the preamble of the bill to acknowledge that Aboriginal sovereignty was never ceded, and replace all mentions of “Aboriginal Victorians” with “sovereign clans”. Victoria offers the best chance of negotiating a state treaty, after the federal government’s negative response to the Uluru Statement. The Swedish government has begun sending all 4.8m of the country’s households a public information leaflet telling the population, for the first time in more than half a century, what to do in the event of a war. The 20-page pamplet explains how people can secure basic needs such as food, water and heat, what warning signals mean, where to find bomb shelters and how to contribute to Sweden’s “total defence”. The illustrated guide also prepares the population for dangers such as cyber and terror attacks and climate change, and includes a page on identifying fake news. Similar leaflets were first distributed in neutral Sweden in 1943, at the height of the second world war.

Williams was world No1 when she left the tour to give birth, but is now ranked No453. The WTA is considering a rule change to add protected seedings for highly ranked players returning from maternity leave but the earliest that could take effect is next year. Arsenal have moved to appoint Unai Emery, the former PSG and Sevilla manager, as the successor to Arsène Wenger. Former player Mikel Arteta had been considered the favourite, but the signs on Monday were that Emery was set to be chosen. Thinking time There were undoubtedly some fresh faces at Australian Fashion Week, but not much has changed. Internationally the message on diversity appears to be getting through, but Australia still has a lot of catching up to do. Alexandra Spring and Carly Earl followed four models at last week’s shows to gauge progress. Last week we heard that one million jobs had been created since September 2013. This sounds impressive, but a closer look at the data suggests that population growth and part-time work has been the main driver, writes Greg Jericho. It indicates that the achievement is rather less inspiring than the government would suggest. Former US President Barack Obama and wife Michelle have signed a deal with Netflix to produce films and documentaries. The couple will develop ideas for shows, including scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries and features. “Michelle and I are so excited,” Barack Obama said in a statement. “We hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples, and help them share their stories with the entire world.” What’s he done now? Donald Trump has promised that American farmers will not be able to keep up with demand from China once he sorts out the trade deficit. “Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce,” he tweeted. Media roundup Australian Joel Zamel has been linked to Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, the Australian Financial Review reports. The entrepeneur was reportedly interviewed by the special counsel as part of his investigation into foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Sydney Morning Herald says traffic congestion in the city is at a “tipping point”, with a new study warning the NSW capital is falling behind comparable global cities in managing its traffic woes. The Courier Mail is among several papers to focus on the number of athletes who have remained in Australia since the Commonwealth Games, warning “Aussie taxpayers will have to stump up millions of dollars” to cover legal costs. Coming up The banking royal commission’s public hearings will hear further evidence about loans made to small and medium-sized businesses.

As Clay wanders around the floor distraught, many of his friends from school circle and embrace him, swaying together, holding one another’s pain. Season two is about the aftermath of trauma, as each character works towards healing and justice from the first season, while the presence of new and mysterious Polaroid pictures indicates there are new aspects to Hannah’s story that affects all of the characters. Whether or not you find the scene of Clay and his friends’ circle of compassion heartfelt or cloying may depend a lot on your age and experience. Despite the show’s well-deserved TV-MA rating, it is clearly intended for a younger audience, with each hour-long episode filled to the brim with teenage emotion, from the delicately drawn opening credits that seem reminiscent of doodles you would scrawl in a notebook, to the increasingly complex social dramas that evolve in the halls of Liberty High, to the constant hiding of important things from parents who (except for Hannah’s mom) just don’t seem to understand. Since 13 Reasons Why was first released, critics have debated whether or not the show is good for young people – is it a conversation starter about pressing real-world issues affecting teens? Or a dangerous provocation that could be deadly for impressionable and vulnerable youth? In season two, this criticism has been taken to heart in all sorts of tangible ways. The show’s creators have included content warnings that the show is fictional and is intended as a warning about the dangers of suicide, and have assembled a website with mental health resources for teens and their parents. “The minute you start talking about it,” one of the actors assures its young viewers, “it gets easier.” In many of the video PSAs, teens are encouraged to seek the help of trusted adults, to listen to friends who may need care and comfort and, above all, to encourage a culture of talking about difficult things. This emphasis on the importance of talking is constant in the world of the show as well: characters are consistently reminding each other that talking about these issues is essential to help troubled and traumatized people, kids and adults alike. When the school itself bans discussion of Hannah’s suicide, a frustrated Clay talks back, saying that silence is what caused Hannah’s death in the first place. The school’s trial, which function as the narrative backbone of this season, is ultimately a forum for characters to voice their grief, their traumas, and their regrets. In this way, rather than clarify who Hannah was, or who was at fault for her suicide, the trial becomes a kind of collective purging. You would think with all of this well-intentioned talking, the season is set up to probe deeply into mental health issues and assert the power of speaking your truth. But while 13 Reasons Why insists over and over again that its purpose is to bring complex awareness to issues that one else is discussing, the reality is that the soap opera format that the series clings to is an incredibly clumsy attempt at looking at mental health. Despite efforts to complicate characters by having them form new friendships, each character in the show is defined almost exclusively by their trauma – be it coping with a friend who committed suicide, dealing with the aftermath of rape, or confronting a toxic culture of school bullying. The number of diffuse “hot-button” issues that the show insists are important to look at closely, ends up giving us a smorgasbord of various angsts, none of which are interrogated with as much depth as they deserve. If the problem with the first season was that it risked romanticizing Hannah Baker’s story, the problem with season two is that it insists so much on being an important PSA that it fails to allow the story to develop more organically, instead relying on the discovery of Polaroids that seem to complicate the story further, when only reiterating things that were already established. We already know that there is a dangerous culture of bullying at Liberty, that one of the jocks is a sociopathic rapist, and that adults are as complicit in this culture of covering things up as a lot of students are. Season two’s best moments are when its attempts at complexity actually serve up something interesting – for example, the knowledge that Hannah actually bullied a girl at her previous school. But often, the additional information we are provided simply serves to further muddy the waters of the plot. Does the fact that Hannah’s father had an affair really add anything to Hannah’s character? Does the fact that she slept with other boys really add to her character’s development? By cutting back on more cluttered, less focused plot points, 13 Reasons Why could spend more time focusing on what I think is the heart of the show and what has made it most successful: those moments, like the one with Clay on the dance floor with his friends, that take teenage pain seriously. Sadly, in attempting to make a show watchable and socially important, 13 Reasons Why isn’t content to focus on this main arc. Instead, it constantly throws everything at its audience: young love! Sweet high school moments! Intense bullying! Graphic and disturbing violence! The final episode of the season highlights how these sudden and shocking tone shifts are intended to provoke controversy, more so than conversation, and also highlight how the introductory PSAs are little more than a Band-Aid solution for a series that is more interested in getting a third season rather than actually helping young people. I don’t think a third season would help clear up any of these concerns but, luckily, we don’t actually need one to have the conversations that the series keeps insisting are so important. We are fortunate to live at a time when there are many TV shows that handle mental health issues with nuance and sensitivity, in ways that are caring and not exploitative. Shows like One Day at a Time, Orange is the New Black, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and BoJack Horseman consider mental health concerns in ways that center their characters’ humanity. Of course, these shows aren’t intended with an exclusively teen audience in mind, but they do provide a template for how a teen show might deal with mental health concerns in ways that are less triggering and more meaningful, simply by allowing characters to grow and change, without the need to throw more gratuitous violence at them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/21/ex-footballer-terry-butcher-accuses-british-army-failing-his-son","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T19:26:51Z","webTitle":"Ex-footballer Terry Butcher accuses British army of failing his son","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/ex-footballer-terry-butcher-accuses-british-army-failing-his-son","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/ex-footballer-terry-butcher-accuses-british-army-failing-his-son","fields":{"headline":"Ex-footballer Terry Butcher accuses British army of failing his son","bodyText":"The former England football captain Terry Butcher has accused the British army of failing his son, who died after developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Butcher told an inquest on Monday that Christopher, 35, had turned to alcohol and drugs after being discharged from the armed forces in April 2015, due to the mental health condition. “Christopher passed away several months ago. But, in reality, the Chris that we all knew and loved had ceased to exist years before,” Butcher told Ipswich coroner’s court. “Diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress disorder, his life spiralled downwards as the demons took control of his mind. In truth after intense tours of Iraq and Afghanistan he became a victim of war. “These circumstances are all too familiar. Our country has a number of veterans suffering from the same condition, released from the armed forces too early and having to rely on an overloaded NHS that is ill-equipped and underfunded to cope.” Butcher, who struggled to hold back tears during the hearing, said the armed forces’ duty of care towards personnel had been “discarded too easily, which has resulted in a growing number of our veterans turning to anything that might help including alcohol, drugs and suicide as a means of alleviating the flashbacks and nightmares”. The inquest heard how Christopher, a former captain in the Royal Artillery, had been haunted by nightmares and flashbacks about the deaths of comrades and civilians in Afghanistan. Butcher found his son’s body wedged between his bed and a wall when he went to check on him on the morning of 16 October last year at his home in Suffolk. A postmortem failed to identify Christopher’s cause of death, but found he had an enlarged heart, which could have been caused by drug use. Toxicology tests revealed he had non-lethal levels of cocaine and heroin in his body, as well as prescription drugs he had been taking for several years. A makeshift crack pipe in a sunglasses case was also found in his room. Suffolk’s assistant coroner, Dr Dan Sharpstone, concluded that Christopher died from an enlarged heart due to uncertain causes with a background of drug use and PTSD. Butcher remembered his son as a man who had a “glittering career in the army ahead of him, a loving wife and dreams of having children of his own. His unnecessary death has deprived us of a wonderful son, husband, brother and grandson, friend and comrade”. Sharpstone said: “When people serve in the armed forces, they give everything in the defence of our country and this may result in death or serious injury. However, it can also result in PTSD.” In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

In the chamber last Wednesday Bercow was accused of having said in an aside that Leadsom was a “stupid woman”, and swearing before describing her as “useless”, prompting Downing Street to say such language would be unacceptable. But in a statement to MPs on Monday Bercow said that while he had been annoyed by the government’s decision to schedule a statement on the East Coast rail franchise on an opposition day, he had not insulted Leadsom. “I thought then, as I think now, that this was very badly handled,” Bercow told MPs. “It was in particular disrespectful both to the house and to the 23 backbenchers who were hoping to participate in the opposition day debate on the Grenfell Tower disaster. “It was in that context, and that context alone, that, having expressed my displeasure about the matter quite forcefully from the chair, I used the word ‘stupid’ in a muttered aside. That adjective simply summed up how I felt about the way that that day’s business had been conducted.” This was not directed at Leadsom, Bercow said, telling MPs that anyone who knew her “will have not the slightest doubt about her political ability and her personal character”. He concluded: “I love this house. I respect all of my colleagues. I hold you all in the highest esteem. It is our duty to get on with the business of parliament, scrutinising legislation, debating issues and standing up for the people we are here to represent. “For my part I shall continue to speak out firmly for the interests of the whole house and, if from time to time it involves publicly disagreeing with the government’s management of business, then so be it.” Speaking in the debate after the statement, Leadsom said she took her responsibilities very seriously and she expected all MPs to treat colleagues with “courtesy and respect”. The claims about Bercow last week came amid wider pressure and scrutiny on the Speaker, who has faced calls to resign over allegations he bullied staff who worked for him. He has denied the claims. Speaking in a debate after Bercow made his comments, Leadsom said: “I take my responsibilities to this house very seriously. As you said last week, Mr Speaker, we have a responsibility to safeguard the rights of this house. “As leader of the house, I seek to do exactly that, treating all members of parliament with courtesy and respect. I hope and expect all honourable and right honourable members to do likewise.” Leadsom did not complain to the parliamentary standards commissioner about the alleged comments. It is understood she did not to want to complain herself because she did not want to jeopardise her independent complaints and grievance policy. The final proposals, which are due out before the summer recess in July, have to be signed off by the House of Commons commission, which is chaired by Bercow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/21/white-house-doj-trump-campaign-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T22:10:55Z","webTitle":"DoJ agrees to expand election inquiry after Trump meeting, White House says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/21/white-house-doj-trump-campaign-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/21/white-house-doj-trump-campaign-investigation","fields":{"headline":"DoJ agrees to expand election inquiry after Trump meeting, White House says","bodyText":"The White House announced on Monday that the Department of Justice would “expand its investigation” of the 2016 election to include “any irregularities with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s or the Department of Justice’s tactics concerning the Trump campaign”. The statement, issued by press secretary Sarah Sanders, came shortly after Donald Trump finished a meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, FBI director Christopher Wray and director of national intelligence Dan Coats. The meeting, which was not on the White House’s public schedule, came the day after Trump demanded an investigation over a government informant’s meeting with several people connected with his campaign in 2016. Trump posted on Twitter on Sunday: “I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes – and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!” A number of House Republicans have been vocally demanding information from the justice department about the informant, including Devin Nunes, the chair of the House intelligence committee, and Mark Meadows, leader of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. Meadows tweeted supportively of Trump’s demand on Monday: “This is the right call from Donald Trump – we’ve seen disturbing evidence that the FBI engaged in political targeting.” The White House also said in the statement that chief of staff John Kelly “will immediately set up a meeting with the FBI, DoJ and DNI together with congressional leaders to review highly classified and other information they have requested”. It was unclear what they will review and which members will be part of the process. Democrats expressed concern about the meeting. In a statement, Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat said: “The White House plan to arrange a meeting where ‘highly classified and other information’ will be shared with members of Congress is highly irregular and inappropriate. The president and his staff should not be involved in the viewing or dissemination of sensitive investigatory information involving any open investigation, let alone one about his own activities and campaign.” He added: “However, if such a meeting occurs, it must be bipartisan in order to serve as a check on the disturbing tendency of the president’s allies to distort facts and undermine the investigation and the people conducting it.” The DoJ a year ago announced the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russian interference in the presidential election and alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/22/manchester-united-womens-side-casey-stoney-manager","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T09:00:50Z","webTitle":"Manchester United appointing Casey Stoney would be a very smart move | Suzanne Wrack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/22/manchester-united-womens-side-casey-stoney-manager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/22/manchester-united-womens-side-casey-stoney-manager","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United appointing Casey Stoney would be a very smart move","bodyText":"After weeks of quiet rumblings, it is now being widely reported that the announcement that former England captain Casey Stoney will be the manager of the new Manchester United women’s team is imminent. When United revealed their intention to relaunch a women’s side and bid for entry into the new Women’s Championship (second tier) for the 2018-19 season, it was clear that the job would be highly sought after. United will not be confirming the news until the Football Association reveals the league status of the teams that have applied in the second round for the Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship, expected on Sunday. The FA have confirmed that there are up to four places available in tier one and five in tier two. With 15 teams fighting it out for those nine places, there is likely to be disquiet if United are handed a spot at the expense of a longer-established team. Yet they are not the only side who are benefiting from the changes. Other teams will be moving up, with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion having already been granted a move into the top flight. In 2014, when the Women’s Super League structure was revamped and expanded, Manchester City were parachuted into tier one at the expense of Doncaster Rovers Belles. It is a move which still causes consternation, yet few would question the evident benefits of City’s investment in women’s football in recent years. With professional women’s football now on the cards, the introduction of a team from one of the biggest and most widely supported clubs in the world will have many positive implications, and with the women’s game very much still at the beginning of a journey, memories of the start will likely be short. How United go about setting up their team will help, and bringing in Stoney is a very smart move for the club, Stoney herself, and women’s football in England. While the 36-year-old’s managerial experience is limited to a brief spell as player-manager at Chelsea in 2009, she has slowly worked her way through her coaching badges, has led training sessions with development teams at Liverpool – where she ended her playing career – and has been vital to Phil Neville as an assistant coach in his first few months in charge of the Lionesses. Stoney knows football and is brilliant at reading the game, but she also knows the women’s game inside out. During a lengthy playing career which included spells at Arsenal, Charlton, Lincoln, Chelsea and Liverpool, she has experienced it all, from winning trophies to clubs folding. Stoney is also a proven leader having captained many of the sides she played for, alongside raking up 130 caps for England, preceding Steph Houghton as captain of the Lionesses and leading Team GB at the 2012 Olympics. United handing such a well-liked and respected member of the women’s football community, pinpointed by many as a future England manager, the chance to build a squad from scratch will earn them considerable credit. They are taking a chance on her potential and have picked her from a rumoured four-strong shortlist. They also stand to benefit greatly from her profile, both from a marketing point of view – Stoney is a role model and was one of the first gay players in the women’s game to speak publicly about her sexuality – and on the pitch. The respect she garners professionally will mean she has no problem recruiting talent to her new project. For Stoney, this is an opportunity that would be hard to rival. She has the chance to build from the bottom up, without the baggage accumulated by previous managers, at a club with resources and a top-class youth set-up already established. If United are granted the tier-two license they’ve bid for, Stoney has the profile to recruit players from tier one and abroad to balance a squad being built to not just earn top-flight status but be able to compete for trophies. There are a host of former United academy prospects who have gone on to leading clubs such as England and Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen, Everton defender Gabby George, 18-year-old City forward Ella Toone, Liverpool’s Ellie Fletcher and Emily Ramsey, Juventus’s Katie Zelem and Chelsea keeper Fran Kitching, and there may well be an attempt to lure some of them back to their roots. The one down side to the potential move is the short-term loss to England. Though there can be little doubt this is a appointment that will have been supported by Neville. He will certainly miss Stoney’s experience but having her managing at what will likely become one of the biggest women’s teams in the country is something England will hopefully eventually benefit from.

China’s air pollution problems are often blamed on the country’s rapid industrial growth but the problems probably date back to the 1950s. In air pollution terms China is two countries, divided by a line that follows the Huai river. North of this line average winter temperatures are below freezing and here free or heavily subsidised coal was provided for home heating. This led to the development of poorly controlled, coal-powered, district heating systems in towns and cities north of the river. The laudable aim of providing home heating was disastrous for China’s air. Average particle pollution north of the Huai river was 40% greater than the south and this extra pollution caused an estimated three-year reduction in average life expectancy.

The former Eastleigh owner, speaking for the first time since the Football League ratified his takeover, said that all previous debts had been erased and Sunderland would benefit from a “pretty hefty” third tier transfer budget. He then proceeded to refuse to rule out the chance of Coleman making an extraordinary comeback. “The budget’s going to be pretty hefty for League One,” he said. “It’s going to be a lot more than any of the teams that got promoted last season had. I’m sure it’s a budget one or two Championship clubs would like.” As a key part of his manifesto for change, Donald hopes to name Sunderland’s a new manager in the next week but maintained he had nothing to do with Coleman’s controversial sacking in April. “That was all Ellis,” he said. “It wasn’t us and I wouldn’t rule out potentially talking to Chris. We wouldn’t necessarily exclude Chris. When I look at the list of people who have applied I think Chris would be potentially in the three or four we’d like to speak to.” It is only the second time in their history that Sunderland have fallen into the third tier and a club relegated from the Premier League just 12 months ago desperately craves a new dawn. Around £35m worth of top-flight parachute payments will help but there are concerns about the longer-term funding. Donald conceded that he is not currently backed by an international consortium but is in partnership with Charlie Methven, a public relations expert. The pair are actively seeking outside investment. Nonetheless they are adamant the agreement with Short means the new regime will start on a healthy financial note and that arrears recently understood to be in excess of £100m have been eliminated. “We’ve given Ellis £40m and in return Ellis has tidied up his debt and that’s now gone,” said Donald. “Ellis was very clear he didn’t want the debt, but we didn’t want the debt either so we refused that. Sunderland is now debt-free.” Initially Donald and Methven did not want to buy Sunderland until further investors were on board but they were eventually persuaded to act quickly. “The timescale was getting very crunched and anything that delayed the takeover was going to have a material impact on this summer’s business,” said Methven. “We took advice … and what became clear was that it would be quicker and more straightforward if the club was simply taken over by Stewart. “There are other people we both have in mind who have further capital and contacts that could be useful for the club going forward. Considerable investment is needed. This is an organisation that has become used to failure and there needs to be a quick turnaround. But Stuart will be the major shareholder whatever happens.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/22/mps-push-for-myanmar-regime-to-face-international-criminal-court","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T23:01:38Z","webTitle":"MPs push for Myanmar regime to face international criminal court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/mps-push-for-myanmar-regime-to-face-international-criminal-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/22/mps-push-for-myanmar-regime-to-face-international-criminal-court","fields":{"headline":"MPs push for Myanmar regime to face international criminal court","bodyText":"The UK must support efforts to refer Myanmar’s regime to the international criminal court over evidence of state-sanctioned ethnic cleansing of Rohingya people and human rights abuses, according to MPs on the international development select committee. They also called for a complete review of UK aid to Myanmar, which was worth £100m in 2018, saying the sums were agreed at the time it appeared the country was on a transition to democracy. The committee concludes that no such transition, or any genuine peace process, is under way, adding they were barred from visiting the country to visit UK aid projects when visas were denied by Myanmar authorities at the highest level at the last minute. The idea of collective action against the Myanmar regime has been stalled at the UN due to opposition from China, a veto-wielding member of the security council. But the committee says the UK and allies should still seek to gather “support for the UN security council to refer Burma to the international criminal court and to apply targeted financial sanctions at all identifiable key figures”. Myanmar is not a signatory to the ICC. It welcomes a move by the ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to seek a ruling whether she can investigate the deportation of thousands of Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh. After ambassadors from the UN security council visited Myanmar last month, they called for the safe return of refugees, but also recognised Myanmar’s sovereignty. More than 680,000 Rohingha have been forced to flee Rakhine state since the violence started in August 2017. There has been a tension within the UK’s Foreign Office over the degree to which Britain should give Myanmar’s state counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi, further leeway due to her need to appease a military junta that still runs foreign policy and defence. But the British parliamentary committee says the former Nobel prize winner and political prisoner has become part of the problem. It accuses her of a “longstanding approach of denying human rights abuses have taken place and seeking to obstruct moves towards justice and accountability [and] failing to counter hate speech through positive speech and messages of tolerance and restraint”. The MPs point out that, since the last British aid programme was prepared, “there has been ethnic cleansing, the breaking of ceasefires, a closing of civil society space, including restrictions on media freedoms and the persecution of journalists, and a reduction in religious freedom”. Following this bleak assessment, the committee said the UK’s government’s language and actions towards Myanmar needed to change dramatically, including by imposing targeted sanctions. The committee says: “[Myanmar] must realise that there is a bill to pay for the actions of its army and the inaction its government and society. The dramatic changes to the situation in Burma must drive dramatic change in UK policy.” The UK government continues to promote trade links and provide technical assistance to the Myanmar government. The only substantive change in its policy, according to the committee, has been an end to funding for the Myanmar armed forces. The committee’s chair, Stephen Twigg, said: “British taxpayers must be assured that their money is not being used to subsidise a government accused of crimes against humanity. If there is nothing to report, we recommend suspending these programmes.” The committee, which has twice before reported on the plight of refugees expelled from Rakhine state, say they are now deeply concerned by the threat to the Rohingya’s fraught and fragile foothold in Bangladesh as the monsoon season approaches. The UK has provided £70m in aid to help address the impact of the monsoon at Cox’s Bazaar, the main refugee camp, including help to ensure the inhabitants have access to safe drinking water.Bangladesh is already one of the world’s most densely populated countries, and is home to 21 million people living precariously in extreme poverty, vulnerable to natural disaster. Twigg said:“This is not a challenge which Bangladesh should face alone. The international community should step up to provide a long-term plan for countries who carry out a global ‘public good’ by hosting refugees, migrants or displaced persons.” International development secretary Penny Mordaunt said: “We recognise this is a man-made crisis and the UK continues to lead the international response. We are reshaping our programme in Burma to focus on helping those whose lives have been devastated by conflict. “Dfid does not provide aid to the government of Burma and we are focussed on providing aid to those displaced and destitute in both Burma and Bangladesh.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/23/ditch-the-tin-foil-and-channel-yotam-ottolenghi-how-to-enjoy-eating-outdoors","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"How to enjoy eating outdoors: a guide to avoiding wasps, sand and warm mayonnaise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/23/ditch-the-tin-foil-and-channel-yotam-ottolenghi-how-to-enjoy-eating-outdoors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/23/ditch-the-tin-foil-and-channel-yotam-ottolenghi-how-to-enjoy-eating-outdoors","fields":{"headline":"How to enjoy eating outdoors: a guide to avoiding wasps, sand and warm mayonnaise","bodyText":"The simple pleasures of dining alfresco are a well-worn topic at this time of year: it is hardly news that food tastes better in the open air, even if it is more likely to be our appreciation, rather than our perception of flavour, that is enhanced by the novel surroundings of a cliff top, a sailing dinghy or even a park bench. Indeed, although the rustic romance of un déjeuner sur l’herbe has inspired writers and painters for centuries, the picturesque results tend to be heavily seasoned with artistic licence. No wasps hang around the fruit basket in Manet’s painting and nary a seagull dive-bombs the bread and cheese as Virginia Woolf’s fractious family finally make their voyage to the lighthouse. If the Famous Five’s tinned sardines ever leaked fishy oil all over the rug, I don’t remember it, while Renoir’s boating party seem bizarrely untroubled by the distinct possibility that the small dog on the table will upset their wine glasses. These are fantasies of alfresco life, but in truth Mother Nature is a cruel mistress who doesn’t give a fig for your carefully laid plans or meticulously sliced cucumber sandwiches – which is why it pays to come prepared for all eventualities. Here’s a guide to dealing with a few of the challenges likely to crop up as soon as the words “it’s a lovely day!” leave your mouth. Surprise! I’m vegan These days, most special diets are easy to cater for with a little notice – but when someone texts on the day to inform you they have gone plant-based, or gluten-free, it can be tempting to reply telling them to bring their own bloody lunch. Before you do, count to 10 and channel Yotam Ottolenghi: a Middle Eastern feast will keep everyone happy. Big bowls of hummus or baba ganoush, paired with a salad of roasted or barbecued veg and some falafel or vegetable fritters are sure to go down a treat with omnivores, too – add pitta or other flatbreads to bulk it out, then finish with fruit and meringues or damp, sticky polenta cake. Most of these are gluten free and can easily be made vegan too. Failing that, almost all supermarkets carry a wide range of free-from products – and everyone likes crisps, right? Who invited them? Even the most committed animal lover might be hard-pressed to welcome our flying friends to the feast – but if you are eating outside, a certain insect presence is inevitable; to be fair to them, it’s where they live. The best way of deterring wasps and bees is thought to be to trap the first inquisitive scout before it returns to the nest weighed down with ketchup and alerts 250 of its nearest and dearest to the free buffet going on in your back garden. Avoid setting up camp close to ponds or the standing water beloved of mozzies and midges; instead, embrace the fresh air of a breezy hilltop – most flying insects hate both wind and smoke, which is a great excuse for a barbecue or a campfire. Sand-wiches The crunch of sand between the teeth may seem as inevitable a part of eating on the beach as a stiff wind and a Mr Whippy for pudding, but there are ways to reduce your silica consumption. Go for food such as wraps, filled baguettes and oranges that can be eaten straight from their wrappers (see below for eco-friendly options) with minimal contact with the gritty environment. Make sure you rinse your hands, preferably with fresh water, before you even think of unpacking anything, although even a bucket of sea water is better than nothing. Sun Obviously, sun is welcome whether you are planning a barbie in the back garden or a celebratory drink at the top of a mountain, but it can be problematic keeping food fresh in the heat. A good rule of thumb is to choose dishes from warmer climes: cured salami and ham are more robust than poached salmon or coronation chicken, just as parmesan, manchego or feta will do better than cheddar or stilton in sunshine. (That said, if you are eating at home, or can keep them flat in transit, bries, camemberts and their ilk come into their own after a few hours outside the fridge.) Crunchy carrots and radishes and Mediterranean veg are preferable to leafy greens, and vinaigrettes tend to hold up better than mayonnaise in high temperatures. If you are making sandwiches ahead of time, consider replacing the butter with avocado mashed with lemon juice, or a soft cheese. Rain This is more likely to be a problem in the UK than sun, sadly – but all is not lost if the forecast begins to look grim; one of the best picnics I have ever eaten was consumed in the very damp shadow of a dry-stone wall on Scafell Pike in December. As on a beach, choose foods that can be eaten straight from the wrappers, and avoid soft bread or delicate pastry: you’d be surprised how water-repellent a pork pie or scotch egg is compared with your average loaf of sliced white. If you are taking advantage of a brief break in the clouds to picnic, pack a waterproof layer to protect the rug, and your bottoms, from soggy grass. If the forecast looks similarly grim for a long-planned barbecue and you cannot fit the grill under cover, or prop a well-weighted umbrella over it, then go for dishes such as jerk chicken or ribs, which can be cooked in advance and then finished off either on a grill or a hot pan, depending on how the sky is looking, or choose recipes that work in the oven as well as on the barbecue. Travel If you are planning to eat a few hundred yards from your own kitchen, I probably do not need to tell you that a tray will come in handy. For picnics at distant beauty spots and barbecues on the beach, however, it pays to consider the very unromantic question of logistics. Some foods travel better than others; exquisite Parisian pastries will not look quite so pretty once they have been carted up a hill, but a sturdy British pie with a hot water crust could probably be kicked up there without much damage. Hard cheeses, cooked meats, boiled eggs and crunchy pickles are all good choices, as are soft things such as hummus or potato salad, which won’t mind being shaken about a bit. If you must take ripe tomatoes or stone fruits, then wrap them in newspaper as carefully as fine china, and put them in storage boxes. Cold drinks can be happily decanted into Thermos flasks full of ice. Comfort One of the chief pleasures of picnics in particular is their simplicity: unless physical necessity demands it, this is not the time for tables and chairs. Much lovelier to lounge about on the grass, sand or a sun-warmed rock and feel at one with nature as you shovel Pringles into your gob. In reality, all of those surfaces can be prickly, damp or downright spiky – so if you can manage to lug along a stout, preferably waterproof rug as well as the food, all the better (a sheet of plastic, or a few large Ikea bags, underneath an ordinary rug, does the job just as well). If you are planning to sit for a while, you might also like to suggest each guest brings a cushion as head support for an eminently sensible postprandial nap, and consider bringing a parasol as a sunshade: though a hat apiece is considerably easier to carry. Proper cloth napkins not only give a picnic an air of sophistication but are much more useful than paper ones, which tend to disintegrate at the mere sight of mayonnaise – and, of course, they are endlessly reusable, as well as handy for wrapping any crockery, glasses, boiled eggs and so on. Equipment As above, if you are eating away from home, keep it simple. Go for finger food – crudités and dips, burgers, hot dogs or samosas – and all you need are napkins to wipe your hands afterwards, although a bottle opener is sure to come in useful at most British picnics, as will some beakers. (Unless you want to be lugging those around yourself, ask everyone to bring their own – it will save on the washing up too.) If you are planning to barbecue away from home, invest in a small portable grill rather than wasteful disposable ones: some models are hardly more expensive, and you will be able to enjoy them for many summers to come. Barbecues will never be the most eco-friendly option of course, but you can also help by fuelling them with sustainable British lumpwood charcoal. Packaging Naturally, this should be kept to a minimum – principally for environmental reasons, although aesthetically there is little to spoil the simple elegance of a picnic like outrageous amounts of plastic wrap strewn across the rug. This should not be a problem if you are making the food yourself: there are plenty of good eco-friendly options out there, from sandwich wraps to Indian tiffin boxes, which are not only reusable, but far easier on the eye than tin foil, and a lot better at their job as well. Unless you are feeding the 5,000, you may prefer to decant condiments and seasonings into small jars (I collect tiny jam jars from hotel breakfasts for the purpose), though always leave dressing salads and sandwiches until the last minute, if possible, to minimise the risk of things going soggy and slimy in transit. The aftermath In theory, without all that rubbish to deal with, this should be relatively painless: box up any leftovers for tomorrow’s lunch, then sluice out dirty containers with water if it is available and going spare, and roughly dry with the aforementioned napkins before packing away. It’s always a good idea to take a couple of bags for any disposable packaging and recycling you do manage to accumulate, and if you are likely to be somewhere without water, a few damp flannels in a waterproof washbag will be invaluable for cleaning hands and faces before you release any trapped wasps, shake out the rug and head home, smug in the knowledge you have done your patriotic duty by the great British summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/22/the-spin-cricket-fretting-future-health","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T11:52:58Z","webTitle":"Restless fretting about cricket’s health could be its great strength | The Spin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/22/the-spin-cricket-fretting-future-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/22/the-spin-cricket-fretting-future-health","fields":{"headline":"Restless fretting about cricket’s health could be its great strength","bodyText":"Summer came late in 1906, and the spring, harried by a keen north-east wind, hardly stopped at all. May was cold and grey, frosty till the third Sunday. It was dismal weather for cricket. The season started on Wednesday the 2nd, but no one came to watch. Lord’s was empty. The Oval was empty. Old Trafford was empty. The press began to fret. On 27 May the Observer published a leader called The Necessity for Cricket Reform. It asked if the game had outlived its popularity. “Matches are being finished, but the crowds do not come,” the editorial read. “Cricket seems to have grown too old fashioned for these go-ahead times.” The Observer wasn’t the only one worrying. The next year’s Wisden recalled “all sorts of gloomy forebodings”. Until “the sun came out and all was well”. By the far side of the summer, England was in the middle of a long, late heatwave. George Hirst did the double-double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets, but Yorkshire were still pipped by Kent, who won 11 championship matches in a row, thanks in part to their brilliant young all-rounder Frank Woolley. It was one of the great seasons of the Golden Age, and when it was over, “no more was heard as to cricket being on the wane”. All this is just another reminder that cricket has always had a morbid obsession with its own death. As if this thanatophobia is a natural consequence of following the game, the inevitable upshot of a sport that leaves you so much time to stew, is so closely yoked to the coming and going of summer, and so dependent on the vagaries of the weather. The anxiety gets to be infectious. I suffer from it myself. It comes on stronger with age, perhaps because we never care for the sport so much as we did when we first came to it, so, looking back, it always seems less to us now than it did then. Even in 1906, the administrators and journalists were fussing and fretting over it, rethinking it and tinkering with the regulations to try to make it more appealing. In 1900 the MCC changed the length of an over, in 1904 there was a proposal to launch a new knockout competition for the counties, in 1905 they considered scrapping the toss, and in 1906 WG Grace argued the championship should be split into two divisions. There were running debates right through the decade about how many Test matches should be played, and how long they should last. Which are all ideas we’re still turning over now, a century later. In the these last few weeks, the International Cricket Council has said that it is considering whether or not to scrap the toss in the new Test championship, there has been a push from within English cricket to get rid of the County Championship’s two divisions and replace them with regional conferences, and the England and Wales Cricket Board has, of course, announced it wants to change the length of an over so it can launch a new domestic competition. South Africa have already played a four-day Test. Cricket has been going on so long that there’s nothing new left under the sun. This lingering suspicion that the game is an anachronism is not entirely unique to cricket. It runs through its cousin game of baseball, too. The writer Susan Jacoby has just published a book about it, Why Baseball Matters. Just like cricket, baseball is worried that it’s losing the young audience; it has the oldest, whitest crowd of any major US sport. Nearly six out of 10 fans for nationally televised baseball games are white men over 55. Compare that with YouGov’s sketch of the English cricket fan, who, compared to similar groups, is particularly likely to be a rightwing male, over 55, and well-to-do. The MLB commissioner, Rob Manfred, tells Jacoby he is convinced that the “three-hour-plus length of the average baseball game” is “a major problem for young fans”. Jacoby believes that “the aging of baseball’s audience is largely attributable to the profound dissonance between a culture saturated with devices that offer instant gratification and a sport that requires intense, sustained concentration”. Baseball’s problem, she argues, is that “it derives much of its enduring appeal from a style of play and adherence to tradition very much at odds with our current culture”. It is, as the Observer put it in 1906, “too old-fashioned for these go-ahead times”. Last week the ICC held a seminar in Dubai to talk over its global strategy. It presented a “Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats” analysis. It was a provocative document, designed as a starting point for the discussion. It listed the “time it takes to complete the game” as one of the weaknesses, flagged up T10 cricket as both a threat and an opportunity. It even went as far as to ask “Why does cricket exist – what’s its primary purpose in society?” Which sounds less like a threat, and more like an existential crisis. Maybe cricket’s restless fretting about its own status is one of the game’s great strengths, a quality that has caused it to adapt and evolve, the reason we’re still playing and watching it all these years later. Certainly it seems to have been the backdrop to every other English summer since the sport started. We worry away at it until the sun comes out again. They say it will be shining when the first Test starts at Lord’s on Thursday. The crowds will be out, the international season under way, and all of a sudden, for those precious few hours, everything will seem right with the game. • This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

The train company said a shortage of drivers was disrupting services on Tuesday. Dozens of trains were cancelled, some at short notice. A greater number were curtailed or running significantly late, with routes between Blackpool, Southport, Wigan and Manchester airport again heavily affected. Northern commuters face more problems as the RMT is planning industrial action on Thursday and Saturday. Arriva Rail North, which operates the Northern franchise, has yet to finalise its strike timetable but has warned passengers to expect more disruption. The union confirmed that the action – in a dispute over the future role and responsibilities of guards on the train – would proceed. Its general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “We have seen again this week that Arriva are not capable of running a railway and have chosen to declare war on passengers and staff alike in the drive for increased profits while safety, access and reliability are left to rot.” On the first full weekday of a new timetable for rail companies around Britain, Northern passengers were apparently hardest hit, despite a more radical redrawing of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) schedule in the south-east. The mayor of Manchester, Andy Burnham, who had demanded an inquiry into Northern’s failing services before this week’s problems, said on Monday night that he had asked for a meeting with the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to discuss the chaos. He said: “Things can’t go on like this.” On Tuesday, GTR’s services were apparently running with less disruption than on what unions called “meltdown Monday”, although the company was unable to provide figures. Many commuters again reported delayed and cancelled trains. A spokesperson for GTR said: “Disruption to our services has been reduced compared with the first full working day and there have been fewer peak-time cancellations as a consequence of the new timetable. Passenger groups have acknowledged that overall the network is functioning adequately under difficult circumstances.” The timetables have been changed to provide a more efficient service, but train companies had warned that disruption should be expected during a transition period. While GTR passengers should ultimately benefit from more thousands seats on trains to London at peak times, commuters in towns in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Sussex have complained that the changes will leave them with slower or less frequent services."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2018/may/27/simone-lia-things-i-plan-to-do-this-bank-holiday-weekend","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia: things I plan to do this Bank Holiday weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/may/27/simone-lia-things-i-plan-to-do-this-bank-holiday-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2018/may/27/simone-lia-things-i-plan-to-do-this-bank-holiday-weekend","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia: things I plan to do this Bank Holiday weekend","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/may/23/grammar-school-pupils-gain-no-social-or-emotional-advantages-by-age-14","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T23:01:08Z","webTitle":"Grammar school pupils 'gain no social or emotional advantages' by age 14","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/23/grammar-school-pupils-gain-no-social-or-emotional-advantages-by-age-14","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/23/grammar-school-pupils-gain-no-social-or-emotional-advantages-by-age-14","fields":{"headline":"Grammar school pupils 'gain no social or emotional advantages' by age 14","bodyText":"Grammar school pupils gain no social or emotional advantages by age 14 over children who do not attend a selective school, a study suggests. The research by University College London (UCL) is the latest to call into question the government’s plans to expand selective state education, which have been fiercely opposed by educationalists and policymakers. Recent studies have suggested that grammar schools only outperform their non-grammar peers academically because they select well, rather than because they add value, and do not increase social mobility. Researchers from UCL’s Institute of Education took a novel approach, examining a range of social and emotional outcomes important to parents and children when choosing a school. They concluded that attending a selective state school had no positive impact upon teenagers’ attitudes towards school, self-esteem, aspirations or their English vocabulary. Lead author Prof John Jerrim said: “You have to question the wisdom of expanding grammar schools, putting the extra resources in when actually it doesn’t seem to have any positive benefits. When you don’t see it’s actually having that much impact, not only on academic achievement, but on various [other] parts of people’s lives I would say stick to the status quo.” The researchers analysed 733 children in Northern Ireland, where grammar schools remain widespread, and 883 children in England from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). The children had similar academic achievements at primary school and came from families with similar incomes and education levels. Cognitive abilities were assessed on the basis of tests children had taken in English, mathematics, verbal and non-verbal reasoning at ages three, five, seven and 11 as well as a vocabulary test at age 14. Children’s social and emotional wellbeing were based on answers to questionnaires at ages 11 and 14 about mental health, engagement at school, wellbeing and interaction with peers. For both the English and Northern Irish pupils, there was no evidence that grammar school children were more engaged in their school work, more likely to expect to go to university or have superior English vocabulary skills than their non-grammar peers. The only outcome with a marked difference was self-esteem, which actually proved to be worse among grammar school pupils. The authors posit that this may be a result of the “big fish, little pond” effect, whereby grammar school pupils’ confidence is dented by being among other high(er) achievers. The self-esteem findings also suggest that the confidence of children who do not get into a grammar is not greatly affected in the long term, contrary to what many opponents of selective education believe. “It (the 11+) is probably not the make or break that parents and children think at the time – it actually doesn’t make that much difference,” said Jerrim. The Nuffield Foundation-funded research, published on Wednesday, comes less than a fortnight after the government announced a controversial £50m expansion fund for grammar schools that was seized upon by opponents of the policy. “How long can the government continue to ignore the evidence?” asked Melissa Benn, chair of the Comprehensive Future campaign group. “Will it now call a halt to its often sneaky plans for expansion of selective education?” Both Labour and the National Education Union said the study proved the money would be better spent elsewhere. “This is simply the latest evidence that the prime minister’s pet project of grammar school expansion will fail even on its own terms,” said Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary. A Department for Education spokesman said pupils from disadvantaged schools achieve better results in selective schools and 98% were rated good or outstanding. He added: “We want more children from all backgrounds to have access to a world-class education, which is why all selective schools applying for funding to expand must not only be good or outstanding, but must also make clear how they will increase their intake of disadvantaged pupils and work with local non-selective schools to improve outcomes for pupils of all backgrounds.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/25/air-pollution-online-wildlife-trade-and-puffins-in-peril-green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T14:12:51Z","webTitle":"Air pollution, online wildlife trade and puffins in peril – green news roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/25/air-pollution-online-wildlife-trade-and-puffins-in-peril-green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/25/air-pollution-online-wildlife-trade-and-puffins-in-peril-green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Air pollution, online wildlife trade and puffins in peril – green news roundup","bodyText":"Environment news Air pollution worse inside London classrooms than outside, study finds Fears puffins could die out on Farne Islands as numbers plummet ‘We can’t see a future’: group takes EU to court over climate change Hitting toughest climate target will save world $30tn in damages, analysis shows Scotland draft climate change bill sets 90%-by-2050 emission reduction target England at risk of water shortages due to overuse and leaks, report warns Revealed: majority of politicians on key EU farming panel have industry links Australia completes world’s largest cat-proof fence to protect endangered marsupials Illegal online sales of endangered wildlife rife in Europe Humans just 0.01% of all life but have destroyed 83% of wild mammals – study Shell investors revolt over pay and increase pressure over climate change UK’s new air pollution strategy ‘hugely disappointing’, says Labour In depth Rangers find 109,217 snares in a single park in Cambodia ‘They’re everywhere’: has the decline of the seal hunt saved the polar bear? ‘It’s wrong to stink up other people’s lives’: fighting the manure lagoons of North Carolina Trump administration plan to scrap hunting rules condemned as ‘new low’ Multimedia The week in wildlife – in pictures 12 conservation success stories - in pictures Great British Bee Count 2018 - in pictures And finally ...

Shop workers began returning to prepare and re-stock stores ready for the reopening. Some whooped and clapped as they were allowed to pass through the security cordon. Sharon Batstone, who works at B&amp;R Textiles, one of the shops closest to the bench where Skripal and his daughter were discovered unconscious, said: “It’s really exciting. Some of the workers in these shops have been frightened for their jobs. When you don’t know what’s happening it’s really worrying. It’s great for the whole of Salisbury that The Maltings is reopening.” The bench on which the Skripals were sitting before falling ill will not be replaced and ultimately some sort of memorial or public art work could be installed there. The council accepted that visitors were bound to take selfies at the spot but said it could think of no way of preventing this. Speaking at the park on the banks of the River Avon, Alistair Cunningham, the chair of the recovery coordination group, announced that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had handed the site back to the city after a painstaking process of testing, cleaning and re-testing to make sure there was no trace of the nerve agent novichok. He said: “We’re pleased to say the site is clean and remediation work is under way to bring it back into use.” The council added that grass would be cut, brickwork repaired and paintwork touched up, with the aim opening the site to the public by the bank holiday weekend. At the end of last week, it emerged that Sergei Skripal had been released from hospital. His daughter was discharged last month and a police officer, DS Nick Bailey, left hospital just over two weeks after the 4 March attack. Cunningham said the park’s opening was hugely important for the Salisbury’s recovery: “This is a city that is turning its back on the incident and looking forward. It is a real milestone in Salisbury returning to normal. It’s a great day. You walk around and life goes on, the city is bigger than the incident.” Cunningham insisted the site was completely safe, adding: “Testing, cleaning and re-cleaning has been carried out to make sure there is no chance of any materials being left at the site of a hazardous nature. There is no risk to public health: it is a simple message.” Decontamination work is continuing at other sites, including the Zizzi restaurant and the Mill pub, which the Skripals visited on the day they fell ill. Detectives are also carrying out investigative work at Sergei Skripal’s house. Wiltshire council is working on finding out how much the incident has cost the city. It said footfall has fallen 10% and “one or two” businesses in the Maltings had closed. The council considered installing a new bench with a collection pot for people to donate to charity but decided against the idea. Cunningham said it would be silly to try to stop people taking selfies on the spot. Defra confirmed that decontamination work was complete at the Maltings. A spokesperson said: “The site was visited by specialist teams and any items that may have harboured residual amounts of the agent were removed. All waste has been removed and will be disposed of safely.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/22/chinese-australian-billionaire-involved-in-un-bribery-case-mp-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T00:29:52Z","webTitle":"Chinese-Australian billionaire involved in UN bribery case, MP claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/chinese-australian-billionaire-involved-in-un-bribery-case-mp-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/22/chinese-australian-billionaire-involved-in-un-bribery-case-mp-claims","fields":{"headline":"Chinese-Australian billionaire involved in UN bribery case, MP claims","bodyText":"The chair of Australia’s intelligence and security committee has taken the extraordinary step of using parliamentary privilege to identify one of Australia’s biggest political donors of conspiring to bribe one of the United Nations’ top diplomats. Andrew Hastie used a speech in the parliament’s Federation Chamber to identify Chinese-Australian billionaire Chau Chak Wing, as “co-conspirator 3” in a 2015 American bribery case, which alleged John Ashe, the former president of the United Nations general assembly, had been paid to assist in the smooth progress of business deals. Hastie said he confirmed Chau’s identity while leading a delegation to the United States to discuss Australia’s foreign interference and espinage laws, as the chair of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee and believed it his “duty” to share what he had learnt. “During discussions with United States authorities I confirmed the long suspected identity of CC3,” he said. “It is now my duty to inform the house and the Australian people [that person] is Dr Chau Chak Wing. The same man who co-conspired to bribe the UN president of the general assembly, John Ashe. The same man with extensive contacts in the Chinese Communist party, including the United Front. “I share it with the House because I believe it to be in the national interest. My duty first and foremost is to the Australian people and the preservation to the ideals of the democratic traditions of our commonwealth.” Hastie’s explosive statements in the Federation Chamber comes at a time when the Turnbull government has been attempting to calm diplomatic tensions between Canberra and Beijing prompted by the Coalition’s foreign interference laws. With relations between Canberra and Beijing tense, the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, has travelled to China, and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, held a lengthy meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of the meeting of G20 foreign ministers in Argentina. Bishop characterised the bilateral discussion with Yi as “very warm and candid and constructive” and said she would shortly visit the Chinese capital. Her Chinese counterpart was cooler. In a translated press statement after the G20 talks, Wang acknowledged China-Australia relations had “encountered some difficulties”. He also urged Australia to adopt a more positive disposition towards Beijing. “If Australia sincerely hopes that the relations between the two countries will return to the right track … they must break away from traditional thinking, take off their coloured glasses, and look at China’s development from a positive angle,” Wang said. Hastie, a Western Australian conservative, told the chamber on Tuesday night he was naming Chau to ensure Australia’s democracy – and free press – could operate without interference. “CC3 is a Chinese-Australian citizen. He has also been a very significant donor to both of our major political parties,” he said. “He has given more than $4m since 2004. He has also donated $45m to universities in Australia. The Australian press has reported these matters and others and have been sued for defamation by CC3. “CC3 disputes a number of the reported allegations. “The merits of these defamation cases are appropriately left for a court. My concern is defamation cases can have a chilling effect on our free press. “Any attempt to silence our media from our telling the truth, provided it is the truth, through a defamation claim can not stand. “Our democracy only works if we have a free press which can publish information which serves the public interest. “We don’t always like what the press writes, but they are essential to a free and flourishing democracy. The Australian people deserve the truth.” Chau had been named as a suspect in the 2015 bribery allegation case previously, which he denied. Following a Four Corners report in December last year, which alleged Australian security agencies suspected Chau of having links to the Chinese Communist Party, Chau told the Australian he denied the claims, saying that he was “exploring options to defend by reputation and correct the record by laying the facts on the table”. “I have never been approached by, or spoken with anyone at Asio. Nobody has confirmed to me whether or not I was named in a confidential Asio brief to senior political officers,” he told the Australian. “Yet an ABC media report not only asserted this was the case, it contained several false and defamatory imputations that I have acted against Australia’s interests. “Nothing could be further from the truth and it is deeply distressing that wild and unsubstantiated claims could be made publicly in the absence of facts. “For the record, I have never been a member of the Chinese Communist Party and I have never been a member of an advisory group called the People’s Political Consultative Conference. “As to the entity referred to by the ABC as the ‘united front work department’, I have no idea what this is.” On Tuesday night, Chau’s lawyer, Mark O’Brien, told the Australian that Hastie had used parliamentary privilege to “slander” Chau ahead of the Fairfax defamation trial. “Dr Chau has brought these defamation proceedings to give his accusers the opportunity to prove their allegations in court,” O’Brien said. “If he was concerned about them, he would not have exposed himself to these proceedings.” O’Brien said Chau had been given a pseudonym by the FBI to protect his reputation because he was not a suspect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/23/lauryn-hill-uk-ireland-dates-miseducation-album","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Lauryn Hill marks 20 years of Miseducation album with arena tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/23/lauryn-hill-uk-ireland-dates-miseducation-album","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/23/lauryn-hill-uk-ireland-dates-miseducation-album","fields":{"headline":"Lauryn Hill marks 20 years of Miseducation album with arena tour","bodyText":"Lauryn Hill will mark the 20th anniversary of her classic album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill with five UK and Ireland arena dates in November and December. The rapper and soul singer came to fame in hip-hop trio the Fugees, scoring two UK No 1s in 1996 with Ready or Not and their cover of Killing Me Softly, before Hill went solo. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill remains her only studio album, but is widely regarded as one of the best of the 90s – its singles Doo Wop (That Thing) and Ex-Factor both reached the UK Top 5, with the former topping the US charts. On its release in the US, the album broke the record for first-week sales by a solo female artist, and was nominated for 10 Grammy awards, winning five, including album of the year. Hill continued to tour but later took herself out of the public eye, and was sentenced to three months in jail in 2013 for tax evasion. She returned with six well-regarded recordings for the Nina Simone documentary What Happened, Miss Simone? in 2015, and The Miseducation ... also continues to be highly regarded, with Ex-Factor being prominently sampled twice this year, on Drake’s chart-topping single Nice for What and Cardi B’s single Be Careful. Her 2014 tour of the UK was marred by bad reviews from critics and audiences. The Telegraph called the arrangements of Miseducation tracks “bafflingly obscure”. The UK dates follow a run of shows in the US, which begins on 5 July in Virginia Beach. Announcing that tour, Hill said: “This album chronicled an intimate piece of my young existence. It was the summation of most, if not all, of my most hopeful and positive emotions experienced to that date. I Loved and believed deeply in my community’s ability to both Love and heal itself provided it received the right amount of support and encouragement. Our world today, both complex and changing, is in need of the balance between moral fortitude and cathartic expression. I hope the Love and energy that permeated this work can continue to inspire change with Love and optimism at the helm.” The UK tour begins at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro on 23 November before heading to Manchester Arena (26 November), Birmingham Arena (27 November), Dublin’s 3Arena (30 November) and London’s O2 Arena (1 December)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/may/22/italy-giuseppe-conte-cv-new-york-university","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T11:55:21Z","webTitle":"Doubts raised over academic credentials of proposed Italian PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/italy-giuseppe-conte-cv-new-york-university","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/22/italy-giuseppe-conte-cv-new-york-university","fields":{"headline":"Doubts raised over academic credentials of proposed Italian PM","bodyText":"The nomination of Giuseppe Conte, a political newcomer, to serve as prime minister of the incoming populist government of Italy appears to be hanging in the balance after questions arose about whether he padded his academic résumé. The controversy over the nomination of Conte, a law professor who claimed on a résumé to have “refined” his jurist education at New York University, despite there being no record of him studying there, raises the possibility that Luigi Di Maio, the head of the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), could be back in contention to become Italy’s next premier. Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, the anti-immigrant head of the League, who have agreed a shared agenda and have been trying since elections on 4 March to create a government, agreed days ago to take themselves out of contention to lead Italy and had settled on Conte, a virtually unknown candidate, to serve as premier. The New York Times reported that NYU had no record of Conte ever attending the university as a student or as a professor, despite claims on his CV that he “refined” his studies there in 2008 and 2009. Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, who can confirm or reject the choice of Conte, is seeking more time to consider the nomination. The delay led to speculation in Italian newspapers that Mattarella might push for Di Maio to serve in the role. Mattarella has also expressed concerns over Di Maio and Salvini’s nomination of Paolo Savona, an 82-year-old Eurosceptic, to serve as finance minister. If Conte is dropped it would represent the first major defeat of the potential new government and would be likely to feed allegations by the two populist parties that efforts to bring about change are being hampered by the foreign press and by Italian institutions. As well as the NYU claim, Conte stated in his résumé that he had enhanced his legal studies at Yale University in New Haven, Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, the Sorbonne in Paris and Cambridge University in the UK. Citing confidentiality rules, Cambridge said it could not immediately confirm or deny whether Conte had attended the university. A university source later told Reuters they had not found any trace of a visit, but said the professor might have attended a course prepared by a third party. The International Kultur Institut in Vienna is also named on the résumé. Conte said he had worked on his legal studies there, but the Kultur Institut is a language school, according to an online profile. The M5S defended Conte on Tuesday and criticised the foreign and Italian press for suggesting he had lied about academic credentials he had never claimed he have. “Giuseppe Conte wrote with clarity that he perfected and updated his studies at New York University. But he did not cite courses or say he completed a master’s at the university,” it said in a statement. “Conte, like any scholar, has studied abroad, enriched his knowledge and perfected his legal English. For a professor of his level, the opposite would have been strange. He did it and rightly wrote it in the [CV], but paradoxically this is not good now and it even becomes a fault. It is the umpteenth confirmation that they [the press] are so afraid of this government of change.” It is not the only controversy to emerge about Conte. News reports have highlighted his involvement in a case involving a now discredited medical treatment invented by Davide Vannoni, a former professor who in 2015 was convicted of conspiracy and fraud for administering unproven stem cell treatments to patients at his Stamina Foundation. In 2013, Conte represented the parents of a child suffering from metachromatic leukodystrophy, a degenerative disease that leads to paralysis and blindness, in their fight to get their daughter access to the treatment. After he won the case, the child, Sofia De Barros, was treated with Vannoni’s Stamina method at a hospital in Brescia. She died in December 2017. The Italian government banned testing for the method in 2014 despite intense pressure from pro-Stamina activists, among them Beppe Grillo, the comedian who founded the Five Star Movement. The question now is whether the controversies over Conte will allow Di Maio – a politician the head of Italy’s biggest party – to become prime minister. Both he and Salvini were frequent critics of previous prime ministers such as Matteo Renzi who were not directly elected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14993","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T23:00:37Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,993","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14993","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14993","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,993","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/may/22/official-world-cup-song-to-feature-will-smith-nicky-jam-and-era-istrefi","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T10:32:38Z","webTitle":"Official World Cup song to feature Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/22/official-world-cup-song-to-feature-will-smith-nicky-jam-and-era-istrefi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/22/official-world-cup-song-to-feature-will-smith-nicky-jam-and-era-istrefi","fields":{"headline":"Official World Cup song to feature Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi","bodyText":"Will Smith is making a return to music, recording the official 2018 World Cup anthem with Colombia-based reggaeton star Nicky Jam, and Kosovar pop singer Era Istrefi. According to reports in Billboard and other publications, the track is to be released on 25 May, and is being produced by Diplo, the US producer behind hits with his group Major Lazer including Lean On and Cold Water. Alongside his burgeoning acting career in the late 1980s and 90s, Smith was a successful pop-rapper, first with DJ Jazzy Jeff and then as a solo artist. He had nine UK Top Five hits in all, including No 1s with Boom! Shake the Room and Men in Black. He hasn’t released an album since 2005’s Lost and Found, and a new track with Jazzy Jeff in 2017, Get Lit, was a flop. Nicky Jam, meanwhile, is one of Latin America’s biggest stars – his most recent single, X, has been streamed almost 800m times on YouTube, while previous hits like El Amante and El Perdón have over a billion each. Istrefi is a rising star whose track BonBon was a dance hit across Europe in 2016, and who has worked with rapper French Montana. The official World Cup song is usually performed at either the opening or closing ceremony. Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez performed We Are One (Ole Ola) at the 2014 opening ceremony, while Shakira’s Waka Waka (This Time for Africa) closed out the 2010 competition. As well as the official song each year, there is also an “anthem”, which have been performed in the past by the likes of Wyclef Jean, R Kelly and Vangelis. Unofficial tracks and promotional tie-ins include ones from Coca-Cola, who have had its own anthem for the last two competitions. This year it will be Colors by Jason Derulo and Maluma. Earlier this month, an FA spokesperson confirmed there would be no official song for the England team. Previous official songs include World in Motion by New Order in 1990, World at Your Feet by Embrace in 2006 and a rerecorded version of Take That’s Greatest Day in 2014. The most popular year for World Cup anthems in the UK remains 1998, with the official track – On Top of the World, performed by Ian McCulloch, the Spice Girls and others – reaching the Top 10, but getting overshadowed by unofficial tracks Vindaloo by Fat Les, which reached No 2, and Three Lions by Baddiel and Skinner, which topped the chart."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/22/football-transfer-rumours-robert-lewandowski-to-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T08:43:12Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Robert Lewandowski to Chelsea?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/22/football-transfer-rumours-robert-lewandowski-to-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/22/football-transfer-rumours-robert-lewandowski-to-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Robert Lewandowski to Chelsea?","bodyText":"Paris Saint-Germain are going to sign Gianluigi Buffon on a free transfer. The former Juventus goalkeeper is unlikely to have much to do during Ligue 1 games, so he’ll have plenty of time to think about all those nasty things he said about Michael Oliver. Or he can start preparing ways to insult Neymar, who has made it clear to the French champions that he wants to join Real Madrid. Chelsea want to sign Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski, who has actually turned out to be a bit underwhelming at the very highest level. He misses a lot of big chances, doesn’t he? Still, the Poland striker will probably put himself about a bit more than Álvaro Morata. And he won’t have to worry about Willian blotting his face out of team photos either. Willian, it seems, is set for an emotional reunion with José Mourinho at Manchester United. There is, of course, no manager quite as imaginative to Mourinho. His response to United’s FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea will be to banish Anthony Martial to Tottenham Hotspur for the crime of not being the finished article at the age of 22 and buy Toby Alderweireld, Gareth Bale, Fred, Jorginho, Alex Sandro and Jean-Michaël Seri. Daley Blind, Matteo Darmian and Luke Shaw will also be bundled towards the door marked Do One, while Marouane Fellaini is in talks with Milan about a free transfer. While United plot a £250m spending spree, Manchester City are already closing in on their first signing of the summer. It seems that Riyad Mahrez won’t have to go on strike this time. The Leicester City winger is finally set to join the Premier League champions. Tottenham will replace Alderweireld with Ajax’s Matthijs De Ligt. Chelsea are going to ditch Antonio Conte for Maurizio Sarri, enabling Napoli to hire Carlo Ancelotti. Wolves are eyeing Marseille’s Bouna Sarr and Cameroon’s Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Aston Villa are worried that John Terry is going to zoom off to China or the USA.

If you’d told me 10 years ago that I would one day be stepping up and speaking in public about liberalising abortion law in Ireland, I would have called you crazy. But all that changed on a warm autumn day in 2011. I was 20 weeks into my third pregnancy, and a little bit chuffed with myself. As an older mum (I was 35 when my first child was born), I was delighted to be on track to complete my three-child family shortly after turning 40, and that day I was looking forward to getting a first proper glimpse of my baby at the anomaly scan. But shortly after the sonographer started the scan, she went very quiet. Then she said: “I’m a little concerned – I can’t see the top of the baby’s head.” I’m a GP, so my medical brain took over as I tried to work out what she meant. It took a second but then the penny dropped. “Do you mean like anencephaly?” I heard myself say. “Oh, you’ve heard of it,” she said, with obvious relief. Relief that she didn’t need to explain that the top half of my baby’s head had never formed, that there was nothing above his eye level – no brain, no scalp, no skull, and that my baby would not survive outside the womb for long, if at all. In that moment my world was turned upside down. The future as I had planned it was gone. Wiped out in an instant. My husband hadn’t been able to attend the scan with me that day, so the consultant suggested we return to see him together to discuss what would happen next. Our options were to continue with the pregnancy and carry the baby to term, or travel abroad for a termination. I made my way across Dublin with my sister, who had been with me for the scan. The news was starting to sink in, and I realised I would have to let people know. My mother was texting to know how it had gone but I couldn’t answer her. I needed to let my husband know, but I couldn’t speak on the phone to him. I’d fill him in later, face to face. We stumbled through that weekend trying to get used to our new reality. But I very quickly realised how difficult daily life was going to be, carrying this news around with me. I could foresee the same conversations happening everywhere I went, the questions that every pregnant person has about due dates and whether or not you know what you’re having. What would I tell people? Would I play along and pretend everything was normal, or would I tell them we’d be having a funeral instead of a christening? How would I continue to work as a doctor after a conversation like that with every patient who noticed I was pregnant? The distress, the torture of retelling the awful truth or denying it completely: I’d be in bits. Day-to-day living would be intolerable. Faced with this reality, we decided to travel out of Ireland. We booked flights and accommodation, arranged childcare and took the lonely early-morning departure to Liverpool surrounded by businessmen and hen parties. It was surreal to be going through the greatest tragedy of our lives hidden in plain sight, hoping no one would ask us where we were going or why. Liverpool was a place I’d never been to. I had a picture in my head of a grey, industrial city, but Liverpool was the beacon of light in this story – a warm and vibrant place that took care of us. We went straight from the airport to Liverpool Women’s Hospital, where we were wrapped in a blanket of care and compassion. Everyone we met said they were so sorry we had to be there. They confirmed the diagnosis, talked us through what would happen over the following days, and then sat with us to discuss what we would like to do with our baby’s remains afterwards. I was given the first dose of medication and we then had 48 hours before we had to return to the hospital. We checked into our hotel and wandered around the old docks, dining out and shopping. I’d read it was a good idea to bring a hat for a baby with anencephaly so we bought one to cover my baby’s head. To the outside world, we must have looked like tourists enjoying the Indian summer weather, but we carried our dark secret in our hearts. We returned to the hospital on the Saturday, where I was admitted for a compassionate induction of labour, and late that night our little mite was delivered silent and still. We held him and named him TJ and, though we mourned the death of our son, there was a moment of peace as we sat there holding him. The cause of his death was clearly visible: we could see remnants of brain tissue and we knew we had made the right decision. And then we had to leave him behind and return home to our family; to pick up the pieces of our lives and move on. About three weeks later, a courier arrived at my front door with a Jiffy bag containing the cremated remains of my child. That’s how my baby came home to me. Time moved on and we began to heal. Good things happened in our lives again – we went on to have another baby. We are a happy family and we talk openly with our children about their brother TJ. But I feel scarred by a constitutional amendment that says I should be punished because I could not continue with my crisis pregnancy. It doesn’t need to be this hard for people. Travelling abroad for a termination doesn’t make you think any harder about your decision, it just traumatises you and diverts your energies away from what you should be focusing on: the death of your baby. On Friday 25 May, the people of Ireland will decide whether or not to remove from our constitution the amendment that means there is a near-total ban on abortion in the country. Introduced in 1983, the eighth amendment gives the unborn foetus the same protection as the life of the mother and makes legislating for abortion in cases like mine impossible. I know that for many voters this is a deeply difficult topic to think about, and something that they have not wanted to discuss openly. For many others, it is personal because they have been directly affected by its consequences, and I am one of the latter. I wish TJ could have been delivered in Ireland. I wish his brother and sister and grandparents had met him. I wish my mum had been there to give me a hug. But mostly I wish that no other family has to endure what we went through. We can help achieve that wish by voting yes to the repeal of the eighth amendment to the constitution. It is time we in Ireland brought compassion home. • Siobhán Donohue is a GP based in Dublin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/11/from-eastenders-to-broad-city-how-bisexuality-found-its-place-on-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T10:29:29Z","webTitle":"From EastEnders to Broad City: how bisexuality found its place on TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/11/from-eastenders-to-broad-city-how-bisexuality-found-its-place-on-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/11/from-eastenders-to-broad-city-how-bisexuality-found-its-place-on-tv","fields":{"headline":"From EastEnders to Broad City: how bisexuality found its place on TV","bodyText":"The bisexual community has always been, rather unfairly, a tad ignored. The B isn’t exactly the letter that jumps out at you in LGBT, especially now it is competing with a Q, an A, an I and a plus as part of LGBTQIA+. An entire Scrabble board of queer acronym. If not ignored entirely, bisexuals are often disparaged; painted by turns greedy, indecisive, confused or even predatory. But there has been one big boost to positive bi representation and visibility in the past few years – on the small screen. Gay characters and storylines came out a while ago. That lesbian kiss between Anna Friel and Nicola Stephenson on Brookside happened way back in 1994. Gay sex was depicted in Queer As Folk in the late 90s. Even in more conservative and religious America, gay characters were introduced decades ago, more commonly on cable television, but tentatively on network, too. There was Soap in 1977; Ellen, of course, in 1997 (although DeGeneres’s coming out resulted in a sharp ratings drop and eventual cancellation) and Will &amp; Grace after that. But for a long time, bisexuality has seemingly been deemed too baffling for audiences. Not any more. Current bisexual characters on hugely popular shows include: Piper from Orange Is the New Black; Ilana from Broad City; Darryl from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (and in the third season of Valencia, too); basically everyone in Transparent; Stella in The Fall; Petra and Adam in Jane the Virgin; Oberyn from Game of Thrones; Rosa in the just-rescued Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Annalise in How to Get Away With Murder. And – until Kevin Spacey’s fall last year – a bisexual president in the form of Frank in House of Cards. In fact, it’s almost as if most critically acclaimed shows currently feature a bisexual character, or at least one questioning their sexuality or taking on a same-sex partner for the first time. Although the less said about Netflix’s Gypsy, the better. There’s a number of reasons for this. One is the changing demographic of audiences, with younger people more likely to be sexually fluid and tolerant of others who are. A 2016 American study found a huge leap in those likely to have had same-sex relationships, and 49% of all adults and 63% of millennials were tolerant of LGBT+ relationships. In the UK, 23% of people reported to YouGov that their sexuality was something “other than straight”. It’s a trend that has been replicated in many places around the globe. A rise in queer and specifically bisexual celebrities has probably been a factor, too. Kristen Stewart, Cara Delevingne, Janelle Monae and a slew of YouTube stars have come out as bisexual. It also helps that there is greater queer talent behind the scenes. Orange Is the New Black writer Lauren Morelli left her husband for one of the show’s stars, Samira Wiley. Backstage queer talent in general has surged, with Lena Waithe (who is gay and was last seen wearing a rainbow cape at the Met Gala) becoming the first black woman to win a comedy writing Emmy and Transparent’s writers’ room full of queer writers. One of the original bisexual characters, Callie in Grey’s Anatomy, came about after the actor Sara Ramirez, who is bisexual, put her character forward when showrunner Shonda Rhimes mooted the idea of introducing a bisexual character. As Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and CEO of the media-monitoring organisation Glaad, told me recently: “When cast and writers’ rooms are diverse, everyone benefits. It’s crucial that when telling stories about people’s experiences, people who have lived those experiences are a big part of the creative process.” Of course, there have been representations of bisexuals on TV in years past, but they were often problematic. The most prominent example of bisexuality I remember as a teen was in The OC. Marissa had a brief flirtation with the bisexual Alex (Olivia Wilde, who has said she is bisexual in real life, and played another bisexual character in House). Alex and Marissa’s relationship seemingly lasted a single Tuesday evening spent snuggling on a sofa and ended two weeks later on a beach at sunset. It was a cruel false dawn, and also furthered the notion that queer girls have to wear short-sleeved T-shirts over long-sleeved shirts and have purple highlights. What was positive about Marissa and Alex’s relationship was that it didn’t seem to be a big deal. It is becoming more common for bisexual and queer characters across the spectrum to just exist without making a big song and dance about it. This is refreshing, because it doesn’t reduce characters to their orientation, and it means a character turning out to be that way inclined can be a nice surprise for queer fans. See Stella Gibson snogging Tanya in The Fall. Similarly, there was no big reveal about Archie Panjabi’s Kalinda in The Good Wife being bisexual, just her character casually pulling a female CIA agent, even though she was married to a man. But where it is important for a character’s development to show a discovery of sexuality, it has been handled well recently. Song and dance is Crazy Ex Girlfriend’s raison d’etre, and Darryl’s 80s-inspired number coming out as bisexual was a beauty. (“I’m a bi kind of guy! My oh my, it’s a fact I can’t deny!”) UK telly has a rich history of gay and, more recently, bisexual characters. Soaps in particular are particularly influential in changing national conversations, given their high viewing figures and place in the national psyche. It’s why Sonia Fowler’s bisexual turn on EastEnders is so important. Sonia’s first flirtation with women was back in 2005 when she kissed best friend, Naomi. The character is currently involved in a storyline that might see her reunited with her husband, Martin, but her character was once also involved with Tina Carter. Natalie Cassidy, who plays Sonia, has said of her character: “Sonia’s had a relationship with women before. But it’s not about lesbianism or being gay … she doesn’t want to put a label on it. She’s quite modern in that sense, but in layman’s terms we can call her bisexual.” Pal Aron, who played bisexual Sonny in Corrie in 2007, has talked of his character’s sexuality in a similarly understated fashion. “It’s about settling down with the person you love and at the moment that happens to be woman. He could be just as happy with either sex.” Hollyoaks, which has always pulled in a young audience, has often been praised for its LGBT+ characters. Bisexual characters in the past have included (male) Lockie, and there’s current character Grace Black. Buzzfeed TV editor Scott Bryan explains how important it is for solid LGBT+ representation on television. “When an LGBT character is written well, has complex and engaging storylines, viewers notice and value them years later,” he tells me. “Some people [talk about] characters years after they first appeared on television and how much it helped them understand the issues that they may or may not have been facing.” There’s still work to be done, of course. You might have noted that most current bisexual characters are cis women. You could argue that statistically this is because more women identify as sexually fluid, but it probably has a lot to do with the pull of two women kissing on television. But there are growing examples of successful bisexual male characters: Captain Jack in Torchwood, for example, or Felix in Battlestar Galactica. It’s pleasing, though, that people of colour are well represented among bisexual characters (on both sides of the Atlantic) with good examples being played by Panjabi, Ramirez and Viola Davis. Of course, as bisexuality and LGBT+ rights progress around the world, and as representation increases in other entertainment mediums (there’s a particular boom in film at the moment), we can only hope that bisexual characters, and other queer characters, go from strength to strength. And Anna Friel, that Brookside lesbian kiss pioneer? Currently starring as a lesbian financier in Amazon’s The Girlfriend Experience, which has bisexual characters galore."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/23/rspca-to-investigate-lincolnshire-farm-after-workers-filmed-kicking-pigs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T15:58:53Z","webTitle":"RSPCA to investigate Lincolnshire farm after 'workers filmed kicking pigs'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/23/rspca-to-investigate-lincolnshire-farm-after-workers-filmed-kicking-pigs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/23/rspca-to-investigate-lincolnshire-farm-after-workers-filmed-kicking-pigs","fields":{"headline":"RSPCA to investigate Lincolnshire farm after 'workers filmed kicking pigs'","bodyText":"The RSPCA has launched an investigation after the release of footage that appears to show farm workers brutally kicking and punching pigs at a farm in Lincolnshire. The footage, released on Wednesday by animal protection group Animal Equality, appears to show workers at Fir Tree farm repeatedly kicking pigs in their heads and stomachs, with more than 100 incidents recorded over 10 days. At one point two workers join together to kick a pig which screams loudly in pain. One worker prods pigs with the tines of a manure fork. At another moment in the footage a worker leaps into a pen to kick the animals inside. The campaigners say they received a tip-off about the conditions on the farm, and placed hidden cameras in the buildings where violence had been reported. The images they captured shocked hardened campaigners. “We’re used to seeing the everyday brutality of these places,” said Dr Toni Shephard, Animal Equality’s UK director. “But this sort of violence you really don’t often see. The workers show complete contempt for the animals in their care and seem immune to their suffering, even when the pigs scream in pain. We demand that they be brought to justice.” Shephard added: “Consumers can help end this cruelty by trying the increasing variety of plant-based foods available in shops and restaurants – which are often healthier than meat as well as cruelty-free.” According to some reports the workers responsible have now been sacked. The family that runs the farm said: “We are shocked by the actions of those involved as their abhorrent behaviour does not represent our business. We are a family-run farm where the care and welfare of our pigs is paramount. We have been able to identify the four individuals in the film and following an immediate investigation their employment has been terminated.” The RSPCA does not comment on individual cases, but stated: “Farm animals are sentient creatures who feel pleasure and fear. Like any animal they deserve to be treated with kindness, compassion and respect. We would like to reassure people we will always look into and, if necessary, investigate any complaints made to us about animal welfare.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/jun/04/what-is-depression-and-why-is-it-rising","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"What is depression and why is it rising?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/04/what-is-depression-and-why-is-it-rising","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jun/04/what-is-depression-and-why-is-it-rising","fields":{"headline":"What is depression and why is it rising?","bodyText":"What is depression? Depressed people don’t all shuffle around with a long face, or cry at any provocation. MentalHealth.gov, a US government website, defines it as “losing interest in important parts of life”. Symptoms include eating or sleeping too much or too little; pulling away from people and usual activities; having low or no energy; feeling numb or like nothing matters; feeling unusually confused, forgetful, on edge, angry, upset, worried or scared; and thinking of harming yourself or others. A visceral description is quoted by the UK campaign group Mind: “It starts as sadness, then I feel myself shutting down, becoming less capable of coping. Eventually, I just feel numb and empty.” Depression is also often mixed with other health problems: long-term illness, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder or schizophrenia, for example. The term dysthymia is also used for mild, long-term depression – usually lasting two years or more. How many people have depression? Clinical depression has surged to epidemic proportions in recent decades, from little-mentioned misery at the margins of society to a phenomenon that is rarely far from the news. It is widespread in classrooms and boardrooms, refugee camps and inner cities, farms and suburbs. At any one time it is estimated that more than 300 million people have depression – about 4% of the world’s population when the figures were published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015. Women are more likely to be depressed than men. Depression is the leading global disability, and unipolar (as opposed to bipolar) depression is the 10th leading cause of early death, it calculates. The link between suicide, the second leading cause of death for young people aged 15-29, and depression is clear, and around the world two people kill themselves every minute. While rates for depression and other common mental health conditions vary considerably, the US is the “most depressed” country in the world, followed closely by Colombia, Ukraine, the Netherlands and France. At the other end of the scale are Japan, Nigeria and China. Why are there such wide variations? The stark contrasts between countries have led some to dub depression as a “first world problem” or a “luxury”. The logic is that if you are staring down the barrel of a gun or you don’t know where the next meal is coming from, you have no time for such introspection. Recent research points to myriad reasons, many overlapping: in particular less developed countries often lack the infrastructure to collect data on depression, and are less likely to recognise it as an illness. Also, people in these countries are more likely to feel a social stigma against talking about how they feel, and are reluctant to ask for professional help. Statistics are also less simplistic than rich = depressed and poor = not depressed. A paper in the journal Plos Medicine argues that, extremes aside, the majority of countries have similar rates of depression. It also found that the most depressed regions are eastern Europe, and north Africa and the Middle East; and that, by country, the highest rate of years lost to disability for depression is in Afghanistan, and the lowest in Japan. What causes depression? Things have improved since people with mental illness were believed to be possessed by the devil and cast out of their communities, or hanged as witches. But there remains a widespread misunderstanding of the illness, particularly the persistent trope that people with depression should just “buck up”, or “get out more”. A contrasting opinion is provided by the psychiatrist Dr Tim Cantopher’s book Depressive Illness: The Curse of the Strong. He argues there is a part of the brain called the limbic system that acts like a thermostat, controlling various functions of the body – including mood – and restoring equilibrium after the normal ups and downs of life. The limbic system is a circuit of nerves, transmitting signals to each other via two chemicals, serotonin and noradrenalin, of which people with depression have a deficit. According to this description, depressive illness is predominantly a physical, not mental, illness. Cantopher says that, when under stress, weak or lazy people give in quickly; strong people keep going, redouble their efforts, fight any pressure to give up and so push the limbic system to breaking point. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this theory, as it is impossible to experiment on live brains. Other commonly agreed causes or triggers are past trauma or abuse; a genetic predisposition to depression, which may or may not be the same as a family history; life stresses, including financial problems or bereavement; chronic pain or illness; and taking drugs, including cannabis, ecstasy and heroin. The subject of much debate, there is a school of thought that severe stress or certain illnesses can trigger an excessive response from the immune system, causing inflammation in the brain, which in turn causes depression. Treatments The WHO estimates that fewer than half of people with depression are receiving treatment. Many more will be getting inadequate help, often focused on medication, with too little investment in talking therapies, which are regarded as a crucial ally. Among pharmacological treatments for depression, the most commonly prescribed antidepressants are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which reduce the absorption of serotonin, increasing overall levels. Another popular class of drugs is serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor (SNRIs), which work on both serotonin and noradrenaline. The most common talking therapy is cognitive behavioural therapy, which breaks down overwhelming problems into situations, thoughts, emotions, physical feelings and actions to try to break a cycle of negative thoughts. Other types are interpersonal therapy, behavioural activation, psychodynamic psychotherapy and couples therapy. All talking therapies can be used on their own, or with medication. Away from the medical approach, doctors can prescribe physical activity or arts therapy, while some patients opt for alternative or complementary therapies, most popularly St John’s Wort herbal pills, mindfulness and yoga. Trends While there are more and more treatments for depression, the problem is rising, not falling. From 2005-15, cases of depressive illness increased by nearly a fifth. People born after 1945 are 10 times more likely to have depression. This reflects both population growth and a proportional increase in the rate of depression among the most at-risk ages, the WHO said. Suicide rates, however, have declined globally, by about a quarter. In 1990, the rate was 14.55 per 100,000 people, in 2016 the rate was 11.16 per 100,000. A key reason for the continuing rise in depressive illness is that drugs do not necessarily “cure” the patient, and other therapies that can make the crucial difference are usually not in sufficient supply. Other reasons given for the continuing rise in depressive illness include an ageing population (60- to 74-year-olds are more likely to suffer than other age groups), and rising stress and isolation. What next? No new antidepressant drugs have been developed in the last 25 years, forcing psychiatrists to look elsewhere for help. There have been positive experiments with both ketamine and psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms. Further hopes for a new generation of treatments have been raised by recent discoveries of 44 gene variants that scientists believe raise the risk of depression. Another controversial area of research is treatment for low immunity and mooted links between depression and inflammation. Countries are increasingly recognising the need to train more psychologists to replace or complement drug treatments. And perhaps most importantly, there is a cultural movement to make it easier for people to ask for help and speak out about their illness. Some of the most visible leaders of this shift are the UK’s princes William and Harry, who set up the charity Heads Together and have talked publicly about their own problems. Others are celebrities; most recently the wrestler and actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has spoken about his depression, and the singer Mariah Carey has talked about having bipolar disorder.

A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed that more than 1,600 schools teaching tens of thousands of pupils had not been inspected for six years or more, and of those, almost 300 had not seen an Ofsted inspector for at least 10 years. The schools watchdog is legally required to re-inspect schools every five years, but those judged outstanding – many of which are grammar schools – are exempt from reinspection. Concerns have thus been raised about the continuing accuracy of the judgments on which many parents base their choice of school. It is the first time the NAO has investigated the schools inspectorate, and its report is highly critical in places, concluding that Ofsted cannot demonstrate that its inspection of schools represents value for money, and does not know whether its inspections are having the intended impact of raising education standards. According to the report, over the last four years, Ofsted failed to meet its statutory target to reinspect schools within five years in 43 cases. In each case Ofsted has offered an explanation. It also failed to meet its own target of reinspecting inadequate schools in 78 cases over the same period. The report, published on Thursday, shows time spent on inspections diminishing and periods between inspections extending. According to Ofsted’s own targets, good schools should be reinspected every three years, but in 2016/17 this period increased to four years. The maximum time for reinspection of schools graded as “requires improvement” – and therefore in need of closer attention – was extended from two years to 30 months, but 55 schools still waited longer. Ofsted also missed its target of inspecting new schools within two years of opening in 95 cases between 2012/14 and 2014/5, and extended the target to three years. The NAO acknowledged that as across much of the public sector, Ofsted has been subject to significant funding cuts in recent years, which have seen spending on school inspections down 52% in real terms over the last two decades despite increased responsibilities. As a result, the watchdog has switched from conducting in-depth, comprehensive inspections to a “snapshot” of standards, using a light-touch, risk-focused model of inspection. A good primary school, for example, will be inspected by a single inspector over a day. Resources are concentrated on underperforming schools, leaving high-achieving schools unchecked by routine inspection, as long as data shows that they are maintaining performance. “The length of time without inspection means that some pupils go through primary and/or secondary without an independent assessment of their school’s effectiveness,” the report states. “The older an inspection judgment, the greater the risk that it is no longer accurate. This reduces the level of assurance available about the school concerned.” Responding to the report, Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said the organisation was operating in a difficult financial environment. “This means that we have had to make tough decisions about how we prioritise resources. I am confident that Ofsted gets the balance right. For example, by focusing more resource on inspection of schools that are less than good. An increase in either the number of inspections or time spent on inspection will quite simply require greater funding. “Ofsted is only one lever in the school system, which is why it has proven difficult for the NAO to judge our impact and value for money. As we have made clear to the NAO, judging ourselves against school outcomes would inevitably create perverse incentives.” Ofsted has found it difficult to meet its targets in part because it lacks sufficient inspectors. Many have been poached by multi-academy trusts offering salaries in excess of £100,00 compared with the £70,000 an HMI will receive. The turnover of inspectors has improved, but is still high at 19% a year. Launching the report, the NAO head Amyas Morse acknowledged Ofsted’s strengths: “Ofsted’s role as an independent inspector is valued by parents, headteachers think its judgements are fair, and it is making headway against recent performance shortfalls. “However, it needs better information to be able to demonstrate that its inspection of schools represents value for money. The Department [for Education] needs to be mindful that cheaper inspection is not necessarily better inspection. To demonstrate its commitment, the department needs a clear vision for school inspection and to resource it accordingly.” An NAO survey found that three in 10 headteachers (28%) believed inspection had not led to improvements in their school, compared with 44% who thought it had. Seven out of 10 respondents said inspectors had provided useful feedback. Teachers’ leaders who have long criticised Ofsted welcomed the report as confirmation of their view that Ofsted was not fit for purpose and called on ministers to conduct a root and branch review of the system of holding schools to account. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The revelation that Ofsted does not know whether its school inspections are having the intended impact, to raise the standards of education and improve the quality of children and young peoples’ lives, is devastating.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We agree with the head of the NAO that cheaper inspection is not necessarily better inspection, and we support the recommendation for a review into whether Ofsted has the resources to do its job.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/17/why-dutch-bring-up-worlds-happiest-teenagers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T07:00:09Z","webTitle":"Why Dutch teenagers are among the happiest in the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/why-dutch-bring-up-worlds-happiest-teenagers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/why-dutch-bring-up-worlds-happiest-teenagers","fields":{"headline":"Why Dutch teenagers are among the happiest in the world","bodyText":"In a biology class at a secondary school near Rotterdam, Gerrit the skeleton is not the only one with a permanent grin. The Groen van Prinstererlyceum, which first trialled happiness lessons a decade ago, teaches some of the least troubled teens in the world. In report after report, the Netherlands tops OECD countries for high life satisfaction among its young people. It contrasts starkly with the picture in countries like Britain, where depression and anxiety are on the rise among teenagers, and the US, where the number of young people taking their own lives has risen sharply. So why is this flat, damp country of 17 million people with its history of Calvinism and colonialism so good at giving young people an optimistic outlook? Dr Simone de Roos, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), says life satisfaction among teenagers has not dropped since 2013. “I think Dutch children have generally positive interactions in all their social surroundings,” says De Roos. “They have a supportive environment at home, with friends and also at school. Dutch parents give a lot of support and have mild control. There’s an egalitarian climate, teachers are not authoritarian but accept the feelings of pupils, and pupils trust teachers.” The last Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, comparing children of 11, 13 and 15, showed a happy Dutch youth. When asked where they would be on “Cantril’s ladder” – with the worst possible life for them on 0 and their best at 10, about 94% of Dutch boys said six or above. Dutch girls were slightly lower, ranging from 84% to 92%. According to that report, young people in the Netherlands were also in the top five for eating breakfast on weekdays, watching more than two hours of weekday television, having kind and helpful classmates – and in the bottom five for being overweight, having sex before 15, and feeling pressure from schoolwork. They were less likely than average to experience bullying and generally found it easy to talk to parents. The results chime with a 2016 Dutch Statistics Office study of 4,000 people from 12 to 25, who ranked their happiness at 8.4 out of 10, and a PISA report in 2015 noting that the country – alongside Finland and Switzerland – seemed “able to combine good learning outcomes with highly satisfied students”. Of course, the general state of the nation helps. There is little unemployment in the Netherlands, relatively low inequality and a healthy economy. Five months ago the SCP compared the Netherlands favourably with 25 years ago, while another study showed people were more optimistic than last year. “At some point there’s a critical mass of optimistic voices, and then it gets its own dynamic,” says Prof Paul Dekker, the SCP programme leader in values and meaning. The director of the World Database of Happiness, Prof Ruut Veenhoven, also believes young people are less burdened by an expectation to “be good”. “If you look across Europe, the Dutch and the Danes are the most lenient and focus more on developing autonomy than giving priority to obedience – and that fits the society,” he says. “Children are more free to do what they want, and in doing what they want, develop an idea of what they really like and social skills. A happy boy may be sometimes not a very good boy.” In Dutch, there is no phrase that means literally “you are a good boy” or “good girl”, says 14-year-old Tjalling Appelhof, from Amsterdam. “You say ‘bravo, lad’ or ‘well done’ or ‘thank you’,” he says. Like most Dutch teenagers, he cycles to school and feels he has a good level of self-determination. “I can say how late I come home – not at 3am, I mean, but some time before bedtime!” he says. “I think I have enough freedom.” Despite the country’s reputation for cannabis smoking, the Trimbos Institute reports a downward trend for using alcohol and drugs and smoking in Dutch children aged 12 to 16. Such activities are described by HBSC experts as “risk behaviours” that impact happiness. Other negatives are bullying and fighting. At Groen van Prinstererlyceum, Dani Karremans, a 16-year-old majoring in sciences, believes such pressures are not extreme in the Netherlands. “If I compare things with other countries and especially other schools, you hear that people are bullied, often seriously,” he says. “Here, you don’t really see that. If people try to bully me, I just ignore it. I’ve got my own friends who I get on with. I don’t have a social ‘image’ or think that everyone has to like me – it’s not realistic.” Dani, whose mother is Indonesian and Polish and whose father is Moroccan, says his father spends more time on Facebook than he does. Saffron Jones, also 16, and majoring in social sciences, is half-English and half-Dutch. She says that from when her parents split up 11 years ago, her friendship group has always been supportive. “I could always stay with my friends at primary school. Now, if I’m stressed about school, mostly one of my friends is good in that subject, so I’ll call them and they help. It calms me down.” The HBSC data supports this: 86% of Dutch teenagers say their classmates are kind and helpful, putting the country top of the tables at 13 and 15. Sex education starts at four, and Saffron says her boyfriend is accepted by her friends and parents. Meanwhile a poster on her school’s wall encouraging people of all sexualities to “come out” reaffirms that openness is OK. The rate of teenage pregnancies in the Netherlands is also the lowest in the EU. The Dutch school system – almost entirely publicly funded – incorporates major exams at about the age of 12 and three levels of secondary education from practical to the most academic. But it is possible to progress from one to the other or repeat a year and, despite concerns about dropping standards and increasing segregation, such flexibility could make for less stress. Yara Agterhof, 17, from Vlaardingen, has just changed her subject focus. “I was a year ahead, [taking] physics, chemistry and biology,” she says. “I figured it was too hard for me and made a decision to go back. Now I have a different profile with the things I do actually enjoy. I don’t feel like I’ve lost a year and I think my parents feel: ‘As long as you’re happy, we’re happy.’” There are social problems such as differences between minority ethnic and native Dutch achievement, while one in nine children grows up in poverty. But Jacqueline Boerefijn, a biology teacher at the Groen van Prinstererlyceum, says even if a school wants to expel a child, it must find another school for them, so there are incentives to deal with issues. But Boerefijn, who developed happiness classes at the school a decade ago, and also gives positive psychology lessons to educators, is worried that Dutch children are under threat from new pressures around educational achievement. “Please stop putting the bar higher, because we have happy children,” she says. “We already have so many highly educated people, and at the moment there are not enough people to do the plumbing and carpentry jobs.” For Tjalling, it is pretty simple. “In the Netherlands we are rich, most things around children are well organised, like school and healthcare, and if people are poor, we try to help them. That’s maybe why children are happy. “It rains a lot. But you get used to it.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Snowy Hydro’s managing director and chief executive, Paul Broad, told a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday the project would perform better than any new coal plants, including those being pushed for by government backbenchers , because of the increasing market shift toward renewables. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “We will out-compete any new coal plant, no subsidies, no government guarantees, nothing,” he told the hearing. “We will out-compete them on price and reliability as the markets unfold.” Earlier this year Broad’s colleague and the Snowy Hydro chief operating officer, Roger Whitby, told an estimates hearings that adding new coal-fired power to the energy market would jeopardise the viability of Snowy 2.0. Broad himself told Sky News last December that just three new coal-fired power stations would be enough to undermine the economic case for the project. But under questioning from the Labor senator Kristina Keneally on Tuesday, Broad said he no longer stood by those remarks. “The price we’re getting for wind and solar has come down by an order of magnitude,” he said. “As the market moves, you’ve got to readjust your sights. “We think strongly that the move has happened to the point where the investment stands alone and that the economics for us with renewables now works.” He added that he thought the scheme could “out-compete a new HELE (high-efficiency, low-emissions) plant today.” Keneally asked if Broad was suggesting that a new coal-fired power plant would be economically unviable. “That’s what I’m suggesting,” he said. But Broad told the hearing that the viability of the 2.0 scheme still depended on more existing baseload power exiting the energy market. When the Liddell, Vales Point and Eraring power plants closed by 2030 and were replaced by renewables or gas, he said, the Snowy Hydro would be working at its capacity. “The amount of baseload that comes out of the market determines the viability or not of 2.0,” he said. Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said Broad’s comments showed it was inconsistent for the government to support Snowy 2.0 “but have a national energy guarantee whose emissions reduction ambition will result in no large-scale renewables built for the entirety of the 2020s”. “Mr Broad was clear that Snowy 2.0 only stacks up as we transition to ‘a world that’s different’ with a new clean, reliable and affordable renewable energy system,” Butler said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/22/thomas-is-just-fine-the-latest-gender-scare-is-mere-fabulism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T06:16:31Z","webTitle":"Thomas the Tank Engine is just fine.

The latest gender scare is mere fabulism","bodyText":"Thomas the Tank Engine is not facing decommission for being a boy train. No Victorian council library is planning to remove any children’s books from the shelves because of feminism. And an academic report suggesting that the development of limiting gender roles and damaging stereotypes are engendered in children from the age of three isn’t saying you can’t even call a girl a girl anymore. But just because these statements are true does not mean they’ve made the news. Truth was no influence over a press release authored by spokespeople of Victoria’s parliamentary Liberal party , in turn incited by some editorial fabulism in the Herald Sun. Both claimed some research (released in March) from the Australian National University was a nefarious scheme to ban “books that use the words ‘boy’ and ‘girl’”. No, Winnie the Pooh will not be “banned for not meeting gender tests”, as the Herald Sun reported and the shadow minister for families and children, Georgie Crozier, repeated, and shadow education minister, Tim Smith, bellowed after her. There isn’t even going to be a “gender test” – this is all nonsense beyond fantasy. Ah, but the Victorian Liberal party have never met a social issue they couldn’t chase down an alleyway to beat up. Their knuckles barely dry from last month’s bruising campaign for gay conversion therapy, they’re now giving this innocent ANU report a thorough walloping. I imagine the report in the cowering form of a pre-serum Captain America, insisting “but ... facts remain facts!” from a corner, even as Smith stomps on his head. A crowd of goons assemble to watch from tabloid papers, tabloid TV and fools on Facebook, their mouth’s a-lathering as they sniff at blood. Of course, fighting gender stereotyping is not about banning books. It’s about confronting how a bronze-age cultural insistence that all humanity conform to a mere two categories of pink-or-blue behaviour is not only still with us, but coercive, limiting and damaging our children. The report speaks to research that we’ve been accumulating for decades. Encouraging girls away from technical and construction-based “boys toys” – or interest in engines and trains – deprives them opportunities to refine useful skills in mathematics, measurement and spatial reasoning. Simultaneously, chastening boys from engaging with dolls, dress-ups and role play denies them improved development of – again, quite useful – emotional, communication and social skills. These are needless, arbitrary divisions which we impose on children for no reason beyond cultural superstitions that predate the invention of books. Yet we persist with these distinctions – at our cost – because of habit, because of outrage-mongering by opportunistic policymakers and because of bullying dimwits terrified they may yet be obliged by life to consider any numbers larger than two. What’s more, the gendering of toys and play is now worse than it was fifty years ago, with aggressive marketing to match. Let’s stop indulging other people’s prejudice and ancient propaganda and – here’s a radical idea – prioritise what’s best for the kids. The aim of the original report was to inform how to minimise distinctions on the basis of gender in order to build inclusive educational behaviours in children. That’s a good thing for them, and for the society they’ll be equipped with a greater diversity of skills to create. Overcoming the influence of stereotypes is about having conversations around books and other cultural material – including people’s attitudes. It’s to encourage children to think critically and come to evidence-based conclusions about the nature of reality, within a positive moral framework. This process enhances the capacity of children to process knowledge, develop problem-solving skills and mature into adults. Traditionally, we call it “education”. But education is irrelevant to the, um, Liberal education spokesperson in Victoria, who manages to demand in his press release that someone “step in and stop this ideological rubbish in our classrooms” in the very same paragraph he pledges to a curriculum review headed by his ideological comrade, Jennifer Buckingham. She’s presently employed by the conservative think tank, the Centre for Independent Studies. What a coincidence she was quoted alongside ... Tim Smith, of all people, in an Australian piece earlier this month, critical of David Gonski’s education review that encourages “collaboration and creativity” in children. They’re all right to be very afeard. You can see the dangerous consequences to which it leads, that kind of expansive thinking. Encouraging children to work together, use their imaginations, accommodate differences, fulfil their potential as independent thinkers and critically deconstruct the messages offered them will not prove terminal for Thomas the Tank Engine, or society. Yet how it must desperately threaten the conservatives, and their strategy of hollering out baloney when the facts fail to suit them.

At a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Tuesday, Peter Foley from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau outlined a possible theory – which he stressed was one of many – for the plane’s disappearance four years ago. The official explanation from the ATSB and Malaysian authorities is that the captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was unconscious when MH370 crashed into the Indian Ocean, resulting in a steep dive. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon But recent reports, including a one-hour special aired by Australia’s 60 Minutes, claimed Zaharie was conscious at the end of the flight, and deliberately piloted his plane in a “controlled ditching” into the sea. The program’s experts said Zaharie depressurised the plane to incapacitate passengers and other crew through hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), and used an emergency air supply to stay conscious. He then repressurised the plane for the rest of the journey. On Tuesday, Foley said this was “plausible”, but Zaharie himself would have been knocked out by the sudden pressure change. “Most of the people out there are speculating about a long period of depressurisation after the transponder went off,” he said. “[They say] this may have been as long as an hour. “What they fail to understand is that while you don an oxygen mask and prevent the worst of the hypoxia situation, you are flying an aircraft at 40,000 feet. You are taking an aircraft from sea level to Mt Kosciuszko in 20 minutes, then you are talking it, over the course of a couple of minutes, to the height of Mt Everest plus 1,000 feet. You’ll get decompression sickness too.” He said a similar situation happened to a cargo aircraft in 1994, documented by the US National Transportation Safety Board. “During the climbout the flight crew was unable to pressurise the aircraft, and the captain elected to proceed with the flight. The crew donned their oxygen masks and shortly thereafter the captain became incapacitated from decompression sickness. The first officer took command and they landed the plane.” He said this occurred “within several minutes”. “The pilot in this particular aircraft was 51 and overweight. The pilot in command of MH370 was 53 and overweight. I’m not saying that happened and I hate to speculate, but that is one plausible scenario.” However, senator Rex Patrick continued to press Foley on the possibility that the plane was in a controlled descent. “Today we have an analysis of the flap that tells us it is probably not deployed,” Foley said. “We have an analysis of the final two transmissions that say the aeroplane was in a high rate of descent. We have 30 pieces of debris, some from inside the fuselage, that says there was significant energy at impact ... We have quite a lot of evidence to support no control at the end.” He added that the ATSB had spoken to experts who supported the controlled descent theory, including former Boeing 777 instructor Simon Hardy. “Some of Simon’s initial area where he was postulating it was controlled to the end, but not a ditching – we actually searched. We went a long way to the east in that search – 42 miles. “We certainly listened very carefully to what Simon had to say. We certainly read the articles in The Australian where [another pilot] Byron Bailey said ‘Clearly the pilot has done this ... He must have been in control at the end.’ But it wasn’t substantiated. “We haven’t ever ruled out someone intervening at the end. It’s unlikely.” Foley has been the ATSB’s director of the search for MH370 for the last four years. He also told the committee he believed Zaharie, or someone else, was in control of the plane for at least the first one and a half hours of its flight. “Early in the flight an aircraft doesn’t turn itself,” he said. “There must have been someone in control of the aircraft up until 18:25 (UTC).”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/23/newstart-recipients-left-with-just-17-a-day-after-housing-expenses-research-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"Newstart recipients left with just $17 a day after housing expenses, research finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/23/newstart-recipients-left-with-just-17-a-day-after-housing-expenses-research-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/23/newstart-recipients-left-with-just-17-a-day-after-housing-expenses-research-finds","fields":{"headline":"Newstart recipients left with just $17 a day after housing expenses, research finds","bodyText":"There is a small public car park on the northern banks of the Hawkesbury, near where the river swallows Mooney Mooney creek. To most, the car park is an unremarkable blip on the busy thoroughfare out of Sydney. To Jane, who does not wish to have her last name published, it was home during her darkest hours. Driven into homelessness by family violence, the single mother spent the past year living in her father’s old caravan. Her social security payment, though, could not stretch to meet a fortnight’s campground fees and the basic costs of living. When the money inevitably ran dry, Jane would steer herself into the car park, arriving late and leaving early to avoid detection. “I used to call it ‘Riverview’,” Jane said. “It’s a constant stress … how do you have the sanity to walk into a job interview and be positive when you’re constantly thinking, ‘Tonight, where am I staying?’” Jane is one of many for whom Newstart and similar-level payments are inadequate. New research, released on Wednesday by the Salvation Army, shows that the average Newstart recipient is left with just $17 a day after accommodation expenses. The finding was one of the starkest to emerge from the Salvos’ 2018 economic and social impact survey, which examined the financial situation of 1,267 people accessing the charity’s services. It has prompted the Salvation Army to call for Newstart to be lifted, which the Coalition failed to do in this month’s budget. “It is simply inhumane that corporations and wealthy households are handed a tax cut, while the most disadvantaged and marginalised people in this country continue to be ignored,” Salvation Army major Paul Moulds said. “It is widely acknowledged it will take a minimum increase of $75 a week just to ensure people can live on the poverty line – let alone above it.” The survey also found 81% of those who were renting or paying a mortgage live in extreme housing stress, using more than half their income towards housing. About half said finding a job or being accepted into education was their greatest challenge day-to-day. Two in five households with children were unable to afford either three meals a day, fresh fruit/vegetables every day, or a single meal with meat, chicken or a vegetable equivalent. Roughly one-quarter of the respondents had moved house within the past year due to family violence. When Jane left her husband, she found herself confronted by a system that appeared to be stacked against her. She had to represent herself in court proceedings. Her switch from Newstart to Austudy has precluded her from early access to superannuation, despite her hardship, which should entitle her. “It left me with a huge gap and the only place I could live was in a caravan park,” she said. Despite extensive higher education and experience as a business management consultant, she has found it hard to get back into the job market. Age is a barrier, as is her time away from the industry, which has changed in the years since she was last in work. Jane has now obtained more secure housing, with the help of the Salvation Army and the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services. She is studying law in a bid to update her skills and find a way back into employment. Her experience has proved to her one thing about Newstart-level payments. “No one can survive on that money.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/22/banking-royal-commission-westpac-executive-admits-flaws-in-loan-process","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T07:13:28Z","webTitle":"Banking royal commission: Westpac executive admits flaws in loan process","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/22/banking-royal-commission-westpac-executive-admits-flaws-in-loan-process","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/22/banking-royal-commission-westpac-executive-admits-flaws-in-loan-process","fields":{"headline":"Banking royal commission: Westpac executive admits flaws in loan process","bodyText":"A Westpac executive has told the banking royal commission it is “not uncommon” for Westpac employees to fill out loan documents on clients’ behalf after questions were raised about a staffer falsely witnessing a document. The revelation comes after Westpac admitted to falsely witnessing and pre-filling a form of acknowledgement, before allowing an elderly pensioner to become guarantor for her daughter’s loan, and then making a claim on the home after the daughter’s business failed. The royal commission heard evidence for the second day on Tuesday about the case of Carolyn Flanagan, an elderly pensioner who is legally blind and has trouble hearing, who has suffered from nasopharyngeal cancer, depression, osteoporosis and pancreatitis. It heard Westpac allowed Flanagan to become guarantor for her daughter’s $165,000 business loan in 2010, before making a claim against her home when her daughter’s business failed two years later. After negotiations with Legal Aid, Westpac allowed Flanagan to stay in her home until she dies. But if Flanagan needs to leave her home for health reasons, or to sell it to fund aged care, she will first have to pay Westpac $170,000 from its sale. Alastair Welsh, Westpac’s general manager for commercial banking, admitted to the royal commission on Tuesday that documents allowing Flanagan to become guarantor for her daughter’s loan had been filled out incorrectly by Westpac staff. That included falsely witnessing a document and marking documents to suggest Flanagan had received independent legal advice about her business lending agreement when she had not received that advice. He also said Westpac staff did not look too closely at Flanagan’s sources of income because it knew if the lending agreement failed her house could be sold to recoup the loan. Michael Hodge, senior counsel assisting, asked Welsh why Westpac would falsely mark a document saying Flanagan had received legal and financial advice about her loan when it knew she had not. Welsh said the bank understood Flanagan would be seeking advice from a lawyer a few days after meeting with a bank, so it marked a document to say she had seen the lawyer in anticipation of it happening. “It’s not uncommon for these to be filled out in anticipation of something happening, so in anticipation that she was going to go and see a lawyer,” he said. Hodge replied: “Let me make sure I’ve understood the position that you’re presenting, which is that you find nothing surprising, nothing inconsistent with Westpac’s policies, writing ‘yes’ in advance to the question ‘you got that advice’, past tense?” Welsh said: “That is often the practice ... to help [customers] fill the form, yes.” After a small pause, Welsh then amended his statement. “Sorry, not often, I don’t know that. That’s an opinion,” he said. “It could be the practice at this point in time. It’s not fair to say it’s often, because I can’t know that.” Hodge also asked Welsh why a Westpac staffer, Fletcher, had filled out the document and pre-signed as a witness without having seen Flanagan sign it. He told the commission Fletcher signed as a witness on 8 December, 2010, but Flanagan didn’t sign the document until 10 December when she was in the presence of a lawyer. Welsh agreed that Fletcher had pre-signed as a witness, but he claimed she had done so incorrectly. He couldn’t provide evidence to back his claim. Hodge said: “Westpac believes that Ms Fletcher signed as the witness without having seen Ms Flanagan sign the document, is that right? Welsh replied: “Yes.” Hodge said: “So Ms Fletcher on the 8th December signed this document as the witness without having seen Ms Flanagan sign the document?” Welsh said: “She signed and crossed it out, yes.” Hodge asked: “Did she sign and cross it out or did the solicitor cross it out? Welsh said: “Hmm. I don’t know.” Hodge said: “Is it normal practice within Westpac for bankers to helpfully pre-witness signatures that they haven’t seen done? Welsh replied: “Not at all. Hodge said: “In this case the banker has pre-signed as the witness without, on your view, having seen the guarantor sign the document. Welsh replied: “Well in my view, she did this in error and crossed it out. Hodge said: “Or the solicitor crossed it out. You don’t know. Welsh answered: “No, I don’t know.” Hodge told the royal commission that if Flanagan needed to move out of her home and sell it, Westpac would take $170,000 from the sale plus 3% per year accruing. Hodge said: “So if, for example, she needs to, for health reasons, move into some other environment, she couldn’t sell her home to fund that without first having to ... pay out Westpac?” Welsh replied: “That’s correct.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/25/it-stops-with-me-isaiah-dawes-mentoring-plan-for-the-foster-kids-of-the-future","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T18:00:26Z","webTitle":"'It stops with me': Isaiah Dawe's mentoring plan for the foster kids of the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/25/it-stops-with-me-isaiah-dawes-mentoring-plan-for-the-foster-kids-of-the-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/25/it-stops-with-me-isaiah-dawes-mentoring-plan-for-the-foster-kids-of-the-future","fields":{"headline":"'It stops with me': Isaiah Dawe's mentoring plan for the foster kids of the future","bodyText":"A family court judge once told Isaiah Dawe that foster children usually experience 10 different placements during their time in “care”. Isaiah found that shocking, because he’d been through 17. Isaiah is a Butchulla and Garawa saltwater Murri man. He was taken into the child protection system at just two months old and came out when he turned 18. He was separated from his older sister when he was five and she was placed in Queensland. For Isaiah and his little sister, childhood was tough. Isaiah lists all the places they were sent as children: Fairfield, Green Valley, Liverpool, Campbelltown, Griffith, Yass, Goulburn ... now, at 23 years old, he’s had 35 different addresses. “Growing up in care, a lot of it was abusive: physical, emotional, sexual and mentally straining as well,” he says. “There were many times my younger sister and I would come home and be physically abused, racially abused: the colour of our skin was considered dirty. “It became normalised. Being hit over the face, being held at knifepoint by the carers, all sorts of things happened that no child should be forced to experience.” Isaiah says he used to run away about once a week and the police would bring him back. “The only reason I would come back was because I didn’t want to be taken from my sister. She was the only family I had. “The majority of my carers were non-Indigenous and that’s where I copped the majority of the abuse. Child protection? It wasn’t child protection at all.” Isaiah is determined to put his negative experiences to good use, to help the thousands of other young Aboriginal people still in the out-of-home-care system. “At the end of the day, a young person needs to feel they belong, have a purpose, and find empowerment, especially when it comes to foster children. They’re taken away from those who brought them into the world. They’re vulnerable and easily manipulated and pressured into wrongdoing.” Isaiah has developed a mentoring program, ID Know Yourself, which he hopes will be supported by the New South Wales government. It’s focused on culture and identity, life after care, education, health, life skills: preparing young Aboriginal people for the time after foster care when they have to fend for themselves. Isaiah wants to help them flourish, not just survive. The difference with Isaiah’s mentoring program is that it’s designed and delivered by Aboriginal people who have been through out-of-home care and can offer empathy. “Unfortunately you don’t hear too many success stories of Aboriginal kids in foster care, do you? I don’t know many at all. So there’s got to be mentoring guidance programs meeting with young people face-to-face in a culturally appropriate space. And I would love to see prevention programs that assist families before young people are being taken, when the family first comes on their radar.” He wants to break the cycle of intergenerational trauma. “My grandmother was a member of the stolen generation, my mother was in foster care, my sisters, some of my nephews and nieces, my younger brother is in foster care. “It’s intergenerational. But it stops with me. There’s got to be people leading the way and my program is a solution to that problem, and I can’t wait to roll it out.” Isaiah seized an opportunity to go to boarding school to complete the HSC. “I lived at the school and went to stay with friends during the holidays. I used to make up lies and say my family was overseas when really I just didn’t have anyone. I was ashamed of telling the truth of my situation. “But I found out my story doesn’t make me weaker, it makes me stronger and more resilient for the future. The negative experiences I had were character building, they didn’t define who I was as an individual. “It made me more empowered to give back to those who are currently going through the system. I realised over the years I needed to share my story with as many people as I can to give them hope and that it doesn’t matter where you come from, you can choose your destination. You just have to work for it, and make sure you have the right supports in place to stay strong. “I knew I had a responsibility as an Aboriginal person to leave positive footprints for future generations to follow in and I knew that walking through my footsteps in foster care I could lead the path for these young fullas currently going through it. “People always ask me, what did success mean to me growing up? Success to me was literally being alive at 18 and not being in the criminal justice system, being 18 and not being locked up. The things I’ve seen and had to go through, I’m very lucky I’m even here. “I never had any mentoring or support, and I knew first-hand that’s what is needed, so those who are currently going through the system are not be left behind or forgotten.” Support our independent journalism by making a one-off or monthly contribution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/26/after-the-apology-to-the-stolen-generations-a-photo-essay","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T22:49:18Z","webTitle":"After the apology to the stolen generations – a photo essay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/26/after-the-apology-to-the-stolen-generations-a-photo-essay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/26/after-the-apology-to-the-stolen-generations-a-photo-essay","fields":{"headline":"After the apology to the stolen generations – a photo essay","bodyText":"Due to parliamentary policies throughout much of the 20th century in Australia, numerous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were forcibly removed from their family homes and placed in institutions and foster families. The goal was to create a racially assimilated “white Australia”. The discriminatory policies that existed throughout these years gave the Australian government permission to forcibly remove these children and place them into non-Indigenous families and institutions. They had no contact with their own families, language, culture, belief system or heritage. From the age of about 14, many of these children were sent to work in white households. Susan Moylan-Coombs was born in Darwin and taken from her mother at birth Ten years ago the then Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, made an official apology to all Indigenous Australians, and in particular to the stolen generations, for past governments’ mistreatment and wrongdoings to Australian’s Indigenous populations, and the “profound grief, suffering and loss” that was caused by the forcible removal of these children. Jennifer Moylan, daughter of Susan I didn’t understand why people at school started to say horrible things about me and Mum – Jennifer Moylan This photographic series explores the effect of the Australian government’s apology on Indigenous Australians, both the stolen generations and also those who were indirectly affected by the policies of the past. The images tell the story of women who have been marked by historical injustice but who have worked towards a point of healing. The images are a mix of landscapes and portraits – the landscapes speak of memory and attachment to place, while the portraits explore identity, grief, loss and reconciliation. Top: Yeena Connelly, Orient Point. Yeena recounted in vivid detail the stories of children being removed with force from the mission where she grew up; Middle: Patricia Ellis, south coast. Patricia’s sister is a member of the stolen generations; Bottom: Caroline Glass-Pattison, Freshwater beach. Caroline’s mother, grandmother and sister were all stolen as children and placed in other the care of the state or in foster homes The apology didn’t change much, the only way to make real change is through education – Patricia Ellis My mother, grandmother and sister were all [of the ] stolen generations. I miss their presence and their whispers of knowledge gently steering me on the right wave – Caroline Glass-Pattison The series focuses on women, in order to highlight the voices of those often less heard. These women are bound together by the fact that they have been marked by the racial policies of the past, although they all have a diverse relationships to the history of the stolen generations. Not all were themselves removed from their families; some were present as other children were taken from their communities, and others are children or relatives of those removed. Lorraine McGee-Sippel. Lorraine was taken away from her Aboriginal mother at birth and adopted out to a white couple who could not have children The stories depicted are reflective of the fact that almost all Indigenous Australians have been affected by the racist policies of the past in some way, in particular the forced removal of children. As Jasmine, one of the young women who participated in the project, says: “Because of what happened, I’m afraid the same thing will happen to my own child.” Jasmine has no reason to be fearful of her child being taken from her, yet such is the depth and pain of the past that this fear lives on in many people from the younger generations. History has a way of repeating itself … I knew other people who were stolen. Now I’m afraid that the same thing could happen to my own child – Jasmine Atkinson-Haby The prominent anthropologist WEH Stanner has written of the culture “of disremembering” that has occurred throughout the history of Australia. Stanner stated in his famous lectures for the ABC: “In Australia we have shown … a view from a window which has been carefully placed to exclude a whole quadrant of the landscape.” Stanner went on to say that we have continued to honour what he called “The Great Australian Silence”, which was not only a silence on the telling of an alternative history, but also a silencing of Indigenous voices as well. This photographic series was made as a way of remembering, acknowledging and honouring some of those voices that have been silent in the past. And by remembering the past we give a space and a platform to the voices and stories of the present. I continue to walk two worlds. I dream of a day that we, as First Peoples, only need to walk one.

Smith told parliament on Thursday the contests – which loom as major electoral tests for Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten – would need to happen late in July to allow electoral officials to issue new regulations ensuring that candidates comply with their constitutional requirements under section 44, and because of the scheduling of school holidays in the relevant states. Labor, blindsided by the decision, expressed its objections immediately to the proposed timeframe, and signalled it might shelve its national conference, which is currently scheduled for 26-28 July in Adelaide. The ALP’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, branded the decision “a disgraceful delay and a sneaky tactic from Malcolm Turnbull”. “It would appear this has been deliberately designed to disadvantage the Labor party, given our national conference is scheduled for that weekend,” she said. “This will obviously have implications for our national conference. “Our activists will want to be out in the community campaigning for Labor, not sitting in a conference centre.” The outrage from the opposition flowed into a Senate estimates hearing, where officials from the Australian Electoral Commission were called to account for advice they had given the Speaker prompting Thursday’s decision. Labor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, told the electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers, that he had given the Turnbull government “cover” for a politically advantageous decision, which had the effect of depleting the ALP’s numbers in the lower house for two months and creating a scheduling collision with the national conference. The electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers, objected to the line of questioning, and went toe-to-toe with Wong in the hearing. “Are you saying I’m partisan?” Rogers asked Wong. “I’m saying it looks partisan,” Wong replied. Rogers declared the electoral commission should not be “fingered” when parliamentarians had created the underlying mess that triggered the byelections. The commissioner noted MPs had created the dual citizenship fiasco by failing to comply with the constitutional requirements to sit in parliament. “Several members of the House have resigned, resigned as a result of failing to follow procedures, and now somehow the AEC is being fingered as being responsible for the outcomes of this?” a visibly irritated Rogers said. Smith told parliament shortly after question time he was inclined to issue the writs for 28 July because the AEC had told him it would need two weeks to implement new administrative procedures candidates need to follow to ensure compliance with section 44, and because election contests in school holidays “created additional difficulties for voters, and risk disenfranchisement and low turnout”. The byelection contests will take place in Longman, Braddon, Mayo, Fremantle and Perth. Rogers acknowledged in the estimates committee the recent byelection in Bennelong had taken place during the school holidays. He said the AEC was ready and willing to hold the byelections during school holidays, but the decision was ultimately up to the Speaker. Rogers said he had provided advice to Smith about “factors” relevant to the conduct of the byelection contests, with some options for dates supplied. “I provided an optimal date ... but I’ve made clear in the advice we are prepared to run elections on any date.” Wong was chided repeatedly by the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, for questioning the independence of Rogers. “You are badgering the witness and badgering a statutory independent officer. “Senator Wong, he is not a partisan actor ... Quite frankly it is Bill Shorten and the Labor party responsible for the delay in these elections.” Labor’s Senate leader said she was not badgering the witness, she was giving him an opportunity to explain a highly controversial decision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/24/king-island-birds-face-extinction-without-urgent-federal-help-residents-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"King Island birds face extinction without urgent federal help, residents say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/24/king-island-birds-face-extinction-without-urgent-federal-help-residents-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/24/king-island-birds-face-extinction-without-urgent-federal-help-residents-say","fields":{"headline":"King Island birds face extinction without urgent federal help, residents say","bodyText":"Residents of King Island in Tasmania want the federal government to intervene to try to stop two bird species from going extinct. The King Island brown thornbill and the King Island scrubtit were recently identified as numbers one and three on a list of Australian bird species most likely to go extinct in the next 20 years if nothing was done. Volunteers with the island’s natural resource management group, with help from Birdlife, applied for federal funding last year but were unsuccessful. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon It is unclear how many endangered thornbills are on the island because they are difficult to detect. They were last seen by volunteers in 2015. The most recent scientific monitoring of the scrubtit put its numbers at fewer than 50 and found major threats were habitat destruction, fire and poor fire management, and acid run-off in forest soils. The small King Island community has been trying for years to get state and federal governments to help the little brown birds and warn that without emergency help the species could go the way of the bramble cay melomys, a mammal species that went extinct because officials were too late to act. “Neither the state nor the federal government has ever put up their hand to help these birds,” said Kate Ravich, from the King Island bird monitoring group Wings on King. “Unless we get into gear now we might lose them. We may have lost them already. We need funding and we need to get people on to the island now who can start monitoring and then decide what we can do about them.” The King Island story is a case study in Australia’s track record of managing threatened species. Community groups say that too often the survival of species is left to volunteer groups with no government funding, relying on donations. Volunteers working with the Mary River turtle, which received global attention recently, are in a similar position. In Senate estimates hearings this week, the Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked environment and energy department officials what was being done to save the King Island birds and whether the department knew whether or not the birds still existed. Officials said they would have to check what monitoring had been done. “Is your threatened species strategy flexible enough to respond to emergencies if they should occur?” Whish-Wilson asked. The government’s threatened species commissioner, Sally Box, told the hearing the department would contact the Tasmanian government to see if emergency intervention was required. The birds do not have species-specific recovery plans but are covered by the government’s King Island biodiversity management plan. Officials did not outline what, if any actions, had been taken. Guardian Australia asked the department when it had last monitored the thornbill or scrubtit and whether it believed emergency assistance was needed. Box said she wanted to protect “these precious little birds” and had contacted the Tasmanian government, the King Island community and the national environmental science program about establishing a recovery team. Matt Webb, a conservation biologist at ANU’s Fenner school of environment and society, has written reports on the scrubtit and said both bird species needed long- term investment to survive. “It can’t just be small amounts of money for short periods of time,” he said. “It requires significant investment and long term commitment to secure the future of the species.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/26/sussan-ley-stands-firm-against-live-sheep-trade-despite-turnbull-rebuke","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T23:54:20Z","webTitle":"Sussan Ley stands firm against live sheep trade despite Turnbull rebuke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/26/sussan-ley-stands-firm-against-live-sheep-trade-despite-turnbull-rebuke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/26/sussan-ley-stands-firm-against-live-sheep-trade-despite-turnbull-rebuke","fields":{"headline":"Sussan Ley stands firm against live sheep trade despite Turnbull rebuke","bodyText":"Sussan Ley can certainly see the irony. In the past, the member for Farrer has been a vocal supporter of the live sheep trade: “I was right on the front foot saying keep this trade going, and I ran all the arguments that are now coming back to me.” She laughs lightly: “Every single one of them.” But Ley, a Liberal representing a rural New South Wales constituency, has reached the point where she has lost all confidence in the regulatory regime and can no longer support an industry with “an operating model built on the suffering of animals”. She says the rules don’t work, because if the rules were enforced the trade would not be economically viable. “I think this trade in sheep is a shame and a stain on our international reputation,” she tells Guardian Australia’s political podcast. The parliamentarian who resigned her frontbench position as health minister over an expenses controversy in early 2017 has perhaps learned something about windows of opportunity in politics being finite. She is fixed on her current objective, and approaching the suasion effort with implacable determination. Sign up to receive the latest news in Australian politics every weekday This week Ley brought forward a private member’s bill banning live sheep exports in the northern summer from next year. Under the proposal, supported by fellow Liberals Jason Wood and Sarah Henderson, the transport of sheep and lambs to the Middle East or to any routes through the Persian Gulf or Red Sea would be banned within five years. As well as the animal welfare arguments, Ley is firmly of the view that the trade is harming the international reputation of the meat industry. She insists she is attempting to defend the long-term interests of Australian farmers, not shut down their livelihoods. For her pains she was rebuked by Malcolm Turnbull in the Coalition party room meeting on Tuesday for failing to follow due process. The rebuke annoyed a number of Ley’s colleagues, some of whom bristle when the National party tail wags the Liberal party dog. Several Liberal MPs spoke during the meeting in favour of transitioning out of the live sheep trade, and made the case that the public backlash, after a litany of animal welfare scandals, was coming from their own supporters not inner-city Greens. Even some supporters of the trade referenced a deluge of negative constituent correspondence. Ley counters her prime ministerial rebuke by pointing out that Turnbull and the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, left her no option other than taking her legislation to the floor. She’s sanguine about the events of the week, albeit through slightly gritted teeth: “The prime minister and I have been friends for a long time, and while there may have been difficult parts to that friendship, I’m sure it will continue.” She’s had constructive dialogue with Littleproud, she says, but the Nationals MP is intent on preserving the live trade over the northern summer, which she insists is unconscionable. Their positions are consequently irreconcilable. “When there were statements made by the leadership we were not going to look at a phase out, then my only course of action was to argue for the phase out,” she says. Ley isn’t looking to cross the floor. She is looking to persuade enough Liberal colleagues to support the phase out as official policy. But she’s also not ruling out breaking ranks if that’s what it takes. That is absolutely on the table. “I would never say I would never cross the floor,” she says. “I have given a commitment at this point in time not to cross the floor and the reasons for that are very simple: I want this to be Liberal party policy. I don’t want to align my views with Labor and give Labor a win on this. “There’s a lot of grandstanding in this building but the hard yards are what happens out of the public eye, so now it’s up to us, my colleagues and I who believe in this, to push for the next step, which is for the bill to be debated. “It should be debated. It’s a really powerful topic for many people and it’s an important topic for Australia. I think it should be debated and everybody vote according to how they feel. “I’m not calling it a conscience vote, but [at the point the debate comes on] I believe we will see the parliament at its best, as we have with the gay marriage debate and with other issues I’ve seen over the years.” She says emotion is powerful, and sways people, but she believes the only way she will win on banning the live sheep trade is with facts and evidence: “One of the things I’ve been really interested in doing in my time in parliament is not just speaking off the cuff and trying to twist people to a viewpoint because of rhetoric and emotion, but saying these are the facts.” So what are the facts? “It’s a trade in terminal decline,” she says. “In the last five years the numbers of sheep exported from Australia has actually dropped by two-thirds.” Ley says the live sheep industry is already transitioning, anticipating the inevitable. Her bill would set an end date and give farmers and the industry clarity and certainty. While she’s copping some flak at home, her constituents are also responding to the sincerity of her personal conviction. One sheep farmer told her recently she’d “almost” convinced him, and in any case, she needed to do what she thought was right. “I have to keep going on the path that I’ve set,” she says. “One thing I’ve learned from being in parliament for 17 years is when you believe you need to do something, you must do it, and never take a backward step.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/29/land-clearing-wipes-out-1bn-taxpayer-funded-emissions-gains","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T18:00:00Z","webTitle":"Land-clearing wipes out $1bn taxpayer-funded emissions gains","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/29/land-clearing-wipes-out-1bn-taxpayer-funded-emissions-gains","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/29/land-clearing-wipes-out-1bn-taxpayer-funded-emissions-gains","fields":{"headline":"Land-clearing wipes out $1bn taxpayer-funded emissions gains","bodyText":"More than $1bn of public money being spent on cutting greenhouse gas emissions by planting trees and restoring habitat under the Coalition’s Direct Action climate policy will have effectively been wiped out by little more than two years of forest-clearing elsewhere in the country, official government data suggests. The $2.55bn emissions reduction fund pays landowners and companies to avoid emissions or store carbon dioxide using a reverse auction – the cheapest credible bids win. The government says it has signed contracts to prevent 124m tonnes of emissions through vegetation projects – mostly repairing degraded habitat, planting trees and ensuring existing forest on private land is not cleared. Based on the average price paid by the government for a tonne of carbon dioxide, the projects will receive about $1.48bn from taxpayers as they deliver their cuts over the next decade. Meanwhile, forest-clearing elsewhere in the country has released more than 160m tonnes of carbon dioxide since the emissions reduction fund began in 2015. Emissions projections data estimates another 60.3m tonnes will be emitted this year – equivalent to more than 10% of national emissions. An analysis by the Wilderness Society suggests the official figures underestimate the rate of land-clearing, and in reality the projects paid for from the Direct Action emissions reductions fund would have had their work nullified in even less time. The Wilderness Society climate campaign manager, Glenn Walker, said other data sources suggested the projections data was almost certainly an underestimate. He said the government’s forest-clearing emissions counted areas felled for farming, mining and other industry, but not those from native forest logging for timber, which are absorbed into another category. Australian National University scientists have estimated native forest logging may contribute another 38m tonnes a year. Walker said the official forest-clearing figures also underplayed the amount of mostly agricultural land-clearing in Queensland. State data showed that 395,000 hectares were felled in 2015-16, releasing 45m tonnes of emissions from that state alone. The Wilderness Society estimates suggest 600,000ha of land were cleared across the country in 2016, an area equivalent to about half of greater suburban Sydney, and the most in a decade. Walker said the government had shown it wanted mass land-clearing to continue, pointing to evidence that federal environment department notices asking Queensland landholders to explain suspected illegal clear-felling on their land had been withdrawn after lobbying by Liberal National MPs and senators. “It’s a disgrace that there is a massive public investment going into tree planting while the government sits back and not only watches but encourages the mass destruction of forests,” Walker said. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, did not directly respond to questions about how the rate of land-clearing squared with the government’s emissions goals. He said a departmental review of climate policies last year confirmed that Australia had a comprehensive set of emissions reduction policies, and that the emissions reduction fund was internationally recognised as one of the world’s largest domestic carbon offset markets. Land-clearing spiked in Queensland after the former Liberal National premier Campbell Newman relaxed laws preventing mass deforestation. The Palaszczuk Labor government has repealed the changes to restore earlier protections but legacy clearing permits remain for about 115,000ha. The federal government is resisting calls that it should use national environmental laws to stop land-clearing that threatens endangered species, saying it is a state responsibility. Frydenberg is currently considering a draft department of environment recommendation that a Queensland farmer be allowed to clear most of a 2000ha block of Cape York forest that is home to endangered species. Scientific advice suggests allowing it would likely increase sediment runoff on to the Great Barrier Reef. The government is also facing calls that it make changes to the emissions fund. It has committed $2.28bn on what it says is 191m tonnes of abatement, but questions remain over whether some types of projects backed by the fund – such as capturing methane from decomposing rubbish at landfill sites to convert into electricity – are actually limiting emissions or just being rewarded for what they would have done anyway. “Avoided deforestation” projects – paying farmers to not clear land – are also contentious. Habitat restoration and tree-planting projects have broader support. In a recent paper in the journal Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, University of Queensland research fellow Dr Megan Evans found that well-designed incentives could encourage landowners to back reforestation on otherwise agricultural land, with broad benefits for the environment and community. But she found that Australia’s reforestation program was being undermined by land-clearing elsewhere on the continent. She said people were likely being held back from signing up for reforestation projects by inconsistent messages from government. “If, as a society, we have a goal to reduce emissions, we need to ideally point all the policy messages towards that goal,” she said. “Unfortunately this hasn’t been happening.” Australia’s total national emissions continue to rise. The most recent national greenhouse accounts showed a 1.5% increase last year. The government has pledged to cut emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. Emissions from what is known as “land use, land use change and forestry” – a vast category that takes in forest-clearing, native logging, tree planting and the natural impact of and recovery from disasters such as fire, flood and drought – rose by 0.5%. The 60m tonnes from forest-clearing cancelled out what would have otherwise been an emissions sink. The next emissions reduction fund auction is scheduled for 6 and 7 June. • Support our independent journalism with a one-off or monthly contribution"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/24/marvel-ous-entertainment-etihad-stadium-re-named-after-walt-disney-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T02:16:37Z","webTitle":"Marvel-lous idea?

With Etihad’s current deal coming to an end in August, an eight-year naming rights deal has been struck with the Walt Disney Company Australia in a move that will also see a Marvel retail store installed at the ground and “a new era of entertainment” ushered in. “This partnership will allow us to take the stadium atmosphere to the next level and create memorable experiences for a vast array of audiences and we look forward to delivering a truly game-changing experience,” Melbourne Stadiums Limited CEO Michael Green said. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day Marvel becomes the fourth naming rights sponsor of the facility, built in 2000 in the inner-western suburbs of Melbourne. It currently houses the AFL’s headquarters and is home to five clubs – Essendon, St Kilda, Western Bulldogs, North Melbourne and Carlton – as well as the Melbourne Renegades’ men’s and women’s Big Bash League teams and reigning A-League champions Melbourne Victory. The deal comes after last month’s announcement that the Victorian government will invest $225m into the stadium and Docklands precinct around it. Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide’s parent company which was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2009, is the creator of well-known superhero comic characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor and Captain America. “Marvel is a powerhouse in the entertainment industry and one of the most recognised brand names in the world,” Green said. “It is a brand dedicated to audience experiences, which firmly aligns with our vision to create incredible experiences for fans.” It is not the first time Marvel and the AFL have teamed up – in 2015, the Sunday Funday promotion was launched which grants children free general admission to games on Sundays. Marvel is also involved with the NRL in its super hero round, during which players don comic-book themed jerseys. Kylie Watson-Wheeler, the senior vice president and managing director of the Walt Disney Company in Australia and New Zealand, said the union of comic books and a sports stadium was an obvious one. “Marvel is known for epic storytelling with heart, action, humour and relatability,” she said. “MSL’s Docklands Stadium has told its own compelling stories over time, via a vast array of sport and entertainment. It’s why this partnership is such a great fit.” Initial reaction to the announcement was, inevitably, mixed. “Disney got the sponsorship wrong. ‘Muppet Stadium’ or ‘Mickey Mouse Arena’ would be more fitting,” wrote one critic on Twitter while another branded it “a dumb joke”.

Reporters at the scene described a series of explosions throughout the day, three of them in entry tunnels to the underground facility, followed by explosions that demolished a nearby barracks and other structures. Tom Cheshire, the Asia correspondent for Sky News and one of the journalists invited to watch the demolition, said: “We hiked up into the mountains and watched the detonation from about 500 metres away. They counted it down: three, two, one. “There was a huge explosion, you could feel it. Dust came at you, the heat came at you. It was extremely loud.” North Korea did not invite any independent observers from overseas. The gesture is meant to reinforce the pledge by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to stop nuclear tests before a summit with Donald Trump on 12 June in Singapore. Despite North Korea’s desire to close the site, a war of words between Pyongyang and Washington this week cast a dark cloud over the summit, with both sides threatening to delay or pull out of the talks. The Trump administration has given mixed signals about its negotiating position. In an interview broadcast on Fox News on Thursday morning, the president said he was to accept a phased disarmament of North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, contradicting his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who insisted that Pyongyang would have to surrender the whole programme rapidly before receiving any reciprocal US measures. There would be “zero concessions”, Pompeo told Congress. In his television interview, which was taped on Wednesday, Trump put forward a more flexible stance. “We’re going to see. I’d like to have it done immediately,” he said. “But, you know, physically, a phase-in may be a little bit necessary, we will have to do a rapid phase in, but I’d like to see it done at one time.” North Korea has focused its verbal attacks on members of the Trump administration it has identified as hardliners, like national security advisor John Bolton, and vice-president Mike Pence, rather than on Trump himself. It presented its spectacular destruction of its test site as proof of good faith. The regime used the site at Punggye-ri for all six of its nuclear tests. The most recent one, in September, which produced a 6.3-magnitude earthquake that was felt across the border in China and Pyongyang, claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. Experts have said while decommissioning the site is an important diplomatic gesture, it will not affect the North’s nuclear arsenal. “Pyongyang wants a spectacle that leaves an impression of good faith,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy. “But its recent statements affirm the substantive questions of denuclearisation are going to be much tougher.” Earlier on Thursday, North Korea reminded the world it was not shy about verbally brandishing its nuclear weapons, saying the US had to choose whether it wanted to “meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown”. The test site consists of four main tunnels beneath mountains in the north-east, according to analysis by the monitoring group 38 North. While there has been some debate about whether the facility is still structurally sound, 38 North said two unused tunnels remained. That appears to confirm Kim’s claim the site was still in good working order, after a group of Chinese geologists said it had collapsed and was beyond repair. The closing of the tunnels consisted of three explosions, with the first collapsing the entrance to the north tunnel, which was used for five tests beginning in 2009, according to the Associated Press. Journalists were taken to the tunnel entrance and shown explosives before moving to a safe distance, CNN reported. “There were neither leakage of radioactive materials nor any adverse impact on the surrounding ecological environment,” North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute said according to the state run Korean Central News Agency. But no international inspectors were allowed to survey the site. Experts have said that if only the entrances were sealed at the closing ceremony the tunnels could easily be reopened if Pyongyang decides to resume nuclear tests. Before the closing ceremony, buildings at the complex were razed in preparation for a visit by 30 international journalists. The remote location meant the group had to travel 18 hours by rail and bus, before continuing on foot for roughly the last hour. Radiation monitoring equipment brought by some reporters was confiscated by authorities, according to Sky News. The site’s location only became known in 2006 when the North conducted its first nuclear test under Kim’s late father, Kim Jong-il. Activities since have been watched closely through satellite imagery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/21/alex-mcleish-scotland-injuries-friendlies-mexico-peru","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T22:00:37Z","webTitle":"Alex McLeish tells injury-hit Scotland to be giantkillers in friendlies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/21/alex-mcleish-scotland-injuries-friendlies-mexico-peru","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/21/alex-mcleish-scotland-injuries-friendlies-mexico-peru","fields":{"headline":"Alex McLeish tells injury-hit Scotland to be giantkillers in friendlies","bodyText":"Alex McLeish has said Scotland will have to perform acts of “giantkilling” against Peru and Mexico after the number of withdrawals from his squad stretched to six. McLeish, who already had a makeshift party for the upcoming friendlies, lost the Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong and the Hearts defender John Souttar on Monday due to injury. The Scots travel to face Peru in Lima on 29 May before a meeting in Mexico City on 2 June. “It is getting quite thin,” Scotland’s manager said of his squad. “We have some great players out there and we want them to be ready and available to play for Scotland. Hopefully we can do a giantkilling act. Wigan beat Manchester City in a recent FA Cup game so we are looking for those kind of performances and the fellows to play above their performance levels like they have never done before.” McLeish hinted at the late additions of United States-based players to bolster his squad. The former Liverpool defender Danny Wilson now plays for Colorado Rapids while Sam Nicholson, the former Hearts winger, recently moved to the same club from Minnesota United. “There’s a couple of other Scottish boys out there who have good experience we can maybe call upon,” McLeish said. “We will assess things on Tuesday morning.” The Scotland manager is aware of wider scepticism regarding the motivations of players at the conclusion to their domestic season. McLeish, who has taken charge of only two fixtures in his second Scotland tenure, admitted he must tread carefully with regards to building relationships with clubs. With Scotland not in the World Cup, clubs have no obligation to send players on international duty for friendlies. McLeish earlier opted not to call upon a key batch of Celtic players when mindful both of their need for rest and Champions League qualifiers in mid-summer. “You have to hope everyone else genuinely wanted to come to play for their country and enhance their careers,” he said. “It is not to be. It is a shame to lose Stuart, a tremendous player. But we are looking forward to the overall grand scheme of things. “ Sometimes managers can rage and say, ‘Well listen, we are wanting to do a medical with them’ but we have to trust in the clubs and we have to have a rapport with the clubs. That has definitely got to be an ongoing thing.” He added: “It has been very difficult at this particular time with the end of the season and players playing on with injuries in the last few weeks. We have made some concessions with James McArthur and that kind of thing but the late call-offs were disappointing. But I am not blaming the players. “Stuart has a little tweak in his hamstring, he flagged it up right after the Scottish Cup final on Saturday. “John Souttar is gagging to play for the full national team. He has come through the system and the process and had a good season, so hopefully he will keep learning and improve on what has been a very good season for him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/21/ryanair-soars-above-the-clouds-of-disharmony","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T07:17:47Z","webTitle":"Ryanair boss rides out turbulence of bad publicity | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/21/ryanair-soars-above-the-clouds-of-disharmony","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/21/ryanair-soars-above-the-clouds-of-disharmony","fields":{"headline":"Ryanair boss rides out turbulence of bad publicity","bodyText":"Ryanair cancelled thousands of flights last year, insulted its pilots but then was forced to recognise their unions, and generally generated an above-average level of bad publicity, even by its own elevated standards. The financial effect of the disharmony? Roughly zero. At the after-tax level, profits rose 10% to €1.45bn (£1.27bn). Indeed, the most eye-catching development in Monday’s full-year statement was Ryanair’s new habit of referring to its passengers as “guests”, which is the wrong word for paying customers but may be another of Michael O’Leary’s little jokes. Despite Ryanair’s resilience in the 12 months to March, the chief executive said he was “on the pessimistic side of cautious” about this year, which he is obliged to say because oil prices, and thus jet fuel prices, are rising and Ryanair must absorb the full-year costs of the pay rises for staff that it was shamed into awarding. Even so, O’Leary’s version of pessimism doesn’t look so awful. He still expects profits to arrive between €1.25bn to €1.35bn, which is hardly a collapse. It is possible because the customers keep coming and, for all the turmoil, Ryanair’s business model is not seriously imperilled. Staff costs will rise by almost €200m this year, but only half that sum represents higher pay for “frontline” staff – the rest is the natural effect of expansion. Ryanair may suffer a few strikes (Spain and Ireland are the current focus) but, if €100m is the cost of relative peace in the ranks, that’s not a bad result for the company. Ryanair will remain Europe’s lowest-cost operator. Brexit, as ever, is another of O’Leary’s complaints but he may have found a solution to the problem of how to meet EU ownership rules for airlines – if necessary, just disenfranchise non-EU investors from voting on shareholder resolutions. The shares rose 5%, suggesting shareholders are happy-ish again. O’Leary ought to be more perky than he sounds. By rights, the shambles of last year’s cancellations should have prompted serious pressure to reform a boardroom lineup that looks too cosy. Instead, he seems to be in the clear again. Retail winners irked at a system that favours losers A backlash against company voluntary arrangements, or CVAs, was only a matter of time. A system that allows a struggling store or restaurant group to escape collapse by asking its landlords for a big reduction in rent is clearly useful in protecting jobs and giving companies a shot at saving themselves, but CVAs also seem fundamentally unfair on rivals. If landlords are happy to hand out rent reduction, why should retailing winners not get prizes? It’s no surprise that Next, as reported by the Sunday Times, is now lobbying for “CVA clauses” to be included in the new lease contracts so it can enjoy the same benefit if a direct competitor on a high street or retail park, or in a shopping centre, gets a helping hand from a landlord. From Next’s point of view, it’s another way to reduce its rent bill and extend the life of profitable shops in the age of internet shopping. In its last full-year results, the Next chief executive, Lord Wolfson, reported that leases on 19 stores had been renewed with net rents falling by an average of 28%. He was expecting a similar outcome from renegotiations on 29 stores this year. In his shoes, you can understand why he would be irritated if rivals can sometimes get 50% cuts by threatening to go bust. It’s hard to see how landlords can resist the pressure from operators with strong covenants. Yes, landlords can complain – legitimately – that internet-only retailers like Amazon are grossly undertaxed in terms of business rates. But CVAs have become normal only because landlords have embraced them as a least-bad option to minimise the short-term pain for themselves of empty shops. In a retail property market where healthy tenants now hold more aces, there were bound to be long-term consequences. Italy’s government bond yield won’t cow the populist coalition The yield on 10-year Italian government debt has risen from 1.8% at the start of this month to 2.39%, prompting some to assert that the market has spoken and the new populist coalition won’t dare to pick a fight with the EU over fiscal rules. This sounds like wishful thinking. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League might point out that yields were 7% in 2012 in the depths of the eurozone debt crisis. They might draw the conclusion that their big spending plans are going down rather well, all things considered. If bond market vigilantes want to send a message, they will have to throw a proper tantrum: 2.39% probably doesn’t even register on the populists’ radar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/21/roger-michell-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T17:04:20Z","webTitle":"Roger Michell obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/21/roger-michell-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/21/roger-michell-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Roger Michell obituary","bodyText":"My husband, the potter Roger Michell, who has died aged 71 after a short illness, was best known for the Walking Ware tea service he designed in 1974, its quirky pieces mounted on legs, clad in shoes and stripy socks, and ready to stride out. His highly decorative style came as a breath of fresh air in the world of pottery. Roger’s pots are held in public collections including that of the V&amp;A, the Glasgow City Museum, the Norwich Castle Museum, the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Staffordshire, and the Tea and Coffee Museum in London. In 2009 I published a book about his work, Walking Ware: A Collector’s Guide. Roger was born in Guildford, Surrey, the second son of Edna (nee Scott), a teacher, and Norman Michell, a modernist architect and garden designer, and went to Harrow High grammar school. His father apprenticed him, aged 15, to David Eeles, a pioneer of the 1950s country pottery movement. During summer holidays, Roger stayed with the Eeles family in west Dorset, where he met distinguished potters including Bernard Leach. At the Central School of Art and Design, in London, where he studied ceramics under Gilbert Harding-Green, he met Danka Napiorkowska, a fellow student, and they married in 1970. Roger left the course early to start his first pottery in London. When this venture failed, he worked for Sir Anthony Caro, painting sculpture and then as a gallery assistant in the opening year of the Serpentine Gallery in 1970. He left London for Yorkshire, where he worked as a zoo artist, and where in 1973 he started Lustre Pottery, in Malton, with Danka. There they created and sold the Walking Ware tea set. It was originally made by hand and later manufactured on a larger scale by the industrial pottery Carlton Ware. Lustre closed in 1987 and Roger and Danka divorced the following year. His second marriage, to Jill Murphy, also ended in divorce. Roger continued to exhibit widely and his pots were collected all over the world. He and I met in 1992 in a life-drawing class and we married in 2003. We happily divided our time between Roger’s pottery studio in France, our caravans in the Algarve and family in the West Country. He was a kind man with an unforgettable sense of humour and a razor sharp intellect. Roger would grasp any challenge and in 2011 he wrote and published a mystery novel, The Salt Glaze Murders. He is survived by me, his daughters, Chloe and Alice, from his first marriage, and my children, Carly, Mazey and Louie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/21/grenfell-inquiry-opens-to-emotional-testimony-from-survivors","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T18:06:19Z","webTitle":"Grenfell inquiry opens to emotional testimony from survivors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/grenfell-inquiry-opens-to-emotional-testimony-from-survivors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/grenfell-inquiry-opens-to-emotional-testimony-from-survivors","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell inquiry opens to emotional testimony from survivors","bodyText":"A series of highly charged and emotional tributes to those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire launched a long-awaited public inquiry into the disaster as its chair, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, pledged that survivors’ testimony would be treated as “integral evidence” in proceedings which could run into 2020. Mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts and nieces of the dead were among those who spoke or provided statements about their loved ones as the inquiry began just over 11 months after the fire, which Moore-Bick described as “the single greatest tragedy to befall [London] since the second world war”. Seventy-one people were killed in the blaze and its immediate aftermath and a 72nd victim died in January. The family of Mohamed “Saber” Neda, a Kabul-born chauffeur who had lived on Grenfell’s top floor since 1999, played a harrowing recording of his last phone message as the fire took hold. He said in Dari, an Afghan language: “Goodbye. We are now leaving this world. Goodbye. I hope I haven’t disappointed you. Goodbye to all.” Marcio Gomes, the father of Logan Gomes, the disaster’s youngest victim who was stillborn after his mother went into a coma, showed the several hundred gathered survivors, support workers, lawyers and journalists an ultrasound scan of his son and told them how he had been left “broken”. He said: “I held my son in my arms, wishing, praying for any kind of miracle that he would open his eyes, move, make a sound. As we know that never happened. “You don’t know what you are made of until you are broken,” he said, hugging his wife, adding: “Without her strength and courage I would not be here.” The family of Mary Mendy, originally from Gambia, and her daughter, Khadija Saye, showed a short BBC film of Khadija at home in Grenfell talking about her art. She was a celebrated photographer who had exhibited at the Venice Biennale before she and her mother perished. When pictures of Grenfell tower were displayed, another victims’ mother covered her eyes. “The pain is unbearable,” the family said in a statement read out by a solicitor. “There are no words to describe the emptiness that’s in our hearts.” As Khadija Saye’s aunt, Betty Mendy, wept on the stage, a statement from her cousin Marion Telfer was read out. It said: “I hate night-times because night brings silence and silence brings tears of sadness, because that’s when I start to remember the blaze, the fire. There will be two empty chairs on the table for every birthday, Christmas and New Year’s, but they will for ever own a position in our hearts.” The inquiry began at the Millennium Gloucester hotel in Kensington, three miles from the burned-out skeleton of the 24-storey London council block. Testimonies were often harrowing, bringing many of those present to tears. There have been months of tension over the level of trust survivors feel in the inquiry process and the commemoration hearings were agreed to by Moore-Bick after representations from lawyers including Michael Mansfield QC, who argued they played an important role in the Hillsborough stadium disaster inquest. They will continue this week and next, with the majority of the victims expected to be represented. Before the commemorations, Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry set out how the fire started at just before 12.54am on 14 June 2017 in the kitchen of flat 16 on the fourth floor and that “within minutes the fire had broken out of the flat and into the cladding. By 1.29am, the flames reached the top of the tower and by 2.54am all four elevations were ablaze. “Grenfell is not a lawyers argument or a scientific experiment,” he said. “Grenfell Tower was not a public space. Grenfell was home. Its flats were private and a supposedly safe space where individuals could live their lives. It was a human space for human lives, each unique. “That is what a home is … It was a joined up community whose members worked, lived, played and prayed together … and many of them died together.” The heartrending evidence was heard by an audience that included Elizabeth Campbell, the leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which owned the tower, and Commander Stuart Cundy of the Metropolitan police, who is overseeing the criminal investigation into the fire. Campbell looked harrowed by what she had heard as she left the first of what are expected to be six days of tributes. “I want to bear witness and pay respects,” she told the Guardian. In a side room, she was buttonholed by Nabil Choucair, 43, who lost six close relatives in the fire. He remains in temporary accommodation, along with 71 other households who have not moved into permanent or interim housing. He said key workers assigned to them were “not showing compassion and care”. Campbell said she would try to help. Some families were speaking publicly for the first time about their loved ones. Flanked by relatives, Anne-Marie Murphy gave tribute to her brother Denis, 56, a London-born father of one, who died on the 14th floor of Grenfell where he had lived since before 1997. She recalled his last phone call at 2.52am as the flames rose, during which she and Denis’s son Peter had “reassured him we were on our way to him, not imagining we would never get to speak to him again”. “We as a family feel strongly that there is no reason in the world why anyone should have death forced upon them in such a horrific way,” she said. A handful of coins were the only possession of Murphy’s that could be recovered from his incinerated home. Anne-Marie Murphy described her brother as the lynchpin of their family, adding: “His three biggest loves were family, friends and Chelsea football club. Not always in that order.” Speaking afterwards, she said: “It has been a very emotional day for us with all the stories. It has been an honour to pay tribute to Denis publicly. It is the first time we have done that. We don’t want any of the victims to be one of the 71, to be a number and we have brought them alive today by being able to pay tribute to them.” David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham and a friend of Khadija Saye, said he spoke to her father by phone after her family’s tribute. “He was watching on TV and he was moved and reassured his daughter was brought to life in the room,” he said. The shortest contribution came from Sam Daniels, who spoke for 17 seconds about his father, Joseph, who had lived at apartment 135 at Grenfell since 1982. He requested that no one clap afterwards, as happened with some of the other commemorations. “The events of that night took his life and all trace of his existence in this world,” he said. “He never stood a chance of getting out. It should never have happened.” The first phase of the inquiry is due to run until the end of October, with evidence from experts and firefighters before an August break, and testimony from survivors and local residents from September. A second phase, examining the refurbishment and the decision-making that led to the fire, will not begin until at least November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/from-the-archive-1976-the-birth-of-punk-sex-pistols","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"From the archive: the birth of punk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/from-the-archive-1976-the-birth-of-punk-sex-pistols","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/from-the-archive-1976-the-birth-of-punk-sex-pistols","fields":{"headline":"From the archive: the birth of punk","bodyText":"On 1 December 1976, the Sex Pistols made their first TV appearance on Bill Grundy’s Today. After minimal preamble they branded the irate Grundy a ‘fucking rotter’ and admitted they’d spent their entire £40,000 record contract ‘down the boozer’. This was the third time in British TV history that ‘fuck’ had been uttered live on air. The nation was shocked, Grundy was suspended, and punk rock entered the nation’s consciousness. Two weeks after the incident, the Observer Magazine met the band in Caerphilly’s old Castle Cinema, where they were taking refuge from an angry mob of Labour councillors and Pentecostal chapel members waiting for them with torches in the car park. Staring out of the window at the torches outside, the band, our writer notes, look ‘victimised’. ‘Rock’n’roll is a violent music,’ explains band manager Malcolm McLaren, ‘but violence is kids being out of work on the streets with nothing to do – that’s a society being violent.’ This is a view echoed by two local punks, who had come to see the Pistols: ‘They face the realities of life,’ says Jill. ‘They understand people on the dole and they play specially for us. We feel closer to them than to people like Rod Stewart.’ When our reporter remarks on the pair’s swastika-adorned garms, Josie simply shrugs and replies: ‘We don’t follow fascism or anything like that. We just like the gear.’ As the Pistols played their gig the opening number would confirm the worst fears of the Caerphilly car park: ‘God save the Queen, she ain’t no human being…’ The record company cancelled the band’s contract after a spitting and vomit-related incident on the way to Heathrow airport. But, rebellious to the end, Johnny Rotten and his band refused to quit – for the sake of generations to come: ‘We’re now bankrupt, but if we give up, no new band will get a chance to play again.’ Long live rock’n’roll, eh?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/gardens-of-the-imagination-planting-for-others-to-enjoy-allan-jenkins","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"Gardens of the imagination | Allan Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/gardens-of-the-imagination-planting-for-others-to-enjoy-allan-jenkins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/gardens-of-the-imagination-planting-for-others-to-enjoy-allan-jenkins","fields":{"headline":"Gardens of the imagination","bodyText":"There is a soundtrack to summer happiness: the dawn chorus, a squadron of swans, wings singing in unison. Sometimes it is found in silence: gardening or sitting or lying together when nothing’s said. Sometimes the thing is in absence. We plant tulips at our beach plot in Denmark aware we’ll likely miss the flowering. We don’t get there nearly enough: a weekend every six to eight weeks or so. Sometimes the tulips will be tight in bud or the deer will have found them first. Other times, we’ll arrive to see their finished petals, tulip ghosts in the grass. Three years ago I fell for Dan Pearson’s winning garden at the Chelsea Flower Show, an artful, almost-wild meadow glimmered with sprengeri tulips. I planted them at the beach hut. The thought was that they would naturalise, find a home and return, like us, year after year. This early May bank holiday, for the first time, there they were: small, easily missed, almost delicate, opening and shutting with the sun. The lily of the valley bought for Henri’s birthdays have scattered along the hedge; we count them on our early-morning walks. Primroses nestle, sheltered under trees, white-flowered wood sorrel spreads along the bank. Wild carrot is surging through by the cluster of silver birch, ready to sway in the sea breeze. The sound of nearby waves, small birds sharing their summer happiness, an occasional grass mower, a child, of course, laughing. Thoughts like prayer flags fluttering in the wind. A bike ride to see buttercups; marsh orchids in the fields where the Icelandic horses are. I save and sow summer meadow flowers: red poppies, cornflowers and tall daisies, topped off with calendula.

Oxford University has admitted it is falling short on diversity as figures show more than one in four of its colleges failed to admit a single black British student each year between 2015 and 2017. White British applicants were twice as likely to be admitted to undergraduate courses as their black British peers. Releasing the figures, Oxford said it recognised the need to make more progress and was adding 500 more places to its spring and summer school programme for students from under-represented backgrounds. Wadham stands out as one Oxford college that has made inroads by admitting more state school students. Samina Khan, the university’s head of admissions and outreach, argues it is difficult to convince parents of minority-background applicants that they should look beyond their traditional goals of law and medicine to courses such as English literature or theology. “A degree from Oxford opens doors to so many careers,” Khan said. David Lammy, the Labour MP who has criticised Oxford and Cambridge over the issue, said: “The underprivileged kid from a state school in Sunderland or Rochdale who gets straight As is more talented than their contemporary with the same grades at Eton or Harrow, and all the academic evidence shows that they far outshine their peers at university too.” * * * ‘It’s all me, nothing is me’ – The novelist Philip Roth, author of Portnoy’s Complaint and American Pastoral, has died overnight aged 85 from congestive heart failure. Roth’s controversial first collection of short stories, Goodbye Columbus, was published in 1959 and followed the fortunes of middle-class Jewish Americans caught between old ways and new. Ten years later the comic erotic monologue of Alexander Portnoy made the author a scandalous celebrity. Over more than six decades – in work sometimes channelled through the alter egos of Nathan Zuckerman and David Kepesh – Roth won the Pulitzer, the National Book Award and, in 2011, received the National Humanities Medal from Barack Obama. * * * Quick catch-up – Here is a look at some of the week’s developing stories. &gt; A Birmingham woman will be sentenced today after being found guilty of orchestrating the forced marriage of her teenage daughter in Pakistan. Victims’ campaigners are “elated” after the first successful prosecution of its kind in the UK. &gt; Theresa May is under more pressure from hard Brexit Tories over how long Britain might stay attached to the EU customs union. Michael Gove has lashed out at the Treasurer, Philip Hammond, over Brexit bill defeats in the Lords. Boris Johnson, visiting South America, suggested he needs an official Brexit jet in a decent colour. &gt; Proceedings at the Grenfell inquiry were suspended when people became severely distressed during a video presentation about the deaths of six members of the same family. Anger and grief poured out as more stories of victims were recounted. &gt; Donald Trump is saying there is a “very substantial chance” of his 12 June meeting with Kim Jong-un being delayed though South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, says there is a “99.9%” chance things will go ahead as planned. Trump suggested the Chinese president had persuaded Kim to harden his position about denuclearisation – “I can’t say I’m happy about it,” Trump said, describing Xi Jinping as a “world-class poker player” – but experts say the North Korean leader never committed to an up-front handover of his arsenal. &gt; Manchester last night concluded a day of commemorations marking one year since the Arena attack. Our north of England editor, Helen Pidd, who covered the atrocity, was back last night for the mass singalong of Don’t Look Back In Anger that closed proceedings. * * * Dinner with friends, then a lie-in – Two studies that the Briefing is liking the look of today. The first, from Oxford Economics, finds that regularly eating alone is best avoided – the associated loneliness is the single biggest factor associated with unhappiness, apart from mental illness. It dovetails with previous findings about the profound benefits of regular social contact with friends. For the second study we can thank the Swedes, who have found that the ill effects of short sleeps over a few days may be countered by a later lie-in. Researchers warn that always getting five hours of sleep or less, without ever catching up, is associated with a 65% higher risk of premature death. * * * Baked holiday weekend – Some early notice that Britain is expecting highs of 30C (86F) for the coming bank holiday. Parts of south-east of England could experience temperatures double their usual level for the time of year, says the Met Office. There is a risk of thunderstorms, though, in the south-east and south-west leading up to Monday, which could keep temperatures down. * * * ‘You are hereby evicted’ – A mother and father have successfully sued their adult son to move out of home. The parental admonishments of Christina and Mark Rotondo that Michael, 30, should get a job and a place of his own are now backed by the force of law in New York state. He had demanded to stay another six months. The judge called that “outrageous” and served him with an eviction order. Lunchtime read: Investing your pension the DIY ethical way “Even 10 years after the crash, the finance sector is that thing so close as to evade perspective,” writes Aditya Chakrabortty this morning. “It gets bashed for bonuses, for tax dodging, for reckless innovation. What you hardly ever hear about is the vital part: how badly it does its supposed job of investing productively in society.” He writes that its great wealth, including our pensions money, sloshes around between financial institutions, getting loaned out to unproductive ends such as property speculation. There are, Chakrabortty says, ways to bring back what investment was supposed to be: one person puts money into another’s endeavours, said endeavour flourishes, the investor earns a return “and the country grows a little bit richer”. In Kirby, north of Liverpool, you can invest in building affordable family homes and supported living flats. You get 4.5% annual interest (versus a base rate of 0.5%), and the housing scheme gets the £3.9m it needs. In big French companies, pension savers are offered the chance to invest 10% of their money in a fond solidaire supporting social enterprises. In Britain, “desperately deficient” in everything from social housing to roads, “the big battle is to give us agency over our own savings, rather than leaving it all to some pinstriped manager on a fat commission”. Sport Rafael Benítez, the former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager, says a sixth European Cup is not beyond the Anfield club when the pair meet in the Champions League final on Saturday. Toni Kroos, meanwhile, says his side will face “11 animals” in Kiev and insists that Liverpool will be “tough,” “aggressive” opponents. The man who is set to be named as the new Arsenal manager has already joined the club – according to Unai Emery’s official website. Andrew Strauss is to take a summer-long break from his role as director of England cricket with Andy Flower stepping in as a temporary replacement. Harry Kane has marked his appointment as England’s youngest World Cup captain by insisting Gareth Southgate’s inexperienced side are capable of winning the tournament in Russia. Alex Sanderson has been urged to stay at Saracens and reject any approach to be England’s next defence coach but his current director of rugby, Mark McCall, will not stand in his way if Eddie Jones comes calling. And Thomas Bjorn has completed his selection of vice-captains for the Ryder Cup with the additions of Graeme McDowell and Luke Donald for Europe. Business Asian indexes have mostly slipped amid continuing worries about North Korea. The Dow dropped 200 points on Tuesday after Donald Trump said he was not satisfied with US-China trade talks and cast doubt on whether a summit with Kim Jong-un will take place. The pound has been trading at $1.341 and €1.140 overnight. The papers The Mail rolls out its well-worn taunt to call peers “Dinosaurs in ermine” on the front page (recently it had them as “traitors” in that same fur). The Times reports on Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying the Brexit vote has cost every British household £900 by damaging the economy. The Guardian leads with the diversity fail at Oxford University. The Mirror is outraged by the idea of a “Jumbojo Jet” for Boris Johnson. The Sun reports on BBC presenter and triathlete Louise Minchin being accused by rivals of cheating during a race (British Triathlon told the paper she was not under investigation). Both those red-tops, and the Telegraph and the Express, have a front-page picture of Meghan Markle giggling … in actual news, the Telegraph splashes on Michael Gove attacking the chancellor, while the Express demands a “minister for the elderly”.

The company reached a settlement with Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, the two men who were detained, in which they asked for a symbolic $1 for themselves and Starbucks agreed to fund a new community youth program. The company also issued new guidelines, requiring stores to allow customers to linger and use the restrooms, irrespective of whether they buy anything. That prompted a backlash from some Starbucks customers, who said they feared the outlets would become a place for homeless people to hang out. Starbucks later clarified the new policy, saying non-paying customers would be allowed to use the stores so long as they do not exhibit disruptive behavior, such as “smoking, drug or alcohol use, improper use of restrooms, and sleeping”. The company also clarified instances when employees should call 911. But this weekend’s seminars are by far the most extensive retraining measures the coffee giant has undertaken. Last week, it offered a preview, including a five-minute video and accompanying statement, of what its 175,000 employees can expect. Starbucks has not offered an estimate of what it will lose in sales during the afternoon closing, but the Philadelphia incident reportedly had a noticeable negative effect on consumer approval. In a corporate video to be shown to staff during the training, the chief executive, Kevin Johnson, reportedly tells employees that “the issue of racial bias and discrimination isn’t just about us as a company, it is about us as a country. Prejudice in public accommodation is deeply rooted in America.” While acknowledging the difficulty employees sometimes have with customers’ anti-social behavior, Johnson says, “my hope in gathering us is that Starbucks can become a place of welcoming, of warmth and of inclusion for all.” But anti-bias training experts are divided over the efficacy of a single seminar in correcting racial and gender biases. “The marketplace should be the place where we leave baggage at home,” said Rodney Sampson, chief executive of consultancy Opportunity Hub and author of Kingonomics, a study of economic diversity drawn from the teachings of Dr Martin Luther King. “I applaud what Starbucks is trying to do but I’m not sure if one day, or even one year, of training will have an impact.” The Philadelphia incident and others like it elsewhere speak to deeply set racial biases, Sampson said, which require additional cultural context and competency to result in effective training. “Starbucks has the opportunity to make incredible investment across its brand, in human resources, in procurement and innovation. There’s got to be a deeper approach than just a day of training. But this sends a big message to companies that aren’t even considering how to be more diverse, equitable and inclusive,” he added. According to Nathalie Molina Niño, who has studied and lectured on both gender and racial diversity studies, Starbucks has spent time and resources in achieving greater diversity but needs to take a holistic view of the problem. “Bias training is largely unsuccessful in isolation,” she says. “This has to be part of a multi-tiered strategy that attacks the problem from several different angles. It needs to be about looking at the core issues of gender and racial disparities.” One question Starbucks and companies like it could be asking, she said, is: “What are you doing to empower the voices of color that are in your ranks already? That sense of empowerment could help prevent the cops being called on customers who are simply waiting to have a meeting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/24/sadio-mane-senegal-liverpool-champions-league-final-300-shirts","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T21:40:06Z","webTitle":"Why Sadio Mané bought 300 Liverpool shirts for his village in Senegal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/24/sadio-mane-senegal-liverpool-champions-league-final-300-shirts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/24/sadio-mane-senegal-liverpool-champions-league-final-300-shirts","fields":{"headline":"Why Sadio Mané bought 300 Liverpool shirts for his village in Senegal","bodyText":"Three hundred Liverpool shirts have been sent to the small Senegalese village of Bambali in the buildup to the Champions League final, donated by Sadio Mané, its most famous son. On Saturday he aims to deliver on a promise to spare his childhood friend the despair and disbelief that accompanied Liverpool’s triumph in Istanbul. The gift set will be complete when he brings a European Cup winner’s medal back home. “I remember AC Milan v Liverpool in 2005,” Mané explains. “Three-nil down, then 3-3 and penalties. This was a big memory for me. I was watching in my village, Bambali. I remember being with my friend, a big friend of mine, and at 3-0 down he was completely out of it. He stopped watching and ran like crazy to get away. Then he came back at the end and he could not believe it. Even to this day he cannot believe it. He came back after the game when Liverpool had won.” Mané dissolves into laughter at the 13-year-old memory, half his lifetime ago. The Liverpool forward laughed at his friend’s antics at the time – “I was not supporting Liverpool then, I was a Barcelona fan,” he admits – but thoughts of the club’s eighth European Cup final appearance stir pride. “If you had said then I would be playing the final I would say it is something incredible in my life,” he says. “Hopefully we are going to win.” Bambali, bedecked in red, will be united behind the Senegal forward against Real Madrid in Kiev. Their pride in Mané’s rise to global stardom is not lost on the 26-year‑old, who remains in regular contact with family and friends back home, including the one who missed the comeback that secured Liverpool’s last Champions League triumph. “I spoke to him yesterday,” Mané says. “He is a big Liverpool fan. He is still in Senegal. His name is Youssouph Diatta. He asked me that this time do not be 3-0 down. “Nobody in the village will work this day. My family still live in the village. My mum and my uncle. They are all going to be watching. There are 2,000 in the village. I bought 300 Liverpool jerseys to send to the people in the village so the fans can wear them to watch the final. I will be going back in the summer after the World Cup and hopefully I will be showing everyone a winner’s medal.” Istanbul staged the most famous rapid-fire Liverpool performance of all, with three goals in six second‑half minutes stunning Milan en route to the club’s fifth European Cup. But devastating bursts of firepower have been such a feature of Liverpool’s Champions League campaign under Jürgen Klopp that not even a Real team pushing for a hat-trick of titles provoke fear. Liverpool scored three goals in 12 minutes in the play-off against Hoffenheim, three goals in 16 minutes and two in another five‑minute spell against Maribor, two in nine at Sevilla and three in 15 minutes plus two in four against Spartak Moscow at Anfield. And that was just the group stage. Porto, Manchester City and Roma were all in effect banished from the knockout phase before they could identify the threat and regroup. “It would be good for football [if Liverpool won] because of how we play,” Mané says. “I cannot say most of the world wants that because Real Madrid fans will say otherwise. Maybe everyone who is not a Real Madrid, Everton, Man Utd and Man City fan. I think everyone else would like to see Liverpool win the trophy. Real Madrid won it two times and want a third time in a row. We respect them as a great team and great club in history but Liverpool also has history. It won’t be easy but we will do our best.” He adds: “I am just thinking it is incredible to be in the final, not about pressure. I’m just happy and excited. It is the best time for the whole squad to play. “We are in the best shape; there is no tiredness. This kind of game does not happen all the time and it is one of the most important of a career. It will not be easy. They have experience and are one of the best teams in the world, but we have quality and can beat any team in the world.” Liverpool are leading scorers in this season’s Champions League with 40 goals (excluding six against Hoffenheim in the play‑off). Mané, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah are responsible for 29 of them. It is a record that invites comparisons between Liverpool’s fearsome front three and the prodigious Real attack of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, albeit not from Mané himself. “You can write this, I didn’t say it,” he adds. “We are happy people name us at this level. Thank you for the compliment. It is something we have been working hard on to play in this Champions League. I am always honoured to play alongside these great players. People talk about the front three but it is the whole team that makes us better. They did a great job behind to help us score goals. It makes us happy.” A feeling no doubt shared in Bambali."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/24/zuckerberg-messenger-kids-facebook-child-health","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T16:00:22Z","webTitle":"Child campaigners to Zuckerberg: scrap Messenger Kids","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/zuckerberg-messenger-kids-facebook-child-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/24/zuckerberg-messenger-kids-facebook-child-health","fields":{"headline":"Child campaigners to Zuckerberg: scrap Messenger Kids","bodyText":"More than 21,000 child health advocates are petitioning Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to “pull the plug” on the company’s Messenger Kids app aimed at under 13s, warning of the “addictive power of social media”. In an open letter and petition led by two groups, the Campaign for Commercial Free Childhood (CCFC) and MomsRising, the campaigners urged Zuckerberg to use his “enormous reach and influence to promote children’s wellbeing.” “Please do not target kids. Research shows that excessive social media use is already harming adolescents and teens,” the letter says. “Younger children are even less equipped to deal with the interpersonal challenges and addictive power of social media. Kids need time and space to experience the physical world and develop healthy face-to-face relationships.” Among the 21,000 signatories are educators, health professionals, parents and caregivers. The campaign says that these are “people who see the impacts of technology and social media on children every day” and that they are “distressed about the impacts of technology and social media on the wellbeing of children and families”. The standalone Messenger Kids app was launched in December with strict parental controls including contact approvals and safety filters to prevent children sharing inappropriate material. Facebook says that data collected from it will not be used for advertising purposes and the app contains no ads. But the launch of the app was attacked by commentators and British health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said the firm should “stay away from my kids”. The Boston-based CCFC sent a letter to Zuckerberg signed by 110 child health advocates in January warning of the dangers of the app. Since then Zuckerberg has been grilled about Messenger Kids while testifying before the US Congress in April. “The harm is real,” said Micah Resnick, one of the signatories of the petition, a paediatrician from New York. “The race to keep children’s attention trains them to replace their self-worth with likes, encourages comparison with others, and creates the constant illusion of missing out.” “Social media is already damaging the emotional/social growth of children. Do not lower the age to younger children, who are already more impressionable, and do not have the cognitive maturity to differentiate social messages,” said Jamie Greene, a psychologist from Mt Kisco in New York. Facebook says that Messenger Kids was developed with the help of online safety experts including the National PTA and Blue Star Families, and that it is fully complaint with US Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act. Millions of children are already on Facebook, with or without their parents’ permission, despite its terms of service barring those under 13 years old from joining. Some have seen the Messenger Kids app as a pragmatic approach to providing somewhere for those under 13 to go that is not the main Facebook social network. But the petition adds to the growing chorus of discontent directed towards the impact of social media, and in particular Facebook, on society and the young. Industry insiders including former Facebook president Sean Parker, SalesForce CEO Marc Benioff and Apple chief executive Tim Cook have all recently expressed concerns over the use of social media by children. A Facebook spokesperson said: “Messenger Kids was built from the ground up with input from families, safety experts and child development advocates. It’s why today thousands of families in the US use the app to stay in touch in a safe environment, where parents have complete control of their child’s contacts and there are no ads or in-app purchases. “We’re going to keep working to make this app better for families, and we appreciate their feedback.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/24/emergency-brake-was-disabled-on-self-driving-uber-that-killed-woman","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T17:52:24Z","webTitle":"Emergency brake was disabled on self-driving Uber that killed woman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/emergency-brake-was-disabled-on-self-driving-uber-that-killed-woman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/24/emergency-brake-was-disabled-on-self-driving-uber-that-killed-woman","fields":{"headline":"Emergency brake was disabled on self-driving Uber that killed woman","bodyText":"A federal investigation into a self-driving Uber SUV that hit and killed a pedestrian in March has found that the vehicle’s emergency braking system was disabled. The preliminary report, issued by the National Transportation Safety Board, said on Thursday that while the vehicle’s guidance system had spotted the woman about six seconds before hitting her, emergency braking manoeuvres were not enabled in order to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior”. Instead, the Uber system anticipated that the human back-up driver would intervene. However, the automated system was not designed to alert the driver of the impending danger. The car was traveling at 43 miles per hour and its sensors determined that braking was needed 1.3 seconds before impact, according to the report. But the driver began to steer less than a second before striking 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was pushing a bicycle across a boulevard in the darkness in Tempe, Arizona, when the crash took place. The vehicle’s brakes were not applied until after the fatal impact. In an interview with NTSB investigators, Uber’s back-up driver said she had been monitoring the “self-driving interface”. On Wednesday, Uber announced it would cease testing its vehicles in Arizona and would focus on more limited testing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and California. Uber said that it had worked closely with the NTSB and was conducting an internal review of its self-driving vehicle program. The company also announced it had brought in the former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart “to advise us on our overall safety culture, and we look forward to sharing more on the changes we’ll make in the coming weeks”. The NTSB said its preliminary report was not designed to assign responsibility for the crash. Carl Tobias, a liability expert at the University of Richmond school of law, said the incident and Uber’s subsequent decision to pull out of testing in Arizona, underscores a need for greater regulatory oversight in the testing of self-driving vehicles. “It sounds like Uber is trying to work with the NTSB to move forward but this is a substantial setback. States are going to have to be extremely careful how they set up and regulate these programs.” Tobias continued: “We can’t have 50 different regimes and we may need some more systematic way to experiment with the technology without risking injuries and deaths. The states are going to need to protect people, and I don’t think we’re set up to do that yet. The question is how?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/01/less-andrew-sean-greer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T06:30:42Z","webTitle":"Less by Andrew Sean Greer review – a literary skewering of stealthy genius","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/01/less-andrew-sean-greer-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/01/less-andrew-sean-greer-review","fields":{"headline":"Less by Andrew Sean Greer review – a literary skewering of stealthy genius","bodyText":"Two thirds of the way through Andrew Sean Greer’s latest novel, he risks letting his novelist hero – white, gay, knocking 50 – describe his latest novel, which has been turned down by his publisher. “It was about a middle-aged gay man walking around San Francisco. And, you know, his … his sorrows … ” “A white middle-aged American man walking around with his white middle-aged American sorrows?” replies his lesbian friend. “It’s a little hard to feel sorry for a guy like that.” Greer can afford this moment of metafiction because, by this third act of the novel, his hero has won us over, for all that he enjoys most of the blessings of existence. Despite its lampooning of the literary world, Less won this year’s Pulitzer prize for fiction, prompting its publication in Britain. It introduces us to minor novelist Arthur Less as he finds himself abruptly single, having coasted through a studiedly casual not-quite-relationship with a vain younger man for several years. Less is “an author too old to be fresh and too young to be rediscovered, one who never sits next to anyone on a plane who has heard of his books”. The younger man, who happens also to be the son of his arch enemy, announces his engagement to someone else. While still not acknowledging to himself that he was in love all along and that his heart is cracked, if not quite broken, Less accepts a slew of writerly invitations that conveniently slot together to provide a round-the-world trip. Not only will he thus avoid the wedding, but sidestep the pain of turning 50 in company. The various stages of this journey lend the novel its structure and, as is customary, provide both a parade of colourful characters and a voyage of self-discovery. They also neatly illustrate the scrabble-and-make-do that most freelance writers must resort to in order to survive, all those little jobs that make you feel like an author but that are not quite writing – “the crazy quilt of a writer’s life: warm enough, though it never quite covers the toes”. Greer mercilessly skewers the insecurity of authors as well as the vanity of the literary industry’s self-absorption in the face of its irrelevance to most people’s lives. The stealthy genius of this novel is that it simultaneously tells the life story of a basically sweet man whom the industry has eaten alive. Less’s undoing, perhaps, is that he has been loved by a genius – he passed his youth as the lover of a celebrated poet – so has fallen into the habit of seeing himself as on the periphery of things. A twink-turned-daddy, he has yet to make the adjustment from kissed to kisser, and wreaks emotional havoc on anyone drawn in by his air of baffled innocence. We first meet him in New York, where he has the humiliation of chairing a huge event for a wildly successful and wildly overrated science fiction writer. His next stop is Mexico, where he must take part in a panel discussion about his former lover’s genius. Then Italy, where an earlier novel of his, apparently brilliant in translation, is up for an obscure but well funded award: a sequence that catches particularly well the artificial camaraderie and false modesty of rivals thrown together for a prize. And so on to Germany, where he teaches a writing course entitled Read Like a Vampire, Write Like Frankenstein. There he has a fling with a besotted business student and it is from the intimate details the narrator lets slip about the way Less kisses (“like someone who has just learned a foreign language and can only use the present tense and only the second person. Only now, only you”) that the reader begins to suspect this story is being told not by some omniscient figure but by a character in it whom Less has underestimated. And then on to Paris, an ever less romantic journey across the desert in Morocco, a nightmarish food article he researches in Japan, and finally an Indian writing retreat. Here he plans to polish the rejected novel to perfection but, as the past reaches out to reclaim and challenge him, he is actually being prepared, we realise, finally to fall in love. Novels about novelists are always a risk, but Less is about anyone who has allowed their calling to define them at the expense of their humanity. Writers may blush in the mirror it holds up to them, but many readers will find it as endearing as the very best of Armistead Maupin. • Patrick Gale’s Take Nothing With You is published by Tinder in August.

The experts sieved the clay, which had gradually filled the coffin, to retrieve every fragment of evidence about the burial. They found a single flake of gold, possibly from an earring, and a jasper cameo, which was already an antique when the woman died in the first century AD. The intact sarcophagus, found last year in excavation of a Roman cemetery in Southwark, south London, before building work, was of international importance and only the third scientifically excavated in the capital in modern times. It will go on display for the first time at an exhibition opening on Friday at the Museum of London Docklands, where the woman lies surrounded by dozens of Roman dead and the objects buried or cremated with them, including jewellery, toys, containers of food and wine and, in one grave, a chicken carcass. The most enigmatic discovery was an animal skeleton – a tiny dog buried near a child, but in its own carefully dug grave. It had a costly beaded collar with a beautiful sickle moon pendant – but the animal’s head and paws had been cut off. The Museum of London curator and archaeologist Jackie Keily said: “It meant something to them – but what? Often we’re left with more questions than answers.” Many were found in recent decades; others excavated long ago were scientifically analysed for the first time. The research revealed one woman was of black African origin, and a tall heavy-boned man thought to be German was actually a Londoner whose heavy fancy belt buckle suggests he was a Roman legionary. He was one of many men whose bones bore the scuffs and scars of healed injuries. A teenage boy, buried with the tiny bodies of a baby and a four-year-old, probably his siblings, was brought up in the Mediterranean. One of the bodies by his side showed early signs of rickets, which the archaeologists believe could have been caused by importing the Roman custom of swaddling infants in yards of cloth, blocking them from having their vitamin D levels topped up by sunlight. The three are suspected to have all died from an infection, which would have left no mark on their bones. The middle-aged woman in Southwark lay quietly in her expensive sarcophagus until the 17th century, when it was probably again an accidental discovery during building work. It had been prised open, cracking the lid carved from a single slab of stone. Her bones had been shoved to one side, her arm torn off and thrown aside, possibly to wrench off a bracelet, and anything buried with her ransacked. “The sarcophagus with its lid and the clay fill weighed a tonne and a half, and we had to use a very strong lorry to move it. It left us in awe of the Romans who brought the stone from Lincolnshire,” Roy Stephenson, head of archaeology at the museum, said. Roman Dead will be at the Museum of London Docklands, east London, from 25 May until 28 October.

The UK’s largest building society reported a 7.3% drop in statutory profits to £977m for the year to 4 April, down from £1.05bn the previous year. Profits include the £116m cost of buying back debt. Net mortgage lending fell from £8.8bn to £5.8bn, and Nationwide’s share of the market nearly halved, from 25.4% to 13.0%. Even so, it said it remained the UK’s second-biggest mortgage lender, behind Halifax. The Swindon-based mutual blamed fierce competition that forced it to lower mortgage rates, hurting profit margins, and said there was no sign of a let-up. Mark Rennison, the Nationwide chief financial officer, said: “Our view is price competition will continue, which is good news for customers.” Nationwide has been hit by the end of the Bank of England’s term funding scheme, which was launched after the Brexit vote to provide cheap finance to enable banks to lend at lower interest rates. Rennison said competition had increased because the big five banks had returned to the market after ringfencing their high street banking operations from the riskier parts of their businesses. The mutual’s buy-to-let lending also continued to fall, after it tightened affordability criteria for landlords. Last year, Nationwide’s profits tumbled 18% after it sought to protect savers from rock-bottom interest rates. It has continued to do so, holding savings rates on average more than 50% higher than the market average. As a member-owned mutual organisation, it has greater flexibility on mortgage and savings rates, unlike the large banks which have to answer to shareholders. However, savings deposits grew more slowly, up by £3.5bn against a rise of £5.8bn the previous year, although the group maintained its market share at 10%. Nationwide said it attracted 816,000 new current accounts, more than any other brand in the past year. It doubled student account openings to 21,000 after improving terms. The building society’s membership reached a record of 15.5 million. Of those, 8.1 million are “engaged” members – those who have a current account, mortgage or savings deposit of more than £5,000 – also a record high. Joe Garner, the Nationwide chief executive, said: “We anticipate modest growth in our core product markets, reflecting the outlook for the economy as a whole. With employment growth expected to slow and pressure on household budgets fading only gradually, mortgage lending is likely to rise at a fairly pedestrian pace.” The group expects the UK economy to grow at 1% to 1.5% over the next few years and the housing market to remain subdued, with house price growth slowing to 1% over the next year. Nationwide wants to enter the business banking market and is applying for up to £50m of funds from Royal Bank of Scotland, which is being forced by the government to provide £775m to rivals so they can improve their services. Garner said Nationwide would target small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) with annual turnovers of £20m to £25m. He said Nationwide would be “the only player in the market that has a full branch network and is targeting the smaller half of SMEs”. The building society has repeatedly looked at offering business banking in the past, but was deterred by the high cost of entry. Its push into business banking comes at a time when the other large financial institutions have come under heavy criticism for their treatment of small businesses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/22/r-kelly-sexual-abuse-lawsuit-herpes","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T09:42:43Z","webTitle":"R Kelly accused of infecting woman with herpes, faces fresh sexual abuse lawsuit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/22/r-kelly-sexual-abuse-lawsuit-herpes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/22/r-kelly-sexual-abuse-lawsuit-herpes","fields":{"headline":"R Kelly accused of infecting woman with herpes, faces fresh sexual abuse lawsuit","bodyText":"R Kelly is facing another sexual abuse lawsuit, the latest in a string of accusations that he coerced women into having sex with him. Faith Rodgers alleges that the R&amp;B star abused her “mentally, sexually and verbally”, filming her against her will in “deviant and compromising sexual contact”. She also alleges that the first time they had sex it was “non-permissive, painful and abusive”, and that he infected her with herpes without her knowing. Kelly has not yet responded to these particular charges. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, most recently calling the string of allegations, and the subsequent backlash from the Time’s Up movement, “a greedy, conscious and malicious conspiracy to demean him, his family and the women with whom he spends his time”. Rodgers also alleges that Kelly locked her in rooms and cars to punish her “for failing to please [him] sexually and/or for perceived offenses and violations of his prescribed code of conduct”. The allegations are similar to others made against Kelly recently, from women who allege he held them against his will in a “cult”, where as well as being forced into sexual acts, the women had their diet and even use of the bathroom controlled by Kelly. Rodgers’ lawsuit describes her case as “run-of-the-mill R Kelly sexual abuse”. In a BBC Three documentary about the allegations, one woman, Kitti Jones, said that Kelly told her he had “trained” one of the women since the age of 14. She added that he was “very abusive, physically, mentally, verbally. I think he gets some sort of satisfaction within himself, knowing that he’s taking control over other people”. Last year, police in Illinois and Georgia made a series of welfare checks on the residences where the women were living and found nothing illegal; in January 2017, one woman told police she was “fine and did not want to be bothered with her parents”. Kelly has previously settled out of court over other sexual abuse claims, and in 2008 he was found not guilty in the one case to make it to court, in which he faced charges of producing child pornography and having sex with an underage girl. As the allegations have grown in number, pressure has grown on Kelly. A Chicago concert was cancelled this month following protests, and Spotify removed his songs from their own curated playlists as part of a new policy against “hateful conduct”. However, the policy hasn’t affected Kelly’s popularity – the number of weekly streams of his music has increased slightly since the policy change. This week Kelly also lost a legal claim he made, after his management company sued venue operator Comcast Spectacor over breach of contract, claiming $100,000 damages. The case has been thrown out after Kelly missed a 15 May hearing, having missed two previous hearings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/22/insanity-liberals-say-john-alexander-may-face-challenge-to-preselection","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T08:38:26Z","webTitle":"'Insanity': Liberals say John Alexander may face challenge to preselection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/22/insanity-liberals-say-john-alexander-may-face-challenge-to-preselection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/22/insanity-liberals-say-john-alexander-may-face-challenge-to-preselection","fields":{"headline":"'Insanity': Liberals say John Alexander may face challenge to preselection","bodyText":"Concern is mounting that the Liberal MP John Alexander – who was feted as the “hero of the hour” when he held the seat of Bennelong for the Turnbull government at the height of the dual citizenship fracas – may face a challenge to his preselection. With sensitivities about preselection challenges heightened inside the Coalition because of the recent rolling of junior minister Jane Prentice in Queensland, and possible challenges looming in Victoria prompted by a factional power shift, Liberals have told Guardian Australia that Alexander could face a challenge in Bennelong – a development one senior figure characterised as an act of “insanity”. While party sources in New South Wales are hopeful potential challengers will be persuaded to stand down before the close of nominations on Friday, given Alexander has renominated for the seat, one well-placed figure said it was “too soon to tell” what would happen. Another acknowledged a challenge against Alexander was possible, a development that would trigger a chain reaction in the state, but added: “There’s a holding pattern at the moment. There is general agreement that we need stability.” Potential challengers have been circling Bennelong for some time, and there was talk early in 2017 that Alexander could retire from politics, but last year’s byelection campaign has ensconced the former tennis pro in the seat, and the Liberal MP has made it known he intends to contest the next federal election. Labor threw massive resources at Bennelong when Alexander was forced to quit because of his dual citizenship, recruiting a star candidate in Kristina Keneally, and running a ferocious on-ground campaign in north Sydney. Alexander prevailed in the contest despite a two-party-preferred swing against the government of just over 5%. The Liberals breathed a collective sigh of relief at the result, because the outcome was critical for the Turnbull government’s fortunes and for the prime minister’s internal authority. On the night of the positive byelection result, Alexander declared the victory “a renaissance” of Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership. Liberals concerned about a potential challenge to the incumbent point out the political embarrassment associated with Alexander holding the seat against the odds at a byelection, only to be run down by a challenger. Alexander told Guardian Australia on Tuesday he welcomed democracy in the Liberal party, and people were welcome to challenge, “but if I were to lose, I would find that hard to understand”. “I’m happy to put my record against anyone who challenges,” the MP said, noting his commitment to local projects and his successful track record as a fundraiser. Similar concerns about a potential challenge to another New South Wales Liberal, Ann Sudmalis, have prompted senior government figures in recent weeks to make public statements of support. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, declared last week that Sudmalis, the member for Gilmore, saved the Liberal party from losing government at the last election. In Tuesday’s regular party room meeting, the Queensland National Michelle Landry raised the issue of women and preselections in the Coalition parties, arguing more had to be done to ensure balanced representation – a point that was accepted by Turnbull. Landry, who spoke out against the recent dumping of Prentice, has now been summoned to appear before the LNP’s candidate review committee for failing to toe the party line. Referencing her summons by the Queensland star chamber, Landry – according to party sources – told colleagues she may as well have her say about women’s representation. The north Queensland Liberal Warren Entsch is said to have remarked in Tuesday’s party room meeting that Landry’s punishment by the party machine was “a bloody disgrace”. In Victoria, tensions have been running high since a conservative group hit pause on preselections in the state, in defiance of Turnbull’s desire that they be concluded by July. While the conservative group, aligned with the Victorian conservative Michael Sukkar, has, according to insiders, guaranteed that lower-house incumbents won’t face challenges, it appears likely that senators won’t be spared."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/04/michael-gove-leading-plan-to-ban-sale-of-new-hybrid-cars-from-2040","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T17:35:37Z","webTitle":"Michael Gove leading plan to ban sale of new hybrid cars by 2040","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/04/michael-gove-leading-plan-to-ban-sale-of-new-hybrid-cars-from-2040","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/04/michael-gove-leading-plan-to-ban-sale-of-new-hybrid-cars-from-2040","fields":{"headline":"Michael Gove leading plan to ban sale of new hybrid cars by 2040","bodyText":"Michael Gove is spearheading plans to halt the sale of new hybrid cars by 2040 to help tackle UK air pollution, Whitehall sources have said. Ministers have been battling privately over whether or not to ban hybrids to strengthen the government’s policy of banning new diesel vehicles in 22 years time. The environment secretary is in favour, as is the business secretary, Greg Clark, but the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, is opposed, the FT reported on Friday. Hybrid car sales dwarf those of fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, but the former emit more pollution because they are still overwhelmingly reliant on burning oil. The proposed hybrid ban is part of a plan called Road to Zero, which is being “heatedly discussed” within government, one source said. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “It is categorically untrue that government is planning to ban the sale of hybrid cars in the UK by 2040.” A hybrid ban would mean the sale of new cars such as the Toyota Prius would be prohibited after 2040, while 100% electric cars and plug-in hybrids, which have larger batteries and a longer range without using petrol or diesel, could still be sold. The motor industry responded angrily to the news, saying it was disappointed to see policy being communicated by leaks. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “Unrealistic targets and misleading messaging on bans will only undermine our efforts to realise this future, confusing consumers and wreaking havoc on the new car market and the thousands of jobs it supports. “We cannot support ambition levels which do not appreciate how industry, the consumer or the market operate and which are based neither on fact nor substance.” When the 2040 ban was announced last summer, shortly after a similar plan by France, the UK government declined to be drawn on whether it covered hybrids. About 98% of new car sales are petrol or diesel, including hybrids. The latter accounted for 72,523 new car registrations in 2017, compared with 13,597 for fully electric models and 33,666 for plug-in hybrids. Prof David Bailey, an automotive expert at Aston university, said the switch to 100% electric cars would only begin to take off in a big way in the 2020s. “We will see a quicker shift into hybrid technology which is set to become the mainstream,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/13/in-brief-the-wind-at-my-back-manhattan-beach-miss-laila-armed-and-dangerous-jennifer-egan-reviews","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"In brief: The Wind at My Back; Manhattan Beach; Miss Laila, Armed and Dangerous – reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/13/in-brief-the-wind-at-my-back-manhattan-beach-miss-laila-armed-and-dangerous-jennifer-egan-reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/13/in-brief-the-wind-at-my-back-manhattan-beach-miss-laila-armed-and-dangerous-jennifer-egan-reviews","fields":{"headline":"In brief: The Wind at My Back; Manhattan Beach; Miss Laila, Armed and Dangerous – reviews","bodyText":"The Wind at My Back: A Cycling Life Paul Maunder Bloomsbury, £16.99, pp272 In a two-wheeled response to much great current writing about man and landscape, Paul Maunder’s engaging memoir argues that cycling, because of its innate connection with civilisation, is a perfect cipher for our feelings about the natural world. There’s a little too much analysis about the art of writing, but it does make you want to get on your bike. Manhattan Beach Jennifer Egan Corsair, £8.99, pp512 (paperback) After Egan’s daring Pulitzer prize-winning novel A Visit from the Goon Squad (in which one chapter was written entirely in Powerpoint slides), Manhattan Beach is relatively straightforward. Set in New York during the depression and second world war, it features Anna, a ship-repair diver in Brooklyn’s naval yard caught up in a world of mobsters and family secrets – a likable heroine battling against the social mores of the time. Despite some over-researched sections on shipwrights and their craft, it’s a story to relax into and enjoy. Miss Laila, Armed And Dangerous Manu Joseph Myriad Editions, £8.99, pp224 Manu Joseph’s third novel, set in the world of Indian politics, police and bureaucracy, is caustic, occasionally comic and determinedly controversial. But there’s a thriller lurking beneath too: a man is found trapped in the rubble of a collapsed Mumbai tower block, whispering about a young Muslim couple about to carry out a terror attack. References are made to the real-life Ishrat Jahan case from 2004, in which a group of “suspected” terrorists were killed by police. Joseph regularly jolts the reader out of his fictional world, though not always successfully, ultimately making the novel easier to admire than to love. • To order The Wind at My Back for £14.44, Manhattan Beach for £7.64, or Miss Laila, Armed and Dangerous for £7.64, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Buried inside science fictional visions of future societies – filled with robots and aliens – lie questions about our own lives. From Star Trek to Tarkovsky, HG Wells to Ursula K Le Guin, all asked what it means to be a human – how do we treat life forms deemed to be “different” and how else might we order our own societies? Westworld, which has just entered its second season, is no stranger to this trope. While the story – developed from the 1973 film written and directed by Michael Crichton – features a futuristic, immersive wild west theme park populated by lifelike robots willing to indulge clients’ every fantasy, the ethical question raised by the series is profound: what it is that defines the human experience. The answers it offers are extremely dark. The series is marked by its relentlessly negative depiction of humans let off the leash. Unrestricted by laws prohibiting crimes against the person, the holidaymakers of the vast plains of Westworld spend their time indulging in orgies of violence by stabbing and shooting the robotic “hosts”. The series pulls few punches; the gunshots leave real wounds, the crushed heads really cave in and the women of Westworld are exposed to relentless sexual violence at the hands of the male guests. While the guests are indulgently anti-robot, does the show itself revel in being indulgently anti-human? The 3D printed bodies that the robotic hosts inhabit are a clear visual reference to the Vitruvian Man, Leonardo da Vinci’s diagram of the ideal human, an iconic image from the Renaissance and the birth of humanist ideals. Like the avuncular John Hammond, the director of Crichton’s later dystopian world Jurassic Park, Anthony Hopkins’ Robert Ford, the director of Westworld, seems driven by a similarly enlightenment-inspired humanistic faith in the ability of scientific progress to illuminate – in this case, by offering guests the ability to explore their own sense of self through his storylines. Ford seems worryingly unconcerned that he is catering to his guest’s predilections for inflicting savage violence and sexual assault upon his simulacra humans. Their own human barbarity is far from a moral quandary or social evil to be addressed; it is simply a market for his entertainment to exploit and a useful plot device to serve his own obsession with storytelling. It’s telling that Ford sets his theme park in the US wild west, itself a place where a confected narrative of “manifest destiny” used European-developed humanistic ideals of scientific progress and the taming of nature to develop a dehumanising racial science and perpetrate genocide against the Native Americans who inhabited the land. Those ruled “non-human” are, at most, resources. Few human characters in the show even approach likability; indeed, as the first series progresses, one of the only staff members in Delos Destinations, the organisation that runs Westworld, to struggle with the ethical implications of his job is later revealed to be a robot. The moral conundrums he wrestles with are a function of his “becoming-conscious”. Almost without exception, the scientists and programmers who work within the vast capitalist conglomerate of Delos are avaricious and sneaky. Their world is organised by a hierarchy of power that rewards all the worst human characteristics, so long as they benefit the corporation. The guests they serve live as mindless consumers whose desires and traumas are not to be questioned, but indulged and exploited. They, too, are shaped by the nature and organisation of the society they’re in; one with a market in crypto-murder. The uncertain, shifting time frames of the show allow the only “good guy” to be revealed as the youthful incarnation of the lawless frontier’s most villainous ne’er-do-well, a sadist played by Ed Harris who indulges in rape and butchery in his obsessive quest to uncover what he believes is the park’s true secret. It’s a life exposed to simulated violence that has shaped him into the cruel “Man in Black”, driven by his own selfish desires. The questions that Westworld asks about what being human means are instead posed through the hosts. Already conscious and semi-sentient, they have many of the characteristics of true artificial intelligence themselves, long since having managed to pass the famous Turing test that makes them functionally indistinguishable from humans. But after each completed “storyline” in the park, their memories are wiped. The sci-fi morality tale lies in the robots’ gradual rebellion, as they become dangerously human only when their programming fails and they begin to experience memory – and with it, psychological trauma. Scientific progress facilitates both hubristic megalomania and brutal cruelty, the show seems to tell us, but it is trauma and a concomitant desire for both revenge and liberation that lies at the core of what makes us truly human."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/may/08/fiona-duncan-love-scotlands-care-system-children","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T13:00:19Z","webTitle":"Fiona Duncan: ‘We want to put love at the heart of Scotland’s care system’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/08/fiona-duncan-love-scotlands-care-system-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/08/fiona-duncan-love-scotlands-care-system-children","fields":{"headline":"Fiona Duncan: ‘We want to put love at the heart of Scotland’s care system’","bodyText":"Perhaps it should be, but “love” is not a word automatically associated with politics or policy-making. And so it felt significant when Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon, announcing a “root and branch” independent review of Scotland’s care system in October 2016, said: “Every young person deserves to be loved”. Eighteen months later, the chair of that review, Fiona Duncan, has just completed the “discovery phase” of her inquiry, asking more than 800 children with experience of the care system, alongside another 800 paid and unpaid individuals who work with them, about the word “love”. “In conversations with children and young people about love, we’ve been trying to figure out what that feels like and if the system was a loving system what would be different. We’ve been having conversations with the people responsible for delivering the system about how they would see themselves loving the children that they care for.” Ultimately, says Duncan, how can you ensure that “those travelling through what is a really complicated system come out the other end with a capacity to love”? Duncan, 50, who is chief executive of the philanthropic grant-giving foundation Corra, (formerly called the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland) has been visiting residential homes and secure care settings across Scotland as part of the review and insists that she wants these conversations to build throughout the sector. “The thing that will make this [review] stick,” she argues, is that it will be a “consensus of thousands”. The review takes places at a time when only 4% of children who grow up in care in Scotland go to university, almost half will have mental health problems, and close on a third will become homeless. Sturgeon described these statistics as “simply unacceptable” when she appointed Duncan to the job. At the same time, horrors are being revealed at the ongoing Scottish public inquiry into historical abuse of children in residential care in the country including at the notorious Smyllum Park orphanage. Duncan says brilliant practice is going on across Scotland, but “there’s also practice that isn’t making a positive different to children and young people’s lives, that could stop”. Examples include multiple placements, or brothers and sisters being separated, “something that has a massive impact at the point of going into care”. The early stages of the review have also identified “things that work in most settings, but need rocket fuel”, as well as “gaps in evidence where we want to do tests and pilots”. (The references to tests and fuel comes from the children Duncan is consulting, in a deliberate effort to demystify the process.) The next stage of the review will explore the issues that have been identified as requiring more in-depth study, including how to prevent children on the edges of care from entering it; what happens at the end of their time in care; and how the system is best inspected. Duncan herself experienced the care system when she was a child, a fact that she is happy to acknowledge but unwilling to expand on. “The place that I’ve settled on is that my job is to listen and to understand, and possibly I’m more able to do that in an empathetic way because of my own life,” she explains. “But this review is not about my life, it’s about figuring out what should happen for the next generation. If I talked about myself there’s a risk that that would be what the story would be about, so it’s a very deliberate decision.” One professional admirer, of whom there are many, describes how Duncan “fills the room with positivity and humour”. But her seriousness and drive are also evident. As well as spending “huge amounts of time on beanbags”, Duncan has conducted a rigorous data analysis. “This is the most important thing I have ever been asked to do and the conversations I have had with children and young people are a huge privilege. They are trusting me and the review to listen properly. There’s learning in every single story. I intend to honour them all.” So what does a good outcome for this inquiry look like in five or 10 years’ time? “At the moment the system works in silos, rubbing up against one another and creating delays, barriers, stigma, and the child is often ricocheted around this operating structure,” says Duncan. She is unequivocal about the solution: “Everything should be focused around the child, and the system should be supportive and loving towards the child.

The vessel rammed into the Greek gunboat, Armatalos, early on Friday within hours of Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, giving a keynote speech on the island. “After the incident, the cargo ship increased speed and made off to Turkey’s nearest coast without responding to the radio messages of the Armartalos,” the Hellenic Navy said. A Navy statement described the pre-dawn collision as occurring in Greek national waters in flagrant violation of international law. “There were no injuries,” it said. Turkey’s transport ministry also announced that there was no threat of “casualties or environmental pollution”. But while damage to the warship – part of a Nato-led operation monitoring illegal migration flows in the Aegean – was also described as minimal, the incident highlighted the friction between the countries. Tensions have been running unusually high in recent months. This week Nikos Kotzias, Greece’s foreign minister, said Ankara had “come close” to “crossing a red line” when a Turkish patrol boat rammed a Greek coastguard ship off a disputed Aegean isle in February. The two neighbours nearly went to war over the uninhabited islet in 1996. “If there hadn’t been a calm and composed approach on the Greek side, no one can say where this could have led,” Kotzias told Skai TV. Senior figures in Greece’s military and naval command have expressed nervousness that the scene is being set for a clash ahead of crucial presidential elections in Turkey next month. The Islamic-leaning Justice and Development party (AKP) has joined forces with the Nationalist Movement party (MHP) to contend the election at the request of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the president. The nationalists are virulently at odds with Greece over Cyprus, and other territorial disputes, and have laid claim to numerous inhabited isles in the Aegean. “We are tracking a lot of Greek nervousness and worry among the military,” said one western diplomat. “There is genuine concern over the rise in what are regarded as provocative violations.” With air violations and mock dogfights also increasing dramatically, it is vital that channels of communication remain open if the danger of miscalculation and miscommunication is to be kept at bay, military observers say. “And, sadly, at the moment we are not seeing a lot of that,” the diplomat added. Last month, Turkish warplanes flew dangerously close to a military transport helicopter carrying the Greek prime minister over the Aegean. In a separate incident, Greek troops fired warning shots at a Turkish helicopter as it flew over an outlying Aegean island. Turkish fighter jets in defiance of a gentleman’s agreement to respect religious holidays, had only hours before entered Greek airspace on Orthodox Easter Sunday. The infraction occurred over a military outpost visited earlier in the day by Panos Kammenos, the defence minister. Analysts downplayed the the idea that Friday’s collision was deliberate but did not rule it out completely. “It appears to be an accident, such accidents have happened before,” said Ioannis Michaletos at the Institute for Security and Defence analysis. “But as there have been so many incidents of late it could also have been staged. Relations between the two countries are tense and the naval theatre is one where clashes occur.” Analysts and diplomats agreed that, so far, EU member Greece had reacted coolly in a clear bid not to be drawn into combat. “Greece has more to lose,” said Michaletos. “In the event of a hot incident, tourism would lose greatly and that could mean the final collapse of the economy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/04/bruce-tulloh-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T17:05:50Z","webTitle":"Bruce Tulloh obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/04/bruce-tulloh-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/04/bruce-tulloh-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Bruce Tulloh obituary","bodyText":"Bruce Tulloh, who has died aged 82, was a runner of distinction, winning the 1962 European 5000m title on a cinder track in Belgrade – running, as usual, barefoot. Further, he stunned his opponents by sprinting for home fully 700m out. The winter before the championships, Tulloh had spent some time in New Zealand, where he raced against Peter Snell, the Olympic 800m champion. On a grass track in Whanganui, Tulloh broke the four-minute mile, running 3min 59.3sec. It was no match for Snell, who broke the world mile record with a time of 3min 54.4sec in the same race, but it was January in New Zealand, not Belgrade in September, and it was a much longer race, 5000m, that Tulloh was preparing for. Come that September evening, in the dimly lit JNA Stadium in Belgrade, everything went to plan. Tulloh broke away on the penultimate lap to win relatively comfortably, though he did much later admit to feeling “scared stiff” that he was going to be caught. It was also the race that Brendan Foster’s father dragged his son in from playing football to watch. “My first inspiration,” said Foster, later also a European 5000m champion, “was provided by Bruce Tulloh.” In Tulloh’s youthful imagination, he was foremost a novelist. However, while his literary ambitions were pushed to the background by running, his career was as diverse as his imagination: as well as his track successes (he was a multiple British record holder and a four-minute miler), he broke the record for running across the US, when Forrest Gump hadn’t been invented; ran with the Tarahumara Indians in Mexico in 1971, nearly 40 years before they were rediscovered; and became a regular visitor to Kenya, coaching, among others, the Kenyan Mike Boit to Olympic bronze and Richard Nerurkar of Britain to victory in the 1993 World Cup marathon. Born in Datchet, Berkshire, but brought up on the north Devon coast, at Instow, it was on the nearby beaches that he first ran barefoot. His mother, Margaret (nee Branfoot), was a botanist and a keen runner in her youth, who worked as a housekeeper and matron after separating from Bruce’s father, Tony, an army captain. Bruce’s grandfather paid for his education at Wellington college, where his running started with more intent, but no great success. Only when he did his national service in Hong Kong did his performances step up a gear. Though Tulloh did not consider himself to be a natural athlete, in his prime few seemed more physically suited to their occupation. He was 5ft 7½in tall and extremely light, on occasion only 52kg (8st 3lb). “Like Lester Piggott, but not as wealthy,” he would say. His style was distinctive too; head rolling, elbows out and, for his height, a disproportionately long stride, which ate up the ground. After national service, Tulloh studied botany at Southampton, graduating in 1959, and then agricultural science at Cambridge. He won his first national title in 1959, and earned selection for the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. But he suffered in the heat and missed qualifying for the final by a single place. There were no world athletics championships in those days and Tulloh’s next target was the European Championships in Belgrade two years later. After his 1962 triumph, the 1964 Tokyo Games could not come soon enough. As it turned out, they came at exactly the wrong time. “I really felt I had a good chance of winning,” Tulloh told Roy Plomley in a 1974 edition of Desert Island Discs. But, in June, just four months before the Games, Tulloh caught German measles from his 18-month-old son, Clive. “I was never really the same for the rest of that season,” said Tulloh, who missed the event. There was to be no final throw of the dice for Tulloh, who felt that the allocation of the 1968 Games to Mexico was palpably wrong. “As a biologist I knew the effect of running at that sort of altitude, 7,500ft, and like a lot of distance runners I thought it was very unfair.” Ironically what he chose to do instead would have been considered by most people as far more challenging. Tulloh decided to run across the US. The record was held by a South African, Don Shepherd, who had taken 73 days. “He’d done it the hard way. He’d taken a bus to Los Angeles and run back to New York carrying everything on his back,” said Tulloh, “I don’t believe in suffering unnecessarily so I did it in much more comfort.” His wife, Sue (nee Baker), whom he had married in 1961, and Clive accompanied him. They had a car and a caravan and were sponsored by British Leyland, Schweppes and the Observer, which had commissioned a weekly column. In 1969, after years as an amateur athlete, Tulloh became a professional. Even with his support team (and for once wearing shoes) Tulloh’s run was gruelling. He averaged 45 miles per day; slightly less early on, more as he got “fitter”. He was not allowed to run on freeways, unless it was the only road out of town. “It was at times like running on the M1,” said Tulloh. In just under 65 days, though, he completed the 2,876-mile journey, beating Shepherd’s record by eight days. Tulloh wrote a book about the experience called Four Million Footsteps. He would go on to write more than 20 books, all on athletics, including Track Athletics (1994) and Running is Easy (1996). After a period living with the Tarahumara Indians, which Tulloh wrote about for the Observer, and a two-year teaching post in Kenya, when he coached Boit, in 1973 Tulloh joined Marlborough college, where, for just over 20 years, he taught biology and, of course, looked after the athletics teams. Tulloh continued to set targets for himself, too; when 58 he ran the 1994 London Marathon in 2hr 47min to win his age group; when 60 he ran a 1hr 16min half-marathon; and, when 75, he ran the original Athens marathon with Sue and other family and friends. He is survived by Sue and their children, Clive, Jojo and Katherine. • Michael Bruce Swinton Tulloh, runner, teacher and writer, born 29 September 1935; died 28 April 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/04/west-brom-tottenham-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T15:33:48Z","webTitle":"West Brom v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/04/west-brom-tottenham-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/04/west-brom-tottenham-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"West Brom v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview","bodyText":"West Bromwich Albion have to win against Tottenham and if successful they must rely on Swansea losing again to avoid relegation for another week.

His latest TV part feels like an extraordinary combination of this trio. Cumberbatch plays Patrick Melrose in an adaptation of Edward St Aubyn’s quintet of autobiographical novels about a young man whose sexually abusive father and emotionally damaging mother lead to a heroin, cocaine and alcohol dependency that is treated first by rehab and then a writing career. The opening episode is a supreme piece of acting: a 60-minute near-monologue of craving, raving, shaking and sarcasm – occasionally interrupted by immigration officials, drug dealers, undertakers and relatives – as Melrose, in early 1980s New York, tries to collect his dead father’s ashes from a funeral parlour. Has any actor in TV history ever spoken at such speed and yet with such clarity for so long? Each episode (dramatising a single novel) is designed to have a distinct feel: the second is languid and ominous, set in Provence during the slow nightmare of Patrick’s childhood. The first two Melrose novels – Never Mind and Bad News – were published in 1992, with the sequence completed by Some Hope (1994), Mother’s Milk (2006) and At Last (2011). Although the story has taken more than a quarter of a century to reach TV, there have been previous attempts. “I think all five novels have been permanently optioned by some company or other over the last 26 years,” St Aubyn says. “But you need so many things to come together – casting, budget, director, timings – that it begins to seem incredible that anything ever gets made at all.” One problem in convincing broadcasters to commit, the novelist admits, is the nature of the protagonist. A representative paragraph of Bad News runs: “He had injected whisky, watching his burned vein turn black under the skin, just to satisfy the needle fever. He had dissolved cocaine in Perrier because the tap was too far for his imperious desire … He had woken up after passing out for thirty hours, the syringe, still half full of smack, hanging loosely from his arm …” The block to adaptation was eventually broken when the novels were published in the US in 2012. “Before that,” St Aubyn recalls, “Americans wouldn’t touch them because they were ‘too English’ or ‘too French’ or whatever.” He chose a US-UK production team of Rachael Horovitz, whose shows include HBO’s Grey Gardens, and Michael Jackson, a former channel controller at the BBC. When Cumberbatch mentioned in an online Q&amp;A that the role he most wanted to play was Patrick Melrose, they had their star. Novelist David Nicholls (Starter for Ten, One Day) had been obsessed with Melrose since picking up Never Mind in 1992, while working in a bookshop, so quickly signed on to write the screenplay. Both St Aubyn and Nicholls see aspects of Hamlet in Melrose and so felt it to be a good omen when Cumberbatch was a success in the 2015 Barbican stage production. In Bad News, Patrick wonders “How could he think his way out of the problem when the problem was the way he thought”, which is a Melrosian spin on “to be or not to be?” Strikingly, Cumberbatch recently said that “Hamlet and Melrose are the only two roles I’ve ever bucket-listed.” The attitude of novelists towards screen adaptations runs from taking the money and weeping to having, like JK Rowling, a full creative veto. Where is St Aubyn on that spectrum? “Well, I certainly haven’t been weeping and, actually, the money isn’t huge. People always imagine it’s more than it is. And I sought no control over the outcome.” The author is credited as a “consultant”, a role that mainly involved reading and commenting on Nicholls’s scripts. Initially planned as four 90-minute episodes, the series became five one-hours but after much discussion the order of the first and second novels was flipped, largely because Patrick is a child (played by Sebastian Maltz) in Never Mind, in which the brutal sexual abuse is revealed. “Cumberbatch has many talents but he can’t play a five-year-old boy,” St Aubyn remarks. “I think, in narrative terms, it works very well that viewers see Patrick as he is, and then what happened to him in the past.” Jessica Raine, who plays Patrick’s ex-girlfriend Julia, had read all the books several years ago: “I would recommend them to friends, some of whom would have very different reactions to me; they found the world too dark.” Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Patrick’s mother and the Australian actor Hugo Weaving his father. St Aubyn, who makes a cameo appearance in the third episode at a party for Princess Margaret, was often present on set, and happy to discuss the characters with the actors. “He immediately said: ‘Let me tell you about my father, and what happened to me’, ” Weaving says. “Even though I’m playing David Melrose, not St Aubyn’s father, it was good to have some sense of the man. It was a hard role to play, but he liberated me to do it without worrying about ‘the truth’ or upsetting him.” While acknowledging that the “central psychological story of the novels is true”, St Aubyn is keen to stress that they are necessarily far from being a disguised transcription of his life: “Patrick is five in the first book. Obviously, at that age, I wasn’t sitting in the corner of my parents’ dining room like a little Boswell. I made it all up, and David and Eleanor Melrose are fictional characters.” Screenwriters often complain that TV drama commissioners seek to sanitise dark material, encouraging characters to be more sympathetic. But Patrick Melrose looks and feels strikingly grownup, and Nicholls confirms that “there was no pressure to make the characters more attractive or ingratiating”. He was impressed that Cumberbatch “was quite prepared to be dislikable, self-pitying – and not to soften any of that. He shows you that Patrick’s manner is part of the damage inflicted by his upbringing. I think the usual use of wealthy people in TV drama is for aspirational, picturesque wish fulfilment – the houses, the clothes. But this show is really tough about what Patrick actually calls ‘these terrible people’.” Watching the series, it struck me that St Aubyn now had access to three different versions of some people and scenes: his memory, then the fictionalisation and now the dramatisation. Was that upsetting or strange psychologically? “It would be entirely reasonable to think that I might end up with levels of lived experience, and then the book and then the TV series, and that I would be in a snowfall of confusion about what happened when. But that isn’t how it was.” He points out that the French house in the novels was based on his grandmother’s, rather than his parents’, and the chateau in the TV series is different again, so the page and then the screen versions get progressively further from any triggering incident. “I actually think it might have been a problem if Never Mind had been filmed soon after 1992. But, by this point, the novels are a sublimation of what happened, and the TV series is a double sublimation. Clearly, I wasn’t watching the story as an innocent viewer but, as it went on, I was surprised by the extent to which I could almost do that.” • Patrick Melrose starts on Sky Atlantic on 13 May at 9pm, and will also be available through Now TV."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/04/trump-unqualified-men-rudy-giuliani","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T18:30:29Z","webTitle":"Why is Trump surrounded by cocky, unqualified and kooky men? | Richard Wolffe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/04/trump-unqualified-men-rudy-giuliani","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/04/trump-unqualified-men-rudy-giuliani","fields":{"headline":"Why is Trump surrounded by cocky, unqualified and kooky men?","bodyText":"They say you can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep. The presidency is no different: when it comes to a commander-in-chief, you can tell a lot from the aides they keep close. Barack Obama’s closest staffers were often intensely competitive, earnest, studious types who struggled to understand why the world didn’t admire their idealism and talent as much as they did. George W Bush, at least in his first term, surrounded himself with trigger-happy street fighters who confused patriotism with their own paranoia and prejudice. In the case of Donald Trump, the company he keeps is surprisingly consistent: a singular type with a shared set of character traits. They are, to a man, cocky, unqualified and kooky. You might call this the CUK theory of the Trump presidency, in honor of one of their archetypes: Steve Bannon. All the president’s men – at least, the CUKs – are a constant presence, in spite of the huge turnover among them. There was Bannon, now there’s Bolton. There was Scaramucci, now there’s Giuliani. It matters not. Trump cycles through his CUKs happily and frequently because he needs to keep one or more close through all his volatility. Let’s start with Bannon: the man who believed he was reshaping global politics. Never mind all that help from Russia and Facebook, Bannon was riding the crest of a wave of his own making. Nobody had discovered white male resentment before: not Richard Nixon, not Pat Buchanan, not even Bill Clinton. Bannon thinks he’s so good at this stuff that he was considering running for president himself in 2020. He also told Vanity Fair that getting fired from the White House was an upgrade: inside the West Wing he had influence, but outside he had real power. Cocky? Check. How unqualified was Bannon at his purported job of chief political strategist? Exhibit A is Roy Moore in Alabama, a candidate accused of child abuse, whose doomed campaign was Bannon’s great last stand. If you can’t see the limits of white male resentment in the state that built its politics on those foundations, then you have forever lost your credentials as a political strategist. Status: unqualified. Kookiness was Bannon’s calling card, his cri de coeur. You could plunge into the conspiracy-filled world of his media creation, Breitbart, to explore all the crazy theories he thrived on. Or you could read about the guy who ate green ketamine before he showed up to work, because he makes more sense. So many pundits took Bannon’s kooky ideas as some kind of mark of genius, because of 70,000 votes in three swing states and the quirks of the electoral college. But to recap, Bannon was inspired by a French occultist and Italian racialist to assert that western civilization was locked in “a new dark age” as part of an existential battle with Islam. Which just goes to show that reading books doesn’t necessarily make you less kooky. Where does John Bolton, the latest in a long line of Trump’s national security advisers, sit on the CUK scale? If Bannon is a perfect 10, Bolton is a nine. People who worked with him in the Bush administration say he’s arrogant, when they’re trying to be diplomatic – a quality that Bolton lacks entirely. Bolton even maintains his arrogance about his biggest, most obvious disaster: his cheerleading for the invasion of Iraq. When Tucker Carlson, of Fox News fame, asked him if the war in Iraq had empowered his great enemies in Iran, Bolton said: “No, because I think your analysis is simple-minded, frankly.” Calling the supremely cocky Tucker Carlson “simple-minded” is a power play in the league of cocky politics. This takes us directly to his obvious lack of qualifications to manage national security for the world’s greatest military force. In addition to his colossal errors of judgment about Iraq, he is a hothead and a disastrously bad manager. He isn’t even on the same page as his boss about talking to North Korea, having spent a career trashing them as serial liars and conmen. Which brings us to his kookiness. This is a national security adviser who recently advocated for a pre-emptive strike against North Korea. This is a former UN ambassador who believed the top 10 floors of the UN could be demolished with no impact on the organization. He only drops a point on the CUK scale because of the lack of occultist influence. Anthony “the Mooch” Scaramucci is an epic example of the president’s favorite man. Cocky doesn’t come close to the extravagant strutting and preening of a man who claimed everyone else was obsessed with their own penis. The Mooch was so unqualified for the job of White House communications director that he lasted 10 or perhaps 11 days in office. That’s in a West Wing where the only qualification for a job is a pulse and never-ending praise for the boss. Which brings us to his kookiness. For the Mooch, Trump is “perhaps the least racist” person on the planet, even though he sympathizes with neo-Nazis. Trump is also “neurologically sound” even though, well, everything he has tweeted in the last 16 months. Overall on the CUK scale, the Mooch’s supreme cockiness balances out the relative lack of kookiness, making him a solid eight. So to our latest member of the gang: Rudy Giuliani. According to the otherwise friendly New York Post, it was Rudy’s arrogance that killed his 2008 presidential campaign. For some reason, early state voters found it a turnoff. This is a man who endorsed Trump at the Republican convention by saying the next president would carry the Giuliani torch: “What I did for New York City, Donald Trump will do for America.” If anyone had any doubts about Rudy’s qualifications to be the latest in a long line of Trump’s lawyers, this week was truly special. In a couple of Fox News interviews, Giuliani contradicted the previous official story about Trump’s lawyer paying hush money to the actress known as Stormy Daniels. Along the way, he exposed his new client to additional legal risk and managed to refocus the world’s attention on the president and a porn star on the National Day of Prayer. Pure genius. Among the many kooky theories Rudy has peddled was his repeated stirring of the pot about Hillary Clinton’s health, his obvious superiority to Beyoncé, and his recent description of FBI agents as “stormtroopers”. For all this and so much more, Rudy scores another perfect 10 as a CUK. Curious minds might wonder why this president chooses to surround himself with so many men who are cocky, unqualified and kooky. For someone so modest, so well-versed in world affairs, and so cogent, it seems so obviously out of character."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/04/quakers-and-the-relevance-of-god","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T15:41:21Z","webTitle":"Quakers and the relevance of God | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/04/quakers-and-the-relevance-of-god","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/04/quakers-and-the-relevance-of-god","fields":{"headline":"Quakers and the relevance of God","bodyText":"Simon Jenkins is correct to draw attention to the difficulty of understanding God and as evidenced in the Quakers thinking of dropping God from their “guidance to meetings” (The Quakers are right. We don’t need God, 4 May). God, as a concept, is meaningless and as such cannot be constrained or defined within the limits of human discourse or understanding. Perhaps Wittgenstein was correct when he opined: “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.” Such would reflect the Quaker approach. However, the experience of the divine, that which is transcendent, can be real, and the evidence of increased attendance at cathedrals is indicative of uplifting liturgy, art and architecture which points to something beyond ourselves, even if beyond definition. Unfortunately, Jenkins commits a not unfamiliar category error when he confuses selling with marketing. Selling is the art of persuading customers to purchase an existing product. Marketing is seeking to establish consumer wants and needs and then providing the appropriate product. Perhaps if the church were better at marketing rather than obsessed with selling, the idea of God might be more relevant to contemporary issues and concerns. David Jennings Canon theologian, Leicester cathedral • Like Simon Jenkins, we too wait in anticipation to see what decision will be made by the Quaker yearly meeting this weekend, about whether to revise the Quaker book of faith and practice. For many younger Quakers, though, a potential rewrite is about more than just language, so much as a process through which we could become as inclusive as it is possible for a faith group to be. Quaker advice is to “respect that of God in everyone though it may be expressed in unfamiliar ways”. Through this weekend and the years that follow, that is what we are committed to do. Jessica Hubbard-Bailey The Young Quaker Podcast, Gabriel Cabrera Young Friends General Meeting • Jenkins says “the Quakers are right. We don’t need God”. It depends what you mean by God. I don’t need old-time religion, but I certainly need something to cure my soul.

In power at Westminster for eight years, the economy stalling, Brexit going badly, the cabinet split, ministers resigning, council taxes rising and the Windrush scandal still vivid in the public mind, Theresa May’s party was a sitting target for an opposition party with hopes of general election success. In the past, Labour might have swept the Tories out of town halls across the country, with the Liberal Democrats pocketing plenty of gains too. This didn’t happen on Thursday. That is a significant event in itself. The post-election analysis, particularly in the Labour party, requires humility, not least because Labour had talked up its chances, especially in London. But the inquest will need open-mindedness as well as humility. Labour did not capture the London boroughs it dreamed of, and it did badly or not well enough in many places outside London. Nevertheless, Labour ran neck and neck with the Tories – 35% to 35% – in the projected national share of the vote (last year the Tories had an 11-point lead), won its best share of the local election vote since 2012 and, in London at least, it turned in some of its best borough performances for a generation. One way of reading this week’s results is to say that nothing much happened on the broad canvas, so that Thursday was overall a vote for the status quo and respective comfort zones. Relatively few local councils changed hands. No major party harvested massive seat gains. Everyone had some losses as well as wins. The two main parties were head-to-head in the opinion polls beforehand and still head-to-head when the votes were counted. Separate general election projections by the BBC and Sky News show both Labour and the Tories well short of an overall majority on the basis of this week’s voting . The one major caveat to this no-change reading is the collapse of Ukip, which was all but wiped out in these contests. Good riddance, and to the smaller hard-right parties too. Ukip and leave voters gravitated heavily to the Tories this time, a very mixed blessing for Mrs May in her Brexit battles. The Conservatives undoubtedly managed public expectations about these elections better than Labour. Party chiefs had talked their chances down to floor level before Thursday. As a result, the Tories’ narrow retention of fortress London boroughs like Wandsworth and Westminster – and the capture of Basildon and Peterborough – could be spun into a successful night’s work. In fact, the Tories had a three-point drop in share of the vote, a small net loss of councillors and were ousted in their flagship northern council Trafford. Yet Mrs May’s bruised and battered leadership, which many thought would become an issue if the results were bad, has survived yet again. Both the Greens and, in particular, the Liberal Democrats had decent nights. The latter did well in south-west London, won the mayoral contest in three-way Watford, regained Three Rivers and South Cambridgeshire and registered gains in many parts of England, from Cheltenham to Hull. But this is hardly a revival, more some decent bits of rebuilding. Even with Thursday’s 16% national share, the Lib Dems would be hard put to hold the balance of power at Westminster, according to BBC projections. The biggest questions from these elections are nevertheless those for Labour. Jeremy Corbyn always depicts a Labour party itching for a general election and confident it can win. These results do not rule that out. But they do suggest that there are difficult hurdles still to overcome. Labour’s vote share dropped from the general election. It did well in London and other cities; but it lost ground in many towns, north and south. It was taken to the second count before winning the mayoral vote in the Sheffield city region. Its position in Scotland, where there were no elections, remains difficult. The antisemitism row harmed the party in areas with significant Jewish votes. That issue, along with ambivalence about Brexit, leaked some support to the Lib Dems and the Greens. It is dishonest to say Labour had a disastrous night on Thursday. But it was certainly not a triumph either – and that could be the more lasting lesson. • This article was amended to clarify that the mayoral election in Sheffield was for the city region, not the city."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/04/windrush-scandal-no-passport-for-thousands-who-moved-to-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T17:24:58Z","webTitle":"Windrush scandal: no passport for thousands who moved to Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/04/windrush-scandal-no-passport-for-thousands-who-moved-to-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/04/windrush-scandal-no-passport-for-thousands-who-moved-to-britain","fields":{"headline":"Windrush scandal: no passport for thousands who moved to Britain","bodyText":"New census data shows that about 21,000 people who moved to the UK before 1971 have neither a British passport nor a passport from the country where they were born, giving the strongest picture so far of the possible scale of the Windrush scandal. The data reveals the number of people who may experience difficulty in proving that they are in the UK legally. About 5,200 of the people without passports were born in Caribbean countries, according to the data, suggesting there may be many more non-Windrush people struggling to prove they are not illegal immigrants. Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: “The statistics show us that there are large numbers of people who entered the UK under similar policies who are not from the Caribbean. We don’t know from the data whether some people from some countries are more likely to have problems with the absence of documentation, but certainly there is no reason to think that this will be an issue for people exclusively from the Caribbean.” It is not clear why the majority of cases have so far centred on people born in Caribbean countries. This data could indicate that the full extent of the Windrush scandal may eventually spread beyond the large numbers of people affected from Caribbean nations or it might suggest there has been some level of discrimination which has meant that people from Caribbean countries have disproportionately experienced difficulties. The new census data is consistent with previous analysis of Commonwealth migrants living in the UK who arrived before 1971, published by the Migration Observatory, but provides a more accurate count and gives more detailed information about the physical documents people hold. “It shows that 90% of around 600,000 Commonwealth migrants who came to the UK before 1971 and were still resident here in 2011 held a British passport and that 57,000 did not, which is similar to our earlier analysis of the labour force survey,” Sumption said. “Perhaps more importantly though, it shows that about 21,000 pre-1971 Commonwealth migrants did not have any passport at all. This group is likely to be at highest risk of getting into trouble with the immigration enforcement measures that led to the so-called ‘Windrush’ cases. Of course, people without a passport may still be able to demonstrate their legal status with other evidence, such as a naturalisation certificate or another immigration document.” The Home Office said: “While this data shows which people in this cohort did not hold a passport on the day of the census, this does not necessarily mean that they have never held a passport or that their residency status has not been fixed in other ways.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/may/09/research-every-teacher-effectiveness-student-evaluation-teachers","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T09:12:12Z","webTitle":"Research every teacher should know: the value of student evaluation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/may/09/research-every-teacher-effectiveness-student-evaluation-teachers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/may/09/research-every-teacher-effectiveness-student-evaluation-teachers","fields":{"headline":"Research every teacher should know: the value of student evaluation","bodyText":"There is a wealth of psychology research that can help teachers to improve how they work with students, but academic studies of this kind aren’t always easy to access or translate into the realities of classroom practice. This series seeks to redress that by taking a selection of studies and making sense of the important information for teachers, as we all seek to answer the question: how can we help our students do better at school? This time, we consider student evaluation of learning. How do schools measure how good a teacher is? Some use value-added metrics, comparing how much progress a student has made (often using test scores) versus how much progress the school would predict they should have made, some evaluate performance by observing lessons, and others ask students to rate their teachers. There are reports that some schools even use students like mystery shoppers to report back on teacher quality. But does the student evaluation of a teacher bear any relation to that teacher’s effectiveness? Are student ratings of teachers more of a popularity contest than anything else? To answer these questions, researchers from Mount Royal University in Canada reviewed existing studies in this area and published their findings in 2017 in the journal Studies in Educational Evaluation. The main findings Researchers found there was no correlation between how much students learned and how highly they rated the effectiveness of their teacher. The authors of the study stated that, “despite more than 75 years of sustained effort, there is presently no evidence supporting the widespread belief that students learn more from professors who receive higher student evaluation ratings”. Furthermore, they suggested that previous studies that had found a positive link between the two probably used a very small sample (which can make studies less reliable) or suffered from publication bias (where researchers are more likely to publish positive findings than negative ones). The authors also highlighted the difficulty of measuring how much someone has learned. “The entire notion that we could measure professors’ teaching effectiveness by simple ways such as asking students to answer a few questions about their perceptions of their course experiences, instructor knowledge, and the like seems unrealistic,” they said. Related research Other research has explored why students rate some teachers as more effective than others. Two main factors might be at play here. The first is students’ prior interest in the subject. Simply put, if we like a topic a lot then we are more likely to rate the person teaching it as very good. The opposite is also true: most students won’t like the person who makes them work hard at a subject they don’t like. The second factor influencing student evaluation is confirmation bias. In previous studies, students received a brief biography of a supply teacher that was identical except for one detail. Half the students were told a teacher was “warm”, and half that they had a “cold” personality. At the end of the lesson, students who had been primed to think of their new teacher as warm were more likely to rate them as such, while the other group was more likely to rate them as distant and aloof. Prior knowledge of a teacher’s reputation can strongly influence how a new class feels about them, regardless of their teaching practice. What this means for the classroom The authors of this review concluded that universities and colleges may need to give minimal or no weight to student evaluation ratings. This is not to say that students’ opinions about teachers are not important, but that they shouldn’t be important criteria for measuring teachers’ effectiveness. If educational institutions want their students to rate teachers as effective, championing love and passion for a subject is perhaps one of the best ways of doing so. • Bradley Busch is a registered psychologist, director at InnerDrive and author of Release Your Inner Drive.

But because of a mistake by her accountant, she has lost her job, her home and her savings. Mohite came to the UK in 2008 from a poor family in Mumbai, India. She completed her masters in pharmaceutical analysis from the University of Strathclyde with distinction and has never been out of work since while also setting up her own pharmaceutical consultancy. In 2016, Mohite applied for indefinite leave to remain (ILR), paying £2,500 for the premium, one-day service. At her interview, the Home Office pointed to a tax amendment she had made in 2013, after she discovered that her accountant had failed to declare both her pre-declared employment income – on which the taxes had already been paid – and her £15,300 income for self-employment of 2010 to 2011 on her self-assessment tax returns. “It was a very clear error – why would I choose not to declare an income on which I had already paid the tax? – and was picked up straight away by a new accountant I hired in 2013,” said Mohite. “I paid the sum right away.” Despite HMRC having accepted her £4,089.80 amendment without fines or sanctions, the Home Office used the same amendment to not only reject Mohite but serve her with a section 322(5). In the Home Office’s letter explaining the failure of her administrative review it says: “We do not find it credible that a fully qualified accountant would fail to declare the correct earnings to HMRC.” The letter then goes on, however, to say that Mohite’s application has not been refused because they suspect her of being dishonest. It says, instead, that she has been served with a 322(5) for “undesirable conduct”. Despite the Home Office’s own internal guidance to caseworkers stating that paragraph 322(5) is discretionary and should only be triggered in cases involving “criminality, a threat to national security, war crimes or travel bans”, the letter states: “Paragraph 322(5) is a suitable rule which may be used in a wide range of cases. Your caseworker has correctly identified undesirable conduct.” Neither Mohite nor her lawyer know what “undesirable conduct” she is accused of. To try to find out, Mohite ordered her case working notes from the Home Office in which her earnings were assessed. In the file, the caseworker confirms that the evidence about her income that Mohite has submitted is “genuine” and that she meets the points required for ILR. The caseworker’s “overall decision”, however, is “refuse”. “Why has the Home Office decided to go against their own case working notes? And given that they did, why wasn’t I given a chance to challenge that decision?” asked Mohite. Mohite has been unable to work since August 2016. “I had a lot of savings but now I have nothing,” she said. The only reason she can continue her legal battle is because she has friends with whom she can live for free. “I sold all my furniture, my TV and my jewellery. I’ve got three credit cards, already full, which give me 36 months’ interest-free credit. I’ve borrowed from friends and family, but I’m running out of options to survive,” she said. Mohite submitted a new ILR application last month. “I’m exhausted. Sometimes I’m suicidal,” she said. “I can’t go home with a 322(5) on my passport. I’ve got no choice but to fight. But I don’t know how long I can fight for, or what I will do if I lose that fight – or what I will do when I run out money because I have so little left.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

In the past six months, she has made the brave decision to go public with her experiences, giving an interview to the Guardian that triggered the gradual exposure of the Windrush scandal, which this week led to the resignation of the home secretary on Sunday. Wilson, 61, was delighted to return to the House of Commons for the first time since she left her job there in the early 1990s. She visited the canteen overlooking the river Thames where she had spent about a year clearing trays after MPs and parliament staff had finished their meals. On Tuesday night, she ate supper in the Commons’ Strangers’ Dining Room (where MPs can take guests), with her MP, Emma Reynolds. She was surprised and delighted to meet former colleagues who had been working there for the past 30 years. It was a very emotional and happy evening for her and her daughter Natalie Barnes. Wilson is still processing the full impact of her decision to speak out about her detention, as the government promises that the Home Office will become more “humane”, “fairer” and “compassionate”. Even if this new approach never materialises – and the repeal of some legislation would be required before things can really change – Wilson is just extremely happy that so many other people’s terrible experiences have been exposed, as a result of her account of her own treatment. “I did not realise that my story was going to become this big and bring out a lot of people with this problem. People are dying because of this, because they have nowhere to turn and no one to talk to,” she said. Wilson had agreed only reluctantly last November to speak about her immigration difficulties. One of the reasons that Windrush victims’ problems have remained hidden for so long is that it takes a lot of courage to talk publicly about having been categorised as an illegal immigrant – both generally at a time of great public hostility towards all kinds of immigrants, but particularly when the Home Office is still sending you letters informing you that you are liable for deportation. She wonders if her problems began when she approached pension age, and suspects her files may have been looked at as she was transferred on to pension department books. She lost her home in 2015, a few months after the Department for Work and Pensions stopped her disability benefit payments. “They took my flat away,” Wilson said. Barnes was amazed to hear that her mother had been classified as an illegal immigrant. For a while Wilson was so frightened at the letters she was getting from the Home Office that she did not tell her daughter about them. When her daughter found out, she was briefly quite angry with her mother. “I never, ever once thought that my mum was an illegal immigrant. I asked her why she hadn’t told me.” “I thought I was English,” Wilson said. On 18 October 2017, Wilson was detained at the Wolverhampton Home Office reporting centre where she had been reporting on a fortnightly basis since August 2015. She was put in a vehicle that reminded her of a “meat van”, because it had no windows, and taken to Yarl’s Wood for six days; she says this was the worst experience of her life. She called her daughter from the detention centre and cried uncontrollably down the line. “I said: ‘Get me out of here, Natalie, please get me out of here.’” After six days she was put in another van, and when she got out she realised she was being taken to a building next to Heathrow airport; she was told that she would be put on a plane the next day. It was only at the last minute that she was released, given a travel warrant for train tickets and let out to make her way back to Wolverhampton. “The planes were taking off over my head; I had to put my hands to my ears because of the noise,” she said. Wilson wonders if official racism was behind her treatment. As a child in Wolverhampton, she remembers being called “little black Sambo” and told “go back to your own country” and she got into fights occasionally at school because of these comments. But until this happened in 2015, she did not think racism was particularly prevalent here and she is reluctant to see Britain overall as a bad place, despite the terrible treatment she has endured over the past three years. “I have had a really good life here,” she said. But she was frustrated at the refusal of officials to listen to her repeated protestations that she was not an illegal immigrant. Usually when she went to report, staff did not want to speak to her at all. “When you go to the Home Office, they check you, they take your belt, give you a piece of paper, when your number comes up on the screen, you go to the desk, they go: tick, tick, tick and then tell you that you can go,” she said. Barnes said she tried repeatedly to get staff to realise a mistake had been made. “I got banned from the Home Office [reporting centre] because of my questions and because I was telling them that my mum is not illegal, she is a British citizen. They told me that they can’t answer any questions through the screen, that you have to speak to your caseworker. They said we had a caseworker, but we never, ever met one in two and a half years, so I don’t know,” she said. Wilson said she felt the political crisis had not ended with Rudd’s resignation. “I’m not a political person, but they’re hiding something. This has been going on for a very long time,” she said. She has still not been told why she was released or why she was detained in the first place. “I still don’t know,” she said. Over supper she reflected on her lucky escape. “Just imagine if I had been deported to Jamaica. Where would I have gone? I don’t know anybody there.” Barnes said she had been very nervous about encouraging her mother to speak to the media about her situation, but when she met other Windrush victims in the House of Commons on Tuesday, she realised how important her mother’s story had been. “I’m so glad we spoke out and I’m so glad it meant so many other people came forward with their stories and that now they are all being recognised as British citizens – which is what they are. This has changed my mum: it has brought her confidence back. She can’t stop smiling,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/04/may-commons-defeat-fixed-odds-betting-terminals","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T16:07:15Z","webTitle":"May risks Commons revolt over fixed-odds betting terminals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/04/may-commons-defeat-fixed-odds-betting-terminals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/04/may-commons-defeat-fixed-odds-betting-terminals","fields":{"headline":"May risks Commons revolt over fixed-odds betting terminals","bodyText":"Theresa May risks a defeat in the House of Commons unless the government slashes stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from £100 to £2, with a decision expected as early as Thursday. A group of Conservative MPs, led by Iain Duncan Smith and thought to number more than 25, will write to the prime minister at the beginning of next week, urging her not to waver in the face of last-ditch lobbying by bookmakers. A draft version of the letter, seen by the Guardian, says it is the government’s “moral duty” to restrict FOBTs, which they say “are causing many social harms and leading to huge financial losses for those who can least afford it”. Given the support for a £2 stake from every other political party, the strength of feeling among Conservatives means a more lenient approach would put May at risk of becoming the first prime minister to suffer a defeat on a statutory instrument since James Callaghan 40 years ago. Matt Hancock, the minister for digital, culture, media and sport, will announce the final decision. Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and long-time campaigner against FOBTs, said: “We now have a situation where if the government proposes a stake any higher than £2 they face being defeated by their own party in the House of Commons.” Bookmakers, who derive more than half of their revenues from FOBTs, wrote to all cabinet ministers this week to warn of “catastrophic” consequences – including the closure of high street shops with the loss of thousands of jobs – if stakes fall to £2. The eleventh-hour plea came after they lost a key ally in Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who had raised concerns about the impact of a £2 stake on the Treasury’s tax take, but has since dropped his opposition. A senior betting industry source said that bookmakers are also urging the government to allow them a year’s grace to change FOBT software once a decision is made. The source said this was a stalling tactic because bookmakers are more likely to do away with FOBTs altogether and are already preparing to replace them by installing more self-service betting terminals (SSBTs), which automate the process of laying bets on sport. Matt Zarb-Cousin, an anti-FOBT campaigner, said this cast doubt on the bookies’ public statements of concern about the impact of new curbs on staff. “The bookies warn of staff cuts if FOBTs are capped at £2 but with the introduction of more SSBTs they are automating their staff out of a job.” In their letter to MPs, gambling bosses including the chief executives of William Hill, Betfred and GVC which is in the process of a £4bn takeover of Ladbrokes, proposed a series of alternatives to a £2 stake. They suggested a reduction to £30, systems to allow customers to block their own debit card from gambling transactions and “hard stops” limiting losses to £500. Figures from the Gambling Commission have previously shown that gamblers are losing up to £14,000 in a day, with 233,000 sessions ending in losses of more than £1,000 in 2015-16. The executives also called for the government to tighten up regulations on gambling advertising. This could do less damage to bookmakers than it would to well-established online rivals, who rely on advertising to build awareness of their brands."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/15/venezuela-brazil-hunger-highway","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T05:30:48Z","webTitle":"Hunger Highway: desperate Venezuelans take hard road to Brazil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/venezuela-brazil-hunger-highway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/15/venezuela-brazil-hunger-highway","fields":{"headline":"Hunger Highway: desperate Venezuelans take hard road to Brazil","bodyText":"Daniel Guerra hit the Hunger Highway at dawn hoping to steal a march on the punishing heat of Brazil’s northern savannah and consign 21st-century socialism to his past. “Necessity forced me to come,” explained the 24-year-old Venezuelan as he trudged along the BR-174, a 215km (134-mile) ribbon of asphalt that cuts south across the Brazilian Amazon and is the main entry point for tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants fleeing economic meltdown back home. A month earlier, Guerra had watched with joy as his first child, a baby girl called Carmeyn, was born, nearly 1,000km north in the Venezuelan city of Maturín. Already, though, he had been forced to abandon her, propelled over the border into Brazil in search of food, work and, perhaps eventually, a fresh start for his family. “It was so difficult, just imagine,” Guerra said of the decision to leave his child. Guerra’s four marching companions, like him penniless, famished and unshaven, nodded grimly in agreement. “There’s no future in Venezuela,” said José Luis Moya, a 24-year-old from the north-eastern state of Anzoátegui who was making the trek with a gaping hole in his right sole. “We’re escaping because we don’t want to die.” Mired in economic, political and social crisis, Venezuela will hold a presidential election on 20 May – a vote the country’s mainstream opposition will boycott and which much of the international community has condemned as rigged. President Nicolás Maduro, who took power after Hugo Chávez’s death in 2013, rejects such criticism and has pledged to use a second term to bring a “new era of rebirth, hope and renewal” to a country critics say he has brought to its knees. For the 5,000 Venezuelans reported by the UN to be streaming out of the country each day those are fantastical claims. “Let’s be clear: we have no hope,” said Yorquis Rísquez, a 24-year-old mother who fled into Brazil earlier this year and now lives with her family in a dilapidated squat in the city of Boa Vista. “There’s no such thing as hope in Venezuela under this government. Our hope is bringing our kids here.” More than a million Venezuelans have headed west to Colombia since an exodus some call Latin America’s worst-ever migration crisis began in 2015, fueled by a toxic cocktail of economic strife and rampant violence. But a growing number, like Rísquez and her family, are choosing Brazil, which many see as a safer and, so far, less oversubscribed destination. For those unable to pay a bus fare, that means a grueling odyssey on foot down a road Brazil’s press has dubbed the Rota da Fome or Hunger Highway. The Highway starts just over the border from Venezuela, in the town of Pacaraima, and runs south to the regional capital Boa Vista, through the São Marcos indigenous reserve – a tapestry of sun-scorched settlements that are home to the Macuxi, Taurepang and Wapichana peoples. Media reports have highlighted the growing animosity towards migrants as they flock to this sparsely populated borderland, as well as their exploitation by unscrupulous ranchers. Several towns have seen protests; in one a shelter was ransacked. Brazil’s far-right presidential frontrunner, Jair Bolsonaro, fanned those flames during a recent visit to Boa Vista, where thousands of Venezuelans are camped out in public squares, abandoned buildings or army-run shelters. “Nobody wants to show them the red card, load them on to trucks and send them back … But we also can’t carry on like this.” Yet the migrants have also found solidarity and kindness along the BR-174. “Today it’s them, but tomorrow it could be us,” said Oton Guimarães, the deputy tuxaua, or chief, of Vila Três Corações, a Macuxi village about 110km, or two days’ walk, south of Pacaraima. Seated in the shade of a tamarind tree, the softly spoken 67-year-old recalled how his community had opened its arms to Venezuela’s tired, poor and huddled masses, on the condition they obeyed local rules: “No fooling around, no disrespect, no alcohol.” “They show up here with their feet covered in blisters, very weak, dehydrated,” the headman said, adding poetically: “It’s an adventure, a destiny with no address.” Guimarães said dozens of passing migrants were offered free board and lodging in exchange for their work. “They’re trustworthy folk … They do a bit of everything and we are thankful,” he said. For a time, Guimarães even opened his own home to a migrant. “He built this toilet for me,” he remembered, pointing to a breeze-block outhouse nearby. Not all of the Highway’s indigenous communities have been so welcoming. In Entroncamento, village chief Maria Joana da Silva said she pitied the migrants. “But there’s nothing we can do … We don’t want them living here. “Lots of prisoners were released over there in Venezuela,” she added suggestively. In Boca da Mata, another roadside hamlet, chief Leoneide Torres said it was her Christian duty to help the families she often saw splayed out beside the road: “They arrive in a seriously precarious state. It’s hunger, real hunger.” But Torres, 53, was nervous too. “Our biggest worry is that in among them there are traffickers, drugs. We know this is happening. Some of them are coming over the hills back there … they have a detour so they don’t have to pass through the checkpoint.” Despite such suspicions, Efraín Godoy, a restaurant worker from the city of Barcelona, on Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, said he had been humbled by the reception he had received from the Macuxi. Godoy, 29, remembered staggering into Vila Três Corações in February, after three days on the Highway, sunburned, covered in insect bites and so dehydrated he was on the verge of vomiting. Locals offered him a hammock in the malocão – a traditional palm-thatched hut at the heart of their village – and, weeks later, he could be found helping cater for a summit of indigenous teachers that his adoptive home was hosting. “It’s all new to me … new and marvelous,” enthused Godoy, who planned to stay until his application for refugee status is approved and he can start looking for work to help the eight-member family he had left behind. Venezuela was marching backwards but Godoy was determined not to do the same, using his exile to learn Brazil’s language, Portuguese, and study its indigenous traditions. “It’s a unique experience that will stay with me forever.” For Guerra’s ragtag expedition such a reception still lay several days off – and their final destination, Boa Vista, further still. After a 15km slog in searing Amazonian heat they paused at Sorocaima, the first indigenous village south of the border. Guerra slumped to the ground outside a butcher’s shop, too exhausted to speak and apparently suffering from heat stroke. His comrades, though, were defiant, vowing to march on through the night. Moya said the Highway’s hardships paled into comparison with the suffering back home. “I feel happy because I’m moving towards a future,” he said as the men prepared to hit the Highway once again. “In Venezuela I felt dead. At least walking I have hope.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/04/robot-revolution-could-give-us-bread-and-roses","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T15:42:06Z","webTitle":"Robot revolution could give us bread and roses | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/04/robot-revolution-could-give-us-bread-and-roses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/04/robot-revolution-could-give-us-bread-and-roses","fields":{"headline":"Robot revolution could give us bread and roses","bodyText":"John Harris asks what happens next to all the jobs that technology will obliterate (Ten million jobs could be gone in 15 years. What then?, 30 April). He fears that inequality will worsen. Not necessarily. Let robots do the boring, repetitive stuff. Humans can do all those jobs required to create a better life for all, and provide decent pay and good working conditions to boot. It’s not rocket science. We need many more care, support, youth and early years workers. In fact, we pretty much need to reinvent local government and the services it should provide. Our parks, green and other spaces need workers to create pleasant environments (we once had such workers). We know the NHS is in crisis and that without investment – including increasing staff numbers – the future is bleak. In addition, a progressive government needs to rejuvenate our education system. That means developing a truly comprehensive system under democratic control. And it should enable us to learn for learning’s sake (gone will be the 40-plus-hour working week) as well as offering high-quality education and training throughout life for work, leisure and citizenship engagement. Perhaps a citizens’ income is the way forward, or maybe a genuine offer of decent work, at least for those who can. Either way, a dignified and adequate income for all: bread and roses. Can this happen? Yes, if we adopt what Rutger Bregman has suggested in his book Utopia for Realists, alongside a fair, redistributive tax system. Jol Miskin Sheffield • Even if one makes the dubious assumption that no new jobs are created, the loss of 10m jobs over 15 years is a mere 2% of all jobs per year and means a welcome rise in labour productivity, and thus potential real per capita income. It is modest compared with the productivity rises of around 4% a year during the postwar boom. Harris discusses the need for better education and training to meet this challenge. But the crucial question for the left is how jobs are distributed across the working population and who receives the benefits of productivity rises in higher wages. A fall in average weekly hours of work would avoid rising unemployment and enables more time with, and caring for, friends and relatives. However, firms have no wish to reduce the length of the working week – rather the opposite. This beneficial path would, therefore, require a leap in democratic control over production. The same is true for achieving a beneficial social and geographical distribution of jobs. Dr Jamie Gough Sheffield • John Harris is right to say the left has articulated no comprehensive answer to the existing and future threats posed to employment by automation. Key to this must be prioritising labour-intensive sectors that are difficult to automate, such as health, education and elderly care. Equally key is a climate-friendly infrastructure programme. Crucial to this will be to make the UK’s 30m buildings super-energy efficient, thus dramatically reducing energy bills, fuel poverty and greenhouse gas emissions. The housing crisis should be tackled by building affordable, highly insulated new homes, predominantly on brown field sites, and local public transport links need to be rebuilt. This massive work programme would provide a secure career structure for decades, and would involve a large number of apprenticeships and professional jobs, as well as opportunities for the self-employed and local small businesses. It can be paid for by “people’s quantitative easing”, from fairer taxes, local authority bonds and green ISAs. Since such savers are likely to be predominantly older, this would also be a necessary exercise in intergenerational solidarity.

He rang the bell, walked in and asked for political asylum. It was Julian Assange. Days earlier, he had lost his long legal fight against extradition to Sweden, where two women accused him of rape. Soon afterwards, the left-leaning then president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, agreed to Assange’s request, precipitating a major diplomatic row with the British government. And a full-blown siege. Metropolitan police officers swarmed outside the building, ready to arrest Assange should he venture out. It was against this febrile backdrop that Correa authorised a secret programme named “Operation Guest”. It was later renamed “Operation Hotel”. The guest was Assange, politely referred to as el huésped. The goal, at first, was to stop detectives bursting into the modest ground-floor embassy and dragging Assange away. But documents seen by the Guardian show it developed into something more complex. The aim seems to have changed from protecting Assange – which propped up WikiLeaks in the process – to spying on him. Whatever its aims, WikiLeaks was able to keep going up to and beyond its role in the 2016 US presidential election, with all the seismic consequences. It was WikiLeaks that published hacked emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and senior Democratic officials, leading to claims that it was part of an alleged Kremlin plot to undermine Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump. How WikiLeaks got the emails in the first place is an enduring mystery. Did someone drop them off to Assange on a flash drive? Were the files uploaded on to an encrypted remote server? Or did they come in by some other route? Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the election, is looking for the answer. The secret records seen by the Guardian and the magazine Focus Ecuador may give him important new clues. According to the documents, the counter-espionage effort began nearly six years ago when a team secretly installed CCTV cameras in the Ecuadorian embassy. They covered the entrance lobby, a meeting room and the mini-balcony from which Assange would periodically address supporters. The agents filmed everyone who came in and out, and kept watch on the street.Security personnel worked two-person shifts and were on duty 24 hours a day. They do not appear to have recorded Assange’s conversations, documents suggest. However, they were able to observe him closeup, noting his moods, habits and sleeping patterns. None of this came cheap. The documents set out how Ecuador’s intelligence agency, known as Senain, hired an international security company. Its bill in 2012 was $55,000 (£40,000) a month, paid from a “special expenses” government budget. They detail how the company’s agents slept 100 metres (330ft) away from the embassy, in a multi-tenant Edwardian mansion block in Basil Street. Unbeknown to Ecuadorian taxpayers, the operatives were camping out in one of the most expensive parts of London, albeit in a basic basement flat with two bedrooms, which cost £2,800 a month. From a control room, the security team oversaw Assange’s contacts. They consulted with him about anyone wanting to visit. If he agreed, guests were allowed in. They were met in the foyer, went through a security check, and handed over their passports and mobile phones. The documents show that operatives wrote down passport numbers, nationalities and the purposes of the visits. These included “social reunion”, “medical”, “legal” or “VIP”. They clocked when the guest arrived and when they exited, in the early months past a phalanx of armed police waiting in uniform on the embassy’s front steps. At the beginning of the crisis, when the small Andean nation was facing off against the might of the British state, officers lurked on the interior stairs and next to the embassy toilet. Every month, the security company sent a confidential list of Assange’s visitors to the Ecuadorian president. There were additional “extraordinary” reports. Sometimes, the company included stills from secret video footage of interesting guests, plus profiles and analysis. They also reported when a packet of sweets was lobbed on to the balcony, seemingly a present for Assange. It is these visitor logs that will interest Mueller. He is reportedly close to indicting Russian hackers allegedly behind the raid on the Democrats’ electronic servers and seems to view WikiLeaks as an integral part of the Kremlin’s multifaceted espionage operation. The FBI has interviewed at least one source close to Operation Guest, it is understood. Assange has refused to say how the emails got to WikiLeaks. He denies they came from a “state actor”. The FBI does not appear to believe him. Giving evidence last year, the agency’s then director, James Comey, told Congress that Moscow was behind the DNC cyber-raid. An “intermediary”, he said, passed the emails to WikiLeaks. Assange’s relationship with Moscow is certainly longstanding. In 2011, he signed a deal with the Kremlin-owned television network RT. The Julian Assange Show featured 10 guests, including Correa. Weeks after Assange’s interview with Correa was broadcast, the Australian sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy. The logs record that Assange had more than 80 visitors in one month in 2016. They included the WikiLeaks staff member Sarah Harrison and longtime supporters such as Craig Murray, the UK’s former ambassador to Uzbekistan. Another was the Croatian philosopher Srećko Horvat. There were also visits from Assange’s lawyer Gareth Peirce and Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline Club, who hosted WikiLeaks at his Norfolk mansion for 13 months up until Assange jumped bail. On 23 June 2016, RT broadcast a referendum special from inside the embassy, with the final guests leaving at 4.30am. The external surveillance team wrote up descriptions of these encounters. They were sent back to Senain and Correa, sources say. The then Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, visited Assange in London, talking with him into the early hours, and criticised Britain for failing to find a solution to the standoff. The UK was unmoved. Asked what the government planned to do about Assange, the then foreign minister, Hugo Swire, said: “Not my stone, not my shoe.” Correa had no immediate comment on the operation. He has previously decried the UK’s attempts to arrest Assange, saying his country would not tolerate “colonialism of any kind”. Meanwhile, leaked invoices show the Ecuadorian government spent as much as $28m on surveillance equipment, sold only to states. What it was used for and by whom is unclear. By 2014, it appears tensions over Assange were growing. The documents reveal that Ecuador’s then ambassador to the UK, Juan Falconí Puig, forwarded a complaint to Senain after a bill arrived for unpaid council tax from Kensington and Chelsea. The tax was payable on the agents’ clandestine flat in Basil Mansions. Falconí had no idea it existed. He rang Patiño, demanding to know what was going on, according to sources in Quito. That autumn, the security consultants reported that Assange had somehow set up his own secret communications network. Moreover, they said he had “violated” the embassy’s computers and was apparently reading confidential diplomatic traffic, the company reported. Embassy staff apparently kept their personal files on Assange in a safe – the one place he could not access. The head of Ecuadorian intelligence, Rommy Vallejo, held a meeting with Patiño to discuss the Assange situation and the “risks” he posed to embassy staff. Over time, Assange came to take up more than one-third of the embassy’s ground-floor space. Initially, he slept in narrow room next to the balcony. He subsequently colonised a back room as a bedroom and occupied half the kitchen. Assange’s unkempt realm was home to WikiLeaks and its computers, and was entirely private. There was no CCTV. It was off limits to diplomats, the rooms only accessible via special codes. Patiño brushed off these concerns. His solution to this internal takeover was to dispatch three undercover intelligence officers from Quito to increase security, documents show. The Assange bill was already causing friction with Ecuador’s financial chief. The new state agents cost an extra $35,000 a month, paid out on top of the security company’s monthly invoice, which had climbed to $97,000. Documents show the private security team’s duties included keeping an eye on Hans Crescent, the street outside the embassy. It reported demonstrations in support of Assange, noting that they became smaller each year. There was a strange visit by an American superfan who spent two days outside the embassy sleeping in a car. Protesters who took part in an anti-Correa demonstration were surreptitiously photographed. On one occasion, the team sent back images of a young man in a suit whom they deemed suspicious. Much of their job involved monitoring British police officers stationed outside. Scotland Yard later scaled back its presence outside the embassy and withdrew officers altogether in 2017, when Sweden dropped its investigation into alleged sexual offences, which Assange has always denied. In November 2017, the team filed an “extraordinary” 10-page report on a visit by two Catalan separatists, Oriol Soler and Arnau Grinyó. The meeting might “trigger criticism” from Madrid if it leaked, they concluded. Assange tweeted that same day in support of Catalan secession. Over time, Ecuador’s counter-espionage operation became mundane. In January, the agents noted that a new cleaner had started work. Typically, Assange would hold private conversations in the women’s bathroom, they wrote in a daily log. Visitors noticed that he used a “squelch box”, a counter-surveillance device that emitted a loud sound. Letters arrived for him, as did flowers, the agents noted. The flowers were thrown away “according to protocol”. Sometimes, Assange smoked a pipe. His mood was generally placid. On occasion, there were angry eruptions, sympathetically interpreted by the agents who could understand his frustration after being in the embassy for such a long time. The agents faithfully recorded visits from Bolivia’s former foreign minister, as well as such high-profile guests as Pamela Anderson, Vivienne Westwood and Yanis Varoufakis. Early this year, Assange’s most frequent visitor was the legal analyst Stella Morris, a member of his legal team. Journalists and film-makers have been frequent guests. They included the Guardian’s Ewen MacAskill, who visited twice in January and February to discuss Assange’s confinement and his prospects for the future. In February, there were no more visits recorded for two weeks. This barren spell was marked across a line as “sin visitas”. Friends conceded that after almost six years in the embassy, Assange was visibly suffering, and in poor health, although they described him as mentally robust. At weekends, embassy staff go home, leaving him with no one to talk to apart from a solitary guard. The logs do not explain how WikiLeaks received the 70,000 Democratic emails that had been hacked. By the spring of this year, developments in Quito had moved in an ominous direction for Assange. Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, pronounced him a costly “inherited problem” and made it clear that he viewed Assange as an obstacle to better relations with the US. As a candidate, Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks when it revealed embarrassing Democratic party secrets. When Assange released the email correspondence of the Clinton aide John Podesta, Trump exclaimed: “I love WikiLeaks.” Before and after the election, Donald Trump Jr exchanged a handful of direct Twitter messages with Assange. Seemingly, the Trump White House changed its view when Wikileaks dumped out classified CIA hacking tools. The agency’s then director, Mike Pompeo, who was later made secretary of state, dubbed WikiLeaks a “hostile intelligence service”. In March, Assange’s internet access was cut off. A jammer was installed to prevent him from accessing emails. For more than a month, he has been forbidden visitors. Friends say he is passing the time by reading. They say he is leafing through books on the US election, which WikiLeaks did so much to influence and – its critics allege – subvert. Meanwhile, Correa, Assange’s protector and patron, has moved to Belgium. He has since landed at job at RT. Last week, the embassy appeared deserted. Nearby, well-heeled passengers emerged from Bentleys and Mercedes outside Harrods. Six supporters held banners that said “Free Assange” and #ReconnectJulian. A violinist serenaded him from the pavement. There was no sign of the guest, but the window next to his balcony was open. Assange faces a tough choice. If he walks out of the embassy, he can expect arrest and could spend up to a year in prison for breaking his bail conditions. The US might then seek to extradite him. He would contest any attempt, and might win, but would face a long, uncomfortable spell behind bars while his case is decided. Ecuadorian government sources say Quito is considering a plan for where Assange might go next. Russia would be an obvious choice, though this would cause problems with the US. Cuba and Venezuela are also said to be under discussion. Since January, Assange has officially been an Ecuadorian diplomat. However, this probably would not stop the UK arresting him if it had the chance. If Assange remains in the embassy, cut off from the world, WikiLeaks cannot function. Either way, it is clear that Ecuador no longer wants him. His future is more uncertain than ever. The most likely scenario is that he will soon walk out the door."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/04/home-office-criticised-disabled-man-accommodation-with-steps","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T09:45:06Z","webTitle":"Home Office criticised for giving wheelchair user accommodation with steps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/04/home-office-criticised-disabled-man-accommodation-with-steps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/04/home-office-criticised-disabled-man-accommodation-with-steps","fields":{"headline":"Home Office criticised for giving wheelchair user accommodation with steps","bodyText":"A high court judge has criticised the home secretary, Sajid Javid, for failing to provide safe and suitable accommodation for a vulnerable disabled man after his release from detention. The 44-year-old man, who uses a wheelchair following a stroke and is legally defined as lacking mental capacity, could not get into accommodation provided by the Home Office on Wednesday night because it had steps and nobody answered the door. The confused man was forced to wait in the street. Later, he was driven around London for part of the night by the taxi driver who brought him to the address after his release from detention. He was placed in a hostel as a temporary measure. The disabled man was initially supposed to be released from detention six weeks ago but the Home Office continued to detain him as they were unable to identify suitable, wheelchair-accessible accommodation. The criticism from circuit judge Karen Jane Walden-Smith, sitting as a high court judge, is likely to be the first judicial rebuke received byJavid, who only became home secretary on Monday following Amber Rudd’s resignation. The Official Solicitor is involved with the case because the man lacks mental capacity. The disabled man is Jamaican and has been in the UK for 17 years. He was granted leave to remain before serving two years and three months in prison. The nature of his convictions were not disclosed in court. Following his release, the Home Office opened deportation proceedings against the man. A psychiatric assessment found that he lacked mental capacity and had PTSD and a mixed anxiety and depressive disorder. He had been held in detention since last July, although the Home Office accepted that he was an “adult at risk”. Following a judicial review launched by the man’s solicitors, the Home Office authorised his release from detention on 21March. However, he was not physically released from detention until the evening of 2 May, the day before a court hearing in the case. On arrival at his allocated accommodation that night, he discovered steps leading to the front door, which was not opened by the occupants. Shortly before 10pm the man called his solicitor using the taxi driver’s phone, who advised that he should be returned to detention so that alternative accommodation could be arranged. The taxi driver said he had no authorisation to do this. The disabled man complained of back pain as a result of the journey and waiting around, and requested an ambulance be called. He also became agitated and threatened to break the taxi’s windows. The judge criticised the “lack of clarity about what was happening”. She said that alternative accommodation was found but the man said it was not wheelchair-accessible, so he was taken to a hostel in south London for newly arrived asylum seekers, where he remains. The Home Office has not yet found suitable permanent alternative accommodation that has sufficient disabled access. Walden-Smith said: “Given the history of this matter … and the claimant not being released until the evening before the [court] hearing, that indicates to me that it’s necessary in these circumstances that an order is made by the court to ensure compliance by the secretary of state with his obligations to the client.” She ruled that the new accommodation must be wheelchair-accessible and give the man easy access to a kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. She said if the Home Office failed to comply, the man could bring the matter back to court. “The [Home Office] must ensure the claimant is accommodated in safe and suitable accommodation at all times,” she said, adding that if the man’s solicitors, Duncan Lewis, not persisted this case would not have come to court. “The secretary of state has acted very much last minute, at the last hour,” she said. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Detention and removal of those with no lawful basis to stay in the UK are essential parts of effective immigration controls. “When people are detained it is for the minimum time possible and the individual’s welfare remains of the utmost importance throughout.” The Home Office said that it made every effort to offer suitable accommodation as quickly as possible when it was required."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27508","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-13T23:00:12Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,508","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27508","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27508","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,508","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/03/trevor-noah-on-kanye-west-slavery-was-a-choice-for-white-people","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T15:12:41Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah on Kanye West: 'Slavery was a choice – for white people'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/03/trevor-noah-on-kanye-west-slavery-was-a-choice-for-white-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/03/trevor-noah-on-kanye-west-slavery-was-a-choice-for-white-people","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah on Kanye West: 'Slavery was a choice – for white people'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts discussed Kanye West’s much-criticized comments on slavery and the latest revelations from Donald Trump’s long-term doctor. Trevor Noah The Daily Show’s Trevor Noah took apart Kanye’s comments on TMZ about slavery being a choice for 400 years. “No Kanye, slavery is not a choice,” Noah said. “Going blond is a choice. Both are terrible but one is easier to undo.” Noah continued: “Slavery was a choice: for white people.” Noah then played footage of TMZ producer Van Lathan confronting Kanye in the office and critiquing his stance. Noah joked: “You know, there was one scared white person in that office who was like, ‘Hello police, there are two black people arguing in the office right now’.” Noah said he was also concerned about how his words would be used by the far right. “Normally, I wouldn’t care what Kanye West says about slavery or black history,” he said. “What does suck is now every member of the Tiki Torch Club is going to use Kanye’s words to justify their hate.” He went on to say: “Basically, the way Kanye samples old-school soul music is how racists are going to sample him now.” Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about Trump’s doctor Harold Bornstein’s claim that the president dictated the letter about his health. “You know who won’t let Trump write the report for him?” he said. “Robert Mueller.” Colbert moved on to Mueller and how Trump’s attempts to avoid interrogation might lead to him testifying in front of a grand jury. “If you want Trump to show up, you can’t threaten to slap him with a subpoena,” he said. “You have to spank him with it.” The list of Mueller questions released isn’t a reflection of what Trump will be asked, just a vague idea, or as Colbert terms it: “Just Mueller fan fiction.” “Right now, Richard Nixon is rolling over in his grave saying, ‘I told you I wasn’t a crook’,” he said. Samantha Bee On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee went back to the White House correspondents’ dinner at the weekend and stated: “Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a fucking liar.” She addressed the criticism of Michelle Wolf, who Bee believes was in the right. “Calling Sanders a liar isn’t an insult – it’s her job description,” she said. Sanders “throws other women to the wolves on Trump’s behalf” and while “all press secretaries lie, Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ lies are more like a Jedi mind-trick”. Bee compared her to “a public relations dementor, sucking the energy out of the White House press until they can’t fight back”. While other members of Trump’s inner circle might seem more obviously villainous, Bee said Sanders was “dangerous because she’s such a good soldier in the Trump army”. She continued: “You are one hell of a role model for little girls everywhere who are smart and hard-working and completely evil.” Seth Meyers On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host referred to the “constant swirl of chaos” surrounding Trump in the past week. He brought up the raid on his doctor’s office and the fact that he was asked to remove a picture of himself with Trump from his waiting room. “In fairness, that might have just been a business tip,” Meyers said. “No one wants to go to their doctor’s office and see a picture of their doctor with Donald Trump. That’s like going to your lawyer’s office and seeing a picture of your lawyer with Donald Trump.” Meyers went on to ridicule the appearance of Bornstein: “If you’re supposed to dress for the job you want then I think he wants to be a Grateful Dead roadie or a manager at Guitar Center.” He went on: “He looks like Donald Trump if Donald Trump was in the witness protection program.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/04/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T08:06:17Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/04/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/04/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend","bodyText":"1) A Friday night midfield rejig for Brighton? Results elsewhere could secure Brighton’s Premier League status this weekend, but Chris Hughton’s side have been granted an early opportunity to get the job done themselves at the Amex on Friday night. Brighton have beaten United just once in their history and have already lost to them twice this season – both times at Old Trafford – in the Premier League and FA Cup. United’s unconvincing Cup quarter-final win came immediately after their feeble Champions League surrender against Sevilla, in a match Alexis Sánchez and Paul Pogba sat out as unused substitutes after failing to impress against the Spanish side. Both players have since hit their stride and are likely to feature on Friday, a state of affairs that suggests if Brighton are to beat United for the first time in nine attempts since 1982 they will have to do so the hard way. With Davy Pröpper back from a spell on the naughty step, Hughton must decide whether to pair him with Dale Stephens in his first choice central midfield partnership, or stick with Beram Kayal, who has impressed in the Dutchman’s absence. BG Chelsea interested in move for Anthony Martial Liam Rosenior: Mourinho master of managing expectations 2) An Emirates farewell for Wenger And so it’s farewell. This will be the last time most Arsenal fans see Arsène Wenger at the Emirates, at least until they unveil his statue. Thursday’s failure in Madrid denied the venerable Frenchman if not a fairytale farewell, then at least a glorious appendix. Such will be the emotion of the occasion that the match is almost secondary, and yet defeat would be an almost cruel humiliation, leaving Wenger’s side distant from the top five and level on points with Burnley themselves. Having failed to unlock one famously well-organised defence in the Europa League they immediately face another one – Burnley have conceded 16 fewer goals in the Premier League than Arsenal. “There’s a lot of noise around the game but we’ve got to go there and do a job,” says Nick Pope. “We’re not just going to turn up and make up the numbers, we’ve got to put our foot down and put our own stamp on the game.” Having conceded decisive, controversial stoppage-time goals in each of their last three meetings, some luck for Burnley against Arsenal is long overdue. SB Match report: Atlético Madrid 1-0 Arsenal 3) Another Spurs hiccup against West Brom? The fact that Swansea’s final two games of the season are against two of the three teams below them in the table means victory for Stoke against Crystal Palace in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off will send West Brom down. With qualification for next season’s Champions League not yet assured, Tottenham will be rooting for Stoke in the hope that an inevitable sense of deflation at the Hawthorns will put an end to West Brom’s impressive rally under Darren Moore. Spurs were fortunate to draw the corresponding fixture at Wembley, when Salomón Rondón squandered a glorious opportunity in added time. With Mauricio Pochettino’s future the subject of some speculation, failure to beat the Premier League’s worst team for a second time could be a precursor to grave repercussions come season’s end. BG Kane surprised by ‘silly’ FA tweet and culture of mockery Tottenham reality check as stadium costs escalate 4) Can Chelsea make use of any Liverpool hangover? If ever there is a good time to face Liverpool’s deadly front three then it’s this weekend. The exertions of their Champions League semi-final epic against Roma are sure to have an effect on Jürgen Klopp’s side but with a top four spot not yet assured, Liverpool cannot afford to take it easy. Chelsea have won their last three matches in the Premier League to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for Europe’s top competition next season, with Olivier Giroud’s form the catalyst for their revival. The France striker has a solid record against Liverpool, with five goals in his 10 Premier League appearances against them for Arsenal, and his new employers know only victory will do on Sunday. EA Klopp’s thrash-metal ideal strikes an English chord Champions League final is not me v Ronaldo, says Salah Spanish press predict Madrid success in big showdown 5) Huddersfield to crash City’s title party? So far at home in the league this season, Manchester City fans have celebrated 58 goals and 15 victories. This weekend they will be celebrating again whatever happens in the game, with the trophy to be presented to after the final whistle. This will be their third Premier League title, but the first won with sufficient comfort to plan the presentation. Victory on Sunday would take them to 96 points, a tally never previously reached in the Premier League – for some time, the record books have been their only significant opponents. Huddersfield, though, were troublesome in the reverse fixture in November, when City came from behind to win thanks to Raheem Sterling’s late goal, and given their position in the table could hardly be better motivated to poop the party. A reminder of how fast situations in football can change: Huddersfield have scored 27 goals in the league this season; the last team to score fewer than 30 top-flight goals and avoid relegation were Manchester City, in 2006-07. SB We can be the best team in history, says Guardiola 6) A more gung ho approach from Swansea One point and a place above the relegation zone, Swansea City will drop into the bottom three if they fail to beat Bournemouth and Southampton win at Everton. While nerve-wracking, this scenario would not necessarily constitute disaster – with home matches against Southampton and Stoke to come, Swansea’s destiny remains in their own hands. Nevertheless, they could do with getting back into the winning habit, but Carlos Carvalhal’s inclination towards caution on the road could hamstring their chances of a first victory since the beginning of March. While it would be harsh to be critical of Swansea for their hiding against Manchester City, but their supine performance at the Hawthorns spoke volumes. Despite playing the worst team in the division, Swansea could scarcely have been set up more cautiously and were lucky to secure a point. At Bournemouth they will be better served by starting with similar urgency to that with which they ended last weekend’s defeat to Chelsea. If they are to go down, why not do so swinging haymakers? BG Fight to survive hots up but drop not always disastrous 7) Stoke can keep Palace looking over their shoulders Paul Lambert’s jack-in-the-box antics on the touchline have been a highlight of this season’s relegation battle and with his Stoke side fighting for survival at home against Crystal Palace on Saturday, expect the 1997 Champions League winner with Borussia Dortmund to be on top form. Lambert can take heart from Stoke’s victory over Palace last season – the first time they have beaten them in seven attempts – as they start the game three points from safety. Roy Hodgson’s side gained revenge in November and, with 38 points already in the bag, look to be safe after successive home wins. Yet Palace fans of a certain vintage will be wary of celebrating too soon – in 1992-93, the Premier League’s inaugural season, the Eagles were relegated with 49 points from their 42 games. EA Palace match ‘a war we have to win’ says Shaqiri Hodgson fears losing Cabaye and Ward in summer 8) Another basement battle of sorts for Everton Everton have lost only one of their last seven games, and that was against Manchester City. There was a time this season when they were genuinely concerned about the relegation scrap at the end of the season and so it has proved – in a manner of speaking. They are comfortably in the top half of the table, but having beaten Huddersfield last week to leave the Terriers in peril, they now face Southampton, with West Ham still to come. This is the third time that Everton have played Southampton in their final home game of the season, and the second time they have done so with one more away league match to follow. The last time it happened, in 1986, Everton were destined to finish second to Liverpool in both league and FA Cup, and the Saints were given a 6-1 thrashing. Two days later Southampton travelled to Tottenham and lost 5-3. Peter Shilton’s injury meant 17-year-old Keith Granger was flung into the side; after conceding 11 in those two games, he never played for the club again. SB Daniel Taylor: Firefighter Sam offers Everton too little spark 9) A reaction from Leicester or West Ham? Given their previous in the field of downing tools for managers , it will be intriguing to see how Leicester’s players approach this game. Claude Puel’s future looks uncertain in the wake of his team’s slaughter at Crystal Palace and with nothing much to play for, the reaction – or lack thereof – of his players will be telling. Still in danger of going down, West Ham will be hoping there is mutiny in the air over the King Power Stadium and look likely to bring Andy Carroll along. The striker apologised to David Moyes following an act of petulance and subsequent training ground row, prompted by his manager’s refusal to give him a run-out against Manchester City from the bench. Should both sets of players fail to up their game after respective embarrassments, fans can look forward to witnessing one of the most lethargic “contests” in top-flight history. BG Leicester players seem distracted, admits embattled Puel 10) Watford and Newcastle mired in mid-table malaise Since winning four successive matches to secure top-flight status, Newcastle have looked distinctly mediocre in losing to Everton and West Brom. Here though, they meet a side whose motivation is similarly suspect, though it is hard to know if this match will be entertainingly carefree or demoralisingly careless. This is familiar territory for Watford: since promotion in 2015 they are yet to win a fixture in May. They have not won since the first weekend of March, their dismal away form has prompted their gentle slide down the table. Having lost 2-0 at Spurs on Monday, they declared themselves encouraged. “We managed to create chances and if we keep doing it we will begin to get results,” said Étienne Capoue. “If we play like that we will get the points against Newcastle.” With only a visit to Old Trafford to come, if Watford are to reach 40 points they surely have to.

Detectives are still hunting a gang of raiders who broke into the Museum of East Asian Art (MEAA), a hidden jewel in one of city’s Georgian terraces, last month. The thieves got in through a first-floor window and targeted seven display cases containing culturally significant objects including jade figures. They ignored other items, suggesting the burglary was carefully planned. The museum’s curator, Nicole Chiang, said: “Obviously it’s very upsetting, especially as our founder [ex-lawyer and longtime resident of Hong Kong Brian McElney] lives in this area. It’s very personal for him. “It’s personal for the team as well. The reward of the job for us is showing the collection, the culture and art of east Asia to the general public and we were forced to close.” The museum upgraded its security in 2016 so it could borrow objects from the British Museum but is having to review its arrangements again. Chiang said: “They seemed quite professional. They were targeting jade and gold objects.” But she said the museum would be no less welcoming to the public: “The art needs to be seen otherwise it loses its value.” The gallery will reopen to the public on Saturday in time to celebrate its 25th anniversary, though the room that was broken into is still closed. The shattered display cabinets remain empty. Visitors will instead be treated to an exhibition by the Chinese artist Zhang Yanzi called A Quest for Wellness – an appropriate subject for Bath, where people have visited the city’s hot springs for many centuries. The centrepiece of the exhibition is a silk robe brightly decorated in tablets donated to the artist by her friends. Another piece comprises gauze bandages daubed with cinnabar moulded into the shape of mountains; a third is a collection of bracelets made out of pills. Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, said small museums like the MEAA were the lifeblood of the city and needed to feel secure. “Bath is a city with lots of small museums.” she said. “They help our city thrive. They are one of the reasons so many come here. We really need to help and support them and make sure they can do well in an atmosphere in which they feel protected.” She said the raid should make the police think twice about the closure of the main police station in the area. Hobhouse said: “Unfortunately we’ve lost our police station in Bath. That sort of thing makes it easier for professional criminals. We should reflect on that and think again whether we should have our police station back. “Local people have been very uncomfortable about not having a police station. We can’t say it’s a direct causal link but it may have made a difference.” The raid on the MEAA in Bennett Street took place at about 1.20am on 17 April. Police, who reached the scene within five minutes of receiving an alert, said the burglary was well planned and swift, and that the artefacts may have been stolen to order. Based close to the Royal Crescent, the MEAA bills itself as the only UK museum dedicated to the arts and cultures of eastern and south-eastern Asia. It opened in 1993 and features thousands of objects from the region. Some of its Chinese art dates from 5000BC. The police said the items taken were a jade monkey holding a peach, jade mandarin ducks with lotus flowers, an inlaid wooden covered box, a soapstone figure of the Han dynasty scholar, writer and jester, Dongfang Shuo, a set of 14 gold belt plaques and a Jizhou stoneware vase. • The Bath Museum of East Asian Art reopens with A Quest for Wellness on 5 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/03/sir-paul-donates-dozens-linda-mccartney-photos-v-and-a-museum","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T17:49:32Z","webTitle":"Sir Paul donates dozens of Linda McCartney photos to V&A","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/03/sir-paul-donates-dozens-linda-mccartney-photos-v-and-a-museum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/03/sir-paul-donates-dozens-linda-mccartney-photos-v-and-a-museum","fields":{"headline":"Sir Paul donates dozens of Linda McCartney photos to V&A","bodyText":"Dozens of intimate family photos and celebrity portraits by Linda McCartney are to form part of a significant new photography centre at the V&amp;A Museum. The museum in south-west London is almost doubling the space it devotes to photography to store and display a dramatically enhanced collection, including 270,000 images and objects from the Royal Photographic Society (RPS), and the images from the family of Sir Paul McCartney. The transfer of the RPS artefacts from the Science and Media Museum (SMM) in Bradford has proven bitterly controversial, with one local politician describing it as “an appalling act of cultural vandalism”. Linda McCartney died in 1998, aged 56. The 63 images given to the V&amp;A include original Polaroids of the McCartney family that have never been seen publicly before, portraits of rock music icons including the Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix, and experimental platinum and hand-painted prints, lithographs and cyanotypes. Before marrying Paul McCartney and joining the post-Beatles group Wings, Linda Eastman was a successful photographer who in 1968 became the first woman to shoot a Rolling Stone magazine cover, of Eric Clapton. The V&amp;A’s senior curator of photography, Martin Barnes, visited the McCartney home to help choose the images. “In some ways, I was trying not to think of the family connection and just look at the work,” he said. “I think she had a real eye for capturing the unguarded and unstaged moment.” A selection of the McCartney images will be on display when the V&amp;A’s photography centre – which Barnes said would be “one of the largest single collections in the world in depth and variety” – opens to the public on 12 October. The huge RPS collection, which includes works from early pioneers in “painting with light”, was moved to Bradford in 2003 and regarded as a cornerstone of the SMM, part of the Science Museum group. In 2016 there was public outcry at the decision to move the entire collection to London. The Bradford South MP, Judith Cummins, feared the loss could threaten the viability of the SMM, which had already suffered funding and staff cuts. Barnes said the V&amp;A would consider exhibition tours and artefact loans with the SMM. The RPS collection, which includes books and journals, 6,000 cameras and pieces of equipment, and 270,000 photographs all being catalogued and digitised for the first time, dovetailed perfectly with the V&amp;A. In some cases negatives, prints and the cameras they were taken with are being reunited – including equipment and images captured by William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented some of the earliest means of permanently fixing a photographic image. Tristram Hunt, director of the V&amp;A, said the museum had been the first in the world to collect photographs and the first to stage a photography exhibition, because its founder Henry Cole was an enthusiastic amateur snapper. Hunt said the arrival of the RPS works was seamlessly creating a new collection that could tell the entire story of photography from daguerreotype to digital. It had been the catalyst towards creating the new spaces, which will occupy three restored 19th-century galleries, he said. The new galleries will include display cases holding 140 cameras, a historical display from the earliest experiments to a digital wall for the latest projected images. There will also be a handling collection and a “dark tent” – a projection and lecture space modelled on the travelling darkrooms used by 19th-century photographers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/may/03/investor-criticises-chiefs-of-lossmaking-gloo-for-pocketing-millions","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T17:05:11Z","webTitle":"Investor criticises chiefs of lossmaking Gloo for pocketing millions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/03/investor-criticises-chiefs-of-lossmaking-gloo-for-pocketing-millions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/03/investor-criticises-chiefs-of-lossmaking-gloo-for-pocketing-millions","fields":{"headline":"Investor criticises chiefs of lossmaking Gloo for pocketing millions","bodyText":"An activist investor has criticised the management of Gloo Networks – the listed vehicle that aimed to buy digitally focused media companies valued up to £1bn but is shutting up shop – for pocketing millions in salaries and bonus payouts despite failing to strike a single deal in three years. Gloo Networks, which is chaired by Vivendi’s chief executive, Arnaud de Puyfontaine, has put itself into voluntary liquidation after burning through the majority of the £30m raised when it listed on London’s AIM share index in 2015. The company, which is run by Rebecca Miskin, the former digital strategy director and “change agent” at Cosmopolitan’s publisher Hearst Magazines UK, spent millions reviewing 90 potential assets and had “in-depth discussions” with 11 but admitted in March that it was giving up on a takeover of its latest potential target. However, the company’s top executives – who included Juan Lopez-Valcarcel, the former digital chief of Pearson, the former owner of the Financial Times and the world’s largest educational publisher – also proved to be a significant drain on its resources. Gloo paid out just over £4m in salaries and benefits, including more than £1m in bonuses over two years, to top management from the time it was incorporated until 31 March last year, according to the most recent publicly available accounts. “The politest word I can think of for paying yourselves bonuses of £750,000 in one year from a lossmaking cash shell is that it is unprecedented,” said Richard Bernstein, the founder of the AIM-listed activist fund Crystal Amber. “There shouldn’t be any bonuses paid for not actually delivering a deal. It looks like almost every director got one and it seems they got it on two criteria, breathing in and breathing out.” Bernstein, who bought an 8% stake in Gloo in a personal capacity, had called for an end to the excess. He was critical of the rapid cash burn rate of the company, which saw it plummet from £21m at the end of September to “between £12m and £14m” at the end of March. “The board has conducted a strategic review of the current pipeline of potential acquisitions within our target sectors that demonstrate the requisite financial characteristics,” said De Puyfontaine, a former chief executive of Hearst UK. “Given the likely time frame to a possible acquisition, the board concluded that shareholders would be best served through the return of Gloo’s remaining capital.” Crystal Amber has a track record of shaking up companies, having taken stakes in the James Bond studio Pinewood, subsequently calling for its chairman Lord Grade to step down, and in the regional newspaper publisher Johnston Press, where the fund wanted the chief executive Ashley Highfield out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/may/06/cambridge-analytica-how-turn-clicks-into-votes-christopher-wylie","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T07:00:14Z","webTitle":"Cambridge Analytica: how did it turn clicks into votes?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/06/cambridge-analytica-how-turn-clicks-into-votes-christopher-wylie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/06/cambridge-analytica-how-turn-clicks-into-votes-christopher-wylie","fields":{"headline":"Cambridge Analytica: how did it turn clicks into votes?","bodyText":"How do 87m records scraped from Facebook become an advertising campaign that could help swing an election? What does gathering that much data actually involve? And what does that data tell us about ourselves? The Cambridge Analytica scandal has raised question after question, but for many, the technological USP of the company, which announced last week that it was closing its operations, remains a mystery. For those 87 million people probably wondering what was actually done with their data, I went back to Christopher Wylie, the ex-Cambridge Analytica employee who blew the whistle on the company’s problematic operations in the Observer. According to Wylie, all you need to know is a little bit about data science, a little bit about bored rich women, and a little bit about human psychology... Step one, he says, over the phone as he scrambles to catch a train: “When you’re building an algorithm, you first need to create a training set.” That is: no matter what you want to use fancy data science to discover, you first need to gather the old-fashioned way. Before you can use Facebook likes to predict a person’s psychological profile, you need to get a few hundred thousand people to do a 120-question personality quiz. The “training set” refers, then, to that data in its entirety: the Facebook likes, the personality tests, and everything else you want to learn from. Most important, it needs to contain your “feature set”: “The underlying data that you want to make predictions on,” Wylie says. “In this case, it’s Facebook data, but it could be, for example, text, like natural language, or it could be clickstream data” – the complete record of your browsing activity on the web.“Those are all the features that you want to [use to] predict.” At the other end, you need your “target variables” – in Wylie’s words, “the things that you’re trying to predict for. So in this case, personality traits or political orientation, or what have you.” If you’re trying to use one thing to predict another, it helps if you can look at both at the same time. “If you want to know the relationships between Facebook likes in your feature set and personality traits as your target variables, you need to see both,” says Wylie. Facebook data, which lies at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica story, is a fairly plentiful resource in the data science world – and certainly was back in 2014, when Wylie first started working in this area. Personality traits are much harder to get hold of: despite what the proliferation of BuzzFeed quizzes might suggest, it takes quite a lot to persuade someone to fill in a 120-question survey (the length of the short version of one of the standard psychological surveys, the Ipip-Neo). “Quite a lot” is relative, however. “For some people, the incentive to take a survey is financial. If you’re a student or looking for work or just want to make $5, that’s an incentive.” The actual money handed over, Wylie says, “ranged from $2 to $4”. The higher payments go to “groups that were harder to get”. The group least likely to take a survey, and so earning the most from it, were African American men. “Other people take surveys just because they find it interesting, or they are bored. So we over-sampled wealthy white women. Because if you live in the Hamptons and have nothing to do in the afternoon, you fill out consumer research surveys.” The personality surveys use those 120 questions to profile people along five discrete axes – the “five factors” model, popularly called the “Ocean” model after one common breakdown of the factors: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. That model clusters personality traits into distinctions that seem to hold across cultures and across time. So, for instance, those who describe themselves as “loud” are likely to also describe themselves as “gregarious”. If they agree with that description this year, they’re likely to agree with it next year. That cluster is likely to show up in responses in every language. And if a person responds to it negatively, there are likely to be real, noticeable differences between them and people who answer it positively. Those features of the model are what make it actually useful for profiling individuals, says Wylie – in contrast to some other popular psychological profiles such as the Myers-Briggs system. In the testing phase of the research, Facebook was barely involved. The surveys were offered on commercial data research sites – first Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, then a specialist operator called Qualtrics. (The switch was made, Wylie says, because Amazon has the issue that “people are overfamiliar with filling out surveys” – so much so that it starts to affect your results.) It was only at the very end that Facebook came into play. In order to be paid for their survey, users were required to log in to the site, and approve access to the survey app developed by Dr Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University academic whose research into personality profiling using Facebook likes provided the perfect access for the Robert Mercer-funded Cambridge Analytica to quickly get in on the field. (Kogan maintains that Cambridge Analytica assured him they were using data appropriately and says he has been “used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica”.) To a survey user, the process was quick: “You click the app, you go on, and then it gives you the payment code.” But two very important things happened in those few seconds. First, the app harvested as much data as it could about the user who just logged on. Where the psychological profile is the target variable, the Facebook data is the “feature set”: the information a data scientist has on everyone else, which they need to use in order to accurately predict the features they really want to know. It also provided personally identifiable information such as real name, location and contact details – something that wasn’t discoverable through the survey sites themselves. “That meant you could take the inventory and relate it to a natural person [who is] matchable to the electoral register.” Second, the app did the same thing for all the friends of the user who installed it. Suddenly the hundreds of thousands of people who you’ve paid a couple of dollars to fill out a survey, whose personalities are a mystery, become millions of people whose Facebook profiles are an open book. That’s where the final transformation comes in. How do you turn a few hundred thousand personality profiles into a few million? With a lot of computing power, and a massive matrix of possibilities. “Even though your sample size is 300,000 people, give or take, your feature set is like 100m across,” says Wylie. Every single Facebook “like” found in the data set becomes its own column in this enormous matrix. “Even if there is only one instance in the entire set, it’s still a feature.” “All that data was then put into an ensemble model,” Wylie says. “This is when you use different families or approaches of machine learning, because each of them will have their own strengths and weaknesses... and then they sort of vote, and then you amalgamate the results and come up with a conclusion.” This is where data science becomes more of a data art: the exact input of each approach to the overall model isn’t set in stone, and there’s no right way to do it. In the academic world, it’s sometimes called “training by grad student” – the point where the only thing to do is move forward through laborious trial and error. Still, it worked well enough, and in the end, Wylie says, “we built 253 algorithms, which meant there were 253 predictions per profiled record”. The goal was achieved: a model that could effectively take the Facebook likes of its subjects and work backwards, filling in the rest of the columns in the spreadsheet to arrive at guesses as to their personalities, political affiliations and more. By the end of August 2014, Wylie had the first successful outputs: 2.1m profiled records, from 11 target US states, the plan being that they would be used to communicate and refine messages in Mercer and Steve Bannon-backed Republican campaigns leading up to the 2016 primaries (Wylie left before these). “What that number represents is people who not only have their Facebook data, voter data, and consumer data (which was all matched up), but also had an additional 253 predictions or scores that were then appended to their profile.” Those 253 predictions were the “secret sauce” that Cambridge Analytica claimed it could offer its customers. Using Facebook itself, advertisers are limited to broad demographic strokes, and a few narrower algorithmically determined categories – whether you like jazz music, say, or what your favourite sports team is. But with 253 further predictions, Cambridge Analytica could, Wylie says, craft adverts no one else could: a neurotic, extroverted and agreeable Democrat could be targeted with a radically different message than an emotionally stable, introverted, intellectual one, each designed to suppress their voting intention – even if the same messages, swapped around, would have the opposite effect. Wylie brings up the anodyne political statement that a candidate is in favour of jobs. “Jobs in the economy is a good example because it’s a meaningless message. Everyone’s pro-jobs in the economy. So in that sense, using just the message of ‘I am in favour of jobs in the economy’, or ‘I have a plan to fix jobs in the economy’, you cannot differentiate yourself from your opponent. “But one of the things that we found was that actually when you unpack what is a job for different people, different people engage with constructs with different motivations and value sets that are interrelated with their dispositions.” What that means in practice is that the same blandishment can be dressed up in different language for different personalities, creating the impression of a candidate who connects with voters on an emotional level. “If you’re talking to a conscientious person” – one who ranks highly on the C part of the Ocean model – “you talk about the opportunity to succeed and the responsibility that a job gives you. If it’s an open person, you talk about the opportunity to grow as a person. Talk to a neurotic person, and you emphasise the security that it gives to my family.” Thanks to the networked nature of modern campaigning, in theory all these messages can be delivered simultaneously to different groups. Towards the end of the campaign, once the messaging has settled in, they can even be automated, Mad Libs-style, with an algorithm churning through a thesaurus to find the perfect combination of words to win over different subgroups. Of course, it isn’t all blandishments. One message used to boost rightwing turnout attacked same-sex marriage. “It’s funny, because this is so offensive and implicitly homophobic, but it’s a team of gays that created it,” Wylie says. “It was targeting conscientious people. It was a picture of a dictionary and it said ‘Look up marriage and get back to me’. For someone who is conscientious, it is a compelling message: a dictionary is a source of order, and a conscientious person is more deferential to structure.” At a certain point, psychometric targeting moves into the realm of dog-whistle campaigning. Images of walls proved to be really effective in campaigning around immigration, for instance. “Conscientious people like structure, so for them, a solution to immigration should be orderly, and a wall embodied that. You can create messaging that doesn’t make sense to some people but makes so much sense to other people. If you show that image, some people wouldn’t get that that’s about immigration, and others immediately would get that.” The actual issues, for Wylie, are simply the “plain white toast” of politics, waiting for the actual flavour to be loaded on. “No one wants plain white toast.” The job of the data, he says, is to “learn the particular flavour or spice” that will make that toast appealing. While this was undoubtedly a highly sophisticated targeting machine, questions remain about Cambridge Analytica’s psychometric model – ones Wylie, perhaps, isn’t best placed to answer. When Kogan gave evidence to parliament in April, he suggested that it was barely better than chance at applying the right Ocean scores to individuals. Maybe that edge is enough to matter – or maybe CA was selling snake oil. And even if individuals were correctly labelled with the five factors, is advertising to them based on that really as simple as slightly hokey-sounding appeals to love of order, or fear of the other? That said, there’s clearly something in it. Take a look instead at a patent filed in 2012 on “determining user personality characteristics from social networking system communications”. “Stored personality characteristics may be used as targeting criteria for advertisers ... to increase the likelihood that the user … positively interacts with a selected advertisement,” the patent suggests.

That book received an avalanche of praise and bestseller stardom. This second novel, Whistle in the Dark, toys with the same subjects of disappearance and blots on the memory, except that the narrative intrigue is built around what happens when the disappeared return and what, if anything, can be retrieved of their lost time. In this case, the missing person is a depressed and self-harming 15-year-old, Lana, who disappears while at an art workshop in the Peak District with her mother, Jen. She reappears after four days, bleeding and injured but alive. She is questioned by her parents and the police as to her whereabouts, but her answer remains stubbornly the same: she got lost and can’t remember. So begins, in part, the story of a mother desperate to discover what damage lies beneath Lana’s blanket of amnesia. She suspects sexual assault and sees the lurking presence of predatory men everywhere in her investigations. But just as Healey’s last novel was not a crime story, nor a comedy but a blend of both, this too is written between genres. The crime detection is mixed in with the social satire of modern family life and middle-class motherhood. Jen is satirised as the over-anxious mother, accompanying Lana to therapy, listening in on her phone conversations, stalking her social media accounts, worrying that she is stuttering, has become part of a gang or, in one comic scene, that she is blinking too much. It is a courageous attempt at generic hybridity on Healey’s part and the two elements of the book are, by turns, intriguing and entertaining. But blended together the effect is odd and inconsistent, veering from Jen’s gothic fantasies of what might have happened to Lana, to flipness of tone and comic dialogue. The satire is the stronger component of the two: Healey’s middle-class family is drawn with canny-eyed clarity – Jen’s other daughter, Meg, is a lesbian having a baby through artificial insemination and the sibling rival between her and Lana is keenly observed. So too is modern teenager-hood, from Lana’s Instagram account filled with pictures of plates of food, feet on grass and the “dick pic” she nonchalantly receives to the repartee of mother-daughter bickering. “I thought we might look and see if there’s a film we could all watch on Netflex,” says Jen, to which Lana replies: “It’s Netflix. Netflix. Oh my fucking God. It’s only talked about every single day.” Healey further complicates Jen’s narrative by turning her into the unreliable narrator. She seems to unravel under the pressure of her daughter’s ordeal and we are made to wonder who the more fragile of the two might be; Lana, it appears, is monitoring her mother’s behaviour while being monitored by her and their mutual surveillance throws doubt over the clarity of Jen’s version of events. The most compelling aspect of the novel, though, is the painful pathos in Jen and Lana’s relationship; Jen’s helplessness in observing Lana’s depression is piercing. “I want to kill myself,” she tells her mother on the art holiday and “her voice was flat and quiet, toneless and powerful”. In other scenes, Healey captures Jen’s desperate attempts to be close to her daughter, however much Lana is pulling away into incipient adulthood, which to Jen seems “as if she’d invited some stranger into the house, or some mythical creature, a unicorn or a griffin”. In the end, it is this interpersonal drama and not the clever narrative tics that Healey employs, nor the generic innovation, that gives the novel its heart. • Whistle in the Dark by Emma Healey is published by Viking (£12.99).

The abduction, on Wednesday evening, took place after gunmen entered the site and grabbed the woman, taking her out through a back entrance to evade security guards. The nurse was later identified in reports as Sonja Nientiet, who had worked for the ICRC since 2014 in conflict zones, including Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The kidnapping was the second serious incident involving health workers in Somalia this week following the killing of an employee of the World Health Organisation, Mariam Abdullahi, on Tuesday. Daniel O’Malley, the ICRC’s deputy head in Somalia, said: “We are deeply concerned about the safety of our colleague. “She is a nurse who was working every day to save lives and improve the health of some of Somalia’s most vulnerable.” A police operation is underway, said local officer Major Mohamed Hussein: “We got the report minutes after she was abducted and now we are searching the whole area. We hope we shall find her.” No group has claimed responsibility but, in the past, foreigners, journalists and aid workers among them, have been kidnapped by armed gangs or al-Shabaab militants and held for ransom, sometimes for years at a time. Abductions and killings of Somali aid workers are common, but targeting foreign workers has become less frequent in recent years as security has improved. In March, Abdulhafid Yusuf Ibrahim, a Somali national who had worked for ICRC for only five months, died after a bomb exploded beneath his car as he left the office. Unlike many other international aid agencies working in Somalia, the ICRC does not base itself within the well-defended perimeter of Mogadishu’s airport, which acts as the city’s “green zone”, housing foreign embassies and the UN agencies coordinating the humanitarian and political response to Somalia’s crises. Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, who is visiting Ethiopia and Tanzania this week, told journalists in Addis Ababa he would not comment “on any hostage cases”. “I have deep respect for all people, especially people from Germany, working abroad in order to help others,” said Maas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/03/to-outer-space-via-david-davis-looking-glass-world-of-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T12:31:41Z","webTitle":"To outer space, via David Davis's looking-glass world of Brexit | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/03/to-outer-space-via-david-davis-looking-glass-world-of-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/03/to-outer-space-via-david-davis-looking-glass-world-of-brexit","fields":{"headline":"To outer space, via David Davis's looking-glass world of Brexit","bodyText":"David Davis isn’t noted for his grasp of detail. Or for his grasp of anything very much. But at Brexit questions in the Commons, he took his lack of awareness to new heights by seeming to forget there had been a meeting of the inner cabinet the previous day. He’s going to get a hell of a shock when someone gently informs him that not only was he there but he voted against the prime minister’s preferred customs partnership option. Before long he will be struggling to remember his own name. If only that were possible for the rest of us. Brexit questions used to guarantee a nearly full house in the chamber, but the number of MPs bothering to attend have now dwindled to a mere handful. There’s only so much futility anyone can take and most have long since decided there’s only a certain number of times they can slip through Davis’s looking-glass world before they don’t come back. Of those few – those unhappy few – who did decide to take one for the team and risk their mental health, almost all wanted an urgent update on the customs union. With the government no nearer to deciding what kind of future trading relationship it wants with the EU nearly two years after the referendum, time is running out to reach an agreement by October. “The customs union is a very complex issue,” said Davis, confidently channelling his inner Alice. “So it should be no surprise that it is taking a long time.” A few MPs began reaching for their medication. It was going to be a long hour. They didn’t need to be told how complicated it all was as they knew that already. The issue was that the government had taken so long to getting round to realise that fact for itself. Davis looked hurt by the criticism and insisted that, despite the customs partnership having been kicked into the long grass the previous day, the government was still actively considering both the customs partnership and a more streamlined model. “Both have their merits and their drawbacks,” he declared. One of which is that the EU has already in effect ruled both proposals out. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, looked at Davis with alarm and pity. Maybe now wasn’t the moment to get him up to speed. On and on Davis went, taking off his glasses, putting them on again and repeating the phrase “deep and special partnership” over and over again until it sounded meaningless even to him. “We are acting in the best interests of the country,” he said. Now it was the turn of the hardline Tory Brexiters to look confused. They had been certain the government was really just doing anything it could to keep them happy and to stay in power. Having talked himself round in circles to a position where everything was equally possible and impossible, Davis sat down and handed over to his junior minister. In a former life, Robin Walker may have been fully sentient, but his boss’s intellectual impairment has proved contagious and he can now barely string a sentence together. What did the people living on both sides of the Irish border think of the government’s proposed solutions, asked Labour’s Karin Smyth. “Um, er, um, er, everyone understands the importance of a frictionless border,” Walker mumbled. “Um, er, um, er, we’re still talking.” Though not in a language anyone but he and Davis understands. Walker was then asked what steps had been taken to find a technological solution to the Irish border. “None whatsoever,” he said proudly. Davis patted him on the back. That’s my boy. To general amazement and concern, Walker was made to look an intellectual giant by the arrival to the dispatch box of the department’s most recent ministerial recruit. Having dismissed the government’s own research into the economic impact of leaving the customs union as rubbish, Suella Braverman then made her big pitch for the future. Outer space. No matter that we can’t even solve the Irish border, Britain would conquer the universe and be a world leader in trade with Venus and Neptune. To infinity and beyond. Just another day in Brexit in Wonderland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/04/uk-growth-prediction-2018-scaled-back-by-thinktank-niesr","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T23:01:07Z","webTitle":"UK growth prediction for 2018 scaled back to 1.4% by thinktank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/04/uk-growth-prediction-2018-scaled-back-by-thinktank-niesr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/04/uk-growth-prediction-2018-scaled-back-by-thinktank-niesr","fields":{"headline":"UK growth prediction for 2018 scaled back to 1.4% by thinktank","bodyText":"One of the UK’s leading economic thinktanks has slashed its forecasts for 2018 following evidence that growth almost came to a halt in the first three months of the year. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said it expected expansion of 1.4% in 2018 – down from the 1.9% it had been predicting three months ago – and anticipated that interest rates would not rise until August at the earliest. The NIESR economist Amit Kara said the “significant” downward revision was the result of official figures showing the economy grew by only 0.1% in the first three months of the year – well below the 0.5% the thinktank had been forecasting. “It is not clear if this is just a soft patch or the start of a prolonged period of weakness” Kara said, although he added that NIESR believed growth would pick up to average around 0.4% in each of the next three quarters. With the latest snapshot of the UK service sector pointing to only a modest recovery in April from the weather-related dip in activity in March, NIESR predicted the Bank of England would delay the next rise in interest rates until August and then only move if the economy was growing at 0.4%-0.5% a quarter. Services firms reported the third lowest level of business activity since the EU referendum in 2016 to defy City economists, who expected a stronger recovery from the cold weather in March. Firms that sell services to consumers were the worst affected, notably hotels and restaurants. The strongest expansion was in financial services. The balance of responses from firms across the sector left the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/IHS Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) at 53.2, up from 51.9 in March, but much lower than the 54.2 in February. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: “Services growth accelerated but, after March’s low, was the second-weakest for over one and a half years.“The weak services data follows news that manufacturing lost further momentum in April, with output rising at the second-slowest rate for just over a year. The brightest news came from the construction sector, which saw the largest monthly output rise since November, albeit after an especially sharp decline in March.” Paul Hollingsworth, a senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the weakness of the rebound in April would “do little to assuage fears that the economy has suffered a loss of underlying momentum and makes the chances of a rate hike next week extremely slim”. Threadneedle Street policymakers are scheduled to meet on 10 May to judge the state of the economy and decide whether to increase interest rates for only the second time since the 2008 financial crash. Several members of the central bank’s rate-setting committee indicated in the early part of the year that they were ready to increase the cost of borrowing and several mortgage lenders raised the cost of their two-year fixed rates loans in response. However, the likelihood of a rise has receded after a series of weak economic indicators, forcing lenders to revise their outlook. IHS Markit PMI, which covers about 40% of the services sector and excludes high street shops, found the rate of employment growth, sales and investment was hit by uncertainty about the economic outlook as well as sluggish domestic demand from among consumers. It said optimism about the next 12 months had increased, though. “The balance of companies expecting a rise in business activity over the year ahead reached its highest level since January. This was attributed to forthcoming product launches, new marketing plans and discounting strategies,” it said. NIESR predicted the UK’s growth rate would recover to 1.7% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020, provided the eventual Brexit deal guaranteed a high level of access for goods and services exports to the EU."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/04/eu-has-no-plans-to-downgrade-use-of-english-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T04:00:12Z","webTitle":"EU has no plans to downgrade use of English after Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/04/eu-has-no-plans-to-downgrade-use-of-english-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/04/eu-has-no-plans-to-downgrade-use-of-english-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"EU has no plans to downgrade use of English after Brexit","bodyText":"The EU’s executive body has no plans to downgrade the use of English after Brexit, despite occasional barbs that the language would be less significant in Europe when the UK leaves the bloc. Buried in the small print of the European commission’s proposed budget for 2021-27 is confirmation that it has no intention to reduce the use of English in its meetings or documents. “The withdrawal of the United Kingdom will result in a limited reorientation of some functions within the administration, but the scope of activities will not change,” the section on EU administration says. “Translation and interpretation services in the English language will also remain unaffected.” The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said last year that English was losing its importance in Europe, although he later said he had been joking. “The French were happy. The British, I had a shitstorm coming from the other side of the Channel,” he told students in his native Luxembourg in October. Rumours that Brexit negotiations would be conducted exclusively in French also appear to have been a joke at the expense of the British, who are among the least likely in the EU to speak various languages. Only 5% of GCSE-age students were studying two or more foreign languages in 2015, compared with an EU average of 59%. Only Greek students were less likely to take languages than the British. When the UK leaves the EU in 2019, only 1% of the EU population - in Ireland and Malta - will be living in countries where English is an official language. The EU has 24 official languages, making 552 combinations of language pairings, allowing each to be translated into 23 others. Only three, however, are classed as working languages - English, French and German. English has been used more widely used than French since Sweden, Finland and Austria joined the EU in 1995, bringing in more speakers of English as a second language. The dominance of English became entrenched when central and eastern European countries joined in the mid-2000. France is keen to restore the pre-eminence of its language, but is fighting a constant battle. Its EU ambassador walked out of a meeting last week when officials decided to use an English-only translation of the budget proposal. • This article was amended on 8 May 2017.

For the first time since 1949, the secretive jury that hands out the world’s most prestigious literary prize will not unveil a winner this autumn, instead revealing two laureates in 2019, it announced on Friday. “The present decision was arrived at in view of the currently diminished academy and the reduced public confidence in the academy,” the body, founded by King Gustav III in 1786 and still under royal patronage, said in a statement. “We find it necessary to commit time to recovering public confidence ... before the next laureate can be announced,” its interim permanent secretary Anders Olsson said. “This is out of respect for previous and future literature laureates, the Nobel Foundation and the general public.” At the root of the institution’s unprecedented crisis are a raft of wide-ranging allegations against Jean-Claude Arnault, a photographer and leading cultural figure in Sweden, who is married to Katarina Frostenson, an academy member and author. Last November, the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter published detailed allegations by 18 women accusing Arnault of sexual harassment and physical abuse over a period of more than 20 years, in France and Sweden and including at properties owned by the academy. For years, Arnault and Frostenson ran Forum, a club in Stockholm that showcased exhibitions, readings and performances by prominent cultural personalities including Nobel laureates. Now closed, the club was partly funded by the academy, prompting allegations of a conflict of interest. As the escalating scandal unfolded, Dagens Nyheter also reported that an internal investigation by the academy had concluded that Arnault may have leaked the names of seven Nobel literature laureates – the subject of heavy betting – in advance, including those of Bob Dylan in 2016 and Harold Pinter in 2005. The Franco-Swedish photographer’s lawyer, Björn Hurtig, has repeatedly said his client denies all the allegations against him, adding that Arnault has become “the victim of a witch hunt” and that the accusations “may have been made with the sole purpose of harming” him. The hidebound and traditionally deeply patriarchal academy’s inability to respond adequately to the allegations against Arnault sparked a bitter internal feud, with members exchanging public insults in the pages of the Swedish media. Three members of the 18-strong academy resigned last month in protest over a decision not to expel Frostenson, followed days later – amid protests that women were being made to carry the can for male misbehaviour – by the permanent secretary, Sara Danius, who had battled in vain to reform it, and by Frostenson herself. Technically, academy members are appointed for life and not permitted to resign, although they could choose to leave their chairs empty. But with the body now down to 10 active members – and 12 required to elect new ones – King Carl XVI Gustaf this week announced a change in its statutes to ensure its survival. The decision to postpone the 2018 award was broadly welcomed. “I think it’s wise; this is the best decision they could make,” said Dagens Nyheter’s literature critic, Maria Schottenius. “They’ll have a chance to restore the institution this year and fill the empty seats, and come back with a strong academy that can award the prize.” One academy member, Göran Malmqvist, told Sweden’s TT news agency that the body was in crisis and would take time to rebuild. But Jens Liljestrand of the Expressen newspaper told TT it was “a disaster for the Swedish Academy’s reputation … that they didn’t manage to handle this better”. The Nobel Foundation, which administers the estate of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, said the crisis had “adversely affected” the literature prize and its judges. “Their decision underscores the seriousness of the situation and will help safeguard the long-term reputation of the prize,” it said in statement. Public prosecutors have said they are dropping parts of their probe against Arnault due to a lack of evidence, but the bulk of the investigation continues. Sweden’s economic crimes bureau last week said it was investigating a case linked to the academy, widely assumed to be the subsidies it paid to Arnault. How the academy chooses the winner of the literature award has remained opaque for decades. Each February, academy members review around 200 nominations, coming up with a shortlist by May, and then reading up on the five authors still in the running for the prize over the summer. The winner is the author deemed to best fulfil Alfred Nobel’s desire to reward “the most outstanding work in an ideal direction”. The honour has not been awarded at all on seven occasions since its launch in 1901, although previously never over a scandal. The prize was missed in 1914, 1918, 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1943, during the first and second world wars, and in 1935 for reasons never disclosed. It has also been “reserved” – due to a lack of suitable winners – in 1915, 1919, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1936 and 1949. The chairman of the Foundation, Carl-Henrik Heldin, said separately that the awarding of the 2018 Nobel prizes in other categories would not be affected. The Foundation now expected the academy to “put all its efforts” into restoring its credibility, Heldin said, calling on the remaining members to show “greater openness towards the outside world” in future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/04/chris-grayling-car-roadworks-pavements-transport-congestion","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T07:30:17Z","webTitle":"Chris Grayling is a car kind of guy – but he crosses pedestrians at his peril | Laura Laker\r\n\r\n\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/04/chris-grayling-car-roadworks-pavements-transport-congestion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/04/chris-grayling-car-roadworks-pavements-transport-congestion","fields":{"headline":"Chris Grayling is a car kind of guy – but he crosses pedestrians at his peril\r\n\r\n","bodyText":"It seems ironic that the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, should usher in National Walking Month by announcing plans to dig up more pavements, to spare motorists the inconvenience of roadworks. His idea is that cables and services should be laid under pavements and verges to cut congestion and reduce potholes. Even when pavement is only being dug up when there’s another one on the other side of the road to use, as the Department for Transport (DfT) is proposing, the plan to free up road space by making the walking environment more difficult to navigate could have the opposite effect, by reducing non-driving options. In a week when the UK has been identified as among the worst countries in Europe for asthma death rates, and a who’s who of British cities with toxic air has been published, this would be a disastrous result. Footage taken by the former doctor and disability activist Amit Patel demonstrates that if you’re blind, a blocked pavement is a blocked pavement – even if it’s obstructed only on one side of the road. This whole idea seems yet another case of the do-nothing-to-upset -drivers attitude that does so much to hinder non-motorised transport in this country. It takes about 20 minutes to walk a mile, or six minutes to cycle one, and yet 11% of journeys of less than a mile in the UK are made by car. This rises to 29% for journeys of between one and two miles. It is estimated in London that two-thirds of the 2.39m potentially walkable trips each day are made by car. Imagine our streets – and our air – if these trips, multiplied in towns and cities across the country, were all walked or cycled. We only need the right conditions to make those choices. Some of what the DfT is doing suggests it understands this. In the Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy consultation, pedestrians are ranked top of the hierarchy of road users, followed by cyclists, then public transport, then the private motor car. This is in the DfT’s own literature, as a way to protect the most vulnerable by reducing congestion while making our towns, villages and cities more pleasant, prosperous and equitable places. Meanwhile, DfT consideration of a new law against pavement parking is a step in the right direction for people who would like to walk. Grayling himself seems more car-focused, however. It was only last year he said cyclists weren’t real road users, after “dooring” one while getting out of a car outside Parliament. This week he described the pothole problem as one he has noticed while “driving around”. Toyota GB PLC, whose headquarters are in Grayling’s constituency, sponsored his constituency office from 2002 to 2009, and then again from 2011 to 2016, latterly to the tune of £6,000 per year. He has also been an honorary RAC member since 2013, valued at £1,600 per year. These donations are logged in his register of interests and there’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing. But Grayling seems to be a car guy. Unfortunately, though nearly all of us use pavements, few of us identify ourselves as “pedestrians” in the same way that cyclists and drivers identify themselves with their means of transport, which means our voice is often lost in the clamour of demands on our crowded streets. Living Streets, the national walking charity, raises concerns about the impact of roadworks on elderly pedestrians, pointing out that disabled and elderly people are less likely to own cars, leaving them with no way to get around in the absence of safe, obstacle-free pavements. Dig up the pavements and you introduce detours, often off raised kerbs, into the road. The scope for trips and falls is far increased and the likelihood that someone using a wheelchair or with impaired vision can still safely navigate those detours is reduced. I recently toured east London’s Stratford town centre, undergoing pedestrian- and cycle-friendly improvements, to see for myself the impact of roadworks on vulnerable road users. With me was Mike Barratt, Transport for London’s development impact assessment lead. He identified problems including fencing over crossing buttons ,barriers funnelling cyclists and pedestrians together, and flooded crossing points, and asked contractors to address these. Would all councils have the diligence, or the resources, to do this? Potholes are a real issue, but their cause is arguably chronic underinvestment, exacerbated by utility companies badly patching repairs. Who’s to say the same contractors won’t do the same on pavements? We know what causes congestion: too many cars on the road. They are the least efficient way of moving people around, and they’re killing us via pollution. Conversely, we know the way to cut congestion – and it’s to make cycling, walking and public transport easier. Whatever Chris Grayling says, we, the pedestrians, should remember that. • Laura Laker is a freelance writer for the Guardian, covering the environment and cycling"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2018/may/11/airline-tickets-return-payments-delta-santander","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T06:00:36Z","webTitle":"Bill shock as airlines and banks split over card ticket sales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/11/airline-tickets-return-payments-delta-santander","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/11/airline-tickets-return-payments-delta-santander","fields":{"headline":"Bill shock as airlines and banks split over card ticket sales","bodyText":"A year ago you featured a letter from a reader who was charged twice after booking flights with Delta airlines. It is still happening. I bought a £2,367.82 return flight with Delta and my credit card has been charged for the outward and inward-bound tickets individually. The full sum for both has also been put on hold, meaning I’ve effectively paid twice. Delta advises that it is my bank, Santander, which is at fault. Santander claims to have never heard of this problem and says the ringfenced sum should be unfrozen within five days. This means I’m in danger of exceeding my credit card limit until the second sum is released. GT, Hindhead, Surrey Online forums report similar experiences from travellers who have purchased airline tickets. When you use a debit or credit card, the merchant pre-authorises the sum with your bank to ensure that you have enough funds to settle the debt. This is then reserved by the bank until the transaction is completed or cancelled, or until the pre-authorisation period expires, usually after three to seven days. Although the pre-authorised sum is removed from the available balance, it is not actually debited. According to Santander, Delta pre-authorised the total £2,367.82 cost of the return flight, but when it came to requesting the money, the airline split the cost into two payments of £1,183.91. “As a result, the requested sums did not match the pre-authorised amount and both transactions were debited from the balance, although the £2,367.82 was not actually paid out,” says Santander. “On review, whilst Santander is not at fault, we have offered the customer £50 as a gesture of goodwill for any confusion and inconvenience this may have caused.” Delta explains that it splits return airfares in two to benefit from a lower credit card fee rate and insists the fault lies with banks who should release the hold on reserved funds once the payment has gone through. The same thing happened in the case I featured last May. Although the pre-authorised sum will be reapplied to a customer’s balance in due course, it’s extraordinary that banks and airlines have not worked out a way to avoid this apparent bill shock instead of passing the buck to each other.

In March the players were found not guilty of raping a woman at Jackson’s home after a high-profile trial in Belfast. Jackson and Olding, who both played for the Ireland and Ulster rugby union teams, had been suing BBC Northern Ireland, arguing the decision to report their arrests in November 2016 – before any charges had been brought – infringed their right to privacy. They also claimed that the broadcaster had not given them long enough to respond to a request for comment before publishing the story and raised concerns about how the information had been obtained. The BBC insisted its coverage was justified owing to the players’ high public profiles and said it had acted responsibly in handling the story. The proceedings against the BBC were initially launched in 2016 but had been put on hold pending the outcome of the criminal trial. After Jackson and Olding were unanimously cleared of all charges the rugby players initially indicated their intention to push ahead with the civil privacy case but instead decided to settle it at the high court in Belfast. Kathleen Carragher, the head of BBC News Northern Ireland, said she was pleased with the decision: “We argued throughout this case that our reporting was responsible, accurate, in the public interest and observed the BBC guidelines. “We are pleased that the players have accepted this outcome and have also agreed a contribution to our legal costs.” Jackson also accepted that judgment should be entered against him in a connected case involving the journalist Orla Bannon. She said her “journalism and integrity have been vindicated” by the rugby player’s decision. There were substantial protests against the players’ acquittal after the conclusion of the nine-week criminal trial, while supporters of the pair paid to take out a full-page advert in the Belfast Telegraph, calling for their playing suspensions to be lifted. Amid growing concern from corporate sponsors about reputational damage the pair were sacked by their club side Ulster Rugby and told they would not play for the Irish national side in future. On Wednesday the English club Sale Sharks issued a statement denying speculation that they were interested in signing them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/may/03/spacewatch-one-step-on-for-space-tourism-as-bezos-rocket-lands","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T20:30:03Z","webTitle":"Spacewatch: one step on for space tourism as Bezos rocket lands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/03/spacewatch-one-step-on-for-space-tourism-as-bezos-rocket-lands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/03/spacewatch-one-step-on-for-space-tourism-as-bezos-rocket-lands","fields":{"headline":"Spacewatch: one step on for space tourism as Bezos rocket lands","bodyText":"Blue Origin, the aerospace company owned by Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, has completed the eighth test flight of its New Shepard reusable rocket and unmanned crew capsule, blasting off from West Texas on 29 April.

Daniels’ lawyer called the revelation “stunning” and said: “This is not about sex … this is about a cover-up.” Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and now one of Trump’s lawyers, revealed on Wednesday night that Trump reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 he paid to Daniels. A report emerged on Thursday from NBC that Cohen’s phones had been subject to a federal wiretap and that at least one call between Cohen and the White House had been intercepted. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, in an afternoon briefing shortly afterwards declined to comment on the report. She referred reporters to both Trump’s outside lawyers and the Department of Justice. However NBC later corrected the report saying that Cohen’s calls had been monitored via a pen register, which simply tracks calls and does not involve conversations being recorded. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, claims that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 – months after his wife, Melania, gave birth – and was paid to stay silent as part of a non-disclosure agreement she is now seeking to invalidate. Trump had told reporters on Air Force One last month that he did not know about the $130,000 payment to Daniels – made by Cohen days before the 2016 presidential election – or the source of the money. But after Giuliani said on live television on Wednesday that Trump had indeed reimbursed Cohen for the payment, the president reversed his position in an extraordinary sequence of tweets – just hours before leading a national day of prayer at the White House. At 6.46am on Thursday, Trump wrote on Twitter, in uncharacteristically legal-minded language, that Cohen received a monthly retainer. “Not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement,” a non-disclosure agreement with Daniels. He claimed: “These agreements are … very common among celebrities and people of wealth.” Trump described the allegations of an affair as “false and extortionist”, adding: “Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll [sic] in this transaction.” Sanders said of Trump’s comments on Air Force One: “He didn’t know at the time but eventually learned” about the payments that he made. She added the “president denies and continues to deny” the allegations of an affair but conceded that she only learned of the payments from Giuliani’s appearance on Fox News on Wednesday evening. But watchdog groups and experts argued that despite his contention that no money from his campaign was used to pay off Daniels, Trump still broke campaign finance laws by failing to declare the secret payment to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). No debt to Cohen is listed on Trump’s personal financial disclosure form, which was certified on 16 June 2017. Walter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics and vocal Trump critic, tweeted: “AMAZING! In trying to talk his way out of a campaign finance violation, Trump has inadvertently admitted to filing a false financial disclosure in 2017. He personally certified that his disclosure was ‘complete and correct’.” Shaub added: “This seems like as strong a circumstantial case for a violation as one is going to see. It is absolutely stunning that we’ve reached the point where the president of the United States appears to have lied to the US Office of Government Ethics about a payoff to a porn star.” Norm Eisen, the chair of left-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which has already filed a criminal complaint, added on Twitter: “This dope &amp; evidently his lawyers do not – despite everything – understand how campaign finance law works. Whole point is that money came from outside the campaign &amp; benefitted it. That is the illegal ‘roll’ under review. No one saying it was campaign money.” Crew, which requested a Department of Justice (DoJ) investigation into the payment in March, filed a supplemental criminal and ethics complaint on Thursday. “There is now more than enough evidence for the DoJ to investigate whether President Trump intentionally omitted the Stormy Daniels liability from his personal financial disclosures,” Eisen said. “This is a very serious matter, including because there can be criminal penalties for false statements.” There can be criminal or civil penalties for violating campaign finance laws, although it is as yet unclear what fresh angle of investigation, if any, could be prompted by the latest developments. On Wednesday night, Giuliani told Fox News host Sean Hannity: “They funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it. That was money that was paid by his lawyer. The president reimbursed that over the period of several months.” Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, described Trump’s tweets as “a stunning revelation”. He wrote on Twitter: “Mr Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied. This followed the lies told by others close to him, including Mr Cohen.” Avenatti told MSNBC:“This is not about sex … this is about a cover-up.” FBI agents raided Cohen’s home and office several weeks ago seeking records about the non-disclosure agreement.

The landmark work, first published in 1611, was drafted by more than 40 translators. But according to Nicholas Hardy from Birmingham University, few documents survive from the drafting and revision stages of the translation and little is known about how the translators worked together. Hardy was consulting a printed copy of the ancient Greek version of the Old Testament, which is held in Oxford’s Bodleian Library, when he noticed that the thousands of handwritten annotations in its margins were in the hand of John Bois, one of the King James Bible’s translators. The annotations’ author had previously been unknown. He then followed a “paper trail” to the British Library in London, where he found correspondence between Bois and the renowned French scholar Isaac Casaubon. The unpublished letters revealed that Bois had asked Casaubon for help translating several passages that he and his colleagues were struggling to complete. Once Hardy identified Casaubon as a translator, he studied the Frenchman’s notebooks, which have been held in the Bodleian since the 1670s, finding records of the conversations Casaubon had with the translator Andrew Downes about other complications in the Bible’s text. “I discovered a series of documents that had been sitting in libraries since they were written, for 400 years basically, but their significance hadn’t been realised,” said Hardy. “We think of the King James Bible as a distinctively English cultural product, but as the most famous scholar of ancient Greek literature of the period, [Casaubon] was far more celebrated and pre-eminent than any of the translators who worked on the translation, and [his contributions] increased the prestige of the translation from their point of view. Even something that seems very distinctively, quintessentially English can actually turn out to be a bit more complicated than that.” Casaubon was visiting London at the time of the translation and could “barely speak or write English”, according to Hardy, so he corresponded with the other translators in Latin. “The translators consulted him because they were still dealing with a lot of unresolved problems in the original texts which they were translating from,” said Hardy. “These new sources show us how complex those problems were, and how strongly the translators could disagree with each other about how to solve them. For example, one of the toughest questions they faced was about the relationship between parts of the Old Testament that survived only in Greek and Latin, usually known as the ‘apocryphal’ books, and the parts that survived in Hebrew. Casaubon was there to help the translators deal with issues like this, but they did not always agree with the solutions he put forward.” According to Birmingham University, Hardy’s discovery of the three documents brings the number of known sources associated with the translation of the King James Bible up to seven. The academic, who is writing a book-length study of the King James Bible for Princeton University Press, said the documents “get us as close as we will ever get to hearing the translators in conversation”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/may/11/tokyo-romance-memoir-ian-buruma-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T07:57:36Z","webTitle":"A Tokyo Romance by Ian Buruma review – shaped by Japan\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/11/tokyo-romance-memoir-ian-buruma-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/11/tokyo-romance-memoir-ian-buruma-review","fields":{"headline":"A Tokyo Romance by Ian Buruma review – shaped by Japan\r\n","bodyText":"The writer, historian and recently appointed editor of the New York Review of Books, Ian Buruma, “grew up with two cultures”. His father was a lapsed Dutch Protestant and his mother British, from an Anglo-German Jewish family: “My destiny was to be half in, half out – of almost anything.” He dreamed of escaping from the safe and dull cocoon of his upper-middle-class childhood in The Hague, and the opportunity to study in Tokyo on a scholarship provided the perfect way out. Buruma arrived in Tokyo in 1975, aged 23. For some time he wandered around in a daze, overwhelmed by its “theatrical, even hallucinatory” brashness that made even Los Angeles seem “staid”. Although he quickly tired of his film course, he immersed himself in the Japanese imagination and in this memoir of his years in Japan he writes with real passion about Japanese film and the avant-garde theatre of the time. From the “three greats” of Japanese cinema – Yasujiro Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi and Akira Kurosawa – to yakuza and roman porno (porno romance) films, Buruma found “a rare honesty” about the darker human impulses in the films he saw. Nagisa Oshima’s controversial pornographic art film In the Realm of the Senses (1976) was “a cinematic blow for sexual freedom, especially for women”. Though he struggled initially, Buruma acted in productions by Akaji Maro and Juro Kara – whose surreal, earthy collages of Japanese life were full of slapstick humour, but also what Buruma describes as typically “outlandish” aspects of the culture: the ero, guro and nansensu – the erotic, the grotesque and the absurd. Buruma offers a memorably evocative account of cultural life in 70s Tokyo, illustrated with his striking photography (“the perfect art for a voyeur dancing around the fringes”), and rich with wryly humorous anecdotes about the people he met, as well as the joys and pitfalls of being a stranger in a strange land. After six years in this insular country he was forced to accept that even though he spoke the language and followed the local customs, he would always be a gaijin (literally, an “outside person”). For Buruma the realisation that he no longer had to conform was liberating. When he returned to Europe, he brought this “radical autonomy” with him and concludes: “Japan shaped me”. • A Tokyo Romance: A Memoir is published by Atlantic.

This is how the media is reporting the health secretary’s apology for the scandal. He told the commons that up to 270 women may have died because of the major error which meant that 450,000 women in England were not invited for screening. It’s sad, negligent and unforgivable that so many women have been missed from breast cancer screening over a number of years. One death is too many, let alone hundreds. The catastrophic mismanagement could cost the NHS millions of pounds in claims. Jeremy Hunt’s apology is not good enough. What provision is being made for the women who have suffered physical and emotional pain as a result of this IT failure? And with staffing issues and the NHS at breaking point – under Hunt’s watch – it is no wonder that those on the frontline were unable to pick up on this error. But they should not have had to. Hunt must take responsibility and go. However, beyond the headlines of this breakdown in the system, we should question the effectiveness of routine breast screening. The evidence is dubious at best. Government advice says screening reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer by 35%. But it is more meaningful to look at how many women would need to be screened to prevent deaths from breast cancer. Michael Baum, a professor emeritus of surgery at University College London, estimated that 10,000 women would need to be screened to prevent three to four deaths and that this would lead to 120-140 women being overdiagnosed (this is where non-growing or slow-growing, harmless cancers are found) and having unnecessary treatment. Efficient healthcare requires informed doctors and informed patients. Our current healthcare system falls short on both counts. I fear that most doctors and patients do not understand the available medical evidence. A representative survey of 5,000 women in nine European countries found 92% overestimated the extent to which mammogram screening was able to reduce the number of breast cancer deaths. A separate study found women were more likely to have overdiagnosed breast cancer than early detection of a tumour destined to grow significantly. Any reduction in breast cancer deaths, researchers said, was due to treatment, not screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with a significant burden of morbidity and mortality. All women in England diagnosed early are treated comprehensively, even though some have overdiagnosed, harmless cancers; these women cannot benefit from treatment but are exposed to the physical, psychological and social harms of cancer treatments. As a GP for 35 years, I have been following the emerging evidence on the harms and benefits of breast screening and have been appalled at the skewed information presented to patients and professionals. Women should be rationally informed about the benefits and harms of mammogram screening. In an era of limited healthcare resources, screening services must be scrutinised with regard to effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and harms. When breast screening was introduced in the UK in 1988, researchers suggested it would reduce the cancer death rate by 19% with few harms and at low cost. A 2011 review raised the disturbing possibility that screening could be doing more harm than good. Its authors said: “This means that for every 2,000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will have her life prolonged, and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be diagnosed as breast cancer patients and will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress for many months because of false positive findings.” Public Health England is still nudging women to attend mammogram appointments. It is likely that many women and their clinicians are not fully informed about the true balance of risks and benefits. The good news is that breast cancer deaths are falling. The bad news is that screening mammograms are unlikely to be responsible for that benefit, while possibly causing harm.

The merger of the UK’s second- and third-largest supermarket chains could hand them control of about 30% of the grocery sales, a similar level to Tesco, meaning two businesses would account for 60% of the market in future. “The cost savings being promised through this merger must not come through squeezing those further down the supply chain,” warned Conservative MP Neil Parish, chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee. Parish said such power could mean that suppliers were more reluctant to raise complaints about fair practices for fear of losing a big chunk of business that could not easily be replaced. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the business energy and industrial strategy committee, also called on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to look at how suppliers would be affected. “This merger threatens customer choice, hands yet more power to mighty supermarket players and heaps more pressure on small and medium suppliers. The CMA needs to be a champion of consumers and it must look closely at the impact of this merger on the supply chain as well as the effect on competition in the supermarket sector.” MPs wrote the letter after questioning the farming minister, George Eustice, and the grocery code adjudicator Christine Tacon, who regulates supermarkets’ relationships with direct suppliers, in parliament on Wednesday. Tacon made clear her remit did not cover the prices agreed between supermarkets and their suppliers, but only ensured that they kept to their contracts. The regulator added that she was only responsible for direct suppliers, meaning that she does not deal with many farmers and other small food producers who provide their goods to supermarkets via wholesalers or processors. Parish suggested in the meeting that the government was “not concerned at all by the scale of these two major retailers that will be totally dominant in the market place”, and suggested “Tesco and Sainsbury’s might decide to get together as the government didn’t turn a hair [in relation to Asda and Sainsbury’s]”. Eustice said it was up to the CMA to “methodically” examine the implications of the merger for consumers and the wider market and take any action necessary. He added that it was “open to the CMA to consider the impact on the market as well”. The CMA has already said it is likely to review Sainsbury’s deal with Asda but declined to comment in advance of an inquiry opening. In the next few weeks it is expected to announce whether it will carry out a broad brush “phase 1” review which would last up to 40 days or go straight to a more detail “phase 2”, in which it will examine competition concerns at a local level around the UK and taking up to 24 weeks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/03/royal-picnic-tips-wedding-invitation-guests-feast","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T13:01:10Z","webTitle":"A right royal picnic: tips to turn a wedding invitation into a feast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/03/royal-picnic-tips-wedding-invitation-guests-feast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/03/royal-picnic-tips-wedding-invitation-guests-feast","fields":{"headline":"A right royal picnic: tips to turn a wedding invitation into a feast","bodyText":"The news that the 1,200 members of the public whose good deeds have secured them an invitation to the royal wedding will have to bring their own picnics should come as a relief to those worthy folk. After all, as the American gastronome James Beard put it, if the rain holds off picnics are “one of the supreme pleasures of outdoor life”. Everything tastes better seasoned with fresh air. The best picnics may be casual, but there are a few simple rules for success and, as usual, they mostly involve planning. This is not the time to do a smash and grab at M&amp;S Windsor – you’ll inevitably end up with too much mismatched food that you’ll just have to lug home afterwards. Instead, choose a centrepiece, such as a pie, ham or cheese, and work from there: contrary to popular belief, not all such occasions require a sharing bag of crisps and a dip selection. Think practically: go for foods that travel well. Crusty rolls rather than floppy sandwiches, robust pork pies instead of flimsy quiches, and coleslaw or potato salad in place of delicate leaves prone to wilting in transit. Soft fruits such as strawberries always feel like a good idea but bruise easily and then bleed all over the rug; I would go for naturally packaged citrus fruit instead, though you might prefer to make like the happy couple and have it in cake form (a lemon drizzle is easy to carry). Favour foods that sit happily out of the fridge: washed rind cheeses such as Brie improve as they warm up, while harder cheeses begin to sweat. You’re also better off ditching the butter in favour of mayonnaise or cream cheese. Cured and smoked meats and fish are more suited to sitting around in the sunshine than poached salmon or roast chicken, and baked goods are a wiser option than creamy puddings or boxes of chocolates. Remember the unglamorous stuff too. No one ever regretted making room for rubbish and recycling bags alongside the chilled fizz and plastic flutes, and you can never have too many wet wipes at a picnic. Finally, bear in mind that at the last such bash, guests were served “finger food”. Compared with that, even a packet of Pringles will feel like a banquet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/08/tuesday-best-tv-secret-life-5-year-olds-the-split","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV: The Secret Life of 5 Year Olds; The Split","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/08/tuesday-best-tv-secret-life-5-year-olds-the-split","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/08/tuesday-best-tv-secret-life-5-year-olds-the-split","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV: The Secret Life of 5 Year Olds; The Split","bodyText":"The Secret Life of 5 Year Olds 8pm, Channel 4 Another round of cute psychological experiments, sometimes with a mildly uncomfortable judgmental undertone.

Think again","bodyText":"A girl-piglet and a boy-piglet, a mummy and daddy pig, no LGBTQ characters or focus on race or religion; Peppa Pig isn’t an obvious target for controversy or counterculture worship. At first glance, it could be a pretty solid adult choice for boredom or sleep. Yet the Douyin video platform in China deems its influence to be a potentially harmful one, due to its growing popularity among the country’s shehuiren. That’s anti-establishment “gangster” internet users to some, or people who like memes and get tattoos of asinine cartoon characters because it’s a bit funny to others. Like people who spend a lot of time on Tumblr, Reddit, or 4chan, ironic Peppa Pig fans probably aren’t a danger to the continuation of humanity as we know it. They might need tattoo-removal services at some point, but removal from a video platform of the cartoons they like, as well as their associated hashtags, is a bit much. For many here in the UK, the apparent crackdown in China has been taken as bizarre and hilarious. Peppa as a figurehead for “unruly slackers”, a cult-like hero calling society’s disaffected to rebel? The cartoon? It’s always been a pedestrian watch, probably even for the generation of children it was designed for. To kids watching who come from single-parent families, have two mums, or are living in foster homes, Peppa Pig’s cosily conservative family set-up may be as otherworldly as talking pigs and rabbits. But despite Peppa being so safe – almost antiquated, even – all the sniggering about its removal from the Chinese media platform is what’s truly bizarre. Because it shouldn’t be surprising at all. A group of adults using the creation or censorship of children’s entertainment to further their own political and moral values isn’t unheard of; it’s almost de rigueur, everywhere. There have been understandable examples of censure, such as the episode of the 90s cartoon Gargoyles on gun crime, which was subsequently cut to remove the blood. Even though blood usually happens after a gunshot. And gunshots tend to happen in television episodes that have been commissioned to focus on guns. An episode of TaleSpin was also taken off air, in this case because of its terrorism theme. Yes; the adults who created it animated Baloo to fight against terrorism. In a children’s TV show. Going further back, there’s 1818-47’s The History of the Fairchild Family’s subsequent fall out of regular circulation … because it included a gibbet-side lesson where a child is shown the hanged corpse of a criminal. Adults of the time wanted children to know that criminals deserved to be hanged. If the adults in charge aren’t stealthily dripping their own politics into children’s entertainment, they’re banning it afterwards when it includes politics they don’t agree with. This is what media for children is, because it’s created, and censored, by adults for the adults they want to see in the future. It’s gentle (sometimes not so gentle) social conditioning, and always has been. Politics but, ya know, for kids. The reporting of the censoring of Peppa, with its undertone of “isn’t China weird and funny compared to us – how ridiculous” ignores all this; how politics are used during the creation of entertainment for children, and afterwards by politicians themselves. This isn’t even Peppa’s first foray into the world of politics; she was part of the promotion of the Labour government’s Sure Start programme back in 2010. One episode of the show was banned by the Australian Broadcasting Company for fear it would encourage children to interact with dangerous spiders. The columnist Piers Akerman even accused the programme of pushing “a weird feminist line”. SoDouyin’s action is not unprecedented, nor ridiculous. Not even when it involves innocent little Peppa and her brother George. The innocuous fictional world of Peppa Pig might seem too far removed from our own to become a symbol of unrest, or moral decay in society, but like much media before it, we create it, we consume it, we use it, and we ban it. What is children’s entertainment but a means to prepare our children for the world? And what is the world but a messed-up mire of warring politics created by angry grown-ups? Children need to be ready for this wherever they live – welcome to adulthood, kids. • Phoebe-Jane Boyd is a freelance journalist who writes on politics and pop culture •This article was amended on 5 June 2018 to remove references to China banning Peppa Pig cartoons and make clear that the entity that removed the cartoons was Douyin video platform."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/06/cracks-nuclear-reactor-threaten-uk-energy-policy-hunsterston","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T14:49:43Z","webTitle":"Cracks in nuclear reactor will hit EDF Energy with £120m bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/06/cracks-nuclear-reactor-threaten-uk-energy-policy-hunsterston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/06/cracks-nuclear-reactor-threaten-uk-energy-policy-hunsterston","fields":{"headline":"Cracks in nuclear reactor will hit EDF Energy with £120m bill","bodyText":"The six month closure of one of Britain’s oldest nuclear reactors will burn a £120m hole in the revenues of owner EDF Energy and has raised questions over the reliability of the country’s ageing nuclear fleet. EDF said this week that it was taking reactor 3 of Hunterston B in Scotland offline for half a year, after inspections found more cracks than expected in the graphite bricks at the reactor’s core. The plant is one of seven Advanced Gas-Cooling Reactors (AGRS) switched on during the 1970s and 80s, several of which have seen their lifetimes extended into the 2020s. EDF maintains that the prospect of more old reactors having a sustained outage is highly unlikely, but experts said it would pose a significant challenge to power supplies if they did. Peter Atherton, an analyst at the consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: “Let’s say worst-case scenario they found a big graphite core problem and Hunterston never comes back on. “That would be a big hole in the plan [for electricity supplies]. The gas-fired power stations, we’ve probably got enough of them, but it would be pretty tight. It would also be a knock-back to carbon targets. You could build more windfarms, but that would take time.”The Hunterston outage is the longest yet over the graphite issue, which EDF calls a “unique challenge”, and company presentations concede the cracking “will probably limit the lifetime for the current generation of AGRs”. The graphite core is used to moderate the neutrons in a nuclear reaction, but over time the irradiation degrades the graphite, ultimately leading to cracks. These cause a series of knock-on effects that can impair control of the nuclear reaction. The UK nuclear regulator points out that the total number of cracks is well below specified safety limits. It has also welcomed more frequent inspections such as those that led EDF to take the Hunterston reactor offline. Experts estimate the 40% cut in the power station’s output – it normally supplies enough electricity for 1.8m homes – will cost the French state-owned firm £100m-120m in lost revenue. That is small compared with the impact of temporary safety closures at EDF’s French plants, which led profits to fall 16% last year, but it is still a blow the company could do without as it ramps up construction of the £20bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. EDF will not be the only energy company affected by the outage. Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Bernstein bank, said she thought it would also hurt the price British Gas’s parent company, Centrica, would fetch for its stake in the plants. Centrica recently said it hoped to sell its 20% share by 2020. Brian Cowell, EDF’s generation managing director, said he was very confident the Hunterston reactor would come back online in mid-November. So far, significant cracks have only been found at reactors three and four at Hunterston B. Hinkley Point B, which came online in the same year as Hunterston, is offline to carry out checks for cracks, which will be completed in three to four weeks. “The one that will be worrying them is Hinkley [Point B],” said John Large, a nuclear consultant who has advised the UK government. Hinkley Point has not only become an industry showcase for why new nuclear reactors should be built in the UK, but the old power station is providing electricity for the 3,500-strong workforce constructing the new plant. Nuclear provides about a fifth of UK electricity, but experts said this week that it would slump to 10% by 2027, as the old plants are retired. BMI Research said it did not expect Hinkley Point C to come online by 2025 as planned, given recent warnings of further delays to EDF’s Flamanville plant in France, which uses the same reactor design."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/26/a-letter-to-my-slob-partner","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T05:45:47Z","webTitle":"A letter to… my slob of a partner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/26/a-letter-to-my-slob-partner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/26/a-letter-to-my-slob-partner","fields":{"headline":"A letter to… my slob of a partner","bodyText":"I know you think there should be more sex in this relationship, and I know you think it’s my fault. But you must realise that nobody is obliged to have sex if they don’t want to, even if they are in a long-term relationship. I never signed up to anything or made any promises to you. I can exercise my own free will about what I do with my body, just as I can about what I eat and how I spend my spare time. Instead of focusing on me, therefore, I think a positive move for you would be to consider your own level of sexual appeal and how it can be enhanced. Although men tend not to obsess about their physical appearance in the way women are encouraged to, maybe you should have a think about it. Nobody wants to get into body-shaming but there are some quite basic things you could do, such as getting a haircut that doesn’t look as if it was done with a knife and fork, and buying jeans that fit so as to minimise the appearance of the builder’s arse whenever you bend down. Most of your pants are pretty revolting, too: new pants are not expensive. There is also your behaviour. Never offering someone any help, support, kind deeds, compliments or affection is all very well, but I really think it is only polite that that should be extended to never offering them sexual opportunities either, by which I mean slyly pawing or pressing against them in bed. If you want the sex, then start by doing the other stuff. Finally, I think you should consider the potential aphrodisiac properties of being less messy and performing simple everyday household tasks, so I don’t have to. Put the dishwasher on. Clean the worktops. Refrain from flicking teabags into the bin so I don’t have to repaint the kitchen wall every six months. As someone once said, it’s hard to shout at a man when he’s vacuuming. And on the flip side, it’s hard to find a man attractive when you have washed his undies and scrubbed the loo and carried out all those other acts of drudgery. There is a possibility that doing all this will render you tired and resentful enough to put you off sex, too; let me say that I am willing to take that risk. It is quite possible that you will do all of these things and I will still give you the cold shoulder. But at least then you can say you have tried, and if it does happen then I will happily take the blame and wear the mantle of “frigid bitch” with pride. • We will pay £25 for every letter we publish.

Shankland totalled an impressive 8.5/11, was awarded the $50,000 first prize, and advanced his world rating to 2700, the seventh American to reach the super-grandmaster level. Caruana, who challenges Magnus Carlsen for the world crown in November, was the pre-tournament favourite and fought hard all the way but was half a point short at the end. His early unnecessary defeat against Zviad Izoria, where he refused a draw then overpressed in the endgame, proved costly, and Caruana also had narrow escapes against Shankland and Nakamura. Meanwhile, thousands of miles away in Shamkir, Azerbaijan, Carlsen stayed in second gear as he won the elite event unbeaten with 6/9, three wins and six draws. The world champion was mostly content to halve with Black and press with White, though he did make an exception in a convincing game against Anish Giri, the Dutch No 1. For a long time Carlsen had a minus score against the Dutchman and there is needle between them. Reverting to Shankland, the intriguing question is how he was able to make such a quantum jump in his results in his mid-20s, an age when players normally start to plateau. One significant factor he mentioned has been his sessions with IM Jacob Aagaard, whose advanced instruction book, Thinking Inside the Box, has a foreword by Shankland and includes extended advice on how to look for and select candidate moves when you are analysing. A summary of its contents and an excerpt can be found online. Shankland’s own book, Small Steps to Giant Improvement, was published last month and shows the importance of pawn play in strategic chess. Writing your first major book can be a stimulus to a results breakthrough for a strong master. Other notable instances being Reuben Fine who wrote his seminal work Basic Chess Endings just a few months before he scored his greatest triumph, shared first at Avro 1938, and Bobby Fischer, whose classic My 60 Memorable Games was published not long before he began his surge to the world title in 1970-72. There was another significant milestone for China’s steady and persistent advance as a major power. Ding Liren finished second in Shamkir, half a point behind Carlsen, jumped to No 6 in the world, the highest ever by a player from his country, and moved to within 10 points of the elite 2800 level. Shankland’s 15-year-old opponent in the final round tried to surprise him with a recent Caro-Kann novelty 7…e5!? only to be met immediately by the still more recent 8 h3! when the critical line, prepared by Shankland, runs 8…Na5 7 Qc2 exf4 10 hxg4 Nxg4 11 Kf1 h5. Liang’s 8…exf4? followed by 11…g6?! (g5!) was weaker and White soon had a clear edge, with the g5 pawn restricting Black’s activity. When Shankland’s 18 Nb3! switched to an attack against the light squares around the black king, Liang had no answer and 32 Bxc6+! led to a winning endgame. At the end Black resigned in the face of the double threat 44 Nxd5, winning another pawn, and 44 Re3-g3, trapping the knight.

The court of appeal, responding to an attempt by the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) to overturn last summer’s verdict, said the key issue that needed to be examined was the accepted principle that the British government should “not grant a licence if there is a clear risk that the items might be used in the commission of a serious violation of international humanitarian law”. The issue of British arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and the government’s support for the Saudi intervention in Yemen, has become more controversial as the war in Yemen has dragged on, plunging the country into increasing chaos and hunger. Saudi-led forces have also been accused of air raids in which civilians have been killed. The granting of the appeal will allow campaigners to challenge the high court ruling that the secretary of state for international trade had not acted unlawfully or irrationally in refusing to block export licences for the multi-billion sale and transfer of arms and military equipment. In written evidence two years ago the government admitted that, as the conflict in Yemen worsened, a Saudi request to accelerate the delivery of Paveway precision-guided bombs, training and other assistance had been granted. Giving the group leave to appeal, Lord Justice Irwin and Lord Justice Flaux said the government should not be allowed to “balance the risk of serious violation of international humanitarian law against any other, extraneous considerations, including whether the end of British arms sales to Saudi Arabia would make matters better or worse in the Yemen”. Andrew Smith, of CAAT, said later: “The Saudi-led bombardment of Yemen has killed thousands of people and created one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the world. “Despite this, the Saudi regime has been armed and supported every step of the way by successive UK governments. “We believe that these arms sales are immoral, and are confident that the court of appeal will agree that they are unlawful.” Britain sells billions of pounds worth of arms to Saudi Arabia, which is historically one of its major arms markets. There was a sharp increase last year in deals that critics such as Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, have described as being done “behind closed doors, and shrouded in secrecy”. Commenting on the ruling, Rosa Curling, of law firm Leigh Day, representing the campaigners, said: “We are delighted the court of appeal judges have recognised that a full hearing into this case must take place. “It is clear from the open evidence in this claim that there is a clear risk the arms sold from the UK might be used in serious violation of international law. Where our politicians have sadly failed to follow UK legislation and policy, our client hopes the court will ensure the rule of law is upheld.” A government spokesman said: “We remain confident that the UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world and will continue to defend the decisions being challenged. “We keep our defence exports under careful review to ensure they meet the rigorous standards of the consolidated EU and national arms export-licensing criteria.” The decision was also welcomed by other aid organisations who have been campaigning on the Yemen issue. Shane Stevenson, Oxfam’s country director in Yemen, said: “We welcome the court of appeal’s decision. The UK should not continue to sell arms where there is the real likelihood that they will exacerbate what is already the world’s largest humanitarian disaster.” Save the Children hailed the ruling in a statement, saying: “Since the beginning of the conflict at least 6,000 children have been killed or injured in what the UN describes as an ‘entirely manmade’ catastrophe. “More than 16,000 air raids have occurred across the country, including attacks on schools, hospitals and markets – one air raid every 90 minutes for the last three years. During the same period the UK has licensed £4.6bn worth of arms to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia … The UK government has both a moral and legal obligation to ensure British-made weapons aren’t killing and maiming children in Yemen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/08/cannes-2018-top-10-film-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"Cannes 2018: our critic's 10 must-see films at this year's festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/08/cannes-2018-top-10-film-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/08/cannes-2018-top-10-film-festival","fields":{"headline":"Cannes 2018: our critic's 10 must-see films at this year's festival","bodyText":"1.

Since he joined the Bank in 2013, he has marched borrowers and savers up the hill with heavy hints about the imminent prospect of a rate rise, only to march them back down again. Last November’s restoration of 2016’s emergency rate cut hardly qualified as a major move, whatever the Bank said about its significance. Until an interview with the BBC during the IMF spring meetings a fortnight ago, it seemed to be a racing cert that the Bank was finally ready to begin the long journey back to 3% and push the base rate from 0.5% to 0.75%. The markets were guided to expect action at a meeting of the monetary policy committee on Thursday. And it wasn’t just Carney dropping hints. Almost every member of the committee who had previously blocked a rise had gone on the record arguing that the time for a rate increase was near at hand. Speeches by external member Jan Vlieghe constituted the most startling intervention. During 2016 and much of 2017, the former hedge fund economist turned interest-rate setter was one of the most vociferous opponents of a rise. His former brethren in the Square Mile considered him an arch dove who might never vote to increase rates, such was his downbeat view of the economy’s growth potential. Yet, towards the end of last year, he was one of the most optimistic proponents of the economy’s resilience and the likelihood of a rate rise. Just as before, a moment of central bank exuberance looks like becoming a non-event – which is strange given Vlieghe’s reasoning for backing an increase last year. Then, he said that ultra-low unemployment, steady growth and the probable end to a long period of declining real wages was enough to justify tighter monetary policy. None of those things has changed. Unemployment remains the lowest it has been since the 1970s, at 4.2%, and is expected to stay that way for the foreseeable future. Growth, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP) data, is expected to show continued expansion with no prospect of a recession on the horizon. And inflation should decline this year, to leave consumer incomes in a healthier position. There is no doubt that the prospect of wages outstripping inflation this year and next was a key element of Vlieghe’s and Carney’s argument. And it looked as if their resolve would be stiffened by a piece of the Bank’s own analysis that argued Brexit was having a bigger effect than previously thought. A tight labour market, denied its regular injections of overseas workers, would overheat more quickly than before, sending wages spiralling. It meant that a growth rate of more than 1.5% would now be considered inflationary – compared with the previous 2.5%. Then came a slew of figures showing that the economy might struggle to achieve even 1.5% growth this year and next. Wage increases, which were supposed to become stratospheric, were stuck on the ground. Surveys last week of the construction, manufacturing and services sector showed them all expanding, but at a snail’s pace. If Bank of England officials were truly dedicated to the cause of higher rates – if only to have something to cut in the event of a downturn – they would see through the spring dip and press ahead. So a reasonable conclusion must be that their hearts were never in the project – and that rates will stay low for a very long time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/04/talking-horses-gustav-klimt-2000-guineas-newmarket-aidan-o-brien-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T23:01:35Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Gustav Klimt can bag Guineas for master trainer O’Brien","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/04/talking-horses-gustav-klimt-2000-guineas-newmarket-aidan-o-brien-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/04/talking-horses-gustav-klimt-2000-guineas-newmarket-aidan-o-brien-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Gustav Klimt can bag Guineas for master trainer O’Brien","bodyText":"The abrupt emergence of Masar as a potential Classic winner gives the 2,000 Guineas today at Newmarket a familiar Godolphin versus Ballydoyle look, but one of the more open renewals of recent years has several more genuine contenders in the field. Expert Eye and Elarqam have serious claims on the pick of their juvenile form, while James Garfield beat Expert Eye in the Greenham and will have his backers with Frankie Dettori taking the reins. There is also market confidence behind Mark Johnston’s Elarqam, which has not been the case for Saxon Warrior, one of Aidan O’Brien’s two main contenders. O’Brien’s Gustav Klimt (3.35), though, looks very solid at the top of the betting. He did not post a wide-margin win to compare with Masar’s on his seasonal debut but Gustav Klimt was, in his way, just as impressive, as he quickened well on testing ground. He somehow plucked victory from defeat in last season’s Superlative Stakes too, and has the class and turn of foot to give O’Brien his ninth 2,000 Guineas winner. Newmarket 1.50 Dommersen is an intriguing runner for John Gosden and Dettori. This will be just his ninth start at the age of five, but he has looked to have plenty of talent on several of his trips to the track and seems sure to improve for his first start in 574 days at Kempton in March. Goodwood 2.05 Architecture finished second to Minding in the 2016 Oaks but failed to win in three starts last year. Mori’s form also tailed off a little last year, but she has had a wind op over the winter and could be set for a productive season. Newmarket 2.20 Mabs Cross has the benefit of a run when she looked a little unlucky in Listed company at Bath and that may give her the edge over Judicial and the admirable Havana Grey. Goodwood 2.40 Johnston has a strong hand here and Masham Star, third in a Listed event at Wolverhampton in March, has picked up useful draw for a front-runner in stall one. Newmarket 2.55 Defoe put up only one poor performance last year when he beat only one home in the St Leger at Doncaster.

Shot in a single grainy black-and-white take, with rough unprocessed sound, it sees the artist seated against the black railings of a bed, a pillow on her knees, and cryingwhile she talks about being autistic in the second person. “You will be told you are a troublemaker,” the voiceover starts. “That the thing you can’t put into words yet, that divorces you from everyone else, is responsible for the way the other kids pick on you, and you really must try harder to fit in.” Lasting just under six minutes, it is a confession of remarkable rawness and heft. “It’s something I’ve wanted to say for a long time: ‘This is my life, this is what it’s been like’,” she says. Born in 1989, Poe was diagnosed with autism at 21, and sees the neurodivergent condition as an integral part of her identity. “It’s not something I can turn off. It’s everything that I am,” she says. Which makes listening to phrases in her film such as, “Nobody will ever tell you what is wrong with you, just that you are wrong,” so powerful. . Turner prize-winner Mark Wallinger, one of the award’s judges, describes her film as unforgettable: “The most explicit expression of having that condition. I have never heard it quite articulated like that.” “There are no how-to manuals on how to be autistic,” says Poe. “And no one [who isn’t] can fully comprehend what it’s like to live in a world that is so completely not suited to [those who are].” The piece is not introspective, says Poe, but is reaching outwards, in an attempt not just to communicate her own experiences but to make a difference for anyone going through something similar. “I felt alone for so long. This prize had made me realise that I am not alone, that there are other people listening.” Poe started vlogging on YouTube in her mid-teens, and went on to self-publish several volumes of prose and poetry on Amazon. She speaks of the internet as being a safe haven for people on the spectrum, fostering communities and building communication. Her spoken-word piece to camera was inspired by prolific feminist writer and YouTuber Savannah Brown, whose award-winning self-published collection of poetry saw her shortlisted for the Goodreads Choice award 2016 and land a book deal with Penguin Random House. With the support of Spectrum – the south-west’s leading charity for autism services – Poe plans to write a book that expands on the text of the film, as a resource not just for people with autism, but all those who fall through societal cracks. She lists everyone from people of colour, women and girls to LGBT individuals, those who suffer from other mental illnesses or living in deprived areas where the services just aren’t there or have been shut down. Getting the award, and the £10,000 it brings, is obviously life-changing, but so was the lead-up to the prize. “My life had been completely stagnant and predictable, very little change from day to day. I have anxiety and depression, and it had gone into overdrive,” she says. “And then I got the email that said I’d been shortlisted. It was like real life finally kicked in, and I had to leave the house and start making plans and talking to people. It was a huge motivator, and I’ve already achieved so much more than I thought I could.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/07/seven-ways-to-prevent-weak-bones","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"Seven ways ... to prevent weak bones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/07/seven-ways-to-prevent-weak-bones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/07/seven-ways-to-prevent-weak-bones","fields":{"headline":"Seven ways ... to prevent weak bones","bodyText":"Walk quickly for 10 minutes, three times a day Weight-bearing exercise (walking, running) helps to keep bones strong. Ideally, you need a mix of “feet on the ground” activity and muscle resistance such as weights, press-ups and swimming. No one knows precisely how much exercise is needed; the NHS says adults aged 19 to 64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week. Three 10-minute periods of fast walking every day is a good target. There is little evidence that exercise prevents fractures once you have weak bones (called osteopenia if it is mild and osteoporosis if more severe), but people who keep active into old age are less likely to fall – and if you don’t fall, you are less likely to break a bone. Don’t smoke – especially when you are young Smoking has an impact on bone-building cells, especially in people younger than 30, who are still accumulating bone. Smokers are at increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures and stopping smoking is likely to improve bone strength. It is a complicated association: smokers may also be thinner than the healthy weight range; if you fall but have no padding, you are more likely to fracture a bone. After the menopause, women make some oestrogen – which keeps bones strong – in their fat layer. Once your ovaries stop producing oestrogen, you can’t make much of it if you don’t have any fat. Don’t get too thin No one is saying that it helps to be overweight; you need to be able to keep moving, of course, and the heavier you are, the more force will land on your bones if you fall. But small-framed, low-weight people have less total bone mass. As a result, losing even small amounts of weight may result in bones that break easily. HRT helps Women are four times more likely than men to get osteoporosis, since their levels of oestrogen fall after the menopause. Hormone replacement therapy can help maintain strong bones and prevent fragility fractures (fractures that occur on minimal force). Once you have osteoporosis, though, it is not very effective. You don’t need calcium supplements, but consider vitamin D A healthy, balanced diet should provide the recommended 700 millgrams a day of calcium that you need to make new bone as old bone is replaced. There is no good evidence that calcium supplements are needed if you are at low risk of osteoporosis. There has been some concern that taking extra calcium may lead to harmful deposits around the heart, increasing the risk of heart attack. The consensus is that dietary sources are preferable to supplements, except if you can’t get enough calcium from your diet because you have a condition such as Crohn’s disease that prevents adequate absorption of dietary calcium. You need about 10 micrograms a day of vitamin D for healthy bones; 90% comes from the action of sunlight on our skin and 10% from diet (such as oily fish). People who never expose their skin to sunlight or have a restricted diet may need vitamin D supplements. The NHS recommends that breast-fed babies up to one year old and all children aged one to four should have a daily supplement, while children over five and adults should consider one in the winter months. Don’t trip up The main risk of having thin bones is fragility fractures. Elderly people who fall and break a hip may never regain their independence. Vertebral fractures may be silent initially, but tend to recur and can become multiple and extremely painful and disabling. One of the most useful things you can do for a frail relative or friend is check their home for potential hazards such as loose carpet. Occupational therapy assessment, to fit hand rails to steps and baths, can be accessed via local authority websites or a GP referral. Know your risk You are at increased risk of osteoporosis if you are elderly, female, underweight or immobile; if you have had previous fractures; and if you smoke, drink a lot of alcohol (more than 30 units a week) or take steroids for a condition such as rheumatoid arthritis. You can do your own risk assessment (there is a useful risk calculator on the University of Sheffield’s website). In some cases, a bone density scan is useful. This can be arranged by your GP, but the scan needs to be taken in context of your overall risk. If you are at high risk, you will probably be advised to have treatment to build up your bones, even if the scan is normal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/may/04/nobel-literature-prize-postponement-attempts-to-retain-some-dignity","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T12:56:11Z","webTitle":"Nobel literature prize: anomalous vanity bauble scrambles for dignity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/04/nobel-literature-prize-postponement-attempts-to-retain-some-dignity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/04/nobel-literature-prize-postponement-attempts-to-retain-some-dignity","fields":{"headline":"Nobel literature prize: anomalous vanity bauble scrambles for dignity","bodyText":"The Nobel prize in literature, which was postponed on Friday following a sex assault scandal, has always been an anomaly among the family of awards established in 1895 by the will of the Swedish chemist and armaments manufacturer Alfred Nobel. The peace prize makes a statement about the state of the world, and the economics, science and medical prizes bring attention to often epoch-making work, giving kudos to the institutions that produced it as well as to the individual winners, but the literature award is a vanity bauble often awarded at a stage of a writer’s career when they no longer really need it. The average age of a Nobel literature laureate is 67. As the 87-year-old Doris Lessing famously remarked, on being told of her win as she emerged from a London taxi in 2007: “Oh Christ. It’s been going on for 30 years. One can get more excited.” Nine years later, the 75-year-old Bob Dylan even more famously responded with silence. For seasoned Nobel watchers, award day often appears to be a ritual humiliation by a shadowy society of sadists. As one journalist wryly tweeted, the announcement of the first Belorussian literature laureate in 2015 was accompanied by the sound of 10,000 reporters Googling Svetlana Alexievich. Alexievich turned out to be one of the better winners, drawing attention to the veteran journalist’s dogged work investigating and exposing the human toll of living in Russia’s shadow. Dylan’s win came after years of his name bobbing around in bookmakers’ odds. It was always assumed to be a bookies’ joke, but now seems likely to have stemmed from a sly wink from someone inside the Swedish Academy. The volatility of the odds in the days leading up to each prize had long suggested there was a mole in the academy ranks, as has now been confirmed as part of the recent convulsions. It is not unprecedented for the award to skip a year, but hiatuses have usually been the result of war, as in 1914, 1918 and 1940. In its scramble to keep its dignity, the academy announced that this year’s award was merely being postponed, as it has been on seven other occasions. “Nothing is changed in our work except the announcement of a laureate, which is postponed until early October next year along with that year’s laureate. A procedure not unusual,” said Nobel chairman Per Wästberg, gamely recalling the year that another such postponement resulted in William Faulkner and Bertrand Russell rolling up together, “Russell in splendid witty form, Faulkner basically drunk.” As the (postponed) 1925 winner George Bernard Shaw remarked: “I find it easy to forgive the man who invented a devilish instrument like dynamite, but how can one ever forgive the diabolical mind that invented the Nobel prize in literature?” With a prize purse of £836,000, however, a great many sins can, and will, continue to be forgiven. Who knows, the jury might even do something seriously face-saving, like awarding two women in the same year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/04/len-mccluskey-and-unite-cleared-of-breaching-election-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T14:50:26Z","webTitle":"McCluskey and Unite cleared of breaching election rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/04/len-mccluskey-and-unite-cleared-of-breaching-election-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/04/len-mccluskey-and-unite-cleared-of-breaching-election-rules","fields":{"headline":"McCluskey and Unite cleared of breaching election rules","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn’s close ally Len McCluskey has survived an attempt to force a rerun of his leadership election. The head of Unite faced a claim from his rival Gerard Coyne that both he and the union had breached election rules. The retired high court judge Jeffrey Burke QC, acting on behalf of the certification officer, rejected Coyne’s claim that the election should have been declared null and void. Coyne said the election of a general secretary in April 2017 should not have been called and that McCluskey continued to act as head of the union after he stood down. The hearing was closely monitored by all factions within the Labour movement because Unite is Labour’s biggest donor, supports Corbyn’s office and has former and current employees in key roles in the party. There will be a hearing in June regarding other claims Coyne in which he has accused the union and McCluskey’s supporters of breaching union rules. Among eight further complaints, the union will be accused of using facilities to stop Coyne from pursuing an investigation into whether union facilities were improperly used to buy a £700,000 flat for McCluskey. However, it is not thought that the outstanding complaints will lead to a rerun of the election. A Unite spokesperson said: “Unite welcomes the assistant certification officer’s rejection of Mr Coyne’s complaint, and his ruling that the union acted in accordance with its rules in calling a general secretary election. “It should be noted that when the general secretary election was called no complaints or objections were made by Mr Coyne or any other individuals.” Coyne said he was considering whether to appeal against the decision. “I am confident that the evidence we will present will demonstrate that this election was not conducted properly or in a way that respected the interests of Unite’s members,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/12/michael-chabon-pops-fatherhood-piece-parenting-teenagers-essays","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"Michael Chabon: ‘Parent properly and you’re doing yourself out of a job’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/12/michael-chabon-pops-fatherhood-piece-parenting-teenagers-essays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/12/michael-chabon-pops-fatherhood-piece-parenting-teenagers-essays","fields":{"headline":"Michael Chabon: ‘Parent properly and you’re doing yourself out of a job’","bodyText":"Michael Chabon is one of America’s best-loved writers, the author of nine novels, including The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay (which won the Pulitzer prize), Wonder Boys, The Yiddish Policemen’s Union and Moonglow. In 2009, he published Manhood for Amateurs, a series of reflections on his early years as a father. Now, with Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces, 54-year-old Chabon has collected his essays about parenting four teenagers. A few years ago, Chabon’s wife, the novelist Ayelet Waldman, wrote a controversial essay for the New York Times in which she claimed to love her husband more than her children (and to be the only one of her married friends still having regular sex). Chabon’s meditations on fatherhood are less likely to offend – they’re generous, very Californian (Chabon lives in Berkeley) and full of warm, often humorous anecdotes. If Manhood for Amateurs was about taking on responsibility, Pops feels like it’s about letting go as your kids grow up. Eventually, one of the things you come up against as a parent is the limitation of your importance in your kids’ life. They go off and forge relationships and make families by choice, in one way or another. You recede and dwindle in importance. If you are parenting properly, you’re parenting yourself out of a job. In the introduction to Pops, you recall a long-ago conversation with an older author who told you that you had to choose between being a great novelist or a father. I realised I wasn’t interested in the question of balancing one’s art and one’s life as a parent. I’m not saying it isn’t a problem, but I was trying to consider a different question – what difference does it make in the end, either way? Either your books will be forgotten or even if you are remembered in 100 years, you won’t be around to enjoy it. You write about a discussion with your daughter in which you talk about how important it is to be a “freakozoid”. How do we encourage our children to embrace their own weirdnesses? My daughter went to fifth grade one day wearing a dress on top of jeans, a green rubber apron with blue frogs all over it and a Martha Washington bonnet that we’d bought on a family trip to Washington’s home at Mount Vernon. When your kid has an impulse like that you either say: “Go change your clothes, people are going to make fun of you, you look ridiculous” or you say: “See you this afternoon.” If you choose the latter option then you take a step in the direction of encouraging your kid’s freakozoid tendencies. In Against Dickitude, you gently upbraid your elder son for his textual mistreatment of a female friend. She’s interested in him and he either doesn’t reply or sends emotionless one-word responses. How have you found bringing up teenagers during the boom years of social media? When I observe the lives not just of my teenage children but also of their friends, it’s just so much harder now and that’s almost exclusively because of social media. When I was a teenager, I might arrive at school on a Monday and gradually come to realise that a party had occurred over the weekend to which I had not been invited. But I was blissfully unaware of that over the weekend when the party was going on. That Fomo [fear of missing out] is just a routine part of adolescence now and you’re always vividly and constantly aware of all of the apparently fun things that are going on within your supposed friend group to which you have not been invited. You write about your children by name. Do you ask their permission? Do you worry about their right to private lives? Everything you write is drawn from the people you know. You can do all this sweating and agonising about whether it’s going to embarrass them or make them angry and often it just sails right over them and they don’t even recognise that you’re talking about them. Saying that, writing Little Man [an essay in Pops about taking his 13-year-old son to Paris fashion week] was the single hardest short piece of writing I’ve ever had to do. What’s the last really great book you read? I just reread for probably the fifth time The Queen’s Gambit by Walter Tevis. I had to teach it at the State University of New York. Every time I read it I’m overcome afresh with admiration for it and with awe for the control of its performance. How do you organise your books? Alphabetically, in the most part. We have a house where we live here in Berkeley and we have a summer house in Maine, which is full of all the books we couldn’t fit in here. There are some glassed-in shelves in our house in Maine in which, one summer’s day a few years back when I didn’t have a whole lot else to do, I organised them by colour. That looks pretty spectacular. Which classic novel did you read recently for the first time? I’m not sure if it quite counts as a classic, but I just read Sebald’s Austerlitz for the first time. I loved it – it’s beautiful. It was the one of his that I hadn’t read. Which book would you give to a young person? Books that I loved as a child and which I then reread to my children who also loved them were The Dark Is Rising series of novels. They are so fantastic. Also Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain, based on Welsh mythology and The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster. Finally, there’s Harriet the Spy by Louise Fitzhugh, which I mostly loved because she wanted to be a writer when she grew up. What books do you read for sheer pleasure? I go back to Edgar Allan Poe, Raymond Chandler. There’s a little-known American thriller novelist called Ross Thomas. I’ll pick one of his books up and I’ll only sometimes have to read a chapter or two to re-establish contact with whatever it was that was comforting and familiar about it • Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces by Michael Chabon is published by Fourth Estate (£10).

I don’t know about the managers of Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United or Arsenal, but Jürgen Klopp, hero of Liverpool, has said loud and clear that he cannot understand why this country should be heading for the Brexit cliff. For the terrible prospect now, as the so called “negotiations” with our European partners proceed nowhere slowly, is that unless someone exercises serious leadership soon, there is quite possibly going to be an almighty political and social crisis. The progress of the “negotiations” was well summarised for Llewellyn Consulting recently by the veteran British expert on all things to do with the EU, Peter Ludlow. He described phase one of the negotiations as “not so much a negotiation as a managed and semi-camouflaged retreat”. The promises made, and concessions demanded, by the Brexiters of whom our hapless prime minister is so terrified have been scattered like ninepins. But the leading Brexiters are content to absorb one blow after another in order to realise their fantasy of “regaining control” – provided that control is not exercised by the parliament whose sovereignty they regard as sacred, except when it doesn’t suit them. I have already reported the finding by Bettergovgroup that “there is now widespread public recognition that the referendum was flawed and that people were not given the relevant facts”. This is hardly surprising when one realises that our former ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, had to explain to the leading Brexiters in the cabinet after the referendum what the customs union and single market actually were. If there was this level of ignorance among the people in the vanguard of the charge towards the cliff, it is no surprise that so many ordinary citizens, with so much else on their minds, have little idea either. They could do worse than read an article by the former mayor of New York, and founder of the financial news organisation that bears his name, Michael Bloomberg. Much of the current controversy surrounds the question of what, if any, customs union there should be. However, retaining the customs union is a necessary, but by no means sufficient, condition if we are to avoid serious disruption to our everyday lives, and an almost guaranteed reduction in standard of living. As Bloomberg reminds us, the customs union is essentially about common tariffs. It is the single market – championed by no less a heroine to the Brexiters than Margaret Thatcher – that allows frictionless commerce with the EU, all of which would be seriously disrupted by the restriction of free movement of goods and people that would be inflicted by a “hard Brexit”. For, make no mistake, we are part of a European economy. Bloomberg writes about the cliff-edgers: “Led by a government lacking faith in its own policy, they’ve failed to give any remotely plausible account of how their preferred hard Brexit can succeed.” Leaving would be like unscrambling a vast economic omelette. As Bloomberg epitomises it: “The Brexit vote was a mistake, and ought to be reversed now, not later.” I could not agree with him more, or with Klopp, who says Brexit “makes no sense at all … let’s vote again with the right information”. For me, the geopolitical case for not disrupting Europe at any time – and certainly not at a time like this – is overwhelming. But it is the economic damage that ought to get through to people. In the London Review of Books, political scientist David Runciman, whose views I usually respect, suggests that “a decision to reverse the Brexit vote would … have serious consequences for national prestige”. Sorry, but the Brexit vote has itself had serious consequences for national prestige. A parliamentary vote to reverse it would demonstrate that at last we have seen sense. At which point I should emphasise that I do not wish to “badmouth” the many ordinary citizens who voted for Brexit. But I do think they were not informed about what was at stake. We are already seeing the damage in the difficulty the NHS, which depends heavily on immigrant employees, is having with recruitment. The Road Haulage Association agrees with what the EU’s Michel Barnier has said: falling out of the EU would bring chaos at the ports and airports and severe disruption to supply chains. Some people say that to question “the will of the people” would cause social disruption. But I suspect that dropping out of the customs union and the single market would make memories of the three-day week and “winter of discontent” in the 1970s look like a vicarage tea party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/04/standing-up-for-transsexual-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T15:39:27Z","webTitle":"Standing up for transsexual rights | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/04/standing-up-for-transsexual-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/04/standing-up-for-transsexual-rights","fields":{"headline":"Standing up for transsexual rights","bodyText":"We are transsexual people deeply concerned about the proposed removal of safeguards from the Gender Recognition Act.

Tree cover in urban areas has declined at a rate of around 175,000 acres per year, while impervious cover – such as roads and buildings – has increased significantly across the country. An estimated 40% of new impervious surfaces were in areas where trees used to grow, the study found. The total loss of tree cover reached 1% across cities and surrounding areas in the five years between 2009-2014. As four-fifths of Americans live in urban areas, it has serious environmental, social and economic ramifications, warned researchers. “Understanding where these losses are occurring and the magnitude of change will hopefully facilitate informed discussions on how much tree cover communities want to have in the coming years, and on the roles of urban trees in sustaining environmental quality and human health and wellbeing,” said David Nowak, co-author of the study, published in the journal Urban Forestry and Urban Greening. Urban forests moderate climate and reduce carbon emissions, improving the quality of air and water. Properly placed around buildings, trees can save energy by reducing the need for air conditioning by 30% and for heating by up to 50%. They also mitigate rainfall runoff, offering vital barriers in flood-prone cities. The estimated loss of these benefits – including carbon storage, pollution reduction, altered energy use in buildings – is valued at $96m (£71m) per year. Urban trees also have social advantages, such as improving people’s mental and physical health. “Trees in urban areas help ward off pollution, providing a long list of benefits for people and the planet,” said Rolf Skar, forest campaign director for Greenpeace USA. “This news proves once again that we need to prioritise adding more green spaces to our cities.” Researchers Nowak and Eric Greenfield analysed tree cover in US cities and surrounding areas between 2009 and 2014. They looked specifically at urban areas in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and a broader category named “urban/community areas”, which includes both urban land and politically defined community areas. They found that 45 states showed a net decline in urban tree cover, with 23 states experiencing significant decreases – resulting in an overall annual net loss of 0.12%, which is comparable to 175,000 acres of tree cover. Alabama, Florida and Georgia were the states with the greatest annual net loss in tree cover in urban/community areas. Georgia saw the worst results, losing 18,830 acres of tree cover per year, and Florida showed a loss of 18,060 acres. Wyoming, Minnesota and Alaska were the only states to have no recorded change in urban/community tree cover over the five years. In solely urban areas, the state of Oklahoma recorded the largest tree cover losses at a rate of 0.92%, followed by Washington DC at 0.44% per year. While there was no significant increase in tree cover in US urban areas over five years, impervious surfaces such as concrete increased by 167,000 acres per year across the states. This represented an overall growth of 1% in urban areas. There was no impervious cover loss. “Trees improve city living,” said Paul de Zylva, senior nature campaigner for Friends of the Earth. “It’s worrying that trends show so many are being lost in US cities when leading cities worldwide are experiencing the many benefits of investing in trees as part of their plans to improve urban life.” Nowak and Greenfield warn that tree loss will “likely continue into the future, unless forest management and/or urban development policies are altered, particularly given the threats to urban trees associated with development, climate change, insects and diseases, and fire”.

But they haven’t – the solidarity of the exploited, which Marx took to be necessary to end capitalism, scarcely exists. “What the bourgeoisie produces, above all, are its own gravediggers,” he and Friedrich Engels wrote 170 years ago in The Communist Manifesto. “Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.” Not really: capitalism today is rampant. In the kind of historical irony that the philosopher Hegel called the cunning of reason, capitalism has even co-opted its gravediggers to keep it alive: China, the world’s biggest socialist society (if only ostensibly) supplies capitalist enterprises with cheap labour that undercuts other workers around the world. So is Marx finished? Not at all. For me, what makes Marx worth reading now is not his Panglossian prognoses, but his still resonant diagnoses. For instance, he and Engels foresaw how globalisation would work. “In place of the old wants,” they wrote, “satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes.” That’s why Chinese workers make products we never conceived would exist, let alone that we would covet, and that would convert us into politically quiescent, borderline sociopathic, sleepwalking narcissists. That’s right – I’m talking about iPhones. I find it hard to read the first few pages of The Communist Manifesto without thinking that I live in the world he and Engels described. “Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones.” We inhabit a world just like that, only more intensely than Marx and Engels dared imagine. For me, these words don’t just capture how Uber, Deliveroo and the other virtuosos of the gig economy chip away at values and standards to make a fast buck, but also how the planet is relentlessly despoiled in order to satisfy tax-avoiding shareholders. Consider, as the Marxist professor David Harvey did recently, São Paulo: a city whose economic base is a car industry that produces vehicles that spend hours in traffic jams, polluting streets and isolating individuals from each other – a potent emblem of how free-market economies are inimical to the real needs of real people. Marx didn’t foresee Facebook, but he grasped the essentials of Mark Zuckerberg’s business model, certainly better than American senators did at last month’s congressional hearings. “The bourgeoisie,” Marx and Engels wrote, beautifully, “has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self- interest, than callous ‘cash payment’. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation.” Facebook, not to mention Amazon and Google, have made humans into exploitable assets. Which is some kind of genius. But it’s what Marx wrote in Das Kapital in 1867 on commodity fetishism that, I think, is most painfully relevant to us today. By that term he meant how the ordinary things that workers produce – iPads, cars, even the spate of new books commemorating Marx’s 200th birthday – become, under capitalism, bewitchingly strange. Just as in some religions an object invested with supernatural powers becomes a fetish for those who worship it, so commodities under capitalism are accorded magical powers. When an iPhone is sold, it is exchanged for another commodity (generally money). The exchange takes no account of the labour that went into the iPhone’s making, still less the fact that some of Apple’s underpaid workers have contemplated suicide in order to escape their lives manufacturing purportedly must-have gizmos for you and me. “A commodity, therefore, is a mysterious thing simply because in it the social character of men’s labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour,” wrote Marx. György Lukács, who profoundly influenced the Frankfurt School of thinkers, argued that a new kind of human arises in a world where commodity fetishism is rampant. Those new humans are so degraded that buying and selling is their essence: I shop therefore I am. Instead of uniting to end capitalism, we buy more shoes. When JD Sports announced a 24% rise in profits last month, for me it felt less like good news for the ailing British high street than footwear fetishism propping up the degrading system that Lukács described. We’ve been took, as Malcolm X put it, in another context. We’ve been had. In such a world it’s easy to collapse, as many of the Frankfurt School did, into the philosophical quietism that drove Marx nuts. “The philosophers,” he wrote in words also emblazoned on his tombstone, “have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.” That remains the challenge. We need Marx to help us understand the state we’re in, though that is only a prelude to the bigger struggle, for which his writings are less helpful: namely, how to get out of it. • Stuart Jeffries is a feature writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/04/victoria-pendleton-abandons-everest-climb-on-health-grounds","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T14:03:02Z","webTitle":"Victoria Pendleton abandons Everest climb on health grounds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/04/victoria-pendleton-abandons-everest-climb-on-health-grounds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/04/victoria-pendleton-abandons-everest-climb-on-health-grounds","fields":{"headline":"Victoria Pendleton abandons Everest climb on health grounds","bodyText":"The Olympic gold medallist Victoria Pendleton has abandoned an attempt to climb Mount Everest after suffering from the effects of oxygen deprivation. The cyclist-turned-jockey had set out for the summit with the TV presenter Ben Fogle and had reached the mountain’s second camp, 21,000ft (6,400 metres) above sea level, after spending weeks preparing for the final climb. But Pendleton, 37, started suffering the effects of hypoxia and was advised by her doctor to end her climb. Fogle is understood to be continuing the expedition. “Unfortunately after much deliberation I have decided not to continue my endeavour to summit Mount Everest,” the Olympian wrote on Instagram. “The weather conditions have offered the possibility of an early summit bid, as a consequence I have been unable to adhere to the prescribed rotation program and keep pace with the team without causing concern regarding my health at the higher camps, due to my lack of adaptation to the extreme altitude.” Pendleton said she was “incredibly disappointed” not to complete the challenge, “as I feel in great physical condition and was moving swiftly and efficiently through the icefall and across the glacier”. She added: “Whilst we were working and moving I was really positive and comfortable. Unfortunately when we were recovering in camp in the afternoon, relaxing with a resting heart rate with a less active breathing pattern, I started to feel quite unwell and felt my body was going into shut down and the oxygen saturation of my blood was very low. So much so that I required a light flow of oxygen that continued throughout the night. “My condition caused much concern to [mountaineer Kenton Cool] and distressed the team. Kenton felt it was perhaps more sensible for me not to continue, for the sake of my health and wellbeing. I took his advice and called an end to my summit bid.” Mountaineers are advised to carry oxygen bottles on high-altitude climbs to prevent hypoxia, which can be fatal. Pendleton is one of Britain’s most successful female Olympians, having won a silver medal and two golds. She retired from cycling in 2012 and is now is now an amateur jockey. She told reporters in December she was taking part in the challenge because she was “probably having a midlife crisis”. She and Fogle, accompanied by Kenton Cool, reached base camp on 21 April after training in Nepal, the Andes and the Alps. Before the trip, Pendleton said her husband, Scott Gardner, the former Team GB sports scientist, would have preferred her not to climb the summit. “In an ideal world, he would like to be able to stop me, but he knows that won’t make me happy,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/may/06/rocking-all-over-the-world-the-painted-pebble-trend-crossing-continents","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T11:00:19Z","webTitle":"Rocking all over the world: the painted pebble trend crossing continents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/may/06/rocking-all-over-the-world-the-painted-pebble-trend-crossing-continents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/may/06/rocking-all-over-the-world-the-painted-pebble-trend-crossing-continents","fields":{"headline":"Rocking all over the world: the painted pebble trend crossing continents","bodyText":"If you go down to the beach today, you may get a surprise: a smooth pebble painted with a colourful picture (cartoon characters and animals are common) or uplifting message. Pebble painting, or “rocking”, is a craze that seems to have begun in the US with Megan Murphy’s The Kindness Rocks Project. She came up with the idea after collecting heart-shaped stones and pieces of sea-smoothed glass from the beach, seeing them as “rare treasures or signs and messages” from her deceased parents. “Finding them made me happy and I wanted to provide others with a similar experience.” Now, a thriving international community of amateur artists decorates rocks before hiding them in public places. The UK-based Facebook group Love on the Rocks has amassed more than 64,000 members since Vicki Poledoles Stansfield, from Essex, started it a year ago. “I suffer with anxiety and I was looking for a quiet hobby with no skills, that was free, and that I could do at 2am when my mind is racing,” she says. Jacky Burns, who lives in Morecambe, is another enthusiast. She has some tips for first-timers: “Decorate a pebble using acrylic paint or permanent pens, then seal it against the weather (using clear nail polish or varnish) and write the name [of a dedicated Facebook group] on the back. Hide it in a safe place and wait for someone to find it and post on your group, then watch its journey.” Some rocks have crossed continents, like the one found by Ian Hines in a south London park, which he later left in Morocco. Others spread a message. Nikki Lunn, from Stockport, has planned a tribute for the victims of the Manchester Arena attack. With council permission, she is encouraging people to leave rocks painted with the symbolic worker bee and the hashtag #lovemcr in certain city spots on 22 May.

His mechanic father is struggling to make enough money to support the family, which also includes Granite’s mother, who uses a wheelchair, and little sister Maisie. Dad’s solution is to move hundreds of miles to the town of Carousel, where things start going wrong as soon as they arrive. Granite is worried about being the new kid at school, and hopes to make that easier with a slight name change, from the hard-edged moniker given to him by his father to balance the family surname to “Gran”. But nobody is interested in his name, or anything about him, and before long he discovers that something strange is going on under the surface of Carousel – literally so. A dangerous, wind-like magical power called The Hollows is carving out tunnels beneath the town. This creates massive sinkholes into which houses fall, as well as most of the school. The town’s – possibly the world’s – only hope is a force of guardians, the “Lifters” of the title. They use magical handles, known as lifts, to enter the tunnels and prop up the ground, but they’re fighting a losing battle. Granite decides he wants to be part of the struggle, although it means having to persuade his spiky classmate – and secret Lifter – Catalina Catalan that he’s up to it. He wins her over through his courage, but it also turns out that a past connection between his ancestors and the town could provide a real solution. Cue plenty of tension in a desperate race against time. There is nothing new under the fantasy sun, of course, and The Lifters is a familiar kind of tale for eight to 12-year-olds, one where a family’s unhappiness is reflected in a dark power that threatens to destroy everything. Yet there is a distinctly original feel to the way it’s told that sets it above many other examples of the genre. The characters are strong, well-rounded and engaging, and there is plenty of pace in the telling. And Dave Eggers can’t write a boring sentence. My favourite? A teacher speaks carefully, “each word clicking into place as if she were making a puzzle out of glass”. Now that’s memorable – and so is the whole book.

In an agreed statement, the parties announced they had “resolved their differences” with a settlement that ends the legal action launched by the offshore law firm Appleby. The company started breach of confidence proceedings against the Guardian and the BBC last December. This followed the publication of the Paradise Papers – an investigation based on more than 13m documents that provoked worldwide anger and debate about offshore tax arrangements. The investigation was undertaken by 96 media groups in 67 countries and relied on material provided by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. It said it had been leaked the documents, which it shared with partners through the US-based, Pulitzer-prize-winning International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. In legal correspondence, Appleby demanded from the Guardian and the BBC the disclosure of any of the 6m Appleby documents that informed their reporting. The company also sought damages for the disclosure of what it said were confidential legal documents obtained in a digital hack. The Guardian said last year it would defend the claim because to not do so could have profound consequences that would deter British media organisations from undertaking serious, investigative journalism in the public interest. An agreement between the parties was reached after it became clear the vast majority of the documents were no longer owned by Appleby and were not legally privileged. A joint statement said: “Without compromising their journalistic integrity or ability to continue to do public interest journalism, the Guardian and the BBC have assisted Appleby by explaining which of the company’s documents may have been used to underpin their journalism. This will allow Appleby to initiate meaningful discussions with its clients, colleagues and regulators.” A spokesman for the Guardian said: “The Guardian’s reporting from the Paradise Papers is investigative journalism that has raised important issues in the public interest.” The BBC said: “We welcome this settlement which preserves our ability to carry out investigative journalism in the public interest.” Michael O’Connell, the group managing partner of Appleby, said it had started the legal action to understand which of its confidential and privileged documents had been taken. “From the outset we wanted to be able to explain to our clients and colleagues what information of theirs had been stolen. That was our duty. As a result of this legal action we are well on our way to achieving our objectives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/04/the-fiver-cardiff-fulham-championship","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T14:55:24Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Divine intervention and the Championship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/04/the-fiver-cardiff-fulham-championship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/04/the-fiver-cardiff-fulham-championship","fields":{"headline":"Divine intervention and the Championship","bodyText":"WHERE IT’S AT Early May, sunshine dappling the blossom on the apple trees, optimism swirling in the air (though it might just be pollen) and the football season drawing to its conclusion. These are heady days, and for the Championship the final one dawns on Sunday with uncertainty at both top and bottom leading to a crescendo of actual excitement. There will even be people celebrating in Sunderland, though inevitably only in the away end. For it is there that Wolves, having beaten 22 of the 23 other Championship sides this season, get the chance to complete the set. Not for them premature celebrations and disappointing drift – they want to win. Quite badly. “The manager,” their captain, Danny Batth, warns, “is massive on it.” But who will go up with them? Will it be Cardiff, who have a one-point buffer and host troubled Reading or … forget it, it’ll be Cardiff. The Bluebirds might have lost three of their last six but will be hyper-motivated by memories of an incident-packed 2-2 draw between the teams in December when manager Neil Warnock – and you’re never going to believe this – was sent to the stands. “When you die and pass away, it’s nice to have something people will remember you by,” said Warnock. “This will be my biggest achievement by an absolute mile. It’d be a miracle if it did happen.” Talking of divine intervention, Fulham need help. Still, they could go up if they emerge from Birmingham with more points than Cardiff wrestle from Reading. “We are ready. The club is built for the Premier League,” roared Tom Cairney. Well, the club will be built for the Premier League once their stadium redevelopment is completed sometime in 2021. Anyway, when Cardiff win, the Cottagers will join Aston Villa and Middlesbrough in the play-offs, with the quartet to be completed by Derby if they get a point at home to relegation-threatened Barnsley, though Preston and Millwall are both dreaming of yet more miracles. Where there’s life there’s hope, which is what Nigel Clough travels in as he takes Burton, in the bottom three on goal difference, to Preston. Still, he’s completely aware of the result his side requires. “A point might be enough,” he mused, adding: “It might not.” A win could take them as high as 19th, with the axe hanging dolefully above Reading, Burnley and Barnsley, already smeared with the gory remains of Sunderland and swinging towards Bolton at almost irresistible speed. The Trotters are not without hope, though they would need three times as many points from their final game, at home to Nottingham Forest, as they’ve got in their last seven combined, and even then might not make it. “We will be trying everything,” tooted captain Darren Pratley. “Then it’s up to the big man upstairs.” LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Barry Glendenning from 8pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Brighton 1-2 Manchester United.

My mind raced back to my childhood (for sake of argument – 40 years) when my dear mum and a few neighbours used to earn a few bob by hand-painting the tiny men. The excitement each week as we waited to find out which team was palpable. Unlike me, she wasn’t a big fan of the late-70s West Ham chevrons given the detail required, but getting one of the big teams seemed like some sort of neighbourhood status symbol. The sense of deflation most weeks to see a bag of 1,000 n@ked Subbuteo men, together with instructions for a generic Nottingham Forest / Bristol City red shirt and white short ensemble was generally assuaged by trying to encourage our cats to walk on the players after they were laid out to dry.

Their new title alludes the rules of respect and care for the environment promoted by ecological campaigners: to minimise human impact on nature. Weirdly, this film initially reminded me of a fatuous and naive (and bafflingly overpraised) film called Captain Fantastic, which features Viggo Mortensen as a charismatic, disciplinarian dad who has taken his children to live with him in the wilderness. Leave No Trace is everything that that movie should have been: careful, realistic, with a sense of what is possible and what is at stake for those people who really do attempt to turn their backs on conventional living and also reject the stigma of homelessness — but what is also at stake for their children who have had no choice in the matter. Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie play Will and Tom, a grizzled army veteran and his 13-year-old daughter. The question of Tom’s mother is not addressed. Will and Tom are living a kind of radical Thoreau-guerrilla existence in a huge public park in Portland, Oregon. They have built a secret camp with tarps and rudimentary cooking implements, making their own fires. They share a tent. They read books. They have military-style drills for staying undercover. Periodically, they amble out of the park and into the city, where Will can pick up his prescription for opioid painkillers at the vets hospital, which he can discreetly sell for cash on the black market to buy food — and then they return to the jungle. It seems like a perfect, even Edenic setup. But then Tom carelessly allows herself to be spotted by a hiker and things take a wrong turn. The personae of Will and Tom are strikingly restrained, both in their conception and performance: there is an attractive humility and restraint at work, a quietism. No scenery-chewing, no fireworks, no obvious scary-Colonel-Kurtz stuff from Will or obvious teen rebellion histrionics from Tom. Neither appears concerned with what the future holds for them, nor when Tom should really be getting a tent of her own – let alone meet other people her own age. When they are picked up by the authorities, they are subject to very similar psychiatric assessments, in which they have to respond true or false to questions about whether they have dark thoughts, etc. In some ways, these tests are callous, soulless – precisely the kind of bureaucratic intrusion that Will has passionately rejected on his own behalf and that of his daughter. And yet it is clear that this is the first time either of them have considered these questions – the first time they have really thought about themselves. Perhaps not having to think about yourself, not having to shoulder the burden of relentless neurotic self-examination, is part of what their way of life is about. Interestingly, getting picked up and then escaping is also part of their way of life. They have clearly planned for what happens. They have to accept – or pretend to accept – the social services’ remedial plans for them before they can slip away once more. There is a great sequence in which they attend a church service, blandly complaisant, not making a fuss, not standing out, biding their time. Or rather it is Will who is biding his time; Tom isn’t so sure. Each time away from the wild brings Tom into contact with a society that she rather likes. Poignantly, she loves the rabbit that a neighbouring farmer’s kid has, and there is a lovely scene where she attends a rabbit-training school. Later, she has the same connection with honeybees. A split is coming. But Granik manages this crisis with cool, unhammy clarity. The intimacy and love between Will and Tom is presented with real delicacy. It’s a movie that will live with me for a long time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/may/04/talking-horses-farewell-to-jockey-who-rode-aintree-without-stirrups","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T10:51:24Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Farewell to jockey who rode Aintree without stirrups","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/may/04/talking-horses-farewell-to-jockey-who-rode-aintree-without-stirrups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/may/04/talking-horses-farewell-to-jockey-who-rode-aintree-without-stirrups","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Farewell to jockey who rode Aintree without stirrups","bodyText":"Friday’s best bets, by Chris Cook I’m sad to report the loss of Stan Murphy, a jump jockey of the 60s and 70s, who died on Wednesday in a Waterford hospital after surgery for cancer. His major wins included the Mackeson on 1973 on Skymas and the Thyestes five years earlier aboard Great Lark. I spoke to Stan last year, to ask for his memories of riding in Foinavon’s Grand National half a century earlier. Talking to old-time jockeys about famous races is just about the most purely enjoyable gig you can get in my line of work and men like Stan are the reason why. There was only wry humour and enthusiasm in his voice as he explained why he felt he would have won that race, if only the loose Popham Down hadn’t brought the field to a standstill at the one after Becher’s. It would have been easy and entirely understandable to be bitter about the missed opportunity or the 1973 car crash in which he, a passenger, suffered career-ending injuries. “I was never going better than I was then,” Stan told me of his ride on Leedsy. “I would have won.” And the amazing context for that assertion is that he had been riding without stirrups for about a mile by then, one of his leathers having snapped at the water jump. Footage of the race clearly shows Stan, in hooped colours just behind the leaders, sitting easily in the saddle, his legs draped around the horse as Leedsy vaults over second Becher’s. There’s no sign of panic or tension or desperately clinging on. He’s just a jockey in unison with his mount as they soar over a fearsome obstacle despite the broken tack. What a horseman. Turning to today’s action, there’s 8-1 about Lydiate Lady (2.40), trying to sustain her excellent run at Musselburgh. Having joined Eric Alston for last season, she has won five of her last seven, including her reappearance run at Ripon a fortnight ago. The ground today will be a good bit faster than it was then but she has seemed versatile as to going and I fancy her to give her running again. Mosalim (3.40) is the nap, two races later, at about 7-4. Gelded over the winter, this lightly raced sort from the in-form William Haggas yard looks on a fair mark, in light of his novice success at Chelmsford last month. There should be plenty more to come from this half-brother to Aguerooo. “Can they do it on a wet Friday at Chepstow?” is a fair question to ask about fancy-bred Flat racers and today King Lud is the one who must answer. He was a fair fourth in the Wood Ditton last month but his yard has since gone a bit quiet and the fifth horse has been beaten at odds-on. In today’s novice race, King Lud comes up against the rather more experienced Coeur Blimey (2.30) from Sue Gardner’s yard, a horse who beat Ballyandy in a Listed bumper at Ascot all of three years ago. A decent hurdler since then, he could not cope with a Listed Flat race last month but this is a more straightforward opportunity and, at 15-8, I’ll take him to beat up the youngsters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/may/05/what-killed-historys-most-famous-people-medical-sleuths-gather-to-investigate","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"What killed history's most famous people?

Medical sleuths gather to investigate","bodyText":"Whether it is a mysterious fever or sudden incapacitation – even today, diagnosing quite what has carried someone off can leave doctors scratching their heads. But every year a group of academics gather to embrace an even tougher challenge: casting a verdict on how and why some of the most famous names in history died. From Florence Nightingale to Charles Darwin, and from Lenin to Cromwell, academics have pored over the historical accounts to scrutinise treatments and in some cases offer up a cause of death. Now experts have turned the spotlight on the 12th century sultan and nemesis of the crusaders, Saladin, to reveal the cause of the kurdish military hero’s demise at the age of 56 in 1193 AD. “It’s difficult to work it out because there is essentially no information – there are no tests and the historical accounts are a little questionable, and there isn’t much anyhow,” said Dr Stephen Gluckman, professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, noting there are only a few fairly reliable details – including the two week duration of Saladin’s illness. The case is the latest to be raised at the annual meeting of the Historical Clinicopathological Conference in the US. “Nobody else does anything like it, as far as I know. It’s unique,” said conference director Dr Philip Mackowiak of the University of Maryland, adding that the conference brings together academics from across medicine and the arts. The goal, he says, is to teach the history of medicine and educate trainees on principles of diagnosis. “And number three is entertainment,” he said. While historical accounts describe how Saladin’s final illness involved sweating, attacks of “bilious fevers” and headaches, quite what the cause of the sickness was has long been a matter of debate, with suggestions including tuberculosis meningitis. Now Gluckman, who was asked to examine the case, says he’s weighed the evidence, and the concluded the culprit was the bacterial infection, typhoid. “It is really based on what the common diseases were at that time, and of those which were fatal, and of those, which were fatal in a time period of around two weeks,” said Gluckman, adding typhus is another possibility. But the diagnosis is not without doubt. Mackowiak admits that there is no evidence Saladin had abdominal pains – a common symptom of typhoid – but said the historical record is written by non-medical people, and often after the event. Dr Tom Asbridge, a medieval historian from Queen Mary University of London, who will give a lecture at the conference on Saladin’s successes at the battle of Hattin and re-capturing Jerusalem, said the sultan’s death might have scuppered plans for a pivotal campaign. “If you see it from the perspective of the muslim world, [Saladin’s] death is quite tragic because he fought long and hard and in a very committed manner through what we call the third crusade… and that’s the crusade that is led by none other than the new king of England, Richard the Lionheart,” he said. Among previous figures to have their deaths scrutinised at the conference is Florence Nightingale who spent decades in poor health before her death at the age of 90. While there have been rumours the mysterious malady was syphilis, others have categorically ruled it out. “There is absolutely no justification for that diagnosis, her symptoms were not in any way consistent with syphilis,” said Mackowiak. “Her severe disorder cleared up on its own after for 30 years wreaking havoc physically and psychologically – and as far as I can tell she never had a sexual relationship with anyone.” Mackowiak says it is likely Nightingale had four conditions: bipolar disorder, the bacterial infection brucellosis – then known as Crimean fever – as well as post traumatic stress disorder, and, later on, dementia. Abraham Lincoln’s death from a bullet fired by the actor John Wilkes Booth has also been examined. “The question was if Lincoln had been shot [in 2007], how would he have been treated by our current shock trauma units...and what would the likely outcome have been,” said Mackowiak, noting that the conclusion was that Lincoln would have survived and, possibly been well enough to continue as president. But ultimately, says Mackowiak, the conference is not about offering a conclusive diagnosis. “I couldn’t say that any of the cases that we have discussed, and this is the 25th, are closed, because we don’t have any definitive test results for obvious reasons,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/07/film-hailing-saudi-arabia-progress-womens-rights-dreadful-propaganda","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T09:00:45Z","webTitle":"Film hailing Saudi progress on women's rights branded 'dreadful propaganda'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/07/film-hailing-saudi-arabia-progress-womens-rights-dreadful-propaganda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/07/film-hailing-saudi-arabia-progress-womens-rights-dreadful-propaganda","fields":{"headline":"Film hailing Saudi progress on women's rights branded 'dreadful propaganda'","bodyText":"A film intended to celebrate progress on women’s rights in Saudi Arabia has been condemned by experts and rights groups as a “dreadful piece of propaganda” that will serve only to reinforce the existing culture of discrimination in the country. Launched by the Saudi-based organisation Alwaleed Philanthropies, one of the world’s largest private philanthropic foundations, the film aims to highlight reforms in the deeply conservative state, where women can now attend sports events and will soon be able to drive cars. It shows a woman being encouraged by a man to drive a car, as well as a woman in traditional Abaya being urged by a man to take a wingsuit flight – similar to skydiving – off a cliff. But the tone of the footage – which shows men urging women to follow their dreams and culminates with the tag line: “Next to every great woman, a man believing in her” – has been criticised as patronising and discriminatory. Dr Madawi al-Rasheed, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics’ Middle East Centre, questioned the commercial value of the film and branded it a “dreadful piece of propaganda” that showed only women dependent on men. “My first reaction was this is a terrible campaign for Toyoto jeeps – it would not appeal to Saudi women who want to drive through the street of Riadh to get to work,” said al-Rasheed. “It focuses on women protected by a man. “But there are a high percentage – millions – of women in Saudi Arabia who are unmarried, widows and those who choose not to marry.” Both men and women in Saudi Arabia are patronised and deprived of basic human rights, said al-Rasheed, “but women suffer double the discrimination. They are not legal citizens.” The campaign seemed to be promoting the idea of equality in Saudi Arabia to the outside world, she said. A UN rights watchdog that has welcomed recent decisions on driving and allowing women to launch their own businesses said last month that, if discrimination against women is to end, Saudi Arabia must abolish its pervasive system of male guardianship and give women access to justice. The UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women said the state should enforce a recent order that would entitle all women to obtain a passport, travel or study abroad, choose their residency, and access healthcare “without having to seek their guardian’s consent”. Suad Abu-Dayyeh, the Middle East and North African consultant for Equality Now, said: “This film is not accurate, it is not fair and it is not just. Of course, we should recognise the role of men in supporting women’s rights. But it should not be the core of the film. “We know in Saudi Arabia, women are very restricted according to their families, their culture, religious beliefs and according to the system. Their basic rights are denied. They can’t take a courageous stance towards the liberation of women. They can’t transcend that reality.” Alwaleed Philanthropies, which aims to help empower women, said the film was inspired by UN Women’s #HeForShe campaign. It is headed by the Saudi princess Lamia bint Majed al Saud, and its launch coincided with a wider debate in Saudi Arabia about whether the end of the driving ban signalled the start of more wholesale reforms. The princess told the Guardian she hoped the campaign, dedicated to men and women, would challenge stereotypes. “We want to celebrate the generations of Saudi women who have pioneered change, as well as the Saudi men who have supported them in their pursuit of empowerment – this campaign is first and foremost dedicated to those local heroes,” she said. “But we also want to reach an international audience in order to challenge some stereotypes of Saudi women as being oppressed and Saudi men as oppressors. We want to highlight the role that many Saudi men have played as supportive allies in this journey, and encourage more to do the same. Asked whether she believed the lifting of the driving ban was the prelude to greater equality, she said it was “a step in the right direction”. “Lasting change cannot be delivered overnight, but women are securing more and more opportunities to be independent and to be empowered within the kingdom. For many people within Saudi Arabia and across the world, the driving ban was symbolic of Saudi women’s lack of freedom. Lifting the ban will have huge practical implications for how Saudi women live and work, but it is also a clear sign from our leadership that as a society we are ready to move forward and modernise.” She said the inclusion of sky diving was to challenge stereotypes of a woman dressed in her Abaya and also to “emphasise the message that the sky is the limit for Saudi women, especially when everyone in society works together”. Last year, the foundation partnered with the Thomson Reuters Foundation to run a women’s conference in Riyadh, titled Saudi Woman Can, to promote women’s evolving roles, and to train female Saudi journalists. Other projects it has instigated inside the kingdom include encouraging women’s participation in local council elections as well as supporting Saudi women’s legal rights, via the Wa’iyah Initiative for Women’s Legal Rights. Abu-Dayyeh, who works with civil society groups all over the Middle East to promote women’s rights, said that while she welcomed progress made by the Saudi government, it was “very far away” from gender equality. Abu-Dayyeh said: “We have well-established civil society groups in Jordan and Lebanon. But there are no civil society organisations in Saudi Arabia. We have courageous female activists who are working separately, often to great cost. If we are talking about the battle for women’s rights in the region, we need to double that fight in Saudi Arabia.” Civil society does not exist in the kingdom. Sama Awaida, director of the women’s study centre in Palestine, said the film was sending out the wrong message. “I don’t understand how it can be about women’s empowerment,” said Awaida. “Women’s empowerment is a long struggle, but it is about empowering women to be independent of men, not dependent on men.” This article was amended on Friday 11 May to clarify the aims of Alwaleed Philanthropies and to give further background on the foundation’s projects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/04/labour-conservatives-local-election-results","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T09:36:44Z","webTitle":"The verdict?

Deflating for Labour, a bullet dodged by the Tories","bodyText":"The 2018 local elections should be seen as a deflating but necessary learning experience for the Labour party, and a bullet dodged by the Conservatives. Labour has some genuinely impressive sets of results – Trafford stands out, as does Southport (part of Sefton), where Labour carried off several seats in previously barren territory; Plymouth was more nip-and-tuck, but Labour is back in power. However, most of the targets were missed – the hard ones in London and some arithmetically easier ones outside – and there was embarrassing slippage in the Midlands in particular: the loss of Derby and Nuneaton and Bedworth will sting. The Conservatives can point to an achievement that is the mirror image of Labour’s salvage operation in the 2017 general election – retaining more than they can have expected to in places where their vote is trending downwards, such as wealthy inner London, while making headway in the places where they can expect to gain. The Conservatives failed to bring over all that much of the leave-voting, Ukip-curious section of Labour’s core vote in 2017, thanks to a campaign that reminded much of that core vote why it does not love the Tories, and Labour’s own astute manifesto and campaign in the general election. However, the local elections did produce some exceptionally strong Conservative performances in just these sorts of areas. Sunderland set the scene early on, with a seven-point swing to the Conservatives. It may be that the Conservatives in their post-Brexit garb will automatically benefit from any discussion of immigration, even if it is prompted by a scandal of their own making, but this cannot be the whole story. Before election day, it looked plausible for Labour to win control in North East Lincolnshire, the council that covers Grimsby and Cleethorpes. Ukip had done very well here in 2014, winning several normally safe Labour wards, but Labour fought back and won them by large margins in the May 2016 local elections and presumably in the general election in 2017. Some of the Ukip councillors had defected to the Conservatives and seemed unlikely to win – but they did. It is not just in Grimsby that the political map has been redrawn. In my home town of Southampton, where I have followed elections since the 1980s, the results were unprecedented. There was no net change, but out of 16 seats three went in each direction between Labour and the Conservatives. The Tories won white working-class estate seats, knocking out the Labour council leader in the process, while Labour picked off the suburbs near the university and Southampton’s inner middle-class residential area. The 2018 results almost inverted the colours of the city’s wards in an “even year” in the 1980s. Part of the explanation for the oddness of the local election results, and the contrast to what happened less than a year ago – from Wandsworth to Grimsby – must lie in the difference between the sort of people who turn out to vote in local and general elections. Local election turnout runs at about half the rate of a general election, and that voting pool exaggerates the usual skew that one finds in turnout – local voters are even older and less transient on average than general election voters. In an environment where age and cosmopolitanism seem to define political allegiances, the party that has the support of the young and footloose is at a disadvantage in low-turnout elections, as the Democrats have found in repeated mid-terms. This should not encourage Labour to think that all will be well in a general election – one has to do a lot of work to level up the turnout, and Labour failed even with its mass membership and a government that looked on the ropes. An ominous cloud on the horizon is the voter ID trial that was tested in several (not very challenging) local authorities this year, which will entirely predictably make this problem worse in future. The other problem for Labour in these elections was one that was frequently forgotten – that most recent polling has shown the Conservatives a bit ahead (perhaps five points) and Labour at best pulling level while doing worse on questions like leadership and economic management. Back in 2014 when most of these council seats were last fought, Labour was a point or two ahead. It is not surprising that the pendulum swung a little towards the Conservatives in 2018, and more dramatically in places where their support could be expected to increase. What was more surprising is Labour’s failure to benefit from much of an upward current in London. The task was hard, as Labour had done well in the capital in 2014, but the 22-point lead in the general election encouraged confidence that proved cruelly misplaced. Expectations were allowed to run too high in public. The results in Wandsworth, for instance, were good but not quite good enough. Around the outer edges of London things were worse for Labour, not just in Barnet with its particular sensitivity to the antisemitism controversy but also in Hillingdon, where the Conservatives made net gains. The one borough in which the Conservatives were massacred in a revenge of the metropolitan remain voter was Richmond, where the beneficiaries were the Liberal Democrats who won at least a seat in every Richmond ward but one. The landslide swept in four Greens, beneficiaries of an unusual “progressive alliance” electoral pact, but left Labour in the cold. The local government scene in England was never going to be transformed in these elections – there was not much swing territory being contested, and the movement in national opinion was too small to do much. Even if Labour had done as well as it might have in London, there was also little extra that was feasible to win there. But the psychological impact for Labour, 11 months on from June 2017, to have dreamed and been disappointed, could be destabilising. For the Conservatives, there must be a feeling that they have got away with it, and normal service is being resumed after the unexpected reverse in the general election. They would be unwise to take too much comfort from this, because these are volatile times. The results of the May 2016 local elections, the other side of the EU referendum, already look – literally – antediluvian, and those of May 2017 when the Conservatives polled so well were themselves overwritten a month later. With so many potentially realigning moments ahead in the next few months, the tectonic plates could easily shift again. • Lewis Baston is a writer on politics, elections, history and corruption, and director of research at the Electoral Reform Society"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/07/mondays-best-tv-genderquake-dispatches-britains-benefit-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T05:00:40Z","webTitle":"Monday’s best TV: Genderquake; Dispatches: Britain’s Benefit Crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/07/mondays-best-tv-genderquake-dispatches-britains-benefit-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/07/mondays-best-tv-genderquake-dispatches-britains-benefit-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Monday’s best TV: Genderquake; Dispatches: Britain’s Benefit Crisis","bodyText":"Genderquake 9pm, Channel 4 What happens when you put a varied group of non-binary millennials together in a house in the countryside?

Jonathan Church’s stylish revival reminds us Wilde explores serious issues under the epigrammatic surface. One key idea, as George Bernard Shaw understood in his 1895 review, is Wilde’s assertion of a robust individuality against a mechanical idealism. Sir Robert Chiltern, a rising politician, is haunted by the fact that, as a young man, he sold state secrets for private profit. While Wilde doesn’t exonerate his hero, who is later blackmailed by the unscrupulous Mrs Cheveley, he allows Chiltern to defend his actions by saying: “Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons” – which in this case was the worship of wealth. Corruption, Wilde implies, is inescapable in a money-mad society. But the play goes on to suggest, in an intimation of Wilde’s own impending humiliation, that past sins should be viewed with charitable compassion rather than inflexible morality. The problem any production faces is how to reconcile the play’s mix of melodrama and comedy. Church’s solution, like that of Peter Hall in his famous 1990 revival, is to play both up to the hilt. Even though it is a touch hard to believe that this Mrs Cheveley was a school contemporary of Chiltern’s wife, Frances Barber invests her with just the right mix of scarlet-gowned hostility and awareness of her own absurdity: she is both flamboyant and giggly at the same time. Nathaniel Parker plays Chiltern as a man aggressively unapologetic for his youthful ambition but faintly comic in his later adoption of a high moral tone. Even when the play verges on the preposterous, as in the farcical shenanigans of the third act, the production openly acknowledges Wilde’s recklessness. But one of the show’s chief delights is the chance to see Edward and Freddie Fox, as the Earl of Caversham and Viscount Goring, exploiting their real-life father-son relationship. Fox senior has now become such a perfect embodiment of crusty antiquity that every line he speaks is greeted as a Wildean pearl. Meanwhile Fox junior plays Goring not just as a joke machine but as a narcissistic dandy with unexpected moral fibre. He even managed to overcome a hilarious first-night mishap in which his attempt to burn an incriminating letter literally misfired. There is strength in depth to the casting, with Susan Hampshire brilliantly turning the gossipy Lady Markby into an unquenchable social gusher and Tim Wallers making Goring’s valet a figure of lugubrious gravity. Faith Omole is suitably sparky as Chiltern’s sister and it is no fault of Sally Bretton that she can’t make much of his naively hero-worshipping wife. I’m not sure I would endorse Church’s claim that this is Wilde’s best play, but it comes across in this revival as the intriguing love-child of a match between Ibsen and Feydeau."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/09/solar-powered-shirts-drunken-droids-smarthome-future-starts-here","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"From solar-powered shirts to drunken droids: what the smarthome will look like","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/09/solar-powered-shirts-drunken-droids-smarthome-future-starts-here","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/09/solar-powered-shirts-drunken-droids-smarthome-future-starts-here","fields":{"headline":"Drunken droids and solar-powered shirts: what the smarthome will look like","bodyText":"If the invention of the ship was also the invention of the shipwreck, as the French philosopher Paul Virilio suggested, then what does that make the invention of the Nest learning thermostat? As our homes fill up with more connected devices, funnelling every aspect of our lives into the great cloud of big data, the answer could be something much more alarming than just a few more faulty appliances cluttering up our cupboards. This is one of the unsettling questions at the heart of The Future Starts Here, an exhibition about to open at the V&amp;A in London. It promises to be less of a showcase of Tomorrow’s World-type gadgetry than a thought-provoking probe into where exactly this new generation of smart technology is taking us. “People seem scared of the future at the moment,” says Rory Hyde who, with co-curator Mariana Pestana, has spent the last two years trawling university laboratories and touring Silicon Valley to gather 100 hot-out-of-the-factory innovations, from a low-cost satellite to a solar-powered shirt that can charge a smartphone. “There’s a sense,” he adds, “that all this new technology is arriving so fast that we don’t really understand its implications – or have much of a say in where it’s going. We’re hoping the exhibition will give people the tools to make sense of what’s happening and help them bring about the kind of future they want.” Designed by the provocative Spanish architect Andrés Jaque’s Office for Political Innovation, the exhibition covers four areas – Home, Public, Planetary, Afterlife – and asks things like “We are all connected, but do we feel lonely?” and “If Mars is the answer, what is the question?” The section on the future of the home sets a sinister tone with: “Could your toaster turn against you?” Those expecting to find a killer Dualit on the loose will be disappointed, but there are plenty of things that you might think twice about welcoming into your house, if not for their malevolence then for their apparent uselessness. Alongside Jibo – the first “social robot” for the home, which purports to be “authentically charming” by lolling about like a drunken iMac – we meet Brett, the Berkeley Robot for the Elimination of Tedious Tasks, an ongoing artificial intelligence research project at the University of California. Programmed to learn through trial and error, it shows just how difficult it is to teach a robot to complete a simple chore that we can do without thinking. This clumsy steel toddler may be at the cutting edge of AI and robotics, but here it struggles to even do the laundry. Domination by our robot overlords seems a safe way off. Most of the domestic items on show, from the driverless lawnmower by Bosch (the company that develops much of the technology for self-driving cars, testing it out on mowers first) to voice-controlled smart assistants, are seemingly geared towards the same end: saving us time. There’s no need to go to the trouble of getting out your smartphone to order an Uber when you can simply shout at Alexa. She can turn up the heating and switch on the hi-fi while she’s at it. But these labour-saving devices have increasingly been revealed to be serving a different purpose: the collection of masses of monetisable data. Simply by going about our business in our voluntarily surveilled homes, we are unwittingly carrying out huge amounts of valuable market research for the tech companies and online retailers waiting to sell us more stuff. If there is one device that represents our Faustian pact with the connected home, it’s the Amazon Dash button. In a kind of April Fool’s Day parody of the internet of things, these are wifi-enabled buttons that you stick on your wall next to a branded product, allowing you to restock with the push of a button. There’s a Listerine button for when you run out of mouthwash and an Ariel button for when you’re low on detergent. You can decorate your whole house with these branded buttons that cover everything from Whiskas cat food to Durex condoms. The inconvenience of having to be at home to receive the deliveries, as well as the vast quantities that are delivered, make the whole thing absurd. Adam Greenfield, the army psychologist turned tech analyst, goes further in his prescient book, Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life. “They get data on the time and place of your need,” he writes, “as well as the frequency and intensity, and that data has value. It is, explicitly, an asset, and you can be sure they will exploit that asset in every way their terms and conditions permit them to – including by using it to develop behavioural models that map the terrain of our desires, so as to exploit them with offer greater efficiency in future.” The endgame, Amazon has admitted, is that you won’t even need to press a button: they will ultimately know what you want and when. For the lazy among us, this might sound like a boon. Amazon will know when I’m hungry and drone-deliver a Chinese takeaway straight to my mouth. But, beyond concerns over what’s happening to our data – amplified by the recent Cambridge Analytica revelations – many of these smart-home technologies have proved vulnerable to hacking. As Greenfield points out, there are hundreds of thousands of unsecured webcams around the world, readily accessible to anyone online, while last year there were even claims that intelligence services had found a way to hack Samsung TVs, turning them into domestic snooping devices. There have also been claims that touch-screen light switches can be easily hacked, playing havoc with entire floors of hotels. With this in mind, does anyone really think remotely operated smart front-door locks are such a good idea? The rise of the home as the major new tech battleground was in evidence at this year’s Milan furniture fair. Traditionally the place where high-end design houses launch their latest expensive sofas, this year’s gathering was graced by Google for the first time, with an installation designed to give a touchy-feely fabric-upholstered face to the omniscient tech giant. With images depicting a wholesome young family caressing the latest Google Home product range while draped on beanbags, it was an attempt to show that having a smart home needn’t mean filling your house with grey plastic boxes. “We were very conscious of trying to soften everything we did,” says Ivy Ross, head of design at Google’s hardware division, speaking from the car on her Silicon Valley commute. “Our watchwords were ‘human, optimistic and bold’. We wanted to make everything less shiny and sharp-edged, using rounded corners and muted pastel fabrics.” Available with soft-knit covers in shades of “chalk, fog, coral or charcoal”, the products, from voice-activated assistants to surveillance cameras and VR headsets, look like what might result if Habitat turned to tech. So is the cosy feel meant to distract from the fact that these devices are listening to everything you say in order to better hone Google’s targeted advertising? “I can’t talk about that,” says Ross. “It’s more about how to make the technology blend into your home. Our ultimate goal is to make it disappear.” The Future Starts Here is at the V&amp;A, London, 12 May to 4 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/04/ravyn-lenae-review-heaven-london-neo-soul","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T12:25:00Z","webTitle":"Ravyn Lenae review – neo-soul star still finding her way to the top","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/04/ravyn-lenae-review-heaven-london-neo-soul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/04/ravyn-lenae-review-heaven-london-neo-soul","fields":{"headline":"Ravyn Lenae review – neo-soul star still finding her way to the top","bodyText":"Fashionably punctual, Ravyn Lenae floats on stage at 9pm on the dot. It’s the Chicago neo-soul singer’s first European show, but the set-up is surprisingly advanced. Her name glistens on screen in a retro font as her four-piece band start up, and she appears, as glammed to the nines as her young, smitten crowd. A cool and almost mystical teenage talent, Lenae has released three EPs in the last two years with Atlantic Records, and worked with Smino, Noname and Mick Jenkins from her home-town scene. But it’s her latest project, Crush, in collaboration with Steve Lacy of funk troupe the Internet, that’s solidified her ascension. Lenae plays it in full here. With her nostalgic diva aesthetic, she’s reminiscent of a marginally more subdued Chaka Khan. At times she stretches her voice a little too far, and her vibrato grates slightly as she verges on musical theatre, no doubt a result of her classical training. She expands on it in her encore with a fluttering classical aria, much to the audience’s bemusement. However, when crowd favourites emerge in 4 Leaf Clover, Sticky, Spice and the Chicago house gem Free Room, the room is energised, suggesting that the misfires are down to the weakness of some of her filler tracks and not her performance – something that is likely to correct itself as her catalogue develops. Choosing the medium-sized Heaven was perhaps a little premature. Although her effort to establish herself is noble, the scale of the show prevented her from tapping into the vulnerability that is so present in her work. An incredibly talented star-to-be, but one very much still in the making."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/04/hiromasa-yonebayashi-interview-studio-ghibli-mary-and-the-witchs-flower","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T12:43:56Z","webTitle":"'A full English every morning': how UK food and weather inspires Japanese anime directors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/04/hiromasa-yonebayashi-interview-studio-ghibli-mary-and-the-witchs-flower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/04/hiromasa-yonebayashi-interview-studio-ghibli-mary-and-the-witchs-flower","fields":{"headline":"'A full English every morning': how UK food and weather inspires Japanese anime directors","bodyText":"‘Clouds in Britain were very different from Japanese clouds,” says director Hiromasa Yonebayashi. “They seemed very close and they went on forever. They really stirred the imagination. I felt like those clouds had been an inspiration for British writers to create lots of fantasy works. It looked as if some hidden castle were about to emerge from them.” It’s rare the tourist who comes to Britain and enthuses about our overcast skies, but Yonebayashi and his team were on a mission. They were researching for their new animated feature Mary and the Witch’s Flower, based on the 1971 children’s book The Little Broomstick by Mary Stewart. The story is set in rural Shropshire, where a country girl’s discovery of a magical flower whisks her into a world of witchcraft and adventure. Yonebayashi opted to retain the original setting, so despite being Japanese in name and manufacture, the film feels quintessentially and unmistakably British, from the chintzy furnishings to the toaster in the kitchen to the herbaceous borders in the garden. Fantasy is most effective when it is grounded in a solid reality, Yonebayashi suggests: “For example, we do not have a culture of witches in Japan, so when we wanted to portray the concept of witches, we really valued [Stewart’s] original ideas. Also, in the original book, nature is very beautifully and carefully portrayed: forests, gardens, flowers and plants, so we really needed to visit England to see the actual setting.” Yonebayashi is best known for his films When Marnie Was There and Arrietty, both made with Studio Ghibli, Japan’s pre-eminent animation house. The announced retirement of Ghibli’s founder and resident genius auteur, Hayao Miyazaki (who subsequently changed his mind), resulted in Yonebayashi in setting up his own Studio Ponoc after Ghibli disbanded its production division in 2014. The continuity is evident in the vibrant, hand-drawn animation and themes of prepubescent female self-identification, but also in the source material: all three of Yonebayashi’s movies have been based on books by British authors. When Marnie Was There was an adaptation of a 1967 novel by Joan G Robinson, while Arrietty was of Mary Norton’s classic The Borrowers. Those were transposed to Japanese settings, largely for the benefit of domestic audiences. Given the choice, Yonebayashi opted to set his latest in England. It was his first visit. “We were familiar with English scenery through such works as Peter Rabbit and Thomas the Tank Engine,” says Yonebayashi. “What was different from what we imagined was the colours of trees and leaves and flowers. So many different tones and shades!” From their bed and breakfast in Leintwardine, the directo, his producer and art director toured the Shropshire area viewing local manor houses, consulting the UK’s National Gardens Scheme’s Yellow Book for gardens to visit, asking locals what to see. Yonebayashi is full of enthusiasm, for the landscape, the hospitality he received, the soft fruits, even the cuisine. “We had an English breakfast every morning and it was fantastic. However, at times we felt that we wanted to eat something else.” Not even the constant rain fazed him. It reminded him of his home town in Ishikawa prefecture, roughly halfway along Japan’s northern coast. “There is a proverb in my region: even if you forget your packed lunch, don’t forget your umbrella.” Looking back, Studio Ghibli has always had a bit of a love-in with Europe in general, and Britain in particular. As a student, Miyazaki became interested in children’s literature, including the works of Rosemary Sutcliff and Philippa Pearce. Last year, he published a list of his 50 favourite children’s books – 20 of them were British. He made trips to Italy and Sweden in the 1970s when he was attempting (unsuccessfully) to adapt Heidi and Pippi Longstocking, and many of his early features have quasi-European settings, from his debut, Castle of Cagliostro (set in a fictional European state) to 1920s aviator tale Porco Rosso (set in the Adriatic) to Kiki’s Delivery Service, another tale of a girl witch, whose location was primarily modelled on Stockholm. Most intriguing of all is Miyazaki’s 1986 fantasy adventure Castle in the Sky, a tale of airborne pirates, technological terrors and a mythical floating city which does, indeed, emerge from the clouds (it is named Laputa, after the flying island in Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels). The story’s boy hero lives in what looks like a 19th-century mining community. It is based on Wales, which Miyazaki first visited in 1984, just after the miners’ strike. The country seems to have struck a chord. “I really admired the way the miners’ unions fought to the very end for their jobs and communities, and I wanted to reflect the strength of those communities in my film,” he told an interviewer in 1999. “I saw so many places with abandoned machinery, abandoned mines – the fabric of the industry was there, but no people. It made a strong impression on me.” He also related to the Welsh and other Celtic people’s struggle for nationhood and cultural identity, in the face of outside invasion since Roman times. Two decades later, he adapted a novel by Welsh author Diana Wynne Jones, Howl’s Moving Castle. As with Hollywood, Japan’s anime and manga industries are so huge and prolific, they are constantly hungry for source material, so it is almost inevitable some are set in Britain. The Victorian, steampunk-friendly era is a particular favourite. Katsuhiro Otomo followed up his legendary Akira with 2004’s Steamboy, set in Victorian Manchester and London and taking in the Great Exhibition of 1851. Black Butler, AKA Kuroshitsuji, is a supernatural spy tale that crosses paths with Queen Victoria and Jack the Ripper. Emma follows a servant girl in class-conscious 1850s London. Read or Die centres on an agent for the “special operations division of the British Library”. Here in the UK, we may question why Japanese animators are more engaged with our rich literary heritage than the domestic film industry seems to be. There is often uproar when Hollywood co-opts Japanese stories and culture, such as the recent remake of Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell, or Netflix’s US-set adaptation of hit manga Death Note. Isn’t this the same thing? Should we be affronted? Not if it’s done in the right way, says producer Yoshiaki Nishimura. “When we create works based on overseas culture, we really want to respect their countries and the original concepts the author wanted to portray.” By the same token, he appreciated Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation, which viewed modern Tokyo with the same curiosity he viewed Shropshire. Yonebayashi remains on good terms with Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, he says. He worked there for 20 years before setting up on his own, and his latest film looks and feels like a continuation of Ghibli’s work. Asked to make a distinction, he suggests: “The late Studio Ghibli works tend to end with departures. However, when creating movies for children currently, I thought it was more important to show encounters than partings.” The sentiment feels in tune with his cultural eclecticism. Perhaps we should be grateful. Films such as Mary and the Witch’s Flower are expensive and time-consuming to make, with their painstakingly hand-rendered images and attention to detail. They are an endangered art, which is why few countries outside Japan still make them. It is hard to imagine anyone could have done a better job. If Britain no longer has the industry, it at least has the stories. Next, Ponoc has its eye on Scottish writer Alex Shearer. “I’ve read all his works,” says Nishimura, “and I would really, really love to make a film out of one of his books.” This time, at least, we Brits beat them to it: BBC adapted Shearer’s story Bootleg into a Bafta-winning miniseries in 2002. Mind you, it was also made into a Japanese anime feature in 2008. • Mary and the Witch’s Flower is now on release"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/04/tory-brexiters-believe-local-election-results-are-vindication","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T15:57:53Z","webTitle":"Tory Brexiters believe local election results are vindication","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/04/tory-brexiters-believe-local-election-results-are-vindication","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/04/tory-brexiters-believe-local-election-results-are-vindication","fields":{"headline":"Tory Brexiters believe local election results are vindication","bodyText":"Conservative Brexiters have seized on the party’s local election results as a vindication of their hard line on the customs union, presaging the argument cabinet ministers are likely to make next week when the Brexit subcommittee meets to try and break the deadlock. The biggest Tory successes were outside London in areas where Labour should be challenging to win parliamentary seats. These included a win in Redditch and gains in Nuneaton, and relief in Swindon, where the Conservatives held the council in the face of a huge Labour campaign. All three council areas voted to leave in the Brexit referendum. In a tweet celebrating the results, Boris Johnson made the Brexit connection explicit. “Jeremy Corbyn has been abandoned in many leave areas – his pledge to stay in the customs union means he is not trusted to deliver Brexit,” the foreign secretary said. Expectations were tightly managed by Conservative spinners. Before the local elections, the part was braced for a dire night in the capital, where experts predicted it could lose as many as 100 council seats. The Conservative MP Paul Scully, the party’s vice-chair for London who coordinated much of the campaign in the capital, said fears the Tories could be wiped out in London were genuine. “This was a relentless amount of work; Labour have been saying we over-egged our chances, but from day one we were on a knife edge,” he said. “If you look at what happened in the general election in some places, that would pull anyone up. Even places like Kensington and Chelsea were a real unknown, but we have brought in a lot of new councillors [who] can revitalise the council group. Keeping focus and a sense of purpose is incredibly important.” The Tories’ careful management of expectations meant the party could spend Friday morning claiming significant wins in councils where Labour had not won for 40 years or more. However, in the south London borough of Wandsworth, Labour made significant inroads, climbing from 19 to 26 councillors. The Conservatives’ low expectations masked an erosion of support in some Labour-held councils where the party should be challenging, such as Ealing and Redbridge. In Redbridge, which Labour won for the first time in 2014, the Tories had huge losses and now hold just 12 council seats. The most significant Tory loss was Richmond, where the Liberal Democrats won 37 seats and slashed the number of Conservative councillors to seven. The result shocked Conservative organisers. “It does certainly seem like Brexit was a factor and we were not getting out our vote as efficiently as we could have done,” a Tory source said. The Tory councillor Paul Hodgins said it had been a “tough night” for the party in Richmond, hinting Brexit had been a key factor. “We tried to keep our campaign very local, but certainly national issues seemed to loom very large in this,” he told the Evening Standard. The Conservatives also lost control in Trafford, the only Tory borough in Greater Manchester, and lost Plymouth to Labour. Johnny Mercer, the MP for Plymouth Moor View, said the result showed his party had work to do on defence policy to win back the city, which has close ties to the Royal Navy. His party had not backed up the local campaign with resources, he said, and campaigning had been too negative. “Places like Plymouth have had absolutely nothing out of CCHQ for a number of years: I have struggled to get it noticed. Labour had all their senior guys here, including Jeremy Corbyn. “The trouble is, we have a story to tell on a lot of issues, but we have got to go and advocate for it, and not just go on about how awful Jeremy Corbyn is – everyone knows that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/04/chris-froome-giro-ditalia-stage-one-time-trial-crash","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T14:47:00Z","webTitle":"Chris Froome off the pace in Giro d’Italia time trial after reconnaissance crash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/04/chris-froome-giro-ditalia-stage-one-time-trial-crash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/04/chris-froome-giro-ditalia-stage-one-time-trial-crash","fields":{"headline":"Chris Froome off the pace in Giro d’Italia time trial after reconnaissance crash","bodyText":"Since arriving in Israel Chris Froome has made a decent effort of concealing the mental bruising of an ongoing battle to rescue his reputation but there was no disguising the impact made by the tarmac of Jerusalem after he fell from his bike before the Giro d’Italia had even begun. Wearing plasters after falling during a reconnaissance ride four hours earlier, Froome laboured through the first stage of this race, a technical 9.7km time trial through the streets of this historical city but admitted it had been a painful experience. “It’s not ideal to race just after crashing but that’s bike racing, it’s all part of the sport” he said. The clock told a fuller story, his 21st place finish putting him not only 37 seconds adrift of leader Tom Dumoulin but also behind compatriots Alex Dowsett and Simon Yates, a result few could have foreseen at the start of the day. The gap is not unassailable over the next three weeks, as the four times Tour de France winner pointed out, but it was an early blow in his bid to win a third successive Grand Tour. Only two men have managed such a feat before, the last being Bernard Hinault in 1983. Froome’s start to the season has been unspectacular by his own standards, with low-key results in his previous three outings. But he seemed confident ahead of the Grande Partenza, the first time the start of the Giro has been held outside Europe. It was 2km into a reconnaissance ride on Friday morning that the 32-year-old was thrown from his bike rounding the second corner of the course, in a built up area of the city. There was an audible smash as he hit the ground, skidding across the road fast enough to create a rip in his racing jersey and shorts. Lifting himself to his feet, Froome hobbled back to collect his bike, cycling back to the Team Sky minibus. He was inspected by medics and after being cleaned up was cleared to take the start. “It’s all superficial, no long-term damage,” Froome said. “I’m just grateful it wasn’t serious, a few guys went down and some were pretty badly injured so I’m glad it wasn’t more serious.” Carnage reigned supreme on the opening day as another three riders also fell during their reconnaissance rides. The Bahrain-Merida rider Kanstantin Siutsou, who used to be one of Froome’s trusted lieutenants at Team Sky and was one of the overall favourites, was forced to withdraw after breaking a bone in his back. Miguel López of Astana, another expected to be in the mix, also crashed. It was 30 degrees by the time Froome rolled down the start ramp with the white stone of Jaffa Gate, one of the entrances to Jerusalem’s Old City providing a spectacular backdrop. Kenyan born Froome relishes the heat but he struggled in the first half of the course particularly. Around the second half of the route he gained some ground but not enough to significantly lift the tone of another miserable day for Team Sky. As he warmed down with team leader Dave Brailsford keeping a low profile in the background, Froome drew loud cheers and requests for autographs from spectators. He remains popular with fans here despite having failed a drug test last year, a urine sample showing twice the permitted level of the asthma drug salbutamol in his system, a finding he is appealing. Froome is being paid a seven-figure sum to compete in the Giro d’Italia which will move to its home country next week but the race director, Mauro Vegni, intimated earlier in the week that the charismatic Dutchman Dumoulin might be a more popular overall winner. The Team Sunweb rider, a world champion time trialist, put himself in the pink jersey by winning the stage in 12 minutes and two seconds, beating Rohan Dennis of BMC Racing by two seconds. Lotto Soudal rider Victor Campenaerts finished third on the stage, losing out to Dennis by a few hundredths of a second. Dumoulin is defending the title here and rejected the suggestion the time trial was a dangerous course. “The course was perfect for me, very technical, and I’m good on corners on the TT bike,” he said, “It was full gas, recover, full gas, recover, so it was perfect for me.” Asked if he was now favourite for the general classification victory, given Froome’s travails, Dumoulin replied: “It’s the usual GC cliche – take it day by day but, like the badass I am, I’m going to take it hour by hour.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/may/07/south-east-london-nil-by-mouth-bromley-boys-thor-2-six","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T08:17:18Z","webTitle":"The Bromley contingent: the films from London's forgotten corner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/may/07/south-east-london-nil-by-mouth-bromley-boys-thor-2-six","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/may/07/south-east-london-nil-by-mouth-bromley-boys-thor-2-six","fields":{"headline":"The Bromley contingent: the films from London's forgotten corner","bodyText":"When a film is set in London, it can often feel like the whole thing was directed by the tourist board. There’ll be an aerial shot of the London Eye. The Shard will glint in the background. There’ll be taxis by the bucketload. If you’re shooting Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction, characters will attend aggressively sexualised therapy sessions right at the top of the Gherkin. It’s all very narrow and heavy on the landmarks. Sometimes the suburbs get a look-in, but not all of them. North and west London may have featured in everything from Shaun of the Dead to Bend It Like Beckham, and east London might have been used as a shorthand for grit in films like The Long Good Friday and Ill Manors. But south-east London rarely gets a mention. True, plenty of films are shot in south-east London – The Da Vinci Code had scenes shot at Biggin Hill airport; Johnny Depp’s Dark Shadows was partly filmed in Beckenham Place Park – but very few films are actually about south-east London. This is why something like The Bromley Boys feels so refreshing. It hasn’t even been released yet but, simply by being about Bromley FC, it promises a glimpse at a London that passes the rest of the world by. Maybe a character will go running through the Glades shopping centre. Maybe they’ll get to register a death at the Civic Centre or ride around on the 138 to Chestnut Avenue. Maybe the action will venture out as far as Chislehurst Caves, although technically they aren’t in Bromley proper and so any inclusion in The Bromley Boys will be an almighty slap in the face to all true Bromleians. But with so few movies dedicated to life in London’s forgotten corner, what can we learn about the area from the productions that actually went there? Let’s find out. 1. Nil By Mouth (1997) Kidbrooke’s Ferrier Estate provided the backdrop for Gary Oldman’s punishing 1997 ode to relentless miserable violence, famed for containing the word “cunt” more than any other film in history. It’s less a tourism advert and more a dire warning for the rest of the world to permanently partition London off. However, film fans had better brace themselves for disappointment, because Ferrier Estate no longer exists. It’s since been replaced by the Kidbrooke Village development, where a one-bed flat now costs close to half a million pounds. If anyone ever makes a sequel to Nil By Mouth, there’s a good chance it’ll feature Ray Winstone petitioning the council to build a nice Waitrose or a pop-up small-batch candlestick retail installation. 2. How to Talk to Girls at Parties (2017) Although poor Croydon is used in a lot of films – Delta Point became Gotham general hospital in The Dark Knight Rises, for example – not many films actually want to be about Croydon. But the Neil Gaiman adaptation How to Talk to Girls at Parties is both set and filmed there, and it features real-life locations such as the College Green, the multi-storey carpark near College Green and St George’s Walk shopping parade. Of course, it should be pointed out that Croydon is very obviously just a placeholder for miserable suburban nothingness, but Croydonites are probably already quite used to that. 3. Treacle Jr (2010) There’s an enormous chance that you haven’t seen Jamie Thraves’ Treacle Jr, which came and went in the blink of an eye eight years ago. But it’s nevertheless worth seeking out, because you’d be hard pushed to find a prettier depiction of London’s hidden gems. There are scenes set in Peckham Rye Common and scenes set in West Dulwich, there’s Goose Green and Herne Hill and Walworth. Locals will be thrilled to see the distinctive Sainsbury’s car park on Dog Kennel Hill. Best of all, there’s a lovely sequence set in the Horniman Museum. All films should contain lovely sequences set in the Horniman Museum. 4. Babylon (1980) Written by Quadrophenia’s Martin Stellman, Babylon, directed by Franco Rosso, is nothing less than south-east London’s Saturday Night Fever. Aswad’s Brindsley Forde plays a garage hand who lives for the Deptford sound system culture at night, encountering racism, violence and police brutality along the way. Again, it’s worth pointing out that Babylon was released 38 years ago, and its depiction of south-east London has now become completely unrecognisable. For example, a Time Out list from 2016 entitled 15 Reasons to Visit Deptford High Street had in first place an Instagram of some nice cocktails sold by a Jamaican-themed bar. I’m sure the guy from Aswad would be thrilled. 5. Harry Brown (2009) Imagine if Michael Caine had survived the end of Get Carter, then slowly went a bit cantankerous on a Walworth housing estate. Got it? Great, because that means you never have to watch Harry Brown, in which Michael Caine vigilante-murders a load of men in hoodies as brutally as he can. Again – and I realise that this is becoming something of a theme here – Harry Brown was filmed on an estate that no longer exists. It has since been redeveloped into something called Elephant Park where, like Kidbrooke Village, a one-bedroom apartment will cost you half a million quid. 6. Thor 2: The Dark World (2013) The lousiest Marvel movie featured several key scenes set in south-east London. Coincidence? We may never know. However, if you enjoy seeing famous landmarks getting blown to smithereens, this is the film for you. The Greenwich Old Royal Naval College gets the absolute hell beaten out of it at the climax of this film. In fact, the destruction was so comprehensive that developers have now transformed the site into a luxury housing scheme called Navy Halls, where a dot-sized one-bedroom apartment will now cost you three times more than you will ever earn in your entire life. It’s the south-east London way, after all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/live/2018/may/04/county-cricket-lancashire-v-somerset-essex-v-yorks-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T18:28:19Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Yorkshire rally after first innings of 50 against Essex – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/live/2018/may/04/county-cricket-lancashire-v-somerset-essex-v-yorks-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/live/2018/may/04/county-cricket-lancashire-v-somerset-essex-v-yorks-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Yorkshire rally after first innings of 50 against Essex – as it happened","bodyText":"What a day - ridiculous goings-on at Chelmsford; a cruel injury to an old warhorse, I won’t say on his swansong, and youthful blooming at Old Trafford; wickets galore at Hove and Sophia Gardens.

His debut first-class century, in the same innings as Marcus Trescothick made his 65th, showing great patience, before England’s new selector, in glorious sunshine. Give the man a cigar. His highest first-class score before this was 39 last week against Yorkshire. Meanwhile at Chelmsford, Yorkshire are 34 without loss with Jonny Barstow leaping up the order to open with Lyth and thrashing about for 26 including a 6. At the County Ground against the tourists, Northants wicketkeeper Adam Rossington is stumped for 90, six wickets for Shadab: Northants 249 for 9. Yorkshire have opened the innings with Adam Lyth and Jonny Bairstow, with the latter making his intentions very clear. In the over just bowled, the sixth, he cracked Sam Cook for six and four over mid-off’s head to help Yorkshire to 27-0. He’s just done exactly the same to Jamie Porter as I type - 33-0 in the seventh. In a flash, the Essex lead is 59. And Notts are all out: 302 in just over 69 overs, Gurney stranded on 16; Edwards 4-94. Middlesex all out too, for 230, Robinson 7-58! Yorkshire hit the heady heights of 6 for 0. And a half-century for Trott! Well played that man. A paean here from Jonathan Liew And a century for Rory Burns! 225 balls, 9 x fours: a first Championship hundred of the season for him. An interesting stat here too And there will be no warning for Anderson, as Bartlett was out of his crease when the ball hit him... Essex have been bowled out for 142, a first-innings lead of 92, on the stroke of tea. We still have 31 overs to be bowled in the day, so maybe that one-day finish is not out of the question. Will firm up the stat later, but talk in the press box was going back to the 1950s for the last time that happened in the Championship. And Essex are all out for 142, a lead of 92. Gird yourselves Yorkies. And Trotty sups tea on 42, on this grand day for England oldies. DIVISION ONE The Oval: Surrey 176 for 3 (Burns 84 not out, Foakes 41 not out; Leach 2-34) Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 281 for 9 (Patel 73, Ball 1 not out, Gurney 5 not out; Edwards 4-82) Old Trafford: Somerset 228 for 3 (Trescothick 100, Bartlett 77 not out, Abell 5 not out) Chelmsford: Essex 128-9 (Lawrence 48, Harmer 23 not out, S Cook 3 not out); Yorkshire 50 all out (Balance 22; S Cook 5-28) Bresnan DIVISION TWO Hove: Middlesex 205 for 8 (Holden 69 not out, Murtagh 19 not out; Robinson 6-57) Sophia Gardens: Kent 40-3 (Denly 12 not out, Crawley 3 not out; van der Gugten 2-10) Glamorgan 94 all out (Murphy 39 not out; Stevens 6-26) Riverside: Leicester 203 for 3 (Horton 75, Carberry 73, Cosgrove 11 not out) Edgbaston: Warwickshire 144 for 2; Derby 318 all out TOUR MATCH Northants v Pakistan: Northants 205 for 7 (Rossington 59 not out, Vasconcelos 18 not out; Shadab 4-72) We still have seven overs remaining in the afternoon and 39 in the day, with Essex just having reached triple figures - a feat greeted by hearty applause from the home faithful. They have moved to 109/7. Tim Bresnan has taken the last three wickets to fall to keep Yorkshire’s hopes of a Houdini act alive. Simon Harmer and Peter Siddle are at the crease. Siddle has just whacked Bresnan for six over long-on. To add to the drama, there’s the odd topless spectator knocking around. English summers, eh! Another wicket at Old Trafford: Somerset 215 for 3 – Hildreth c Clark at mid-off b Mennie for 5. Somewhat earlier Anderson hit the grumpometre, lost his cool and threw a ball at the striker’s end and hit Bartlett on the back of the legs. The men in white coats conferred and it looks like a warning for Anderson. All in front of new selector Ed Smith who arrived to see the end of Trescothick and a lovely debut fifty from Bartlett, his first first-class 50 in his sixth match. Elsewhere, Rory Burns has 83 and Ben Foakes 35 for Surrey, 173 for 3; Notts 253 for 6, Wessels nearing 50; Essex 93 for 7, Bresnan 3 for 12; Middlesex 189 for 8 with a sixth wicket for Robinson and 62 not out for Max Holden and, good heavens, Glamorgan, who somehow slipped totally off my radar, were bowled out for 94. Kent already 18 for 1 in reply. Leicester 176 for 2, Northants 199 for 7 against Pakistan and Trotty 24 not out in Warwickshire’s 236 for five. Pantomime proceedings at Old Trafford … Trescothick hoicks Parkinson for four, no foot movement at all, then a couple more ... 99! That’s it … a HUNDRED … he raises his bat, pure arm movement, legs perfectly still. Then he hobbles about to accept a handshake or two. This is a run-out waiting to happen. It is as if he is wearing iron boots. Ah, there we are, he edges behind, tries to cut Livingstone’s first ball and is CAUGHT, limps off the field for 100: c Vilas b Livingstone. A second first-class century at Old Trafford. Somerset 200 for 2. And a little bit of Friday afternoon happiness. It gives you an idea of how crazy this game has been that there has been the odd mention in the press box, more in jest I grant you, of a one-day finish. However, that is very much out of the window now with Essex at 68/4 and leading by 18. At 12/3 it wasn’t the daftest suggestion. Ravi Bopara was the last wicket to go, caught at first slip off Steve Patterson. Dan Lawrence is unbeaten on 45 as we approach the midway point of the afternoon. And, just five away from his century, Trescothick pushes off for a single and collapses on the pitch. The physic comes out, everyone faffs about then Trescothick limps around using his bat as a walking stick. It barely merits description as a hobble - but he seems determined to stay out there. Renshaw emerges as his runner. This could be interesting. ... as with a nudge off his hip Trescothick moves on to 95. Here’s a vintage shot May the fourth be with the Essex groundsman- thank you Paul Frame News of England ancients: At Edgbaston Bell out for 44, Trott in, Warwickshire 172 for 3. Patel out for 73, a third wicket for Fidel Edwards at Trent Bridge. Essex are just four runs behind Yorkshire for the loss of three wickets and Middlesex are recovering with an unbeaten 44-run partnership between Holden and Simpson. Here Trescothick is only 14 away from his hundred, he and Bartlett’s century partnership came in 168 balls. And from Palf, for you Galactus: More post-prandial mishaps: Surrey have lost a couple: Borthwick c Cox b Leach for 10, and Ryan Patel for 10: 99 for 3. And a clatter at Sophia Gardens as Glamorgan lose 3 for 10, a couple of wickets for Darren Stevens. Fifties for Michael Carberry and Paul Horton at The Riverside in an unbeaten opening stand of 114. And 37 not out for Bell at Edgbaston. And here Trescothick moves steadfastly onwards against tight Lancashire bowling. An off-drive off Mennie after lunch had the press-box tummy-up and purring in appreciation. And he’s still pretty nimble between the wickets. Somerset 143 for 1. Time to praise a batsman. But, knowing my luck, I won’t get to the end of this post before he is out. Dan Lawrence has played very nicely for 31 to just take the sting out of things for Essex. One cover drive off Jack Brooks was particularly pleasing on the eye. Where all the attention is on England’s present in this game, it could be that we are looking at their future in this instance. Essex are 38/3 and trail by just 12. New session, same story. Yorkshire have a wicket, their third of the innings, as Ben Coad bowls Nick Browne for seven to leave Essex at 12/3. “50 looks a bloody long way off here” says one spectator in front of me with an accent that’s more Batley than Brentwood. Sandwiches sitting solidly - wicket already .... Glamorgan 57 for 1: Selman lbw Stevens 33. Oh and at Chelmsford, Essex now 12 for 3, Browne b Coad 7. And a very difficult dropped catch first ball after lunch at Old Trafford. Trescothick on 54 cut to backward point where Croft made a valiant leap. And Vilas has taken the gloves here, Davies still on the field but not behind the stumps. Division One The Oval: Surrey 87 for 1 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 137 for 4 Old Trafford: Lancashire 113 for 1 Chelmsford: Yorkshire 50 all out; Essex 10-2 Division Two Hove: Middlesex 81-5 Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 57 for 0 Riverside: Leicester 80 for 0 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 144 for 2; Derby 318 all out Tour match Northants v Pakistan: Northants 88 for 2 Very, very strange events at Chelmsford headline another eventful morning’s play. Yorkshire won the toss, batted, and were bowled out before lunch; Essex are currently not looking much better at 10 for 2. Ducks already for Cook, Westley, Lyth and Root. Here at Old Trafford Somerset are trundling along against the boldly haired Anderson and the impressive Lancashire attack. Fifty for Trescothick – treasure him while he lasts. Solid starts too for Surrey, though a run-out, alas, for Stoneman, and another run-out at Trent Bridge – this time Ross Taylor on 47 - as Notts race away to 137 for four. A rapid 52 not out for Samit Patel. Wickets at Hove, where Middlesex are 81 for 5, with Oliver Robinson taking all wickets to fall, 5-33. A steady morning for Glamorgan, Leicester and Warwickshire too. Lunchtime scores to follow shortly. So, Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow and Alastair Cook have fallen for seven runs between them this morning. Yorkshire have the breakthrough as they defend 50. Cook, another poor shot to add to the morning collection, is caught behind off Jack Brooks for nought. And, as I type, Tom Westley plays an awfully expansive drive and loses his middle stump to Brooks. Essex are 2-2. A 68-ball 50 for Trescothick at Old Trafford. Seven fours and a real treat for the not-bad crowd who’ve turned up. The shots are still there, plus the old authority, and a quick study through the binoculars is very revealing. He’s a reliably well-upholstered presence, but also an inveterate fiddler – gloves on, gloves off, tuck shirt into trousers, re-tuck shirt into trousers in, flick invisible pieces off grit off the pitch, pat grass, remove helmet. And repeat. Trescothick’s only century at Old Trafford came in May 2001 v Pakistan, just saying, though he has a remarkably consistent first-class record here: 15 matches, 9 fifties, 1 hundred, average 48.1 Yorkshire have been bowled out for 50 inside 19 overs, with Peter Siddle finishing with 4-7 and Sam Cook 5-28. In terms of low totals, it is Yorkshire’s lowest since posting 43 against Surrey at the Oval in 1973. Geoff Boycott played in that match. This is incredible. Yorkshire are 49/9 having just lost Steve Patterson and Jack Brooks to Peter Siddle in the 17th over, caught behind and caught at third slip respectively. Gary Ballance has to have a dart now with only Ben Coad left for company. He has 21. And a wicket at The Oval, Stoneman run-out for 28, which you can watch here, thanks to the Surrey cricket feed that now features a GIANT picture of Kohli dominating Big Ben and the London Eye. Surrey 51/1. Notts whizzing along to 100 off 111 balls. It has certainly done a bit this morning, the ball which got Jonny Bairstow indicated that - nipped away and took off-stump from Sam Cook. But there have been a number of loose shots too. Harry Brook could have left his alone, Adam Lyth and Joe Root were not committed to their strokes when driving and Che Pujara lbw playing across the line. Yorkshire’s rebuild job has been left to Gary Ballance and Jack Leaning, who have 16 and seven respectively. They have taken the score to 41-5 in the 15th. Crikey, that’s twice it’s happened to me this morning. Wickets as I type. Leaning is trapped lbw by Peter Siddle, also playing loosely. Make that 41/6. And a wicket falls at Old Trafford, Somerset 65 for 1. Renshaw, who had been engaged in an intriguing battle with Tom Bailey, repeatedly beaten before driving him with ferocity down the ground for four past a ducking Trescothick, suddenly has a moment of madness. He flicks uppishly off his legs and is caught by Jordan Clark for 21. Samit Patel has just hit 21 off a Fidel Edwards over at Trent Bridge, where Notts are 81 for 3. A busy first half hour at Old Trafford where Somerset have rattled along to 48 without loss. Marcus Trescothick navigated through his notoriously tricky first few overs by throwing the bat about, unbothered by the bleach beacon running in towards him. Tom Bailey conceded one fewer run off his first over than in his entire 19 against Surrey in the second innings here last week. And the sun has just come out. Elsewhere, Middlesex are two down, Gubbins out for 8; Notts 27-3, Fidel Edwards two for 2. And 22 for 5 now at Chelmsford. The three ducks on the Yorkshire scorecard might be some light-relief for David Hopps, part of the old-time Guardian Hopps-Selve double-act who was hoping to win a seat last night in Elmet and Rothwell. Footnote: Not wanting to stray too much into Andrew Sparrow’s live politics blog territory, but as a matter of record Hopps failed to get elected. He garnered 1,189 votes in the Wetherby seat he was contesting, but was well behind the three Tories (one of whom was a Mr Alan Lamb) who took the trio of seats available for the Conservatve party (you can find the full results here) - Ed. Would you believe it! Joe Root is out for a golden duck, caught at first slip by Alastair Cook off Sam Cook. There’s a quip in there somewhere. Yorkshire are 9/3 in the fourth over and Cook was on a hat-trick having had Adam Lyth caught behind with the first ball of the over. He had earlier enticed Harry Brook into poking a slip catch to Simon Harmer at second slip, meaning three wickets in five balls split between overs. Root was driving on the move to the young Essex seamer before trudging back to the pavilion. Che Pujara and Gary Ballance are at the crease now. Hang on, Pujara’s gone too. Lbw to Porter for 9. Yorkshire are 11/4. Oh no! Arrived at Old Trafford to find that Haseeb Hameed has been dropped. And also Jimmy Anderson has had an interesting bleach job … Also, it is cloudy, Somerset are batting and Trescothick is 15 not out. Yorkshire have opted for a toss, won it and elected to bat here at Chelmsford, meaning time at the crease today for Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow. The visitors have opted to play seven batsmen and no spinner, with Steve Patterson returning from a broken finger to play for the first time this summer. Left-arm twirler Karl Carver drops out of the team after one match in which he did not bowl a ball against Somerset at Taunton at the weekend. It is a glorious day - warm and sunny. I’ve even spotted some sun cream going on to a few faces in front of the press box. The quirk of the county fixture list means this is the return clash between these two sides, although not a ball was bowled at Headingley last month due to the wet outfield. In fact, it is actually the third time these two have met in the last five Championship games given they both ended the season here last September. That, a comprehensive three-day victory for Essex, is still fresh in the memory for both sides. Ravi Bopara plays his 200th first-class match. We’ve somehow already hobbled along to the fourth round of Championship matches, with lots of alluring fixtures to look forward to. The weather seems kinder, so fingers crossed for fewer brolly-watch updates. The final face cards in the England pack are being played today: Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow and Jimmy Anderson return for Yorkshire and Lancashire. In the last few days we’ve also learnt that dear old Jonathan Trott will retire at the end of this season and, contrary to what you may have read on the County Blog last week, Virat Kohli will play for Surrey – for three Championship matches and at least three One-Day Cup games in June. One Championship game is already under way, Warwickshire v Derbyshire at Edgbaston. Derby named Mark Footitt, on loan from Nottinghamshire, and England Under-19 off-spinner Hamidullah Qadri in their XI. There was a hundred for Wayne Madsen in Derby’s 318 all out; with four wickets for both Henry Brookes and Jeetan Patel. Warwickshire are 32 for 1 in reply. Games starting today … Division One Essex v Yorkshire: A big-name game: Cook, fresh from his 84, Tom Westley and COTY Jamie Porter plus the returning Root and Bairstow. Yorkshire’s batsmen had a shocker at Taunton last week; Essex have battled rain in two games, though they did beat Lancashire. Lancashire v Somerset: Anderson returns! Which gives coach Glenn Chapple some difficult selection decisions over which of his bowlers to drop after an excellent performance against Surrey. Somerset are on a roll – two home wins in a row -with a wonderful start to the season for captain Tom Abell. This is their first game away from home. Lancashire wicketkeeper Alex Davies is doubtful. Nottinghamshire v Hampshire: Featuring top-of-the-table Notts, leading wicket-taker Jake Ball and the resurgent Luke Fletcher. A two-day victory against Worcestershire last weekend makes them favourites against a Hampshire side still missing Sam Northeast. Surrey v Worcestershire: Worcestershire have a tricky task at The Oval. They’ve lost their first three games of the season against Hampshire, Somerset and Nottinghamshire. Surrey battled sensibly to salvage a draw at Old Trafford last week. Ollie Pope (237) and Ben Foakes (218) have been particularly prolific with the bat. Division Two Durham v Leicestershire: A bottom of the table clash, with Durham desperate for a game after the washout against Northants last week. Leicester are bordering on respectability after home draws against Sussex and Derbyshire. Glamorgan v Kent: Glamorgan’s first home game of the season at the happily renamed Sophia Gardens. Good times for Glamorgan after a win at Gloucestershire and an impressive bowling performance against Middlesex. Acting Kent captain Joe Denly scored a century in the tour game against Pakistan last week. Sussex v Middlesex: Nick Gubbins returns for Middlesex; Sussex are still without a win after Monday’s downpour ruined the fascinating game against Gloucestershire. In other news, the PCA that accused six (unnamed) counties of paying players below the minimum wage, Steve Smith is back in Australia ready to make amends, little Justin Langer, the man with the eyes of an evangelical preacher, has signed a four-year contract to coach Cricket Australia – and Jos Buttler made fifty in 18 balls for the Rajasthan Royals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/may/04/breast-cancer-screening-hotline-staffed-by-people-with-only-an-hours-training","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T19:00:31Z","webTitle":"Breast cancer screening hotline staffed by people with only an hour's training","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/04/breast-cancer-screening-hotline-staffed-by-people-with-only-an-hours-training","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/04/breast-cancer-screening-hotline-staffed-by-people-with-only-an-hours-training","fields":{"headline":"Breast cancer screening hotline staffed by people with only an hour's training","bodyText":"Distraught women contacting the government’s breast cancer screening hotline are being connected with call-handlers who have had only one hour’s training and are relying on a cheat sheet of symptoms, the Guardian has learned. The hotline opened on Wednesday after health secretary Jeremy Hunt said a computer error meant 450,000 women between the ages of 68 and 71 did not receive letters inviting them for a final breast cancer screening. He said up to 270 lives may have been cut short as a result. It is being run by Serco, a multinational outsourcing company that runs government services including prisons. The call centres are based in Glasgow, Liverpool and Newcastle. Workers said they are “disgusted” at the way it is being operated and described scenes of chaos in recent days, as call volumes rose from 5,000 on Wednesday to 10,000 on Friday. Staff said the rush to set up the hotline led them to fear mistakes could be made in the handling of women’s cases as they were not medical professionals and had received so little training. Labour said the problems with the helpline were “hugely serious”. It said there had been an assumption that there was an expectation that trained clinicians would be available to worried callers. A booklet provided to the call centre workers included a page that lists symptoms of breast cancer, which staff are supposed to go through if people calling the helpline ask. A staff member who contacted the Guardian said the training sheet was “all over the place and hard to understand ... It looked like it had been typed up and sent out as soon as possible”. She added that she feared a lack of knowledge from those fielding calls was going to “cause more mistakes.” One staff member said: “I felt ashamed knowing what had happened to these women, taking these calls when I am not medically trained, have no counselling background and am in no position to help them.” She added: “Other people I work with feel the same. A girl who was working yesterday said taking calls was horrendous as people were getting really upset ... People also cannot deal with the volume of calls coming through. We are not trained to be dealing with those type of things.” Serco employees were told about the news at noon on the day Hunt revealed the issue in the Commons, and training in how to handle calls was delivered two hours later. The helpline was up and running at 4pm, said call centre workers speaking on condition of anonymity. They have faced an avalanche of calls, with the number of people calling in distress doubling from 5,000 on Thursday lunchtime to 10,000 on Friday, according to figures released by Public Health England. The rushed response to setting up the helpline comes despite the fact that the government had known about the screening error since January, discovering the missed invites after an upgrade to the IT system provided access to improved data sets. Usually staff members are given two weeks training to handle calls, one said. They also reported having to drop coverage on other helplines, including booking appointments for universal credit, the government’s benefits system that has already been widely criticised because of the minimum 42-day wait for applications to be processed. Jonathan Ashworth MP, the shadow health secretary, said: “It seems the outsourcing firm Serco is running the hotline with staff who have no medical background or training in counselling, responding to women on these calls ... There are of course huge questions that remain unanswered about this tragic scandal but the government’s priority must also be to ensure adequate resources are in place to give women the help they need.” The Guardian saw sheets from what one Serco worker said was a 23-page pack given to call-centre handlers advising them on how to help those worried women who call up. There was a further four pages on possible scenarios and seven pages of frequently answered questions. One worker said: “I don’t think the people whose family members have died would like to know the people they’ve been directed to to help them aren’t medical professionals but have to give medical advice and it’s all from one information sheet.” She added: “We found out at noon and were delivered training at 2.30pm. We were then taking taking calls live at 4pm ... Normally we get two weeks training and this was one hour and a half ... it is ridiculous, there’s no way we could take in all that information in that amount of time.” Serco provides a broad range of services for governments and corporations worldwide. It runs a number of government services including health, transport, justice, immigration and defence. In the past it has come under fire for overcharging on government contracts to tag offenders, as well as for its running of a number of private prisons. Public Health England confirmed that it had contracted out the helpline to Serco. A PHE spokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring that affected women and their families receive all the support they need ... We are aware that the helpline is busy, particularly at peak times. We have built additional resilience into the system to ensure that as many people are able to receive support as possible.” A spokesperson for Serco said: “Our operatives are all trained and experienced in providing contact services on behalf of public service customers. They are using information and advice provided by Public Health England and are required to collect details of women who believe they have missed screening, so they can be contacted by health professionals, and to set out the options available to them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/04/jeremy-clarkson-and-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-it-could-be-tv-hatewatch-perfection","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T10:21:55Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Clarkson and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

It could be TV hatewatch perfection","bodyText":"Imagine being on national television and having to make a decision that was worth a million pounds. Now imagine handing that decision over to Jeremy Clarkson. It sounds like some clammy anxiety dream you might have the day before a life-changing job interview, but it isn’t. This Saturday sees the first in a seven-episode run of 20th anniversary Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? specials, and it’s almost certain that, for some poor sap, the unenviable scenario above will become reality. With the new Ask the Host lifeline, contestants will be betting eye-watering sums on whether the answer to a question is actually swimming around in Jeremy Clarkson’s fuzzy little bonce, or whether he just thinks it is. This is because Jeremy Clarkson will be that host. And, mark my words, this is going to make for superb primetime TV. Clarkson is perfect for the job. Allow me to explain. Millionaire ... was always going to come back to celebrate its 20th birthday in some form, but most assumed it would be Chris Tarrant handling things. When it was announced the Top Gear motormouth would be at the helm instead, it was eyebrows, not hopes, that were raised. I mean it’s Jeremy Clarkson, for God’s sake. Him. That bloke. A man who’s most famous these days for punching someone in the face because he didn’t have his dinner ready and then convincing Amazon to pay him millions of pounds to run around with James May and Richard Hammond. To find someone more divisive on British TV you have to follow the appalled gaze of Susanna Reid. But for Millionaire’s semi-comeback to make any kind of sense in 2018, it had to make changes. Big ones. The introduction of a new lifeline is all well and good, but it’s hardly the boot-to-the-bottom rejuvenation the format needed. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was crying out for a new angle. An injection of compelling, addictive, can’t-look-away hatewatch potential. Enter: blandman. Enter: Jeremy Clarkson. During Tarrant’s tenure as host, and in addition to inventing that infuriating long pause thing which now takes up half the runtime of every show ever, the Tiswas pro was an encouraging, avuncular, only faintly disappointed ringmaster. Even when some feckless dolt hit a duck on a question about what colour oranges are or something, remonstrations from Tarrant were relatively gentle. This was before Anne Robinson made the “media personality being an arse to the general public” trope fashionable, and certainly before Simon Cowell hoisted his belt buckle up between his nipples and weaponised it. They were mean by design. Tarrant wasn’t. While it’s highly unlikely Clarkson will be ostentatiously cruel for the sake of it, you can’t imagine he’ll be anywhere near as patient with a gormless contestant as Tarrant. This new Millionaire … will basically be a study of an extremely wealthy man who thinks he knows everything becoming increasingly incensed by poor people who’ve had the temerity to come on a quiz show to demonstrate that they don’t. You can almost see the vein of swallowed rage throbbing in Clarkson’s temple. His forehead will be pink, chapped and sore from facepalms by the end of the first episode, and I give it 5/1 odds that he loses it completely by episode four. That 20 seconds of silence before saying “ ... is the correct answer!” is going to be literal torture for him, because, for the first time in his career he will be contractually obliged to shut up. Like him or loathe him, Clarkson does know a thing or two about taking a creaky format and twisting it into something new that appeals to an audience far wider than its originally perceived remit. Braying, sycophantic Clarksonian audiences would make it harder for people to cheat by coughing, so a blokey The Grand Top Who Wants to Tour a Gear-ionnaire hybrid isn’t ever going to happen. But a more playful, pantomimic tone would fit the show like a glove. Clarkson knows when and how to play the role of cartoon baddie and, if he chooses to here, his engrained, holier-than-thou smuggadoccio could be superbly put to use. With desperate contestants now being forced, at the absolute end of need and with gnawing dread in their hearts, to Ask the Host, Clarkson’s unwavering belief in his own opinions will at some point almost certainly ruin innocent lives. Not only will this make Millionaire ... wildly entertaining in a voyeuristic sense (and allow us to witness whether Clarkson is able to experience the human emotions known as “humility” and “guilt”), it will reposition the Millionaire … host as the enemy, making us side with the contestants much more than we would if they were just playing for enough money to pay off their mortgage and go on a rubbish cruise. It could give the show an antagonistic narrative that’s been sorely lacking since quiz shows such as Only Connect, Pointless and The Chase prioritised a form of gentle chumminess that’s made them successful, yet casually inessential. Let’s give Who Wants to Be a Millionaire its villain. And let’s agree that, if he chooses to run with the idea, Jeremy Clarkson is the ideal man to portray that heel, in all its punchable glory. In fact, the only person better suited would be his sometime-nemesis Piers “I know Donald Trump” Morgan. But perhaps the producers agreed that this would be taking even hatewatcing a step too far. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? starts on Saturday at 9.15pm on ITV"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/03/jurgen-klopp-thrash-metal-chord-english-ideal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T19:38:00Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp’s thrash metal style strikes a chord with English ideal | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/03/jurgen-klopp-thrash-metal-chord-english-ideal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/03/jurgen-klopp-thrash-metal-chord-english-ideal","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp’s thrash metal style strikes a chord with English ideal","bodyText":"According to Benjamin Disraeli Rome symbolises the ideal of conquest.

But as Klopp pointed out, nothing has been settled just yet. The run to the final has had its memorable subplots. From James Milner’s elevation to the status, on the season’s stats, of most creative player in the history of modern European football. To the sustained excellence of Andy Robertson. To the spectacle of players as diverse as Loris Karius and Ragnar Klavan blocking it out en route to a Champions League final. Still, no permanent mark has been made and certainly Real Madrid will present a different kind of obstacle. For the first time this season Liverpool face a meeting with European aristocracy. Deep down Real will see them as extras in this show, a disposable piece of ballast, there to provide a backdrop to the imperial parade. Yet for all that it is perhaps time to park thoughts of Kiev and wallow just a little in the moment, because Klopp is wrong in one sense. Something significant has already been achieved just by making it to this stage. First for Klopp himself; and second for English football, so angst-ridden in its endless search for things such as identity and purpose, for the right DNA, the right borrowed suit of clothes. Yes: it’s time to talk about Jürgen – and about us. Man is never so manly as when he feels deeply and acts boldly. That was also Disraeli but it could at a pinch be a Klopp-ism, just without the guffaws and the swearing and the slang, a Victorian translation of one of those asides tossed into his rambling late-night press conferences where you sit up and think, hang on, what did he just say? Liverpool have been down this road but the boldness, the deep feeling of this team, is Klopp’s own work. This is a manager who has done that rare thing of rebuilding a team entirely in his own image in the space of two years and eight months. Klopp signed eight of the Liverpool players on the pitch in Rome and gave another his professional debut. There is nothing in this team that isn’t basted in his juices. Liverpool lost their best (inherited) player in January and still got better on the back of it – got a new best player, a better best player. Klopp has always been a systems manager. He remains wedded to his founding revelation at Mainz that the right tactics implemented correctly can beat better players, a theme he has returned to often in the current run. This is the other big thing about this Liverpool team in a Champions League final. As Emlyn Hughes once said: “The greatest good you can do for another is not to share your riches but to reveal to him his own.” Actually that was also Disraeli but it captures Klopp’s potential to affect English football more widely. Real are fitting opponents in this sense. Liverpool’s 4-0 defeat of pre-Ronaldo Madrid in March 2009 is an overlooked staging point in the modern history of European club football. It was after seeing their team physically overpowered by Gerrard and Mascherano, Kuyt and Carragher (and also Babel, Spearing and Dossena) that Real made a slight change of policy, re-gearing to match the power of the Premier League. That summer 13 players left. Cristiano Ronaldo arrived, as did Karim Benzema and Liverpool’s own Xabi Alonso and Álvaro Arbeloa. That Premier League intensity had revealed something to Real, offered a route to further riches. The hope now is that Klopp’s example may do something similar for English football. Like it or not Liverpool are deeply Premier League, oddly indigenous in their style. This is a distinction, not a judgment. For all the brilliance of Manchester City, it is a fact that the Pep Guardiola system is entirely its own entity – no less or no more valid, but with its own distinct fascinations and contrasts. Whereas Liverpool’s hard-pressing, chancy physicality just feels like an unusually good fit with the strangely persistent texture and tone of the game in this country, the way qualities such as pace and power and the eagerness to play at speed still emerge even through the prism of Premier League cosmopolitanism. Perhaps this idea of shared identity should not matter: football is a global, borderless entity now, existing only in that square of green. But the notion of different footballing cultures, of an English way, certainly matters to Klopp, who has spoken in these pages of the benefits of mining that source, of exploring its deep roots. There were seven English players on the pitch at various times over the two legs and at its most intense the Klopp thrash-metal style just feels like it should be English. Before the quarter-final Fernandino had called Liverpool a long-ball team, which clearly is not true but does reflect the rather overlooked synergy between the pressing style and classic direct football of the 1950s. Both are designed to provide creativity out of broken play, whether through airborne assault or well-drilled pressing, the kind of attack that can feed like a shoal of piranhas off a state of engineered disorder. This is what Premier League football looks like, at least in the hopeful imagination, or could or should look like. That it has been created by a German, led from the front by a Brazilian and a Senegalese and given a dusting of genius by an Egyptian only adds to the gaiety. Perhaps Liverpool really will be able to assert their own strengths in Kiev, to summon up the fury of the Red Zone. Some will pore fretfully over the weaknesses in Liverpool’s backline, albeit these are mirrored in Real’s own regally dozy approach to the common mud of marking and tracking back. One other thing, though: a one-off final suits Liverpool much better than the more unforgiving exam over two legs. Finals can be crazy, adrenal things, there to be wrenched away in a fateful 20-minute surge. Now, who does that remind you of?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/04/ex-girlfriend-wont-let-me-go-feel-responsible","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T11:31:57Z","webTitle":"My ex girlfriend won’t let me go and I feel responsible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/04/ex-girlfriend-wont-let-me-go-feel-responsible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/04/ex-girlfriend-wont-let-me-go-feel-responsible","fields":{"headline":"My ex girlfriend won’t let me go and I feel responsible","bodyText":"I broke up with my ex-girlfriend six months ago and while I’m still sad about it and sometimes miss her, it’s been a life-shattering event for her.

Winterkorn, who resigned in 2015 as the scandal was revealed, conspired to defraud the US and violate the Clean Air Act, federal laws designed to control air pollution, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday in a Michigan federal court. Five other VW executives were also charged in the indictment. He becomes the highest-ranking executive to be charged over “dieselgate” – a scheme where VW used software to trick government emissions testers. “The indictment unsealed today alleges that Volkswagen’s scheme to cheat its legal requirements went all the way to the top of the company,” said US attorney general Jeff Sessions. “These are serious allegations and we’ll prosecute this case to the full extent of the law.” When news of the scheme broke Winterkorn said he was “stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen Group”. He denied any knowledge of the scandal – which was used to evade pollution limits on nearly 600,000 diesel vehicles. Last December, Oliver Schmidt, a senior Volkswagen executive, was jailed for seven years and fined $400,000 for his part in the scheme. Schmidt, who had returned to Germany, was arrested while on holiday in Florida. VW pleaded guilty as a corporation in March, agreeing to pay a record $4.3bn in fines. Last year Winterkorn told a German parliamentary inquiry that he had no knowledge of the company’s software scam, also the subject of a criminal investigation in Germany. “It is not comprehensible why I was not informed early and clearly about the measurement problems,” he said. VW was not immediately available for comment. Germany is unlikely to extradite one of its citizens in order to face trial in the US. • The subheading of this article was amended on 19 December 2018 because an earlier version misnamed Martin Winterkorn as Michael.

Back then, I’d asked directions to it of a woman chopping wood outside Bryn Saeth. “Dacw, yn y gornel ym mhen pella’r maes,” she’d told me. “Over there in the far corner of the field.” I crossed to the wood’s edge. A stream cascaded over mossy slabs confettied with wood anemones. Prone among drifted oak leaves was an inches-thick slate, four feet long, a shaped round hole in it. Llech Ronw (the slate of Gronw)! Quartz rocks scattered around suggested a ritual site. I’d lifted it up, just as Gronw Pebyr had done in Math fab Mathonwy (the fourth branch of The Mabinogion – a story-cycle that’s one of the masterpieces of medieval European literature). Gronw had conspired with his lover, Blodeuedd, wife of Lleu Llaw Gyffes, to kill her husband. He lanced Lleu’s side with a spear as he bathed; lived thereafter with Blodeuedd – a woman created for Lleu’s pleasure (no feminist fable, this) by his uncle, Gwydion the enchanter, from the flowers of oak, meadowsweet and broom. But Lleu lived, transformed into an eagle. Gwydion found the wounded bird, restored it to health and human form. They came seeking vengeance. Lleu’s spear pierced the shield-stone Gronw had held up to protect himself from the returned blow – remember your folktale motifs? – he owed him, and shattered the adulterer’s spine. See, there’s the hole! Blodeuedd fled with her handmaidens into the desolate hills, continually looking behind them. Walking backwards, all were drowned in Llyn y Morynion – the maidens’ lake – except for their mistress, transformed by Gwydion into an owl and mockingly renamed Blodeuwedd (“flower-face”). The stone has now been set upright, concreted into a plinth, surrounded by wire. I’d not seen it thus, thought better of finding it again, its place anyway having changed, the resonance gone, a loathsomeness of conifers around it now. Instead I went to the maidens’ wild lake at sunset. A single teal duck was gliding through silvered water. Skylarks soared, distance editing out their dry shrillings until only clear, bell-like notes remained."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/03/atletico-madrid-arsenal-europa-league-semi-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T21:03:08Z","webTitle":"Atlético’s Diego Costa denies Arsenal’s Arsène Wenger European final farewell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/03/atletico-madrid-arsenal-europa-league-semi-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/03/atletico-madrid-arsenal-europa-league-semi-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Atlético’s Diego Costa denies Arsenal’s Arsène Wenger European final farewell","bodyText":"For Arsène Wenger, there will be no happy ending. “Rumbo hacia Lyon,” (road to Lyon) read the huge banner unfurled by the most boisterous section of Atlético Madrid supporters before this victory. Diego Simeone’s team are, as promised, on their way to the Europa League final and whatever tributes come for Wenger over the next 10 days – the promise of a statue, perhaps, or even a stand named in his honour at the Emirates – it will not be how he wanted the story to finish. All that is left now is Sunday’s home game against Burnley, followed by the trips to Leicester and Huddersfield, and perhaps it is a fitting end to a season of drift. Arsenal came up short, as they often do against elite teams, and when they needed something special in the second half, losing to Diego Costa’s goal, they did not have the personnel to deliver it. Arsenal barely summoned a chance and the late onslaught that might have been anticipated never really materialised. There was only one goal in it – yet Arsenal were obliging opponents for a team with Atlético’s defensive expertise. This was Atlético’s 12th successive clean sheet at this stadium – an incredible run that goes back to 20 January and covers 1,097 minutes in play – and that parsimonious defending was the difference over the two legs. Atlético were brilliantly efficient at the back whereas it is more than 10 years since the same could be said of Wenger’s teams. He has never won a European trophy and, yes, it would have been a lovely way to go out after 22 years as Arsenal’s manager. Atlético, however, give the impression that fairytale endings are just that – for fairytales. On top of everything else, Arsenal also lost Laurent Koscielny to a ruptured achilles tendon, an injury that will have ramifications for France. Koscielny, who has been nursing a long-standing problem, went down in such a way the seriousness of the injury immediately became apparent. He pounded the turf in pain and frustration and his reaction was of a man who must have known straight away what it meant for his hopes of playing in the World Cup. Koscielny was supposed to retire after this summer’s tournament; instead, he will not be involved with Didier Deschamps’s team in Russia. Hypothetical now, but perhaps Arsenal might have coped better with Costa and Antoine Griezmann if their captain had lasted longer than seven minutes. Then again, Koscielny was badly at fault for Griezmann’s goal in the first leg. Griezmann had another fine game and when the two Atlético forwards combined at the end of the first half, in the time added on for Koscielny’s treatment, it led to the game’s decisive moment. The goal showed the qualities of both players. Griezmann’s pass was beautifully weighted and once Costa had got behind Héctor Bellerín it was always going to be difficult for the Arsenal right-back to make up for his positional error. Bellerín might have been faster but Costa was stronger, shielding the ball with his body while expertly holding off his opponent. David Ospina, who had endured a nervous opening 45 minutes, advanced from his line and Costa swept the ball past Arsenal’s goalkeeper with a confident left-foot finish. Until the point the Arsenal supporters, positioned in the most vertiginous levels of this sweeping new-build stadium, must have been pleasantly surprised by the way their team had set about the game. All the same, Wenger’s men had a lot of the ball without doing a great deal with it. Mesut Özil, for instance, was prominently involved without being able to pick out a killer pass. Atlético have conceded only 18 goals in 35 La Liga appearances this season and Arsenal needed more from their attacking players. Danny Welbeck and Alexandre Lacazette were disappointing. In the second half Arsenal were attacking the end where their supporters were gathered and there were some encouraging moments early on. Granit Xhaka’s low shot brought the first noteworthy save from Jan Oblak and there were even a few moments of carelessness from the home team’s defenders. Bellerín’s surging runs from right-back were another feature and midway through the second half Wenger brought on Henrikh Mkhitaryan to increase his team’s attacking threat at the expense of Jack Wilshere. Arsenal still found it difficult to get behind Atlético’s expertly organised defence. Mkhitaryan put one shot over the crossbar and the referee, Gianluca Rocchi, was too lenient on the sporadic occasions when Wenger’s team found themselves in encouraging positions and Simeone’s players – streetwise, to the end – gave away deliberate free-kicks. Arsenal seemed to lose belief in the final exchanges and that, perhaps, was the most disappointing part. There was no burst of late pressure, no moving a defender into attack, no gambling – and, more than anything, no spark. The final whistle sounded and Wenger was quickly gone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/speedy/1190","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-21T23:00:49Z","webTitle":"Speedy crossword No 1,190","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/speedy/1190","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/speedy/1190","fields":{"headline":"Speedy crossword No 1,190","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/04/morning-mail-queensland-land-clearing-polanski-cosby-ikea-meatballs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T21:00:17Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Queensland land-clearing laws go through","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/04/morning-mail-queensland-land-clearing-polanski-cosby-ikea-meatballs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/04/morning-mail-queensland-land-clearing-polanski-cosby-ikea-meatballs","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Queensland land-clearing laws go through","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 4 May. Top stories The Queensland parliament has finally passed new land-clearing laws, a move welcomed by environmental groups as a step towards curbing the state’s soaring deforestation rates. The laws went through late on Thursday night after an exhausting three-day debate and amid fierce protests from farmers, who say the restrictions will harm agriculture. The state’s natural resources minister, Anthony Lynham, said passing the laws delivered on Labor’s election commitment. “This is balanced, measured and responsible legislation,” he said. But farmers have promised to give Annastacia Palaszczuk and government MPs a rough reception at Beef Australia, one of the world’s biggest pastoral forums, which begins in Rockhampton on Sunday.

Last week Cosby was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand. His name has since been removed from the Television Academy website and he has lost an honorary degree from Yale. Polanski, who won an Oscar for best director in 2003, fled the US to France in 1978 while awaiting sentencing for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old. Bill Shorten will face a strong internal push at the ALP national conference in July to commit a Labor government to increasing the Newstart allowance in its first term. Darcy Byrne, an ally of the frontbencher Anthony Albanese says Newstart must increase because the unemployment payment hasn’t kept up with national living standards for more than a quarter of a century. Shorten this week pledged to pursue a “root and branch” review of Australia’s welfare payments if Labor won the election but he did not commit to raising it. The UK will use a series of international summits this year to call for a comprehensive global strategy to combat Russian disinformation, and urge a rethink over traditional dialogue with Moscow. “The foreign secretary regards Russia’s response to Douma and Salisbury as a turning point and thinks there is international support to do more,” a Whitehall official said. Former Foreign Office officials admit that an institutional reluctance to call out Russia once permeated British diplomatic thinking, but say that after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal that attitude is evaporating. Turks have reacted with glee to what many have described as an official – and certainly long overdue – confession from Stockholm that Sweden’s signature national dish is, in fact, Turkish. “Those famous Swedish meatballs you get in Ikea are actually Turkish, admits Swedish government,” tweeted TRT World, Turkey’s publicly funded international television news channel. According to academics, meatballs were introduced to Sweden by King Charles XII in the early 18th century.

During a raid on her home in Ruyigi province the girl was pelted with stones and her neck was slashed with a machete by attackers. Her father and three brothers were murdered but, miraculously, she survived. Now 30 and with her own young family, Aline finds her life in turmoil once more due to the violence and instability that blights Burundi. She fled to neighbouring Rwanda in December and now lives among an estimated 64,000 Burundians at the Mahama refugee camp in Kirehe province. With the nation gripped by violence in the prelude to a controversial referendum vote on 17 May, the conflict in her home country is this time drawn along political rather than ethnic lines. The vote could allow the extension of Pierre Nkurunziza’s term from five to seven years, paving the way for him to stay in power until 2034, as the proposed changes would allow him to stand for re-election despite having already served three terms. The campaign has been marked by allegations of widespread intimidation and violence against opposition supporters. “The women of the ruling party tried to make me join their campaign, but I refused. It made it unsafe for me to stay,” says Aline. “I left because these women threatened me. They said they would cut my neck again,” she explains, running her hand along her scars. Florida Uwera, education assistant at the camp, says: “We have seen a sharp increase in the number of refugees arriving every day. They are against the referendum and the government is killing them.” Others have been here since 2015, when the news that Nkurunziza would seek a third term as president – a move his opponents deemed unconstitutional – led to a failed coup. The clampdown on protesters and ensuing violence led to an estimated 1,200 deaths and has forced 400,000 people into exile. About 174,000 Burundians reside in Rwanda, with the Mahama camp supporting the biggest share, roughly 64,000 inhabitants. Since 2015, the camp has been transformed. Emergency tents have given way to hundreds of neat rows of brick huts stretching out along the border with Tanzania, the fringes of Rwandan’s eastern neighbour clearly visible in the distance. Mireille, 30, arrived in the camp in August 2015 with her husband, 32, their eight-year-old son, who is disabled, and his brothers, aged four and one. “My husband was in a demonstration and the police were looking for him, so we had to get out,” she says. “My eldest son is very sick and it was hard to bring him - he can’t talk or walk.” Before leaving the couple had been seeking to take him to India for an operation on his spine. Now their hopes for improving his health have been placed on hold. For how long, they do not know. Inside their hut, Mireille’s eldest son lies on a mat, resting his head in his brother’s lap while she feeds the baby. Their father, who works as a cleaner and gardener at the camp, is not around so she has her hands full. “Sometimes there is not enough soap to keep the children clean,” she says. “We cook outside on a small stove and we all sleep in one room.“There are no tensions between refugees but, sometimes, groups of men from the militia group have tried to infiltrate the camp and threaten people.” The UN has condemned what it has described as a “campaign of terror” by government-backed militia in Burundi calling for the rape and murder of those with perceived links to the opposition. Hundreds of girls and women have allegedly been raped by members of the youth wing of the ruling CNDD-FDD party. Sandrine, who arrived at Mahama camp alone when she was just 15, is among those who fled in fear of the Imbonerakure. “I was living in Kirundo province with my family, but I was scared of the militia groups who had been torturing people,” she says. “They raped any women they could, and I saw it happen to my friends. I decided to leave without even telling my family. I’ve had no contact with them since.” Sandrine regrets that she has missed out on years of schooling. She yearns to study again. Others have had some support to continue their education. Jean Claude studies at Mount Kenya University, commuting more than 80 miles to Kigali for lessons. Dressed in a pristine white shirt and pressed suit trousers, the 29-year-old says: “We need to study but it’s hard. When night falls it’s completely dark and we have no lamps.” He had been living in a militia town in Burundi, and saw young people killed and tortured. “I moved to Karuzi, but I still felt in danger,” he says. “I had been about to start university when I left Burundi and when I reached here I was assisted by the charity, Maison Shalom.” He is among scores of young people supported by Marguerite Barankitse, a Burundian humanitarian who is living in exile in Kigali after moving her organisation across the border. During Burundi’s civil war she set up Maison Shalom to support children who had been orphaned. When the conflict ended in 2005, she helped them return to their communities. Some of those children, now adults, have become refugees and need her help once again. Barankitse is making one of her frequent visits to the site, where dozens of people are building a workshop, singing as they pass buckets of cement and lay bricks. The construction, funded by money made available after Barankitse won the 2016 Aurora humanitarian prize, will house sewing machines and a cybercafe so that young people can be trained in tailoring and sell clothes online. “I came to the refugee camp in 2015 and gathered some of the young people who had stopped studying,” Barankitse says. “They began English lessons and in September 2016 they were able to return to university here in Rwanda. “The goal is they will be able to return to Burundi but, while we wait, we must provide training and create jobs for them.” Aurora prize money has enabled 365 Burundian refugees to graduate in the past two years. Back in Kigali, at the charity’s Oasis of Peace community centre, Burundian student Jeoffrey Mwihevyi describes his hopes for the future. He was living at Mahama but, thanks to Maison Shalom, he is now studying law at a university in Kigali. “My parents worked for the government but turned against the president, so we had to leave,” says the 27-year-old. “At first I struggled, but now I have a job driving tourists and have started my degree. I want to stay in Rwanda and study international law. I hope one day I might be able to hold the Burundian government to account for what it has done.” Barankitse adds: “We fled here together, Hutus and Tutsis. We see how people in Rwanda have suffered so much but turned the page. Our government should learn from the leaders here, who have rebuilt the country with love and vision.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/crossword-blog/2018/may/07/crossword-blog-the-new-yorkers-second-crossword","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T08:45:10Z","webTitle":"Crossword blog: the New Yorker's second crossword","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2018/may/07/crossword-blog-the-new-yorkers-second-crossword","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2018/may/07/crossword-blog-the-new-yorkers-second-crossword","fields":{"headline":"Crossword blog: the New Yorker's second crossword","bodyText":"When a publication launches a puzzle, it is obliged to answer a couple of existential questions: “Who are we?” and “Whatever it is that we are, how should that be expressed through messing around with words and letters?” The best newspapers and magazines know instinctively how to answer. In Viz, for example, the puzzle presents itself as 30 times ruder even than Private Eye’s, then reveals, on closer investigation, a savage intelligence. Just like the rest of the publication. What, then, does a New Yorker puzzle look like? For a very long time, the answer was: nothing, because there was no puzzle at all. Shame. But even the exemplar of the art, the New York Times, held out for an age after the New York World newspaper invented the general form of crosswords, deriding the whole enterprise as “a primitive form of mental exercise”. Then, two decades ago, the New Yorker thought it knew its answer. As a magazine, the New Yorker is smart and aspirational, but rooted in its demotic domicile. Like Stephen Sondheim. So it was that the New Yorker, in the city that had birthed the crossword some 80-odd years previously, followed his lead. In 1968, Sondheim had written a piece for the first edition of New York magazine headlined: “How to do a real crossword puzzle. Or: What’s a four-letter word for ‘east Indian betel nut’ and who cares?” By “real”, he meant the cryptic. Not just any cryptic: every Thursday, Sondheim was in the habit of picking up the UK’s Listener magazine and flicking to its extremely challenging crossword. “I got Leonard Bernstein hooked,” he said. “Thursday afternoons, no work got done on West Side Story. We were doing the puzzle.” The American-style crossword was, for Sondheim, too definitional. Insufficiently playful. For a while – although not for long – he set cryptics for that same magazine. The baton was dutifully picked up by the (similarly titled, more celebrated) New Yorker in the 1990s (although the grids took a strange fit-into-one-column format). But again, not for long. Over here, anyone who fancies a stiff challenge has little option other than to learn cryptic conventions, but the New Yorker felt it needed to hold hands. Alongside the puzzle was an announcement of The New Yorker’s Guide to Solving Cryptic Crosswords, a 2,000-word dossier available to anyone who sent an SAE to 20 West 43rd Street. It began: A cryptic is a special type of crossword puzzle in which each clue is a little puzzle in itself. Cryptics were invented in Britain, where they appear in every sort of publication, from the snootiest literary weeklies to the brassiest popular tabloids. In the United States, cryptics aren’t as well known. But, like such other once-exotic treats as sushi, cappuccino, and acupuncture, the curious crossword with the convoluted clues has been catching on. Reader, it didn’t catch on. Why now for a new New Yorker puzzle? The literary editor of newyorker.com, David Haglund, tells me that the “space afforded by the web lets us do new things. We’ve been expanding online in the last few years, and this was something we thought we could do well, and that our readers would enjoy.” And since the era of Sondheim, and of the New Yorker’s cryptic experiment, the US puzzle has changed. As we’ve noted in these pages, the “bald definitions” decried by Sondheim have yielded to a fairer, smarter style that gives up its secrets after a struggle, just as any cerebral puzzle must. (Says the magazine’s senior web manager, Liz Maynes-Aminzade, of our US-style puzzle series: “I applaud your efforts!”) And so, although it pains me to report it, the new New Yorker puzzle is not a cryptic. But it is brilliant. Today will see only the second in the magazine’s series, but the first puzzle, set by Anna Shechtman, put me in mind of the American series I counter-intuitively find the most straightforward: those puzzles in their Chronicle of Higher Education. I suspect that apparently higher-end challenges are more accessible to us Brits, since literature and history more readily cross geographical boundaries than do, say, TV and commerce. Also, it seems, chronological boundaries. Says Maynes-Aminzade of “how to strike the right balance between topical and timeless”: You want the puzzles to feel relevant – but if you have too many SALTBAE and FIDGETSPINNER answers, no one will be able to solve them five years from now. We shall see. For now, I would say that I expect a New Yorker puzzle to take as long as, say, a (London) Times cryptic, with equal delight as the letters tumble into place. Your feedback is, as ever, valued."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/03/tip-two-win-roger-teal-2000-guineas","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T18:34:00Z","webTitle":"Uncharted waters with Classic runner Tip Two Win has Roger Teal all at sea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/03/tip-two-win-roger-teal-2000-guineas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/03/tip-two-win-roger-teal-2000-guineas","fields":{"headline":"Uncharted waters with Classic runner Tip Two Win has Roger Teal all at sea","bodyText":"Roger Teal is looking forward to the 2,000 Guineas on Saturday so much he cannot wait for it to be over. “It’ll be nice to get the day out the way, for sure,” says the trainer, whose nerves have been unravelling since he committed to taking a shot at the race with Tip Two Win, a David among the Goliaths of Godolphin and Ballydoyle. “We’ve never experienced this before. It’s all brand new to us.” Teal’s most notable success in Britain was the Darley Stakes of 2009, in which he beat the big names of Newmarket with a 25-1 winner, Steele Tango. Now he is trying to turn a similar trick at similar odds in a race of much greater consequence. “You wake up at funny hours of the morning, worrying: ‘Should I have done this, should I have done that?’ I found myself waking up at half three the other morning and then you can’t get back to sleep.” Teal makes a Classic runner sound like a kind of torture. When the jockey David Probert dropped by the stable in Great Shefford, near Lambourn, on Thursday, the trainer’s first words to him were: “This seemed a good idea two months ago …” With a laugh Teal added: “I am enjoying it but it’s nerve-racking at the same time. The whole team in the yard is buzzing.” The 50-year-old Teal and his grey will make a pair of outsiders at Newmarket. The other trainers in the Guineas are, in most cases, backed by big money and have stables well stocked with blue-blooded thoroughbreds. “It’d be nice to go out and have 10 Dubawi’s looking at you,” said Teal, referring to one of the most popular and expensive of stallions. “Some people are spoilt for choice. But I’m not jealous,” he added, laughing again. Teal, whose mother trained point-to-pointers, started in racing on the bottom rung as a teenage groom with John Jenkins in Surrey. He moved on to Philip Mitchell’s yard, where he may have got a taste for giantkilling through the exploits of Running Stag, winner of big pots in the US and France and the runner-up in the Hong Kong Cup. Now retired, Mitchell is rooting for Teal, who he remembers as hard-working and eager to learn. “Roger flew round the world with Running Stag and was able to maintain the horse’s wellbeing and fitness to run on three different continents,” he said. “He was very thorough. If this horse is good enough, he will be well prepared.” Tip Two Win has already done Teal proud, landing a race in Qatar in February that brought more prize money than the stable won in the whole of last year. He sees the horse as “a lively outsider”, adding: “I’m not a trainer that just goes there for days out. He just keeps surprising me. And hopefully on Saturday at 20 to four, he can surprise me again. “He’ll look out of place in the paddock because he’s not over-big. He’s not muscular or anything but he’s an athlete. He’s got some engine on him. “This is what we’re in the game for. We’ve worked long and hard for years, the whole team has. Our team does as much prep as Aidan O’Brien’s but we just don’t have the calibre of horse. It would mean so much if we could go there and get a place on the day, it’d be lovely.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/04/baltimore-museum-art-warhol-artists-of-colour","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T14:20:39Z","webTitle":"Should a museum dump its Warhols to buy up work by artists of colour?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/04/baltimore-museum-art-warhol-artists-of-colour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/04/baltimore-museum-art-warhol-artists-of-colour","fields":{"headline":"Should a museum dump its Warhols to buy up work by artists of colour?","bodyText":"The sale of seven works by some of America’s best-known 20th-century artists has pushed a Baltimore art museum to the forefront of an international debate as to how the great publicly owned collections can thrive in a rapidly changing world. Paintings by Andy Warhol, Franz Kline, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski will be auctioned at Sotheby’s New York on 16-17 May. A Robert Rauschenberg mural and a second Warhol will be sold separately. It is hoped the “transformative” move will create a “war chest” of $12m (£8.8m) to fund acquisitions of more recent art, with a focus on work by women and artists of colour. In pushing through the sales, Baltimore Museum of Art’s Scotland-born director Christopher Bedford has squared up to one of the great taboos of the museum world: the disposal – “deaccession”, in art world parlance – of artefacts that are no longer needed or wanted, and could valuably be replaced with something else. All five artists whose work is up for sale are white and male and have other pieces in the Baltimore collection. Explaining the move to Artnet, Bedford said: “I don’t think it’s reasonable or appropriate for a museum like the BMA to speak to a city that is 64% black unless we reflect our constituents.” He added that the sale came at “a historically significant moment … in that the most important artists working today, in my view, are black Americans”. The massive overrepresentation of white, male artists is a problem the BMA shares with galleries all over the western world, and cuts to the heart of a UK museum heritage that grew out of 19th-century philanthropy, endowments and bequests. Recent research revealed that female artists account for just 4% of the National Gallery of Scotland’s collection, 20% of the Whitworth Manchester’s and 35% of that held by Tate Modern. When it comes to BME artists, the picture is even bleaker. Last week, Royal Museums Greenwich announced the acquisition of a painting by Kehinde Wiley, the African American artist who recently made headlines with his portrait of Barack Obama. Ship of Fools – modelled on a picture by Hieronymus Bosch – is the first painting by a known black artist to be bought by the museum, and the first Wiley work to enter a public collection in the UK. It will form a gang of two with Ship in Bottle, by the British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare, which went on permanent display outside the Greenwich museum after its stint on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. A bottled replica of Lord Nelson’s ship Victory, it was bought for Greenwich with the help of £264,300 raised through a public appeal. While most people agree that collections need to be allowed to grow and develop, the question of how – when museum budgets have been slashed in line with other public spending – is an emotive one, as Caroline Douglas, of the Contemporary Art Society, points out. The CAS was set up in 1910 to help fund public art acquisitions and has a budget of just under £400,000 to spread every year among 70 museums in England, Scotland and Wales. “[Bedford’s] statement about how the museum should represent a community is a conversation I’m having with a lot of museums, about how to speak to their cities,” said Douglas. “Many museums have no acquisitions budgets.” But she draws the line at deaccessioning. “It’s quite a red line. We give on condition that the museum never sells our gifts. Museums are the forever proposition – that’s why artists want to be in them,” she said. “My view is that we can’t wipe out our history but we need to keep on reflecting society, and use museums as great engines for rethinking that history.” Stephen Deuchar, of the Art Fund, which gave £40,000 towards the £122,000 cost of Ship of Fools, believes attitudes towards deaccessioning are changing, though it remains a thornier issue in the UK than in the US. “When I started out in the 1980s it was a word you couldn’t even use, but bit by bit that’s been eroded. It’s good that there is a real discussion and it’s now accepted, provided the museum does it in a proper way.” In part to stimulate that discussion, the Art Fund earlier this year published a report on museum collecting by the historian David Cannadine, which included case studies of good and bad deaccessioning. On the good side was the Imperial War Museum’s carefully planned sale from 2015 onwards of books, films, weapons and aircraft “where they were not significant to the collection or did not meet the museum’s remit”. On the bad side was the sale of an ancient Egyptian statue by Northampton Museum and Art Gallery to raise money for “key heritage and museum projects”. Despite an 11th-hour export bar, to enable a UK buyer time to come forward, the statue was released in 2016 to an anonymous buyer, believed to be from the US. As a mark of how seriously such infringements are taken, the museum’s owner, Northampton Borough Council, was stripped of its Arts Council accreditation and banished for five years from membership of the Museums Association. As Cannadine pointed out in his report, Why Collect?: “Although deaccessioning has ceased to be the taboo subject it largely remained in this country until the end of the 20th century, and has undoubtedly increased since then, most curators would prefer to add to their collections rather than diminish them.” But despite talk in museum circles about the importance of being dynamic and mobile, “it seems likely that many collections are not managed at all,” he wrote. “A significant proportion of acquisitions do not represent the deliberate and successful implementation of a carefully worked out and discerning policy, but instead result from the acceptance of what are often random gifts and bequests, or from a patriotic determination to ‘save’ for the nation a great work of art that has suddenly and unexpectedly been sent to auction, and which might be ‘lost’ if sold to a buyer from overseas.” Among those that have taken steps to implement a “discerning policy” are several small regional museums, including the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art (Mima), whose recent acquisitions include work by black British artists Keith Piper, Sonia Boyce and 2017 Turner prize winner Lubaina Himid. Mima, which has a collection of art and craft going back to 1900, describes itself as a “useful” museum “with a desire to develop civic agendas that reconnect the museum with its social function, promoting art as a tool for change”. Senior curator Elinor Morgan said: “Through acquisitions and long-term loans, we are making an effort to feature more historic and local pieces rarely seen in contemporary museums as well as more works by women artists, artists of colour, and those working internationally. In addition, we are challenging conventional models of showing art by mixing chronologies and styles, disciplines and media and histories.” But when it comes to selling off any of its existing 2,250 art works to fund this mission she is unequivocal. “As a sanctioned museum we cannot deaccession works.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/12/one-to-watch-amber-mark-conexao-sade","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"One to watch: Amber Mark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/12/one-to-watch-amber-mark-conexao-sade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/12/one-to-watch-amber-mark-conexao-sade","fields":{"headline":"One to watch: Amber Mark","bodyText":"Whether bossa nova or Indian classical, 24-year-old New York-based singer and producer Amber Mark’s work is imbued with sounds from around the world.

A two-and-a-half-hour meeting of the prime minister’s Brexit subcommittee ended without agreement on Wednesday, after the home secretary, Sajid Javid, sided with hardline Brexiters to reject a new customs partnership. Williamson, who was rapidly promoted from chief whip to defence secretary, was the least vocal of those expressing doubts about the customs partnership on Wednesday. “They’ll call him in and try to promise him something; they’ll ask him what his price is,” said one Whitehall source. The customs partnership, favoured by Downing Street, would see Britain collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf. Brexiters fear it would be bureaucratic for businesses and could limit the UK’s capacity to diverge from EU rules in future. But its backers, who include the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, believe it is the only plan that has a chance of avoiding a hard border in Ireland. Pro-Brexit ministers prefer the alternative of maximum facilitation, or “max fac”, in which technology would be used to minimise cumbersome border checks. Brussels has rejected both plans as unworkable in their present form. The government first outlined the two proposals last August, but the prime minister has yet to secure the backing of her cabinet colleagues for one plan. The resignation of ardent remainer Amber Rudd has left the Brexit inner cabinet deadlocked. No vote was taken on Wednesday, but insiders said six of the 11 members spoke against the customs partnership plan. The chief whip, Julian Smith, attends the meetings, but Downing Street said on Thursday he was there in a “non-voting capacity”. May faces another headache, however, getting either of the two customs options through the Commons. There were suggestions last night that she is considering delaying key bills until the autumn to try to avoid a damaging defeat. Smith was said to have warned the prime minister that she does not have the numbers needed to prevent around 20 Remainer Tory MPs siding with Labour to amend the customs bill and the trade bill to stay in the customs union. It would mean waiting until a final withdrawal deal is agreed at a Brussels summit in October before holding a Commons vote, which would leave only a short window to pass other major Brexit legislation before leaving the EU on 29 March next year. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s powerful backbench European Research Group, which sent the prime minister a 30-page report opposing her preferred plan, believes it has Williamson’s support against the customs partnership option, which Rees-Mogg has called “cretinous”. The defence secretary used a speech at the Churchill War Rooms earlier this week to argue that “in a post-Brexit world, our only limit will be our imagination”. Asked about support for the customs partnership, an ally of Williamson said: “Gavin will look at the options and do what he believes is the right thing for Britain.” The Brexit secretary, David Davis, told MPs on Thursday that both the government’s two options remained on the table. “Both of these approaches have merits and virtues, both have some drawbacks and that’s why we’re taking our time over the discussion on this,” he said. Whitehall officials are hastily working on refining both plans, despite the fact that one was rejected by May’s Brexit subcommittee. Davis has told allies he hopes to find a way through the cabinet impasse in the next week – though he doesn’t yet know how. The chancellor and business secretary have urged their colleagues to reach a resolution as soon as possible, or risk businesses losing confidence in being able to trade freely with the EU after Brexit. Downing Street sources acknowledged the “urgency” of reaching a conclusion about which approach the government will seek to negotiate with Brussels. Answering questions from MPs, Davis refused to set a deadline for choosing one of the two options. “It’s frankly incredibly important that we get this right, not just for trade but for the extremely sensitive issue of maintaining the peace process in Northern Ireland,” he told the Commons. “I don’t undertake to put an artificial deadline on something as important as that.” Privately, Davis backs the max fac option, though he has loyally kept both plans alive in public. He told MPs the customs partnership was “a brand new idea: it’s never been tested anywhere in the world”. The prime minister’s spokesman sought to play down the significance of Wednesday’s deadlock. “There’s an ongoing process of putting together the plans that will allow us to leave the EU in the smoothest possible way,” he said. Davis also reiterated the government’s commitment to leaving the customs union, a policy for which it is unclear whether May could command a majority in the Commons. Senior civil servants are believed to have told ministers that highly complex new technology for Britain’s borders will take years to be ready, meaning the UK will be unable to leave the customs union before 2023, prompting Brexiter fears the delay will be used to thwart Brexit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/03/we-honestly-believe-we-can-beat-real-madrid-says-liverpools-sadio-mane","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T23:25:00Z","webTitle":"Real Madrid should fear Liverpool in Champions League final, says Lovren","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/03/we-honestly-believe-we-can-beat-real-madrid-says-liverpools-sadio-mane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/03/we-honestly-believe-we-can-beat-real-madrid-says-liverpools-sadio-mane","fields":{"headline":"Real Madrid should fear Liverpool in Champions League final, says Lovren","bodyText":"Sadio Mané and Dejan Lovren have encapsulated the belief soaring through Liverpool by insisting Real Madrid hold no fear in the Champions League final and that the 12-times winners should be the team approaching the Kiev final with trepidation. Lovren thanked Jürgen Klopp for restoring Liverpool’s pride after the club reached an eighth European Cup final appearance with a 7-6 aggregate defeat of Roma. Mané, who opened the scoring in the semi-final second leg at Stadio Olimpico, described the result and tumultuous scenes that followed as among the greatest moments of his life. Both players were more focused on the final with Real on 26 May, however, and claimed a team that has scored 46 goals in this season’s competition will not have an inferiority complex against the European champions from three of the past four years. “Why should we fear them?” asked Lovren. “They should fear us. They are quite confident but we don’t care for that – we are focused on our job.” Mané expanded on the confidence that Liverpool possess under Klopp. “We honestly believe we can beat them,” the Senegal striker who, with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, is responsible for 31 of Liverpool’s 46 European goals this season, said. “I can say at this moment we do have a lot of respect for Madrid, they are one of the best teams in the world, but we are Liverpool – we are strong and we can beat any team in the world. We believe that. So we believe we can go there and beat them. We are going to go there and fight for the fans, for the club, fight without fear and win the final. We have the players. We can score goals, we have shown that and there is nothing to be afraid of for us.” Mané led the celebrations in front of Liverpool’s delirious 5,000 supporters following a tense finale in which Roma came within a goal of taking the semi-final to extra time. The 26‑year‑old said: “Honestly, I can’t believe that the dream has become true. It means so much to achieve this – everybody is happy now. It really is one of my best days. “It is one of my greatest moments in football. I can say that because this kind of moment you can’t say is there for every player. It happens for so few players, and for me I can say this is one of my greatest moments. I am very proud of what this team has achieved. Everybody was dancing like crazy. Everybody was so happy, dancing together, we enjoyed the moment together. It was special to be in that dressing room, such an incredible moment.” Liverpool have reached three finals since Klopp replaced Brendan Rodgers as manager in October 2015: the League Cup and Europa League in his first campaign and now European football’s elite competition in his third. Having lost the first two, and his past five finals in total, the Liverpool manager has backed his players to break that sequence against Zinédine Zidane’s reigning champions. Lovren insists the team have also regained their pride under the German, irrespective of the outcome in Kiev. “He has changed many things in the club, not just the players but things around the club - people, he has changed the mentality, how we think. Everything is more positive now. Even when we sometimes don’t play good he always finds something good and there is not negativity. “He deserves this.

His teaching career spanned being vice principal of Derby College of further education (1984-87), championing vocational subjects such as knitwear design and hairdressing, to being a consultant to the New Labour government (2003-07). I remember hearing as a teenager how he would stop on a long car journey to let David Blunkett’s guide dog out to answer a call of nature. From 1998 he spent much time as a member of the Nottingham and Notts Drama Association, arranging for notable actors such as Timothy West and Prunella Scales to speak. He had lead parts in, among others, Ladies’ Day by Amanda Whittington (2001), Improbable Fiction by Alan Ayckbourn, and Sheridan’s The School for Scandal (both 2008), at the Lace Market theatre. In 1994, his reviews won him, through the Barclays Theatre awards, a year of free tickets to every production in the East Midlands. He attended and wrote a review for every one. Jack was born in DH Lawrence’s home village of Eastwood, in Nottinghamshire, to Harry, a colliery engineer manager, and Barbara (nee Sims), a school secretary. The family moved around various mining villages until they settled in Cinderhill. Jack attended Henry Mellish grammar school (1956-63) and, aged 17, met Janet Radmore at a youth club. They continued their courtship via letters throughout his electrical engineering degree at Birmingham. Soon after graduating, in 1967, they married. Jack obtained a sponsored place at the Coal Board as a trainee engineer, but education called and he began lecturing in maths and engineering at Derby College while Janet worked as a secretary. In 1976 Jack gained an MSc in mathematical education at Loughborough University before becoming head of engineering technology (1980-84), then vice principal, of Derby. In 1987 he became principal of Hinckley College in Leicestershire. In the late 1990s Jack spent two years travelling around the East Midlands promoting the National Vocational Qualifications. He was known as the “blue tornado” for his sharp blue suits, easy manner and whip-smart solutions. He then took a senior position as an education adviser at the East Midlands Development Agency, which was abolished in 2012. From 2003 he worked as a freelance consultant to the New Labour government and was an Ofsted team inspector in mathematics. In retirement Jack was chair of the board of a number of primary schools, tutored local children and was a mentor to local headteachers in Nottingham. He was known as a kind and gregarious friend and colleague, fiercely loyal and generous. He was a staunch supporter of the NHS and was grateful for all it did for him. He is survived by Janet, by his children, Chris and me, and his granddaughters, Rose and Stella."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/may/04/my-1000-macbook-air-was-stolen-at-airport-security-and-no-one-cares","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-04T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"‘My £1,000 Macbook Air was stolen at airport security and no one cares’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/04/my-1000-macbook-air-was-stolen-at-airport-security-and-no-one-cares","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/04/my-1000-macbook-air-was-stolen-at-airport-security-and-no-one-cares","fields":{"headline":"‘My £1,000 Macbook Air was stolen at airport security and no one cares’","bodyText":"As travellers sling their wallets, purses, laptops, smartphones, keys and other valuables into the grey plastic tray heading into an airport security scanner, many have a slight frisson of fear. What if you’re held up and then find on the other side that someone has raided your tray? That’s what happened to student Fernanda Ardiles at London City airport – and to her shock, she found that even though the CCTV could have identified the thief who made off with her £1,000 MacBook Air, officials made no effort to pursue him. Ardiles is desperately upset as the laptop contained vital work for the dissertation she has to deliver – and, in a cruel twist, it is now being held to ransom by the thief. Ardiles, who is studying in Utrecht, in the Netherlands, was travelling home after an Easter break with her parents in London when long delays at the airport meant her bag and MacBook Air went through the security scanner far quicker than she did. She had to wait several minutes to pass through the personal scanner and when she finally caught up with her trays she was horrified to see her laptop was not there. But rather than getting on the case immediately, she says London City airport staff said they would only contact her when they had reviewed the CCTV footage, long after both she and the thief had taken off. Staff at the airport, which specialises in short-haul flights, eventually examined the footage and established that a man stole her laptop, but have done nothing with that information. She has been refused access to footage identifying the crook because of data protection rules. Instead officials have said it is up to her to make a complaint to police and that they will then comply with any CCTV request the police make. Her case will resonate with anyone who has wondered how safe their items are as they proceed through airport security screening. Staff insist that laptops and tablets must be removed from bags and placed openly in trays but, judging by Ardiles’ experience, appear to take no responsibility for them. Passengers sounding the buzzer and facing a subsequent patdown can be a long way away from their items for several minutes, and there is nothing they can do about it. Ardiles says she was shocked that the airport did not appear to have a procedure for dealing with thefts. “After I’d been waiting 10 minutes another Apple laptop emerged which I assumed was mine. However, it soon became clear it wasn’t so I returned to the desk where its owner was waiting. Staff told me to be patient, but mine just didn’t turn up. It ended with them assuring me that they would watch the CCTV footage, and that they would be in touch. After three days of emails I finally got hold of the terminal manager who said there was nothing he could do, but pass it on for investigation. “They have behaved as though this is a minor irritation, as though it is no big deal.” She wants to know how an airport can insist that passengers follow its strict procedures but then decline to help, or to take any responsibility if its system breaks down. “My father was travelling through Gatwick a few days after the incident and inquired as to what would have happened had his laptop gone missing. He was told that staff would quickly examine the CCTV footage in an office next to the security line. Why doesn’t City airport have a similar system in place?” she says. The pain is made worse by the ransom note she received from the thief. She had remotely shut the Apple Mac down and left a message stating that she needed it back as it contained vital dissertation and other work, and would pay a reward for its return. A spokesman for City airport told Guardian Money: “We were sorry to hear of Miss Ardiles’ experience, and the subsequent separation from her laptop. “Theft of items at security is a very rare occurrence and where items are taken by other passengers it is usually in error, and the items can be reunited with their owners. “The security screening is a compulsory legal requirement. The team of security officials that oversee passenger screening act in full compliance with the regulations set and audited by the Civil Aviation Authority and other authorities, and do their very best to ensure unauthorised interference does not happen. When a crime has been committed at the airport, the passenger should report this to the Metropolitan police to investigate, with the airport’s full cooperation.” Meanwhile, Ardiles has been forced to buy another computer to enable her to finish her studies. Insurance paid £500 leaving her with a similar loss, which City airport has refused to refund. How secure is airport security? UK airports have differing attitudes to thefts that take place in security and, as this case suggests, they will probably try to decline claims for compensation if you are a victim. Heathrow told Money that a passenger would be helped in this instance and the matter would be quickly referred to Metropolitan police who are permanently on site. Stansted says that following a theft, the matter is immediately referred to the police. Gatwick failed to respond. However, Manchester and Luton both told Money that they had no set procedure and it was up to the passenger to call police themselves. The airports have been coy about how many thefts take place from security screen trays. The CAA said the security screening rules are set by the government but it is up to airports how they operate them. It has been alleged that gangs in the US target air passengers going through security homing in on the unwary, and moving in behind them in queues. It has been claimed there are two thefts a week from security trays at Miami airport. The advice is to keep wallets and phones out if sight, ideally in zipped pockets, and to watch laptops like a hawk – if you can. The Ardiles case suggests victims of similar thefts should immediately get the police involved, rather than be fobbed off by airport staff. Difficult, of course, if you have only a few minutes to catch the flight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/jul/14/secret-to-healthy-relationships-during-menopause","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-14T08:30:34Z","webTitle":"The secret to… healthy relationships during menopause","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/14/secret-to-healthy-relationships-during-menopause","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jul/14/secret-to-healthy-relationships-during-menopause","fields":{"headline":"The secret to… healthy relationships during menopause","bodyText":"Tell people how you’re feeling. Every woman’s experience of menopause is different. Understand how it may be affecting you – make notes, if that helps. Others can’t read your mind, so be open with them. It may be that you just need a little more understanding, or have a simple request that will make a huge difference. Different people will be able to support you in different ways. Give it a name. When you’re in an irritable mood, try saying, “It’s not you, it’s the menopause.” This can help others cope more constructively than if they think you’re withholding something from them. If you’re feeling angry, take time out and just be by yourself for a while. Accept that men often need support, too. They know something’s different or have been on the whip-end of a mood swing but don’t know what to do. Talking openly about it can be a huge relief for them, so they understand it’s the menopause, and not something they’ve done wrong. Enlist their help and let them give you any support you need. Enlist the help of friends, work colleagues and bosses. The more everyone talks about menopause openly, the better for all. You may find many are glad you mentioned it because it’s something they wanted to talk about. Start the conversation and you could be pleasantly surprised. Don’t forget your children. Menopause is a natural stage, not often talked about. Why hush it up? As long as your children are old enough to understand it, talk about the facts and what you’re experiencing. Treat it as a part of life rather than a mystery.

To fish, the tribe use timbó, a toxic vine that reduces the concentration of oxygen in the water, forcing the fish to come to the surface, where they are shot with arrows. “If we use hooks to fish, only one of our families will eat fish,” explains former tribal chief Onkray Xikrin. “But with timbó the whole village can eat.” But the River Cateté is dying, and with it the way of life of the Xikrin. In 2010 Mineração Onça Puma, a company owned by the mining company Vale, began extracting nickel in the nearby hills, which have tributaries flowing into the Cateté. Vale is one of the world’s largest producers of nickel. Around this time, the Xikrin who were diving into the river say they began suffering itchy skin and burning eyes. The tribe also noticed a decline in the quantity and diversity of fish. In 2015, tests by a professor at the Federal University of Pará found traces of nickel in the sediment of the river at almost double the safe level downstream from the mines, but no trace upstream. The tests also found unsafe levels of iron, chromium and copper. Now federal prosecutors are battling to have the operations of Mineração Onça Puma – which processes the ore at a plant less than four miles from the territory of the Xikrin – shut down. They are also seeking 50 million Brazilian reais (£10.4m) in compensation for each of the seven affected villages. The Xikrin fought for 14 years for the demarcation of their territory, a Brazilian constitutional right that protects their land from exploitation. By the time the demarcation was ratified in 1991, loggers had felled much of the mahogany in the region. Miners were also active, with high-quality iron to be found to the east, the largest copper reserves in Brazil to the north, and exceptional nickel to the west. Nearby, in 1985, Vale established what is now S11D, the largest iron ore mine in the world. Much of this took place on land that had been originally claimed by the Xikrin. But when the demarcation was ratified, 13,000 of those hectares (321,23 acres) were not included. The nickel mines in the Onça mountain range are permitted as they are not officially in the indigenous territory. But the area is home to the Xikrin cemetery, a place where the dead meet to sing and dance for eternity, according to their culture. Anthropologist Lux Vidal, emeritus professor at the University of São Paulo and a pioneer in Xikrin studies, says it was known at that time that nickel might be extracted there. “Geologists, especially Canadian geologists I met, told me: ‘This area to the west is an area designed for nickel. Nickel is the worst of things that can happen. It is the most polluting ore, the most lethal ore there can be.’” In those mountains, two streams begin that flow into the River Cateté. When it rains heavily during the Amazonian winter – between October and April – the water brings sediment and mud from the hillside, turning its waters an earthy red. One stream flows into the Cateté just 500m from the indigenous territory. When the Xikrin began to suffer headaches, skin irritations and food poisoning in 2013, it was a doctor from the university of São Paulo who told them to avoid the river. Dr João Paulo Botelho Vieira Filho first met the tribe when he went to vaccinate them to prevent their possible extinction: at that time, only 93 tribe members remained after the population had been decimated by epidemics contracted from outsiders. The doctor believed the heavy metals had caused many health problems for the Xikrin, including an unprecedented wave of births defects. “The river is dead. If nothing is done, we are on the verge of a chemical ethnocide,” he says. But many of the Xikrin continue to bathe in the river – abandoning it would mean severing ties with their history and culture. Now the fate of the mines is in the hands of Brazil’s notoriously bureaucratic court system. Federal courts have ordered the mine to cease activities on three occasions, but the enterprise continues to function after Vale obtained injunctions. The last time it was shut was in 2017, with Vale – for now – allowed to continue operating only the beneficiation part of the extraction process, which improves the economic value of the ore. In a statement, the company said: “Vale complies with the law. The company does not use any of the elements identified by [prosecutors] as causing pollution in the Cateté river. All of the reports presented prove this and Vale will show this in court.” Vale does not dispute that pollution exists but says it might be from farming pesticides or illegal miners nearby. In a report for investors to Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission, the firm admitted that losing the case could mean facing “a considerable financial impact” and “the cessation of operations at the Onça Puma mine”. This report was produced by Agência Pública, a non-profit investigative journalism agency based in Brazil.
