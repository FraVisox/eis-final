Around 261,000 people will share in a £1.8bn payout after Equitable said it would transfer its business to a separate insurer, Reliance Life, and unlock the capital tied up in funds. The windfalls will mean that those customers who clung on after Equitable nearly went bust in 2000 will eventually see a profit on their policies. But around 800,000 former policyholders who were shifted to other providers or encouraged to cash in and accept their losses will not get anything. Paul Braithwaite, whose Equitable Members Action Group has led an 18-year campaign for compensation, said policyholders who left Equitable still remain £2.5bn out of pocket. “Equitable has crafted an elegant termination strategy for the small number of remaining members, but it will be no benefit to the vast majority of victims. “If the remaining members vote in favour of this deal, they they are likely to come out ahead. But for every one of them, there are five who left the society who are much worse off.” Existing members will be asked to vote on the deal in mid-2019 with payouts towards the end of the year. Equitable chief executive, Chris Wiscarson, said: “When the Equitable closed to new business in 2000, it was inevitable that at some point the society had to come to an end. The benefit of bringing Equitable to an end sooner rather than later is that we can capture for with-profits policyholders the near-record high values of the investments backing their policies.” The payouts will bring to a close two decades of disaster for Equitable Life, which was founded in 1762 and grew to become the country’s second largest life insurer. But decades of excessive payouts and reckless guarantees on policies eventually led to its downfall. It found itself locked into paying out high interest rates promised at a time of high inflation in the 1970s. But when inflation and interest rates fell, Equitable found it hard to fund those commitments, leaving a £4.4bn hole in its accounts. In 2004, a report by Lord Penrose accused the former Equitable management team of “dubious” practices and nurturing a “culture of manipulation and concealment”. Between 2006 and 2007 Equitable transferred hundreds of thousands of policyholders to Canada Life and Prudential, while a highly critical European parliament investigation demand compensation for victims. In 2009 former Avengers star and Bond girl Honor Blackman added her voice to protests demanding government compensation in a demonstration outside the Houses of Parliament, at which 15 wooden coffins were borne aloft to symbolise the 15 Equitable Life pensioners who die each day, “waiting for justice”. By 2010 the government agreed a £1.5bn compensation package, mostly aimed at 37,000 elderly annuitants who had “suffered most”. But EMAG said the total compensation figure should be closer to £4bn, and continues its fight for justice, with a new website for victims launched just this week. “The Treasury has run an attrition strategy, cynically depending on people walking away, dying or just giving up. But we will continue to pursue our case for the £2.5bn outstanding, and we have the support of 233 MPs,” said Braithwaite. So how has Equitable been able to afford windfall payouts after decades of disatrous financial management? In many ways it has been saved by the collapse in interest rates since the great financial crash, which has made its bond investments more valuable. When Equitable nearly went bust in 2000 it moved the vast majority of its money into bonds, whose underlying capital values have risen as interest rates have fallen, allowing the insurer to finance the payouts. The windfalls will be added to Equitable’s policies and then transferred to Reliance Life, part of the £24bn US-backed Life Company Consolidation Group, which specialises in buying up so-called zombie funds which have closed to new business."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-snps-protests-signs-of-weakness-and-strength","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T17:30:36Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the SNP’s protests: signs of weakness and strength | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-snps-protests-signs-of-weakness-and-strength","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-snps-protests-signs-of-weakness-and-strength","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the SNP’s protests: signs of weakness and strength","bodyText":"Scotland was short-changed in this week’s Commons debates on changes to the EU withdrawal bill. Because of the way the timetable for debate operated, less than 20 minutes of the 12 hours set aside for the bill was devoted to the devolution impact in Scotland and Wales. MPs from all sides were angry about that, and rightly so. On Wednesday, the SNP’s Commons leader, Ian Blackford, duly got himself thrown out of the chamber for his protests, taking all the SNP MPs with him, triggering some much-needed good headlines and a surge of new members for his party. On Thursday Mr Blackford promised more parliamentary guerrilla tactics. There is a big hinterland to this week’s row. Almost no part of it is anything like as black and white as the issue of the absurdly short time allowed for the parliamentary debate, on which Mr Blackford was right to protest. The SNP walkout – a tactic straight out of the 19th-century Irish home rule party playbook on Westminster obstruction – was a bit of a stunt. It has given Mr Blackford and his MPs some visibility they have lacked over the past year. But there are serious issues in Scottish politics that cannot be dismissed as gestures. The UK voted narrowly for Brexit, while Scotland voted emphatically against it. The SNP’s initial hope was that this disjunction would boost support for independence. Things have not turned out that way. Though support for independence remains at roughly 45% and backing for the SNP as Scotland’s main governing party is still strong, Scottish opinion has been reluctant to use Brexit as a reason for a new independence vote. A recent Scottish social attitudes survey revealed one possible explanation: three out of five Scots are in some way Eurosceptic rather than Europhile. Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon’s standing has fallen to its lowest level since she became first minister. Her most important task at present is to persuade more Scots that she has other domestic policy priorities beyond independence. SNP leaders are under pressure from activists to have a second poll. In recent months they have switched their focus from opposing Brexit to opposing the UK’s handling of the return of EU powers to the devolved governments. UK ministers protest that 129 of 153 returning powers are being passed straight back to the Holyrood institutions, with the other 24 temporarily retained and no decision-making power removed from Scotland. Wales, moreover, has agreed to this arrangement. But the SNP has had success in casting this as a Westminster “power grab”. It has enlisted the support of all the main Scottish parties at Holyrood bar Ruth Davidson’s Conservatives. This week’s Commons walkout is part of that campaign too, as was Thursday’s effort by Mr Blackford to allege that UK ministers have “shafted” the so-called Sewel convention on whether Westminster can legislate on devolved matters. That issue will now be debated – for three hours – in the Commons on Monday. The most striking feature of Scottish politics at present remains the resilience of the SNP in the face of serious political difficulties. At its recent conference in Aberdeen, the SNP was divided over the conservative fiscal policy in its recent growth commission report, while support for independence is stalled and Ms Sturgeon has lost some lustre, especially compared with Ms Davidson. But voters clearly think the nationalists still speak more credibly for Scotland than any of the alternatives. Considering that the SNP has been in power for 11 years, its continuing ascendancy is a remarkable achievement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/14/russia-saudi-arabia-world-cup-2018-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T19:34:00Z","webTitle":"Russia coast past Saudi Arabia and leave them all smiling in Putin’s place","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/14/russia-saudi-arabia-world-cup-2018-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/14/russia-saudi-arabia-world-cup-2018-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Russia coast past Saudi Arabia and leave them all smiling in Putin’s place","bodyText":"After all the negative talk in the lead-up, and the inescapable sense of unease that this opening match could turn into a humiliating experience for the host nation, it was tempting to wonder what all the fuss was about after Russia got the tournament started with an emphatic victory that was every bit as comfortable as the scoreline suggests. The lowest-ranked team in the tournament – Saudi Arabia will surely assume that title by the time these finals are over – registered their first win in eight matches to put a smile on the face of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and allay those fears that a home World Cup would be some sort of ordeal for Stanislav Cherchesov and his players. That they were playing Saudi Arabia clearly helped. Juan Antonio Pizzi’s team looked hopelessly out of their depth and it is difficult to overstate just how poorly they performed, in particular in defence, where they were a danger to themselves almost every time Russia attacked. Aleksandr Golovin, the gifted CSKA Moscow midfielder, set up two goals and dispatched a fine free-kick with the last kick of the game but the best performer was Denis Cheryshev, who came off the bench to score twice, with his second a wonderful arcing lob with the outside of his left boot that is sure to be shown over and over again during the coming days. Artem Dzyuba, who had pleaded with the Russian press only 24 hours before the game to stop being so critical of the team, was also on the scoresheet moments after his introduction as a substitute, with the other goal scored by Yuri Gazinskiy only 12 minutes into a game that could not end quickly enough for Saudi Arabia. It is a measure of how bad Saudi Arabia were that Pizzi was asked after the game whether he was worried about his future, mindful of the fact that managers tend not to hang around long in a country which has made around 40 coaching changes since 1994 and three in as many months last year. Questions have also been asked about whether Cherchesov is the right man for Russia but this resounding win was the perfect response and drew personal praise from Putin. “The head of state called me with congratulations and asked me to share thanks with the team and to keep playing like that,” the manager revealed. The only blemish on the evening from Russia’s point of view was a potentially serious injury to Alan Dzagoev, who pulled up abruptly with a hamstring problem midway through the first half. One of Russia’s most influential players, the midfielder was in agony and clearly upset. “He was in severe pain. His injury could be quite unpleasant and he could [be out of] the tournament,” Cherchesov said. The contribution of Cheryshev, who replaced Dzagoev in a change that led to Golovin playing in a more advanced attacking role through the centre, suggests that Russia may have a more than able deputy within the squad, with the Villarreal winger hugely impressive on the left. Saudi Arabia, however, were obliging opponents throughout and it was alarming just how easily Russia were able to prise them open on the counter-attack, pretty much whenever they seized possession. Remarkably Saudi had 61% of the ball, yet they generally passed with little purpose and were always vulnerable to being caught on the break. The manner with which Gazinskiy gave Russia the lead rather set the tone. Golovin delivered an inswinging cross from the left, after Saudi had failed to clear a corner, and two Russia players were waiting to head home at the far post. Gazinskiy accepted the invitation after Tassir al-Jassim lost his footing and Russia never looked back. Although Saudi’s defending was also awful in the lead-up to Russia’s second goal, there was still much to admire about the way Cheryshev dispatched his chance. Roman Zobnin, teed up by Golovin, sold the substitute a little short with a square pass that encouraged two defenders, Osama Hawsawi and Mohammed al-Burayk, to charge across the area and try to block Cheryshev. What followed was a lovely piece of skill as he dummied to shoot, leaving Hawasi and Burayk on their backsides before thumping a rising left-foot shot inside the near post. By the time the unmarked Dzyuba headed back across goal for Russia’s third, the game had turned into an exercise in damage limitation for Saudi Arabia, who failed to register a single shot on target. Russia, however, were not finished and added two more goals in injury-time. Cheryshev, running into the area and expertly flicking the ball over the head of Abdullah al-Mayouf, got the fourth and Golovin, with a curling free-kick that beat the goalkeeper at his near post, completed the scoring. Russia now move on to St Petersburg to face Egypt next Tuesday with a spring in their step. Saudi Arabia, in contrast, have some soul-searching to do before facing Uruguay in Rostov later the same day. “They have won by a landslide – but not by doing much,” Pizzi added. “It’s our poor performance that explains the result.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/14/uk-sport-funding-policy-needs-change","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T17:09:12Z","webTitle":"UK Sport funding policy needs change | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/14/uk-sport-funding-policy-needs-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/14/uk-sport-funding-policy-needs-change","fields":{"headline":"UK Sport funding policy needs change","bodyText":"The athletes within the sports cast aside by UK Sport’s current investment policy have little hope for change as UK Sport looks ahead to Paris 2024 (Grainger warns cuts will hit medal haul, Sport, 5 June). Under the heading of “Future Strategy”, the wording of UK Sport’s live consultation survey on future funding for Olympic and Paralympic sport illustrates that there is little appetite for change. Its assertion that “with a fixed amount of investment to distribute to sports, a change to the current investment policy such as an equal distribution of funding for all sports could have direct consequences” seems designed to create fear that there will be a total collapse of the UK medal tally should the current funding model be meddled with. A number of unfunded Olympic and Paralympic sports have championed the principle that every sport matters and have attempted to establish a constructive dialogue with UK Sport. During those discussions, we have never suggested all sports should be equally funded. But we do believe that giving many millions of pounds to some sports but none to others is divisive and will prove self-defeating. We think the British public believes in fairness and equality of opportunity, and the best way to achieve this is to provide at least a baseline level of funding to all Olympic and Paralympic sports. We are confident that this can be achieved without sacrificing current medal success. We call upon the public, in responding to the UK Sport consultation, to support a change to the current funding system to one that creates a new, bold, inclusive goal to underpin the next 20-plus years of participation in the Olympic and Paralympic Games: more sports (represented), more athletes (qualified) and more medals (won across more sports).

An authorised John Gotti biopic, eight years in the making, starring John Travolta as the late mob boss, the film has weathered more bust-ups than many a low-rent mafioso. It passed through the hands of multiple directors, including Oscar winner Barry Levinson, before trickling down to Kevin Connolly, the maestro perhaps better known for playing Eric “E” Murphy on the HBO bro-fest Entourage. (Yes, he’s made films before: who could forget 2007’s Gardener of Eden, a Tribeca premiere still awaiting reviews on Rotten Tomatoes?) Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Lindsay Lohan all flitted in and out of the ensemble. And last year, 10 days away from its scheduled opening through distributor Lionsgate, the film was pulled: producers, deciding they wanted a wider release than the one the studio cautiously had in mind, exercised the buy-back clause in their contract. As an industry rule, this kind of Hollywood backstory does not tend to augur an artistic triumph, even with the fairytale twist of Gotti securing a last-minute premiere slot at the Cannes film festival. (More on that dubious turn of events later.) And unless you’ve come to Gotti for anything but the bizarre quasi-camp spectacle of Travolta channelling the Teflon Don via Tony Soprano via the Dolmio dad – in a truly dazzling array of crunchy-looking wigs – it’s fair to say Connolly’s lurid Noo Yawk story doesn’t disappoint. But its failings are rich and varied, minor and major; just as Gotti himself eventually went down on 13 charges ranging in severity, let’s list the film’s offences in roughly ascending order of egregiousness. Punctuational negligence Yes, we’re starting small, but it’s a nagging error all the same: natural-born proofreaders will note that hyphens have gone awol from the film’s opening credits for its numerous “co producers” and “co executive producers”. Admittedly, Gotti is not a film overly preoccupied with the niceties of language, but this does not bode well for its sweating of the larger stuff. Geographical infidelity “Lemme tell you summin’ – New York is the greatest fuckin’ city in the world … my city.” These are the first words Travolta-as-Gotti mushmouths in the film, turning toward the camera from a nighttime view of the Brooklyn Bridge that looks awfully rear-projected. (Immediately afterwards, he tells us he’s speaking from beyond the grave, so perhaps that’s what the Big Apple looks like from his undead purgatory, but let’s tackle one problem at a time.) This tour guide introduction, further accompanied by establishing shots of subways and the East river, may be pure processed cheese, but it’s also the clearest indication we get of where the film’s set: shot predominantly in Cincinnati, against a rotating backdrop of anonymous suburban blocks and brown back alleys, it evokes Gotti’s beloved city about as authentically as Taylor Swift’s Welcome to New York. Later, when a mobster alludes to “the support of all five boroughs”, the script actually makes him list them, just to be sure. Prosthetic inconsistency Give Travolta this: he goes through a journey in this film, playing Gotti from a 30-year-old underworld underling in soft lighting and a vinyl-like hairpiece to a bald, cancer-riddled septuagenarian with, in his own parlance, a “tit” surgically sewn on to his chin. The makeup team see him through with flamboyant enthusiasm – so why does Spencer Lofranco, the swaggering 25-year-old tasked with playing Gotti’s eldest son and criminal heir, not benefit from any of their attention? Lofranco changes not a whit as he plays Gotti Jr from advanced-looking teendom to baby-faced middle age, oddly saddled most of the way with a Macklemore-style undercut that his real-life counterpart never had to begin with. The film’s flip-flopping timeline is messy enough as it is: at least age your characters at the same pace. Casting-department nepotism No surprise that Gotti is not rich in well-developed female characters, and the role of Gotti’s wife Victoria, running the gamut from shrill to pill-popping to shrill again, is not one that would have leading actresses queueing around the block. So you could say Travolta’s wife, Kelly Preston, making her first big-screen appearance in eight years, did hubby a solid by taking it on. Either way, neither she nor the role are helping each other: her tactic of slavish Lorraine Bracco impersonation is a thin one, though given how the film around her is throwing Goodfellas poses in the mirror, she’s at least on-message. Irresponsible Pitbull handling Yes, Connolly’s Scorsese karaoke routine may extend to a jukebox-rock soundtrack running the gamut from Aretha Franklin to Duran Duran, but that hasn’t stopped the director enlisting the services of Armando Cristiano Pérez – better known to Top 40 pop-rap aficionados as Pitbull – to compose the film’s score, throwing a few of his own numbers into the stew. What Latin hip-hop has to do with the world of Gotti is open to question, but then you could say the same of Kevin Connolly or Kelly Preston: embrace the fusion. Alas, there’s no shootout staged to Pitbull’s jolly Kesha duet Timber, and his original rhymes find him dourly off his debatable game: “There’s rules and codes / Won’t break ’em for no one / Unless you’re a fool / Like that fucking prick Sammy the Bull,” he spits over the opening credits. Against such songsmithery, we’ll let his instrumental scoring slide, though much of it evokes a Casio keyboard on the funk-porn setting. Croisette coercion The Cannes film festival has lent its official stamp of gilded prestige to some dubious films in the best of years – hello there, Grace of Monaco – but perhaps never one quite as shonky as Gotti, which eventually got quietly shuffled into the lineup mid-festival, discreet and embarrassing as a silent fart in an elevator. Cannes did its best to downplay its presence – it was given a single screening in one of the festival’s smallest screening venues, with no press show or red carpet preamble – but there it was anyway, with festival director Thierry Frémaux grimly introducing Travolta and John Gotti Jr as guests of honour. What gives? Could it have anything to do with the festival already having scheduled a master class and beachside Grease screening with Travolta? Did the star, also one of the film’s producers, suddenly add an official premiere to his festival rider? Hard not to smell an underhand power play worthy of Gotti himself. Travolta terribility As they say in Scientological circles, Xenu loves a trier, and he must love Travolta more than most: 40-plus years and multiple comebacks into his career, the star’s still lovably chugging away, giving his all to projects that don’t even deserve his quarter. He’s been dynamite in roles that play on his dorky-cool magnetism, but never as a pure hardman: as Gotti, he poses as unconvincingly as he did as a hench hitman in From Paris With Love, pursing his lips to denote steely conviction and blitzing vowels into a Mickey Blue Eyes drawl (“Ah’ll pock a bus up yo’ ass fockin’ sidewez”) that belies his own nearby New Jersey origins. As we also saw recently with his wobbly Robert Shapiro in The People vs OJ Simpson, biographical impression is not where Travolta’s twinkly talent lies. Grievous hagiography Finally, Gotti’s shabby aesthetic and narrative shortcomings are outweighed by its more drastically questionable moral ones. Connolly’s film may be the first mainstream mafia biopic to overtly take the underworld’s side in its rise-and-fall story: a sympathetic stance was to be expected given that it’s adapted from Gotti Jr’s own self-published memoir, but it’s still somewhat startling to see the film-makers fully buying their subject’s account of events, from its portrayal of Gotti as a doting family man, the bulk of whose criminal acts are kept off-screen, to its chastisement of the government for alleged ill-treatment of the Gottis during their respective trials, to an inadvertently hilarious closing montage of real-life supporters singing the Don’s praises (“Everybody knows he was a good man”). And that’s before our man Pitbull conclusively raps his praises as the credits roll: “Dapper Don / I called him Dad / Giant in my eyes / Legend of a man”. If a certain other contentiously powerful New Yorker is commissioning a biopic any time soon, he might want to check this out – Travolta as Trump, anyone? Gotti is now available in the US and will be released in the UK on 17 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/24/room-to-dream-david-lynch-biography-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"Room to Dream by David Lynch and Kristine McKenna – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/24/room-to-dream-david-lynch-biography-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/24/room-to-dream-david-lynch-biography-review","fields":{"headline":"Room to Dream by David Lynch and Kristine McKenna – review","bodyText":"A few years back I interviewed David Lynch at his lithographic studio in Paris. The film-maker sat at an ink-splattered table in a sky-blue smock. He was courteous and serene and blithely unrevealing about his life and his work – keen to present himself as an unconscious translator of pre-existing ideas, or an angler at the water’s edge, waiting for something to bite. “You don’t make the fish, you catch the fish,” he explained patiently. “Now you can cook it in a good way or a bad way, but that’s as far as it goes.” The hour flew by in a haze of happy abstractions. I came away thinking that while I’d genuinely enjoyed meeting the man, I could not say for sure who it was that I’d met. Now along comes Room to Dream, a hybrid biography bulging with more than 100 interviews (everyone from Sting to Isabella Rossellini), to give a fuller picture and a finer grain. Written by Lynch in collaboration with the journalist Kristine McKenna, it shows us Lynch the artist, the director, the lover, the child, skipping from his boyhood in Idaho and across his four marriages, 23 exhibitions, eight studio albums and 35 movie credits. Which is another way of saying that the book’s waters run wide but not necessarily deep. Room to Dream provides contours and edges, brief splashes of insight and teasing tugs on the line. But the man at the centre remains a beautiful mystery. How reassuring it is when the art and the artist appear to be in snug sympathy; when film-makers conveniently embody the films they make. Martin Scorsese in person is a ball of nervous energy. Jim Jarmusch is languid and studied and self-consciously cool. And yet Lynch has always been a different kettle of fish: a wholesome, strait-laced Norman Rockwell-type who produces the cinematic equivalent of Goya’s black paintings. He’s like the white picket fence at the start of Blue Velvet. Behind that placid facade, the horrors are lurking. Lynch’s finest work contains themes of doubling and twinning. Fred Madison wakes up as Pete Dayton in the undervalued Lost Highway. Two women arguably play the same character in 2001’s Mulholland Drive. So it’s fitting that Room to Dream should be structured as a series of alternating chapters, with Lynch and McKenna passing the narrative back and forth like a baton. First the journalist maps out the terrain, interviews the witnesses and outlines the basic story. Then the artist steps in to add personal colour and detail. “What you’re reading here is basically a person having a conversation with his own biography,” McKenna explains in the prologue. In a Lynch picture, I suspect this exchange would eventually pitch towards chaos. There would be discrepancies, competing frequencies and casual asides that then take on a darker significance. But here the biographer and her subject steer a largely parallel course, intent on accentuating the positive every chance they have. Figuratively, at least, these two are on the same page. Room to Dream, then, is at its most illuminating when it focuses on the nuts and bolts of the director’s work; charting his ascent from a gawky art student to “a brand and an adjective”. McKenna recounts how the director’s apprenticeship in depressed, crime-ridden Philadelphia provided the “rich mulch for Lynch’s imagination” that would eventually bear fruit in his 1977 breakthrough Eraserhead, and how his fascination with the OJ Simpson trial sparked the existential noir of Lost Highway. Along the way, though, the man sporadically breaks cover or is briefly hooked on the line. Lynch, we learn in passing, once suffered from anger-management issues until transcendental meditation ironed out the kinks in his system. Elsewhere, he admits to being fascinated by blood and bone and body parts. He insists on being present at the birth of his first child because “I wanted to see it just to see”. He buys mackerel from the fishmonger so he can dissect them at home. On learning that producer Raffaella De Laurentiis is to have a hysterectomy, he promptly requests that she give him her uterus. “I’m obsessed with textures,” he explains at one point. “What the average person sees as grotesque isn’t grotesque to me.” It’s tempting to read these passages as evidence of hidden depths or even latent sociopathy; some motivating factor behind the twisted films that he makes. Except that maybe this interpretation misses the essential nature of the man. Tellingly, Lynch and McKenna choose to airily fold these instances alongside all the book’s other elements, rustling up a sunny, holistic portrait of a corn-fed American dreamer who simply likes to show his nightmares to the world. Lynch emerges from these pages as principled, flighty and resolutely incurious about his own inner workings. He’s constantly chasing the next big idea or the next regenerative love affair, reluctant to pause and unpick his decisions, at least for public consumption, away from the meditation mat. The world is a mystery and his films live in darkness. He’s prepared to tell us how they happened but he’s not about to tell us why. “David has the ability to put things in closets in his mind and [either] deal or not deal with them on his own terms,” says his friend, the music supervisor Dean Hurley. “He’s got a mastery of his own mind and the world’s best poker face.” • Room to Dream by David Lynch and Kristine McKenna is published by Canongate (£25).

Anyway, what a sensational effort from the Spaniards to sack their manager before a ball had been even been kicked in anger or a player booked for simulation. The reaction of the Spanish press to the news that Julen Lopetegui had signed on as Real Madrid manager (is there a better definition of a poisoned chalice?) has been greeted with anything other than equanimity. El País reacted thus: “Contracts in football may be made of Plasticine, but two days before a World Cup, you cannot risk being seen as a pyromaniac in your own home.” Worthy, I think you’ll agree, as a contender for mangled metaphor of the week. Not to be outdone, El Mundo thundered: “This is a crime against the state, against public order, because one club can never torpedo the flagship of Spanish football.” For unbridled use of hyperbole, another award winner. Most damningly of all, Lopetegui was described as a “former journeyman goalkeeper”. Which is deeply unfair to true journeymen. I was reminded of their true worth when talking to a master carpenter recently, who wore his previous tag of journeyman with considerable pride. He had been taken on as an apprentice carpenter and over many years had become a master of his trade, learning ancillary skills along the way. He rightly bemoaned the fact that this definition of the word has been superseded by the more commonplace meaning we have now, of a plodder, someone able without being inspired, dull but dependable. Nothing at all like the master carpenter, in truth. Anyway, back to the football. Try this for size from England’s Dele Alli: “When you’ve got the Three Lions on your jersey, you’ll play anywhere you’re needed. It’s the battleground.” Not fully Iberian in its intensity, but a damned fine piece of homegrown nonsense, nonetheless."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/15/nhs-can-drop-dozens-of-unnecessary-tests-and-treatments-say-doctors","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T23:01:02Z","webTitle":"NHS can drop dozens of unnecessary tests and treatments, say doctors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/nhs-can-drop-dozens-of-unnecessary-tests-and-treatments-say-doctors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/15/nhs-can-drop-dozens-of-unnecessary-tests-and-treatments-say-doctors","fields":{"headline":"NHS can drop dozens of unnecessary tests and treatments, say doctors","bodyText":"Patients with sore backs should no longer have x-rays, women who are on the pill should be given a year-long supply and older people should no longer get antibiotics at the end of their lives, according to new advice drawn up by doctors. In addition, not just children and older people but everyone should take vitamin D supplements over the winter to reduce their risk of developing colds and flu, it says. The move could prompt claims that the health service is increasingly rationing provision in order to save money. The recommendations are part of a list of 50 tests, procedures and treatments that doctors’ leaders want the NHS to stop undertaking because they say they have little or no value and in some cases harm patients. In some cases doing nothing for the patient might be the best thing for their health, the guidance says. Tests and treatments that have been routine for decades should either be stopped or used less often, it suggests. The wide-ranging changes to medical practice have been proposed by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents the UK’s 220,000 working doctors. If implemented they could save the cash-strapped NHS billions of pounds a year by reducing the unnecessary medicalisation of some ailments, the academy estimates. The advice would give patients a much greater say in deciding how they are cared for and would lead to them being told more often about the risks and benefits of certain treatments. “The more we learn about medicine, the more we learn about the risks and potential harms too. We have long had a tendency to over-medicalise in this country and it’s a problem that really needs addressing now,” said Prof Dame Sue Bailey, who leads the academy’s work on Choosing Wisely, a worldwide campaign by medics to improve health by reducing unnecessary medical intervention. “Too often there’s pressure on both the patient and the doctor to do something, when doing nothing might often be the best course of action. And only when a patient is fully informed about the consequences of what’s being proposed by the doctor should the decision be made about how to proceed.” The advice says: “Patients with low back pain do not routinely need imaging.” X-rays should be used much more sparingly because they often reveal little useful information about the origins of the pain, the academy believes. Steve Tolan, head of practice at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “This is excellent advice that many patients may be surprised by but is very much in their best interests. Indeed, if your doctor or physio judges that a scan is not necessary, you should take it as an encouraging sign that there is nothing serious or underlying going on. “Often patients will see things on a scan that look terrifying and this causes them to avoid doing many of the things that will actually help, such as bending and moving in general. But commonly what they see are completely normal changes to the spine that happen over time.” Similarly, the advice says most patients with a migraine should not undergo an MRI scan of their brain. Doctors believe that some migraine sufferers demand a scan because they fear, usually mistakenly, that they may have a brain tumour. For diagnoses of dementia, doctors should not simply rely on a memory test, the advice says. They should also talk to relatives and carers in order to gain a fuller picture of the person’s cognitive capabilities. The academy also advises that: Babies who are in the breech position before they are born should be manually manipulated by doctors back into a normal position rather than being delivered by a caesarean section. Older people with sight problems due to cataracts could undergo surgery on both eyes on the same day to help reduce the number of operations hospitals perform. Antipsychotic drugs should not be used to manage behavioural and psychological problems in patients with dementia if it can be avoided. Imelda Redmond, national director of Healthwatch England, a government-funded patient watchdog, said patients should be helped to consider all possible options before starting their treatment. Writing in the Pharmaceutical Journal, Bailey and Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist, say the NHS cites research by the King’s Fund that “because patients choose fewer treatments when fully informed, the NHS could save billions of pounds”. They write: “This goes beyond a black-and-white approach of phasing out treatments that have no benefit for patients at all as more robust data becomes available, to a huge grey area in healthcare, especially in managing chronic disease where marginal benefits of treatment are weighed up against often equal risk of harm.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/21/social-creature-tara-isabella-burton-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"Social Creature by Tara Isabella Burton review – slick identity thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/21/social-creature-tara-isabella-burton-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/21/social-creature-tara-isabella-burton-review","fields":{"headline":"Social Creature by Tara Isabella Burton review – slick identity thriller","bodyText":"Downtrodden wage slave meets rich soulmate and is swept up into their wild life: from Cinderella to Gatsby, it’s a well-worn tale. Tara Isabella Burton, a journalist and academic, has updated the story to present-day Manhattan, where it’s not a night out unless every instant is Instagrammed. Louise is struggling to pay the rent on her grotty sublet and knows that, at 29, her chances of being noticed as a hot young writer are running out. (Over 30, in this context, and you’re nothing.) Her fab new friend is socialite Lavinia, an Emma Woodhouse to Louise’s Harriet Smith. Fully half the novel is given over to Louise’s immersion in Lavinia’s extravagant, libertine life, and Burton does a brilliant job of depicting the toxic charm of such a world, the way its artifice erodes one’s sense of reality. “Here’s the thing,” Burton tells us repeatedly. In a story about a relationship with such a hefty imbalance of power, there are a lot of things – and a lot of problems and lies. Louise keeps her true feelings to herself for fear of losing Lavinia’s patronage. It’s soon clear, however, that although she affects the humility of Austen’s Harriet, Louise’s real literary ancestor is Patricia Highsmith’s Tom Ripley, a far less benign prospect. Because here’s the thing: in the first chapter we learn that in six months Lavinia will be dead. As you might expect from a book about contemporary twentysomethings, much of the story hinges on communications – ie phones. In 2009, the New York Times claimed: “Technology is rendering obsolete some classic narrative plot devices: missed connections, miscommunications.” They rued this “loss to storytelling”, but authors such as Burton have proved them wrong. Social Creature forensically unpicks what it means to possess someone else’s phone: not just to be able to read their messages, but to speak with their voice, send them somewhere, spend their money, steal their soul. Fans of American thrillers may have seen this trick before, in Caroline Kepnes’s You (2014). Burton takes it one step further, making us complicit in the deception. For all the story’s modern trappings, there’s not much that’s truly original here. But Burton draws us in via her marvellous control of the material, the expert way she plays off Lavinia’s lavishness against Louise’s guile – and our own fascination with those wild Manhattan parties. • Social Creature is published by Bloomsbury.

We were living in temporary accommodation while our house was being renovated, so we arranged to travel the 30 minutes to our property to receive it. Two hours before the delivery was due we were called by the delivery team to say that they were already there. They agreed to wait while, but we arrived to find that they had gone and the appliance had been left in our derelict, roofless garage. This was on a day where storms were predicted. It was too heavy to move by ourselves, and Currys promised to send the delivery team back. My husband then spent the next five hours waiting in freezing temperatures but no one came. We advised Currys that, as they had effectively left the cooker outside and we had not signed for it, we did not accept it since it may have been damaged by exposure to the elements. They offered a 10% discount but refused a replacement. I am within the returns deadline, but the price has gone up to £2,500 so if I make a new purchase, I will be £310 out of pocket. JW, Southampton Currys and its often dimwitted Team Knowhow make frequent appearances in my inbox. For some customers, getting fully functioning models safely on to the premises has involved hair-raising adventuring and a lot of time off work. In your case, Currys changed its mind once the Observer questioned its delivery policy and a new, reassuringly dry, cooker was delivered within four days. JS of LLandrindod Wells, Powys has also been vainly demanding a replacement after the Knowhow team required six technicians in six weeks to repair her washer-dryer, which then broke down again. The first technician had pronounced it irreparable, but ordered new parts, anyway. The second found that the wrong parts had been sent and abandoned the repair. The third called towards the end of the four-hour appointment slot to say he wouldn’t have time to come. Two months later, she was still racking up launderette bills with no further word from Currys. Following a call from the Observer, Currys agreed to replace the machine and refund her laundry bills. Then there’s the saga of JR and RR of Wimbish, Essex who paid Currys £2,500 for a TV and its installation. Three visits from technicians over two weeks failed to get it working and the couple had to take a fourth day off work for Currys to collect it. It offered £75 compensation which it increased to £100 after media involvement, but the couple are still without a TV. • If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

We must give their families more help","bodyText":"Judges are only meant to speak in court, and they may not pronounce on government policy. So it’s a rare day when a judge turns whistleblower. It’s practically unknown for two senior judges to state publicly, in terms, that there’s a crisis in our care system which is damaging children and families across the land. But Andrew McFarlane, the incoming president of the high court’s family division, this week agreed with his predecessor James Munby, who warned in 2016 that the “seemingly relentless” rise in the number of care applications has resulted in a burgeoning children’s services disaster. This is, according to McFarlane, “untenable” for the courts and care system. The new president of the family court was speaking at the launch of the Care Crisis review, which was prompted by Munby’s alarm call. The seven-month process, facilitated by the charity Family Rights Group, listened to over 2,000 people including social workers, local authorities, Ofsted, women who have lost their children, adopters, and children who have been in care. With the number of children in state care now at a high of 73,000, up from 60,000 a decade ago, vulnerable children are being removed from their families at an unprecedented rate, and families are being destroyed in ways they will never recover from. As the children’s commissioner reported this week, half of the country’s entire public spending on children is going on those 73,000 children. And this highlights the fact that councils are staring down an abyss: they cannot ignore the plight of children in acute crisis, or some will die and others will be terribly damaged; but intervening when catastrophe has already engulfed a family unit is punishingly expensive. It is also throwing good money after bad, because councils end up spending vast amounts with extremely poor results. Yes, they might save a life, but what about the child who has to cope with the harm they’ve suffered? Without a fundamental change this cycle will spiral out of control, because it’s likely that these children will grow up to parent poorly, and their own children will need lots of expensive state intervention. What is clear from the Care Crisis report is that the shredding of the social safety net of preventative services such as Sure Start, and many other council-funded and community initiatives, is leading directly to more children becoming at risk in families unable to withstand the multiple poverty-linked crises that assail them. “Frustration, despair and anger” about the impact of austerity on the lives and life chances of these increasingly fragile families was a pervasive theme running through the review’s listening sessions. With councils now amputating their own limbs in response to government cuts, it seems the only resource left that can help children is families themselves. As things stand, parents under scrutiny feel terrified of social services, which they know have little useful help to offer them. Social workers, in turn, are petrified of children dying on their watch and the vilification that follows, so end up demanding that the courts remove more children. Every family judge I know says the courts are struggling desperately to cope with the numbers of care cases coming through their doors. Family lawyers too have ridiculous workloads. So where is this going to end? If things carry on as they are, this will end with ever more damaged children in foster care, which will bust councils’ budgets. The resulting human misery will be off the scale as the care system seizes up. Sibling groups will be split up even more often than they are now as available foster-care places become more scattered, and brothers and sisters will grow up not knowing each other; those vital sustaining relationships that help buffer people throughout their adult lives will be lost. Children will also end up being looked after farther away from their community, will have to move school, lose their friendships, and their teacher relationships, resulting in even worse educational outcomes. It is a shocking indictment of the care system that still only 6% of children who have been in care go to university. From the other side of the fence, dedicated social workers will burn out, and more will flee the profession. Recruitment crises will worsen, and finally the family court system will implode because the capacity simply does not exist to hear vastly increased numbers of care applications from less experienced social workers. Meanwhile, despite everyone’s best efforts, there will be less robust decisions made for children, as family judges’ lists fill up and up. All this means that there needs to be a complete reset of attitudes in children’s social care, away from removing children and towards supporting families and their relatives and friends to care safely for them. You cannot protect children without supporting families. Children’s services need to always consider the destruction of relationships that happens as a result of removing children, and the immense strain that a family has to bear when involved in court cases that can drag on for months and sometimes years. The vast majority of parents who struggle are sad rather than bad. Almost all families will have strengths that can be built on. So in the current funding crisis, where directors of children’s services are predicting a shortfall of £2bn in children’s social care by 2020, they must direct whatever slender resources they have left to the building up of families’ own capacities. The Care Crisis review suggests that government pumps a ring-fenced sum of money to each local authority to help improve services to children. Good luck with that. In the meantime, working with families, rather than spending tens of millions fighting parents in the family courts, is the only realistic game in town.

I was six years old and spent three magical and exciting weeks watching England progress through the World Cup in Italy enthralled by Gary Lineker’s goals, the dribbles of Chris Waddle and Peter Beardsley and the sheer raw genius of Gazza before West Germany killed the dream and the euphoria was replaced by sobbing. The whole nation mourned that day and some would say it was yet another “welcome to being an England fan” moment. As a nation we haven’t reached a World Cup semi-final since but when the tears had dried and I grew up I reflected on 1990 as a moment which restored pride and joy to English football after the stadium disasters at Heysel and Hillsborough and the negativity of a hooligan element which had dragged our reputation to an embarrassing low. Our record in the most recent tournaments has been poor and has led to a palpable lack of expectation regarding what we might achieve in Russia in the next few weeks. It has also seen a distinct change in attitude among the players in this England squad, who have travelled with less emotional baggage than any group in living memory. That has manifested itself in the way they are approaching the challenge and exhibiting a kind of openness to the media, and therefore the public, which is almost unheard of. I was surprised and encouraged when all 23 players turned up for a Super Bowl-style press day last week, showing a maturity and understanding of how important it is to reconnect. Maybe the FA was bearing in mind it was heading to the nation which gave us glasnost when it set up unprecedented access to its elite players, which resulted in lads like Raheem Sterling putting his sometimes difficult relationship with the media to one side and speaking openly about his optimism for the tournament and addressing issues he’s had with his public image. Instead of the fame and riches people got to see a nice kid who’s living his dream of playing for England and determined to do well for his country. The schism between players, fans and the media is one of the problems the modern game has created. It has made it easy for all sides to feel a lack of connection and empathy for each other, so when Danny Rose spoke so honestly about his depression I believe everyone sensed that the dynamic is changing in the England camp and trust is beginning to be re-established. It’s still early but these and other signs of improvement make me excited that this young squad can do well in Russia. Several of them, when asked whether reaching the quarter-finals would constitute success (the stock benchmark for England teams in previous years), replied that they were going to Russia to win and what would be the point if not. There was no overconfidence, bullishness or arrogance, just a subtle self-belief and determination that suggests this squad – unburdened by expectation – will play without the fear which has crippled Three Lions teams previously. And why not? The majority of the 23 are playing club football under the guidance of the world’s best, most successful and progressive coaches. Pep Guardiola, José Mourinho, Jürgen Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino have instilled in their teams the benefits of a fast transition game where the key to victory is moving the ball quickly and getting behind opponents to hurt them. Not only that, we have in Gareth Southgate a young coach who has worked at youth and under-21 level with the FA and is familiar with many of the senior players he has helped bring through in an England shirt. The Germany team who won the last tournament grew up together in similar circumstances alongside their coach and that proved to be a crucial factor. Neither should we overlook that with Guardiola’s two-year tenure at Manchester City we also have the advantage of the Pep factor in England’s favour. It was the Catalan coach who worked week in, week out with the Barcelona players who were such an integral part of the Spain team who conquered the world in South Africa in 2010, before he enjoyed a successful first season with Bayern Munich, who then provided a raft of talent to the Germany squad which triumphed four years ago. Sterling, John Stones, Kyle Walker and Fabian Delph have become better players under Guardiola’s coaching and it’s no coincidence that England have adopted the fluid style which is the staple at City. I’m not claiming that he is responsible for two World Cup-winning teams as we all recognise the multiple factors needed to achieve the greatest accolade in the game. However, it can’t do your chances any harm to have arguably the best coach in the world on the training field every day with some of England’s key players. It’s not just Guardiola. Klopp has turned Trent Alexander-Arnold from a reserve to a Champions League finalist and a deserved place in England’s squad. Similarly, look at the progress of Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford under Mourinho and the excellence of Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Eric Dier and Kieran Trippier with Pochettino. Some people were underwhelmed when Southgate was appointed but he has benefited from the expertise of club coaches in the Premier League and no one can doubt the players are with him. His straightforward approach and tactical application have seen England qualify efficiently and go into the finals with an optimism which has been absent or unjustified for some time. Starting on Monday against Tunisia, I’ll be watching and supporting an England team who I believe may surprise us and exceed the expectation of the nation with their performances and results. No one can guarantee that football won’t break your heart but maybe, just maybe, this summer won’t be as painful as years gone by."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/22/the-years-annie-ernaux-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T08:00:24Z","webTitle":"The Years by Annie Ernaux review – a masterpiece memoir of French life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/22/the-years-annie-ernaux-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/22/the-years-annie-ernaux-review","fields":{"headline":"The Years by Annie Ernaux review – a masterpiece memoir of French life","bodyText":"Annie Ernaux is long overdue to be recognised in Britain as one of the most important writers in contemporary France, and this edition of The Years ought to do the trick. Originally published there in 2008, it was immediately heralded as Ernaux’s masterpiece, her brief Remembrance of Things Past. It has been expertly rendered into English by Alison Strayer, who captures all the shadings of Ernaux’s prose, all its stops and starts, its changes in pace and in tone, its chatterings, its silences. The book spans the timeframe from the author’s birth in 1940 up to 2006, and moves from her working-class upbringing in Normandy to her years teaching French literature in a lycée, living in the Parisian suburb of Cergy, raising two sons and eventually divorcing. But it is not a straightforward autobiography; rather it is told in a choral “we”, which sometimes shifts into the third person, so the author appears as “she”. This is as close in as it gets. In so doing, Ernaux puts paid (hopefully once and for all) to the idea that memoirs by women are about the small-scale, the domestic. She shows it is possible to write both personally and collectively, situating her own story within the story of her generation, without ever confusing the two. She reflects on the book she is writing even as she writes it, resolving: “There is no ‘I’ in what she views as a sort of impersonal autobiography. There is only ‘one’ and ‘we’, as if now it were her time to tell the story of the time-before.” “It will be a slippery narrative,” she writes, “composed in an unremitting continuous tense, absolute, devouring the present as it goes.” It is comprised of her own memories, of historical events, of scraps of popular culture, slang, notes on the subtle transformations of the culture. We encounter the war in Algeria, Sartre and De Beauvoir, Edith Piaf’s “Les Amants d’un Jour” (which “gave us goosebumps”), fondue bourguignonne, Agnès Varda’s Le Bonheur, May 1968, the pro-abortion rights manifesto of the 343 salopes, nuclear threat, the explosion of consumerism, unemployment, immigration, the advance of technology. Ernaux captures the ineffable passage of time, which she layers like “palimpsests”, in order to express the “lived dimension of history” and, perhaps more crucially, to “give form to her future absence”. • The Years is published by Fitzcarraldo Editions.

Too much sugar is blamed for high obesity rates in children and dental decay. The Department for Health agency is urging parents to try to cut back on sugary drinks, cakes and biscuits. Its guidance says that children aged four to 10 should have no more than the equivalent of five or six cubes of sugar per day, but their intake is more than double that, at an average of 13 cubes. “We’re barely halfway through the year and already children have consumed far more sugar than is healthy – it’s no surprise this is contributing to an obesity crisis,” said Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE. “Snacks and drinks are adding unnecessary sugar to children’s diets without us even noticing. Swapping to lower- or no-added-sugar alternatives is something all parents can work towards.” In spite of the publicity around the sugar levy, which began in April, sugary drinks such as colas, lemonades and juices are still one of the biggest sources of sugar in children’s diets. They account for 10% of sugar consumed by children, as do buns, cakes, pastries and fruit pies. Biscuits are almost as big a problem, making up 9% of children’s intake, with spreads, jams and table sugar also contributing 9%. Other big sources of sugar include breakfast cereals (8%), chocolate confectionery (7%), and yoghurts, fromage frais and other dairy desserts (6%). Fruit juice and smoothies can count as one of the five fruits and vegetables everybody is encouraged to eat per day, but they contain a lot of natural sugar. PHE says one serving a day of no more than 150ml is enough, which should be drunk with a meal not as a snack. PHE suggests parents should swap their children’s sugary drinks for water, lower fat plain milks, sugar-free or no-added-sugar drinks. It also offers ideas on its Change4Life website. It says lower sugar snacks include fruit, plain rice cakes, toast, fruit teacakes, malted loaf or bagels with lower-fat spread. The Obesity Health Alliance said PHE’s figures were alarming. “These startling figures highlight the need for further robust action from government in their upcoming second edition of the Childhood Obesity Plan. A package of measures including restrictions on the advertising of junk food to children, action on price promotions on unhealthy products and clearer food labelling will help parents to make healthy choices and ensure their children have the healthiest possible start in life,” said its lead, Caroline Cerny. PHE’s advice to families came as the British Dental Association warned about the impact of sugary drinks and junk food marketing during the World Cup. Coca-Cola is said to be investing £2.5m into a UK campaign that includes digital, social and out-of-home advertising, and promotion codes to unlock branded content in the top-selling video game FIFA 18. “Whether your kids are sitting in front of the match on TV, on their smartphones or games consoles, they will be unable to escape wall-to-wall promotions for products fuelling tooth decay and obesity,” said the BDAS’s health and science chair, Russ Ladwa. “These increasingly sophisticated tactics demand a coherent response from government.

It’s our Olympics. It means everything, basically.” A glance at his book of rides next week shows why Dettori is treading carefully. Ascot is “his” turf, the track where he rode all seven winners in September 1996, a feat that is commemorated by a bronze of the rider performing his trademark flying dismount by the main gate. Yet Dettori has not finished the Royal meeting as leading jockey since his six-winner week in 2004 and the betting suggests he may never get a better chance to do so for the sixth time in all. Ryan Moore, Royal Ascot’s top jockey for the last four seasons and seven of the last eight, is the 8-11 favourite to be the leading rider once again next week but Dettori, at 3-1, is a solid second-favourite in a market where only two jockeys are priced up in single figures. Cracksman, the even-money favourite for the Prince of Wales’s Stakes on Wednesday, looks like his banker for the week but he will also ride fancied contenders from overseas including the Australian sprinter Redkirk Warrior in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes and several from the large team assembled by the American trainer Wesley Ward. Cracksman struggled to beat the outsider Salouen when odds-on for the Coronation Cup earlier this month, at the end of a race when the hot favourite did not appear to be travelling easily at any stage. Dettori, though, is confident Cracksman will return to his best form over the trip and track where he won the Champion Stakes last autumn. “I’m sick and tired of people asking me ‘How’s Cracksman?’” Dettori said. “He’s fine. He doesn’t like Epsom, he really struggles to run downhill but he likes Ascot and I hope the beast turns up that we’ve seen [in the Champion Stakes]. “You don’t get a rating of 130 if you don’t prove it and I’m as excited as anyone to see him on Wednesday.” Dettori has another favourite for a Group One on Tuesday’s opening card, when the lightly raced Without Parole is expected to head the market for the St James’s Palace Stakes at around 3-1. John Gosden’s three-year-old made his debut in December and has had only two runs since, the most recent being a solid but unspectacular win in the Heron Stakes at Sandown. “He went into that race after a 10-day lay-off with a bruised foot [which forced him to miss the 2,000 Guineas],” Dettori said. “He was a little bit rusty and the ground was soft. Looking at the entries, it looks like a very competitive St James’s Palace, and he’s got to step up from what you’ve seen to be competitive but he’s an exciting horse and you’ve got to take the challenge on.” Redkirk Warrior is one of Australia’s top sprinters and won the Group One Lightning Stakes at Flemington in February, a race which the brilliant mare Black Caviar landed on her way to victory in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes in 2012. Dettori’s rides for Ward, meanwhile, include Chelsea Cloisters, in the Queen Mary Stakes, and Undrafted, a former winner of the Diamond Jubilee, in the Wokingham. “When I ride for Wesley, he has only two words for me: hang on,” Dettori said. “That’s how fast they are, their gate speed is amazing and his record at Ascot is unbelievable. “Let’s hope Chelsea Cloisters is another Lady Aurelia. The old boy Undrafted won the Jubilee and now he’s in a handicap. If he has half the ability he used to have, he should run a big race.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/17/the-most-likely-cradles-for-life-our-solar-system-mars","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"The most likely cradles for life inside our solar system","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/17/the-most-likely-cradles-for-life-our-solar-system-mars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jun/17/the-most-likely-cradles-for-life-our-solar-system-mars","fields":{"headline":"The most likely cradles for life inside our solar system","bodyText":"Mars This week, Nasa’s veteran Curiosity rover discovered complex organic matter that had been buried and preserved for more than 3bn years in sediments forming a lake bed.

It is thought to have water oceans beneath the surface and, like Earth, an internal energy source from radioactive decay. This has led to the hypothesis that life may exist in conditions similar to that of Earth’s hydrothermal vents.

Following a signal from the Labor leader Bill Shorten that the opposition “won’t support anything that punishes the charity and not-for-profit sector”, Labor and the Greens have now endorsed six principles articulated by an alliance of charities and not-for-profits. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While the political focus this week has been on the potential impact of the proposed foreign influence transparency legislation on the Chinese company Huawei, charities and not for profits are concerned the legislation would require groups to register every time they undertake communications or lobbying activities on behalf of or with the knowledge of a “foreign principal”. The alliance of charities and not-for-profits says the regime “would have serious impacts on the work of groups like WWF-Australia, Pew Charitable Trusts and Oxfam Australia, who work with international partners”. “In fact, the definition of foreign principal is so broad, that it may require those who work for these organisations to register as an agent of UN bodies or international governments if they so much as make a presentation to them that refers to planned activities”. The group has outlined six principles that Labor and the Greens have endorsed. It says the sector should have the capacity to use international funding for issues-based advocacy. Any legislation needs to ensure there is “a clear distinction between issues-based advocacy and politically partisan electioneering” – with the definitions consistent with a distinction drawn in the Charities Act. The group wants to ensure the sector does not face an increase in their current compliance requirements and “are not subject to more extensive regulatory controls and administrative requirements or criminal offences than other third parties, for example businesses and industry associations”. It says donors of gifts that are not intended or used for promoting or opposing a candidate or a party for political office “should not be subject to new public reporting or registration requirements”. The alliance also insists charities should be “free to cooperate on issues-based advocacy to advance issues of public interest, including by working with non-Australian citizens and non-permanent Australian residents”. The shadow charities minister, Andrew Leigh, said the opposition endorsed the principles because “charities shouldn’t be caught in the crossfire of any proposed legislation.” “There is bipartisan support for banning foreign political donations, but banning donations to political parties should not entail cutting down free speech,” Leigh said. “The advocacy voice of charities and not-for-profits is not only the voice of the various organisations — it is the voice of every Australian who donates, volunteers or is a member of a charity. When the voice of charities and not-for-profits are threatened, so is our democracy.” With many groups – business, universities, as well as charities – complaining about the impact of the proposed regime, the attorney-general Christian Porter a week ago produced amendments to the proposed register of foreign agents with the objective of limiting its reach. The charities alliance wants the new regime to be unambiguous in its application, because there is currently confusion about who is required to register. The Chinese telecommunications company Huawei said on Thursday it may not have to register, and it’s not clear whether aid groups would have to declare their activities when they don’t have contractual relationships with other parties. “Oxfam regularly works with foreign governments in the delivery of aid programs. We use those experiences and relationships in our communications with the department of foreign affairs and trade, and in the work we do to inform and influence Australia’s aid policy and programming,” said Helen Szoke, chief executive of Oxfam. “The foreign influence transparency scheme would require us to register as a foreign agent in those situations,” she said. While Porter has argued there is no stigma attached to being on the register, that it is only a transparency measure, Szoke says humanitarian work “must be seen as independent and neutral”. “Being categorised as a foreign agent could hurt our reputation with partners in Australia and overseas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/14/the-legal-fight-to-leave-the-dirtiest-fossil-fuels-in-the-ground","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T10:00:44Z","webTitle":"The legal fight to leave the dirtiest fossil fuels in the ground | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/14/the-legal-fight-to-leave-the-dirtiest-fossil-fuels-in-the-ground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/14/the-legal-fight-to-leave-the-dirtiest-fossil-fuels-in-the-ground","fields":{"headline":"The legal fight to leave the dirtiest fossil fuels in the ground","bodyText":"Tar sands are the dirtiest fossil fuels. These are low-quality heavy tar-like oils that are mined from sand or rock. Much of the mining occurs in Alberta Canada, but it is also mined elsewhere, in lesser quantities. Tar sands are the worst. Not only are they really hard to get out of the ground, requiring enormous amounts of energy; not only are they difficult to transport and to refine; not only are they more polluting than regular oils; they even have a by-product called “petcoke” that’s used in power plants, but is dirtier than regular coal. This stuff is worse than regular oil, worse than coal, worse than anything. Anyone who is serious about climate change cannot agree to mine and burn tar sands. To maintain climate change below critical thresholds, tar sands need to be left in the ground. This fact is what motivated me to testify to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission last November, to inform my state’s ruling commission about the impact of tar sands on the climate. Canadian energy company Enbridge has petitioned to put a pipeline through my state to carry this dirty tar to refining sites on the coast. The proposed pipeline is called “Line 3.” The pipeline would carry approximately 760,000 barrels per day – the new pipeline would make it easier and cheaper for the oil companies to transport tar sands and consequently, would boost their bottom line. We already move over two million barrels per day through Minnesota in Enbridge pipelines. This new pipeline would encourage them to extract and sell more tar sands. So, how much pollution would this pipeline carry? 170bn kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. The emissions are equal to approximately 50 coal power plants. These are huge numbers, but more importantly, approval of pipelines like this make it more likely that all of the tar sands in Alberta will be extracted. If that happens, global temperatures will increase by approximately 0.65°F (0.36°C). An astonishing number – approximately three decades worth of global warming. If you care about climate change, then it is not logically possible to approve any pipeline or other infrastructure that may further worsen our climate. We are already screwing up the climate enough as it is. The decision-making body in my state has heard climate arguments before. In fact, in 2016, the same body ruled against the coal giant Peabody. That ruling decided that fossil fuel companies low-balled the social cost of carbon. Back then, Peabody brought in a group of climate contrarians to argue their nonsense. My colleagues and I were able to convince the Commission that the facts were clear – we are causing climate change, and our decisions today can make tomorrow’s climate worse. This ruling was used when evaluating the social cost of carbon pollution for a new Line 3 pipeline. A judge found that emissions from this project would impose $287bn in social costs over 30 years. In this case, the oil company Enbridge did not invite any contrarian climate scientists. They simply focused on arguments that a new pipeline will be safer to operate (fewer spills) and lessen other issues like rail traffic. They effectively conceded the climate arguments. The decision will be revealed later this month. But already, an Administrative Law Judge has given a recommendation that the new pipeline be built, but in the exact same location as the current pipe. While this recommendation presents large costs to Enbridge, it completely misses the science. The judge’s opinion made no mention of climate change. How can a decision on extracting tar sands be made without considering climate effects? Just last week, the staff of the commission also recommended construction of the new pipeline. They too omitted climate change from their decision. I was proud to be able to stand alongside tomorrow’s leaders. Courageous youth became parties to the litigation and helped arrange the testimony of various climate experts like myself. One of the youth involved in the litigation, Frances Wetherall, summarized her view and told me why she was involved in the case. With every barrel of oil burned, my future children and grandchildren’s chances of a long and happy life diminish. I can’t stand by while Big Oil profits off the destruction of future generations. Whether or not these youth prevail in this case, their courage, intelligence, and drive give me hope for a better future. I am hopeful that the commission dismisses these opinions. It is clear to me that not only must tar sands be kept in the ground, but actions to assist in their extraction make one complicit. I believe that decisions have consequences and we must take responsibility for our decisions. We cannot say “climate matters” and then facilitate tar sands extractions. We also cannot say “we didn’t know” when our children ask us why we made poor decisions. I would hate to be a fossil fuel lawyer, or executive, or lawmaker who fights for climate destruction today and has to justify his actions to his kids tomorrow. History will be a very harsh judge to them; but of course it will be too late for the rest of us. I’ve said this before and I will say it again, if we cannot say no to tar sands, what can we say no to?

While Americans who do not have a favorable view of Mueller’s special counsel investigation are still in the minority, their numbers are growing. The share of US voters who view Mueller unfavorably rose from 23% in July 2017 to 36% in June 2018, according to recent polling, while support for his “Russia investigation” mission dropped from 73% in May 2017 to 54% in April 2018. Unmistakably responsible for Mueller’s declining stock is Donald Trump, who has steadily railed on Twitter against the “criminal deep state” and its “witch-hunt” designed, Trump claims, to avenge the election loss of Hillary Clinton. Trump’s Republican supporters have eagerly swallowed that message, with 85% of self-identified Republicans approving or strongly approving of Trump’s job performance and only 18% expressing a favorable view of Mueller. Trump has argued that Mueller’s investigation of alleged collusion between Russia and his campaign has cost the United States too much money and lasted too long – arguments that voters have repeated in focus groups. But Mueller’s expenditures in his first year of about $17m are a fraction of the annual budget of a large district court, and his 13-month-long investigation has yielded more evidence of more crimes – and indeed more guilty pleas by more criminals – so far than any recent comparable federal investigation. The independent counsel investigation by Kenneth Starr, which began as an inquiry into an Arkansas real estate deal, culminated in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton after four years. Special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald won conviction of the former Dick Cheney aide Lewis “Scooter” Libby 39 months after his appointment as special counsel. Mueller was appointed special counsel on 17 May 2017. In that time he has indicted 22 criminal defendants and garnered five guilty pleas, including from Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser; Richard Gates III, a former deputy to campaign chairman Paul Manafort; and George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy aide. Some on the left, including David Corn of Mother Jones, have argued that a focus on the minutiae of the potential Mueller investigation has distracted the public from the big picture – allegations that the Trump campaign tried to cooperate with Moscow as the Russians attacked a US election, and then provided cover for the Russian attack by denying to the public that it had happened. Trump has repeatedly sought to blur the fact of the Russian attack on the US election, asserting that someone else may have been responsible and denying his own campaign’s contacts with Russians, as well as praising Putin, failing to challenge him in meetings and, most recently, inviting him to rejoin a reconstituted G8. Trump’s coziness with the Russian leader appears not to have been lost on voters. In Politico/Morning Consult polling, voters thought that the Trump campaign had worked with Russia to influence the outcome of the election by a margin of 43 to 39. Trump’s self-interest in torpedoing the Mueller inquiry is self-evident. Mueller has indicted Trump’s former campaign chairman, extracted guilty pleas from three of his former aides, and could end up filing criminal charges against a member or members of the president’s family. Mueller could end up filing a report that establishes the president as unfit for office in the eyes of a majority of Americans. Here’s what Mueller has charged so far: Guilty pleas Michael Flynn, former national security adviser – making false statements to investigators. Flynn is cooperating with prosecutors. Richard Gates III, former campaign and White House aide – conspiracy to defraud the United States and making false statements. Gates is cooperating with prosecutors. George Papadopoulos, former campaign aide – making false statements to investigators. Papadopoulos is cooperating with investigators. Alex van der Zwaan, Dutch lawyer – making false statements to investigators about his work with Gates. He was deported last week after serving a 30-day sentence on his conviction. Richard Pinedo of California – identity fraud for selling dummy bank accounts to Russians agents. Indicted Paul Manafort, former campaign chairman – obstruction of justice, money laundering, tax fraud, failure to register as a foreign agent and making false statements. Manafort is due in court on Friday to face new charges, that he tampered with witnesses who could testify in the case against him on charges including money laundering, tax fraud and failure to register as a foreign agent. In addition, Mueller has indicted 13 Russian nationals and three companies with Russian ties in connection with the Russian plot to tamper with the 2016 US presidential election. In doing so, Mueller unveiled features of the Russian plot that have received relatively little attention, such as a cross-country espionage tour taken by two Russian defendants using stolen identities “including stops in Nevada, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Louisiana, Texas, and New York to gather intelligence”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/14/new-zealand-drug-driving-deaths-surpass-drink-driving-toll-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T02:20:05Z","webTitle":"New Zealand drug-driving deaths surpass drink-driving toll for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/new-zealand-drug-driving-deaths-surpass-drink-driving-toll-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/14/new-zealand-drug-driving-deaths-surpass-drink-driving-toll-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand drug-driving deaths surpass drink-driving toll for first time","bodyText":"More people died on New Zealand’s roads last year after collisions involving drug-drivers than drink-drivers, new research has shown. The Automobile Association (AA) has called the statistic proof of the “silent killer” of drug-driving and said police needed to be given saliva-based testing kits. Figures obtained by the association showed that last year 79 fatal crashes involved a driver who was impaired by drugs in their system, compared with 70 involving an intoxicated driver. In 2016, 59 fatal crashes involved a drug-affected driver and 67 involved alcohol. The figures come from testing that is done by authorities following a fatal crash. It is thought to be the first time that drugs have overtaken alcohol. “These figures confirm how big a problem drugged driving is on our roads and why we have to give police saliva-based testing devices to catch impaired drivers,” said the AA’s Dylan Thomsen. “The AA has called drugged driving a silent killer on our roads for years and these latest figures confirm how prevalent drugs are in fatal crashes.” The AA is pushing for the government to give police more tools to test and catch drugged drivers on the roads. Excluding alcohol, the two most commonly detected individual drugs were cannabis and methamphetamine, also known as “P”, with the cases of P detection rising sharply in recent years. “The number of drivers found to have drugs in their system is no surprise to the AA,” said Thomsen. “No one wants someone who is high driving towards their family at 100kph but right now the chances of being caught drugged driving is tiny. We have to change that.” The current system for police to test a driver for drugs requires an officer to have strong cause to suspect drug use and then to take the driver to a police station for a “walk-and-turn” sobriety test. Thomsen said the existing system almost needed “a driver to be sitting in the car with drugs on the seat next to them to get tested”. However, he said saliva testing devices, which were being used in many other countries, would be much faster and allow many more potentially drug-impaired drivers to be tested. “Random roadside drug testing would send a strong message that you’re endangering yourself and others if you drive impaired, and this doesn’t just apply to alcohol.” Such drug testing of drivers occurs in Australia, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and Ireland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/13/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-fox-news-human-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T09:47:43Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump shrugs off Kim's human rights record: 'He's a tough guy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-fox-news-human-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-fox-news-human-rights","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump shrugs off Kim's human rights record: 'He's a tough guy'","bodyText":"Donald Trump has dismissed concerns about the widely condemned human rights record of the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, praising him as a “tough guy”, a “smart guy” and a “great negotiator”. In an interview with Bret Baier of Fox News as he was leaving Singapore following the denuclearization summit with the North Korean leader, Trump declined to condemn the record of his interlocutor. International bodies have accused Kim of crimes against humanity including assassinations of political rivals, public executions and holding captive tens of thousands of political prisoners. Speaking in a wood-paneled office aboard Air Force One, Baier put it to the US president that Kim was “a killer. He’s executing people.” Trump replied by praising Kim as a “tough guy. Hey, when you take over a country, tough country, with tough people, and you take it over from your father, I don’t care who you are, what you are, how much of an advantage you have – if you can do that at 27 years old, that’s one in 10,000 could do that.” Trump went on: “So he’s a very smart guy, he’s a great negotiator and I think we understand each other.” Baier, sounding taken aback by the president’s flippant response, pressed Trump on the issue: “But he’s still done some really bad things.” To which Trump said: “Yeah, but so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done.” Trump’s failure to condemn one of the worst human rights records on the world stage is certain to inflame criticism that is already being leveled at him from both Democrats and Republicans in the wake of the summit. The presidential center of the former Republican president George W Bush has been tweeting about North Korea’s abuses, giving a clear indication of how he views the matter. Other public figures have been more directly critical. A Democratic senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said of the outcome of the Singapore summit: “Kim’s gulags, public executions, planned starvation, are legitimized on the world stage … What the hell?” The issue of human rights was notably absent from the joint statement signed by Trump and Kim at their five-hour summit on Tuesday. Nor has there been any mention of human rights in the early discussions about follow-up meetings between the Trump administration and the North Korean regime. Among the outrages that could be put on the agenda are the up to 120,000 political prisoners that are thought to be held in four political prison camps in North Korea. A UN inquiry accused the regime of “systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations” rising frequently to the level of crimes against humanity. The UN added: “These are not mere excesses of the state; they are essential components of a political system that has moved far from the ideals on which it claims to be founded. The gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world.” North Korea under Kim amounted, the UN concluded, to a totalitarian regime that “seeks to dominate every aspect of its citizens’ lives and terrorizes them from within”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/15/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-ramesh-balwani-criminal-charges","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T22:13:50Z","webTitle":"Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes charged with criminal fraud","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/15/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-ramesh-balwani-criminal-charges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/15/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-ramesh-balwani-criminal-charges","fields":{"headline":"Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes charged with criminal fraud","bodyText":"Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the startup Theranos, and the former company president, Ramesh Balwani, have been criminally charged with fraud for allegedly making false claims about the effectiveness of the company’s blood testing. The pair appeared before the US district court in San Jose on Friday, hours after Holmes stepped down as CEO of the company, and were charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. Both were released on $500,000 bail and ordered to surrender their passports. “This indictment alleges a corporate conspiracy to defraud financial investors,” said the FBI special agent John Bennett. “This conspiracy misled doctors and patients about the reliability of medical tests that endangered health and lives.” Theranos was founded in 2003 with the goal of revolutionising blood testing. It received glowing media coverage and raised more than $700m from investors on the back of the promise that it had invented a machine that could conduct hundreds of laboratory tests from a single finger-prick of blood. The tests were rolled out in Walgreens stores in California and Arizona and the company’s valuation soared to $9bn. However, a series of Wall Street Journal articles in 2015 revealed that most of the tests Theranos claimed to be doing with its Edison machines were being carried out by traditional machines bought from other companies. When the company’s proprietary devices were used for testing, the results were found to be less reliable and accurate than those produced by traditional machines. After scrutiny from health regulators, Theranos retracted two years of blood tests and agreed to reimburse 76,000 Arizonans who used its services. The indictment outlines these issues as well as alleged problems relating to the way Theranos presented its business to investors, including ambitious revenue projections of $1bn in 2015. “In truth, Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos had and would generate only modest revenues, roughly a few hundred thousand dollars or so in 2014 and 2015,” states the indictment. It also alleges that the pair defrauded doctors and patients by making false claims about the effectiveness of Theranos’s blood tests, including those for calcium, potassium, HIV and diabetes. “Based on these representations, many hundreds of patients paid or caused their medical insurance companies to pay Theranos for blood tests and test results, sometimes following referrals from their defrauded doctors,” the indictment states. The criminal charges come three months after Holmes was charge in a civil suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission with “massive fraud”. Theranos and Holmes agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. She paid a $500,000 penalty, returned millions of shares to the company and relinquished her company voting power under the terms of the settlement. She was also banned from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years. The company has laid off most of its workforce and is on the brink of bankruptcy. The general counsel David Taylor has been appointed chief executive officer. Holmes will remain chairman of Theranos’s board, the company said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/17/royal-ascot-tips-order-of-st-george-aidan-obrien","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Royal Ascot 2018 tipping guide: St George has fire to slay Gold Cup rivals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/17/royal-ascot-tips-order-of-st-george-aidan-obrien","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/17/royal-ascot-tips-order-of-st-george-aidan-obrien","fields":{"headline":"Royal Ascot 2018 tipping guide: St George has fire to slay Gold Cup rivals","bodyText":"At first glance the betting suggests Aidan O’Brien and Ryan Moore will dominate again at Royal Ascot this week, as they have for much of the last decade. They have been much shorter prices to finish the meeting as the top trainer and jockey in recent seasons, however, and must contend with both a resurgent Godolphin, fresh from their win in the Derby with Masar, and John Gosden, whose stable jockey Frankie Dettori can scent a first riders’ title since 2004. If there is a banker in O’Brien’s squad for the meeting’s eight Group One races, it is surely Order Of St George, first and second in the last two runnings of Thursday’s Gold Cup. Order Of St George does not have to contend with Big Orange this year, who edged him out 12 months ago thanks to a brilliant front-running ride by James Doyle, but Stradivarius is a major threat for Gosden and Dettori. Order Of St George’s proven form at this trip tips the balance in his favour at around 2-1 but it promises to be an outstanding spectacle with the excellent Vazirabad also on the premises. O’Brien’s remaining favourites for Group One events are much bigger prices, and either have a question to answer – as is the case with Clemmie in the Coronation Stakes – or several very credible opponents. Rhododendron scraped home by a nose from Lightning Spear in the Lockinge and is 3-1 to follow up in the opening Queen Anne Stakes but Recoletos, at 6-1, makes more appeal at the odds after two accomplished wins dropping back from 10 furlongs. Clemmie, meanwhile, was behind Alpha Centauri in the Irish 1,000 Guineas and the winner will be a worthy opponent even if Clemmie is back to her very best. Elsewhere in the main events Cracksman looks very short for a horse who was not travelling from an early stage in the Coronation Cup last time. Eminent was found to be suffering from a fibrillating heart after finishing last at Chester’s May meeting, which may deter some punters, but he is a very fair each-way chance at around 12-1 if, like many horses before him, he can put that behind him. Battaash boiled over before the Nunthorpe last year but he looked more settled before the Temple Stakes last time and has the beating of Lady Aurelia in the King’s Stand Stakes at his best. Without Parole missed the 2,000 Guineas but has a big chance to gain compensation in Tuesday’s St James’s Palace Stakes, while in the handicaps, Stratum (Ascot Stakes) and Dreamfield (Wokingham) have obvious chances and Thursday’s Haydock winner Escobar would be a big contender if he lines up under a penalty in Wednesday’s Royal Hunt Cup."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/15/law-change-upskirting-tory-mp-bill-christopher-chope","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T18:15:23Z","webTitle":"The law must change on upskirting.

One Tory MP won’t stop us","bodyText":"Upskirting is a depraved violation of privacy. It is outrageous that a single Tory MP has been able to derail a much needed and universally supported change in the law. But that is exactly what has happened. While the actions of one backwards, out-of-touch Tory anger me greatly, it is nothing in comparison to the hurt I feel for the women who have been harassed and degraded because they don’t have the protection they need from the law. The experiences of these women, such as Gina Martin who founded the campaign, are what inspired me to lodge my bill to make upskirting a specific sexual offence. Gina’s story is one of many. Less than a year ago, she was at a festival in London with her sister. She was then horrified to notice a man behind her had taken a photo up her skirt. Shocked and distressed, she sought help from the police. The law, however, was not sufficient to ensure the police could help her. Indeed, Dame Vera Baird QC from the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said legislation as it currently stands “is far from clear as there is no specific offence”. This deeply troubled me. I had to take up the fight. I then set about the task – launching the bill on International Women’s Day – of making the government listen. And listen the government did. Last month, at my urging, the prime minister backed my bill and remarked on her own “outrage at the disgusting act”. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable, also lent his weight to the campaign by writing to Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn urging them to encourage their MPs to back the bill. I am glad to say colleagues from across the House of Commons were receptive. The cross-party campaign was building momentum. The breakthrough came when alongside Gina, and her lawyer Ryan Whelan, we engaged in discussions with the ministry of justice to work on the details of the bill, which the minister Lucy Frazer then decided to back. Given that in Scotland upskirting was made an offence in 2009, I could see no excuse for not acting. Working with the government, particularly when party politics is involved, is no easy task. However, it is testament to the importance of this issue that there is such widespread consensus that a change in the law is desperately needed. I can’t tell you of my excitement when, credit to the minister, the government agreed to support our plans to close the loophole, in order to better protect victims and increase convictions. The feeling was short-lived today, but the fight is not over. I will not allow one male Tory MP, Christopher Chope, to deny women the right to feel safe. Urgent arrangements are now being made to agree a route forward with the government and I already have a date in the Commons for another, and hopefully successful, second reading. My message to women who have been victims of upskirting is clear. We will keep fighting to ensure the police are able to act immediately and bring the perpetrators to justice. • Wera Hobhouse is the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/16/trump-kim-summit-analysis-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"A historic handshake … but what did the Trump-Kim summit really achieve?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/trump-kim-summit-analysis-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/trump-kim-summit-analysis-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"A historic handshake … but what did the Trump-Kim summit really achieve?","bodyText":"It says a lot about the world of diplomacy in 2018 that the most expert commentary on Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un’s Singapore summit came from a tearful former basketball player, Dennis Rodman. Unlike all the other talking heads dissecting the summit, Rodman has actually met Kim, and spent more time talking to the North Korean leader than anyone in the western world. Almost everyone else is just guessing. Rodman’s view was Kim was a “big kid” who wants to “enjoy his life” and ideally visit the US. When Rodman kept a promise to bring a basketball team to North Korea, Kim told him “this is the first time someone has ever kept their word to me and my country”. If only the world treated Kim the same way, Rodman said in an emotional CNN interview in which tears streaked down his cheeks, “the door will open”. In Singapore, Trump was practising the Rodman school of diplomacy, behaving towards the North Korean like a solicitous uncle. The president adopted hazy North Korean language on denuclearisation, ditching more precise US arms control terms, defended Kim over the regime’s appalling human rights, and presented him with a gift in the form of a unilateral concession, the suspension of military exercises. “The summit statement is big on hyperbole and short on substance – it reads like it was written by the North Korean negotiating team,” said Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America thinktank who has led back-channel contacts with North Korean officials. If this had been Obama, or any other US leader, Trump would have led the howls of derision at these acts of appeasement of a mass murderer. But hypocrisy is not so much a character flaw in Trump as a defining characteristic: actions he denounces in others become admirable when he carries them out himself. “I signed an agreement where we get everything, everything,” Trump claimed on Friday. In the face of widespread disgust at Trump’s extravagant kowtowing to a dictator responsible for mass murder, the president claimed it was the price for keeping Americans safe. “You know why, because I don’t want you to be killed with a nuclear weapon,” he told a reporter. To some extent, Trump is claiming credit for defusing crises he had helped create, with last year’s “Little Rocket Man” insults and threats to “totally destroy” North Korea. But the standoff with North Korea goes back decades, and – as has happened during previous periods of diplomacy – the two sides had pulled back from the brink in advance of the summit. There have been no North Korean nuclear and long-range missile tests for eight months. Trump claimed he suspended military exercises unilaterally for budget reasons, but the move also removes a flashpoint, and may go some way in lifting the fog of paranoia in Pyongyang. The first test of the new dialogue should be imminent. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is supposed to meet his North Korean counterparts in the next week, and it should be apparent soon if Kim intends to keep his promise to Trump that he would dismantle a missile engine testing site. Robert Carlin, a former CIA officer who was deeply involved in earlier negotiations with the North Koreans, said Pyongyang could do away with its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) programme altogether. “They developed an ICBM programme to get our attention, and it worked. It absolutely worked.” Carlin said. “If they can get something for it, it’s not so hard to give it up.” Another early step could be a freeze on the production of fissile material, shutting down a five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon which is the only known source of the regime’s plutonium, and a facility for making tritium, used in making hydrogen bombs. North Korea could also shut down its plutonium reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities or put them under monitoring. In this scenario, major nuclear disarmament, actually dismantling weapons, would be put off till later, perhaps years later. That would involve a North Korean declaration of their arsenal, access for international weapons inspectors to verify that declaration, following by the disassembly of its weapons and production capacity, which would be shipped out of the country. The regime would only give up weapons it now sees as a guarantee of survival once it has confidence it would not be attacked, according to this argument – and that could take years. “I think it’s important if we can keep up this sensible relationship with the leader, then it’s going to pay dividends,” Carlin said. “People who say: no, he’s a murderous thug, you shouldn’t be dealing with him – what would they have us do? What’s the alternative? Clap him in irons the next time we see him? It’s ridiculous.” Under a proposed timetable put forward by Carlin and a Stanford University physicist, Siegfried Hecker – one of the few westerners to witness the North Korean programme first hand, it would take six years to reach the disarmament phase, and up to 10 years to complete it. For many arms control advocates, this gradual, phased approach is fraught with wider risk. They argue that negotiations with North Korea that are not directly aimed at the speedy dismantling of its rogue nuclear weapons programme would give it legitimacy and send the wrong message to other regimes contemplating whether to build their own bomb. “Trump is legitimising a brutal dictator and the underlying idea that achieving nuclear weapons makes you a legitimate leader. It’s a sad day for diplomacy and arms control,” said Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. From an arms control point of view, the joint statement in Singapore was particularly empty, and significantly less rigorous than a similar joint declaration in 2005. It incorporates the very vague North Korean pledge of steps “toward complete denuclearisation”, a stock phrase of the regime that can mean many things, none of them concrete. Nor is there any timetable or any mention of verification. These are things the Trump administration had insisted in the run-up to the summit that it would demand of Kim. When Pompeo was asked about verification the day after the summit, he immediately lost his temper, calling the question “insulting” and even “silly”. The defensiveness is understandable given how far short the summit fell of its own expectations. The agreement reached thus far has none of the rigour and substance of Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, which Trump and Pompeo reviled. They are, however, committed to maintaining the appearance of success – at the very least until the congressional midterm elections In that time, the US and North Korea are committed to further meetings. Those would be an opportunity for Kim to offer unilateral concessions of his own, such as the downgrading of the missile programme. If Rodman is right, and addressing the leader’s paranoia and sense of betrayal is the key to “opening the door”, it could lead to a virtuous cycle of disarmament. If he’s wrong, it will be very hard, if not impossible, to resume the pre-summit level of pressure on Pyongyang. In the absence of nuclear tests, neither China nor Russia, or even South Korea would support a return to isolation. Trump will have been comprehensively played. “Kim will make concrete concessions along the way that further reduce tensions, such as a codification of a testing suspension, freezing the nuclear and missile programmes and even some rollback,” DiMaggio said. “But chances are high that Trump’s approach will morph from ‘complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement’ to ‘we can live with a nuclear North Korea’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/17/paris-metro-male-names-world-without-women-public-vote-new-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"Next stop, Nina Simone … Paris metro ‘must honour its heroines’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/17/paris-metro-male-names-world-without-women-public-vote-new-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/17/paris-metro-male-names-world-without-women-public-vote-new-stations","fields":{"headline":"Next stop, Nina Simone … Paris metro ‘must honour its heroines’","bodyText":"To travel on the Paris métro is to take a journey through French – and world – history. Honoured with a station name are war heroes, statesmen, artists and writers including Charles de Gaulle, Markos Botsaris, Franklin D Roosevelt and Victor Hugo. But notable by their absence are women. Only four of the 303 stops on 16 lines are named after female figures, French or otherwise. Now, with two new stations being created on a central line extension, French feminists say it is time to end the snub. The campaign group Osez le féminisme (Dare to be a feminist) is urging people to vote for a woman in an online consultation that offers six possible names – three male and three female – that closes on 17 June. “Did you know that in Paris only four métro stations out of 303 make reference to a woman … You want to change that? So vote!” the organisation writes on its Facebook page. Raphaëlle Rémy-Leleu, a spokeswoman, told the Observer: “We have to rename a few more existing stations after women. Most stations make reference to the exploits of what we call in France the Grands Hommes, but we have some great women who also deserve to be recognised. Unfortunately, this is not reflected in the métro which is an example of how France continues to ignore the role of women in its history.” Among the proposed new station names are the French singer-songwriter Barbara – born Monique Andrée Serf – who died in 1997; Lucie Aubrac, a member of the French Resistance who died in 2007; and the American singer Nina Simone, who died in 2003. Last month, the Europe stop on line 3 was renamed Europe-Simone Veil in honour of the health minister and Auschwitz survivor, who died last year. The three other stations named after women are Barbès-Rochechouart, a tribute to Marguerite de Rochechouart de Montpipeau, who was abbess of Montmartre; Pierre et Marie Curie, after the Nobel prize-winning physicists, and Louise Michel, a Paris Commune militant. There is a Rosa Parks station on the RER suburban rail network in north Paris, named after the American civil rights activist. Rémy-Leleu said: “Historically, we have effaced women from transport. In fact, the situation is even worse than reported, because of those four stations, only one is not part of a composite name and that is Louise Michel, a station that’s not actually in Paris intra mures [within the city walls].” Last November, President Emmanuel Macron said his country was “sick with sexism” and declared gender equality and combating violence against women to be a “great cause” of his presidency. In March, following a backlash led by the actor Catherine Deneuve against the #MeToo movement that enraged feminists, the government said it would promote gender equality in education, the workplace and daily life, including fines for sexual harassment in public places. Progress, however, is slow. Last year, for the first time since the modern exam was introduced more than 20 years ago, a book by a woman was among the required works for the literary baccalauréat. La Princesse de Montpensier is a 17th-century court romance by Madame de La Fayette. Françoise Cahen, who teaches at a lycée in a south-eastern suburb of Paris, set up a successful petition calling for the education authorities to address the sexism. Last week, while adjudicating at an oral baccalauréat exam she was shocked to discover that not one of the texts given to 300 pupils to study had been written by a woman. “It was so depressing. Things are slowly but surely getting better, but there’s still some way to go,” Cahen said. “The publishers of school books are making a lot of effort to improve the proportion of women writers and so things are moving forward but gradually.” Osez le féminisme’s Métro campaign has been criticised by those suggesting there are more important issues. Rémy-Leleu admits the station campaign is “symbolic”, but points out that the group is also pushing for lesbian couples and single women to be given the same access to fertility treatment as heterosexual couples. It is also running a protest against a concert tour by Bertrand Cantat, a rock star who was convicted of killing his partner Marie Trintignant in 2003. France has a history of naming roads or railway stations after celebrated figures, even foreigners. Last November, the Burgundy town of Avallon named a street after Jo Cox, the MP for Batley and Spen who was killed during the Brexit campaign in June 2016. But this is the first time métro station names will be chosen by the public. They are due to open in June 2021."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/17/amazon-foxconn-china-will-tackle-illegal-work-practices","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"Amazon supplier in China ‘will tackle illegal work practices’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/17/amazon-foxconn-china-will-tackle-illegal-work-practices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/17/amazon-foxconn-china-will-tackle-illegal-work-practices","fields":{"headline":"Amazon supplier in China ‘will tackle illegal work practices’","bodyText":"Amazon and its Chinese supplier Foxconn have moved swiftly to tackle illegal working conditions exposed in an investigation by the Observer and rights group China Labor Watch. Temporary workers hired without basic rights such as sick pay and holiday pay have been offered staff contracts, and managers have been told to hire more workers to reduce levels of overtime. The company says it is also taking action to tackle “confusing” overtime payments. Amazon said last week that independent auditors had uncovered issues of concern at the factory in Hengyang, China, making its Kindle tablets and Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers. The investigation and the audit both found that Foxconn had hired too many agency workers – known as dispatch workers – in breach of Chinese labour laws and that payslips showed they had been paid a flat rate for overtime and regular work, instead of the time-and-a-half required by law. Excessive levels of overtime were also recorded. Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch, welcomed the changes but called on the companies to ensure workers were not left out of pocket. “It is good to hear Foxconn is addressing the violations found at the factory,” he said. “However, we hope both Amazon and Foxconn will ensure the dispatch workers, who were previously underpaid, receive the overtime pay they were entitled to in accordance with Chinese labour law. “This includes paying the dispatch workers who have already left the factory the wages they are owed.” Li wrote to Jeff Bezos, the billionaire Amazon CEO, last month setting out the findings of the investigation. Amazon said an independent audit in March had identified some of the issues raised, and that it had told Foxconn it expected urgent action to correct the problems. This weekend Foxconn issued a statement to the Observer saying it was addressing several issues identified in the factory. It said it had found that at peak periods, the number of temporary workers in the factory did “exceed targets and limits”. Agency workers can be laid off without pay when production falls and Chinese labour law restricts their use to just 10% of the workforce. Foxconn said it found that some agencies supplying staff had been taking payments for providing social insurance without passing on the benefits to the workers. In a statement Foxconn said: “We are revamping the recruitment policy at our Hengyang campus. We will convert these dispatch workers, should they wish to do so, into regular probationary employees, who can transition to regular employees after successfully completing three months of work.” It added: “Our management team in Hengyang has also reminded all recruitment agencies of the need to comply with Chinese law and our requirements, including ensuring that each worker receives a copy of the labour contract they sign with the recruitment agency. Foxconn will immediately terminate our relationship with any agency that does not comply with our requirements.” The company claimed that it had paid agency workers an “aggregate” hourly wage which included overtime, but admitted this might be “confusing”. In its statement Foxconn added that “while most of our operations were in compliance with our code of conduct, unfortunately, there were some instances where practices were not consistent with our code or the supplier requirements of our customers. We have taken immediate actions to bring them into compliance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/15/morocco-iran-world-cup-group-b-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T17:09:41Z","webTitle":"Aziz Bouhaddouz own goal in added time hands Iran win against Morocco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/morocco-iran-world-cup-group-b-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/15/morocco-iran-world-cup-group-b-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Aziz Bouhaddouz own goal in added time hands Iran win against Morocco","bodyText":"Even when the World Cup is bad, you have to watch until the end, because something you will be talking about for years could happen at any moment. Unfortunately for Aziz Bouhaddouz, Morocco might be discussing his injury-time own-goal that gave Iran a 1-0 win in this Group B game for some time to come. After a promising beginning this had turned into a stultifying, bad-tempered game that not many would have remembered until its unfortunate denouement. The Iran coach Carlos Queiroz’s assertion that it was a “beautiful” match was the sort of thing you say in the afterglow of ecstasy. That ecstasy arrived as the clock ticked over into the 95th minute: Ehsan Hajsafi swung a free-kick over from the left, and Bouhaddouz – on as a second-half substitute – stooped to head past his own goalkeeper. Afterwards he was in tears. “It was the worst thing that could have happened in injury time,” said the Morocco head coach, Hervé Renard. “We can only blame ourselves. We gave away a free-kick, then we scored against our own team.” Renard admitted that his hugely talented team should have taken advantage of an opening spell when they married skill and intensity with so many players – almost too many – looking to swarm forwards and create. But they could not turn their advantage into goals and, according to Queiroz at least, that was Iran’s plan all along. “Our strategy was to try to create a ‘mental collapse’ in the Morocco players,” he said. “We tried to frustrate them – we tried to block their playmakers.” It seemed to work, too. The Moroccans looked like they had developed a team-wide knack for making the wrong decision time after time, and it served to create a match that became increasingly grim to watch. A moment late on summed things up, when Hakim Ziyech spread a simple pass to Achraf Hakimi on the left flank, but he averted his gaze and let the ball bobble underneath his foot for a throw. Iran were not much better: their biggest threat, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, was anonymous: last season the AZ Alkmaar winger became the first Asian player to finish top-scorer of a major European league but he offered little here. Among the frustration there was a concerning moment with 20 minutes left when Watford’s Nordin Amrabat looked like he was knocked out after Hajsafi’s shoulder crashed into his jaw. His teammates gathered around and immediately looked fretful, as for a few seconds Amarabat did not move. He eventually got to his feet and tried to come back on, but after staggering around and having to be kept upright by the arms of the physios, sense prevailed and he was replaced by his brother, Sofyan. By the closing stages it looked a game everyone wanted to be over. But then Bouhaddouz intervened, a bullet header into his own net, and the Iranians present burst with joy. Afterwards they stayed on the pitch for a while, drinking in their victory and giving their coach the bumps. Celebrating like they had won the World Cup seemed a little excessive, but as Queiroz explained afterwards this is a team who have been fighting against the odds. “We came here without good preparations,” he said, referring to an assortment of issues that have hampered them, from friendlies being called off to international trade sanctions leading to Nike cancelling a boot deal. “To make these difficulties a source of inspiration is something very special. “It’s my duty to say ‘Let our boys play football.’ Let them enjoy football. They want to express themselves. This is 23 boys who just want to play football, and they showed today that they deserve to be respected like any other players.” This was a victory as unexpected as it was dramatic. When the draw was made Iran, despite having not lost a competitive game since the last World Cup, were the favourites to go out. This victory means they now go into their next fixture, against Spain on Wednesday, with a genuine chance of making it to the second round for the first time. “Superman is only in the cartoons,” said Queiroz. “Nobody is Superman. What can happen once in a while, is that a group of people when they are united, they can create super stories. We work together to create super results. Our attitude is to make the impossible, possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/15/england-fans-begin-arriving-volgograd-first-match","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T17:30:15Z","webTitle":"'I think it'll be all right': England fans begin arriving in Volgograd","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/england-fans-begin-arriving-volgograd-first-match","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/15/england-fans-begin-arriving-volgograd-first-match","fields":{"headline":"'I think it'll be all right': England fans begin arriving in Volgograd","bodyText":"England fans have started arriving in the Russian city of Volgograd before their team’s opening World Cup game on Monday and are abiding by strict warnings not to drape flags on second world war monuments. The city, formerly known as Stalingrad, is dominated by a statue known as the Motherland Calls, an 85-metre-tall sculpture of a woman raising a sword aloft, a memorial to the millions who died in the 1942-43 battle for the city. There are dozens of other monuments acknowledging the Russians who lost their lives during the Battle of Stalingrad scattered around the city. It had prompted concerns that England fans might provoke their hosts by hanging St George’s flags on them. British police have worked with the Football Supporters’ Federation to make supporters aware of sensitive sites and there was an excited but respectful atmosphere on the streets of Volgograd as fans from several countries mixed. Situated in the south of Russia, Volgograd was a closed city until the 1990s and there had been some uncertainty about how residents would respond to the expected 4,000 England fans who began to trickle in on Friday before their side’s opening match against Tunisia on Monday. Some chose not to wear England shirts out of concern about attracting unwanted attention but most spoke of feeling welcomed by their hosts. One fan, who gave his name as Nobby Rob, from Cornwall, was proudly wearing his England shirt. “I flew via Riga in Latvia and Moscow to get here and mine is the only England shirt I’ve seen,” he said. “I think some others are a bit shy of wearing theirs but I’ve been all over the world watching England in it and didn’t want to stop now.” During Euro 2016 in France organised groups of Russians clashed with England fans on the streets of Marseille, with the violence tarnishing the tournament. “I got gassed in Marseille,” said Rob. “But I think Vladimir Putin doesn’t want it to kick off here so I think it will be all right.” At the airport, volunteers handed out pamphlets welcoming visitors to Volgograd. It claimed a number of myths about the country had been allowed to take hold. “The Russians are kind, friendly and hospitable people, always ready to help,” it said. “We are the same people like you are. And no, Russians don’t drink vodka all the time.” When a delegation from the Football Association visited the city in February it was so cold the Volga had frozen over. But the mercury hit 34C (93F) on Friday as supporters sought shade at the Fifa Fan Fest, a public viewing site where every game will be shown on a giant screen.

As debate once again rages regarding the attritional nature of the US Open, the tournament’s organisers could be afforded the perfect response. Johnson entered this major as the top-ranked player in the world and fresh from success in last weekend’s St Jude Classic. Should a golfer of this standing win what would be a second US Open, there can be little external complaint. Though there is still half of the tournament to be played, Johnson’s touch suggests he is in the mood for a procession – that is, another one. Last Sunday he won by six shots. A second round of 67 left Johnson four under par at Shinnecock Hills. His advantage is the same figure from Scott Piercy and Charley Hoffman. Ian Poulter signed for a 72 to sit five adrift of the lead. He had been only one behind before chaos on the 8th, his 17th, resulted in a wounding triple-bogey seven. What the US Open giveth and all that. Justin Rose was not of a mind to be outdone by his on-form Ryder Cup team-mate, with the 2013 champion moving to within three of the lead before handing shots back to the course on his final two holes. “I had an opportunity today,” said a rueful Rose. “But you have to remember Dustin is only a hole away from putting everyone back in it.” Poulter, Rose and Tommy Fleetwood all find themselves five shots off the lead. A strong leaderboard also has Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick and Brooks Koepka lurking with intent. Johnson is unlikely to have matters all his own way. He will not, however, have Rory McIlroy as a challenger after the Northern Irishman missed a third US Open cut in three years. Far from bemoaning the occasional brutality of the US Open, Johnson, who won at the equally fearsome Oakmont two years ago, relishes it. “You’ve got to play really good golf if you want to shoot a good score and I like where par is a good score on every hole no matter what club you got in your hand or what hole it is,” he said. “The fairways are fairly generous but with crosswinds on every hole, they’re still tough to hit. Even though you’re in the middle of the fairway, a lot of times with a wedge you’ve still got to hit a good shot just to give yourself a 15- or 20-footer.” If Johnson is the man to catch, Friday arguably belonged to Fleetwood. The Englishman returned a superb 66, capped off by a glorious 25ft birdie putt at his closing hole. Fleetwood’s total is plus one. “I was six over through 15 holes of the tournament and struggling,” Fleetwood recalled. “I had missed a few putts and I was on a really bad run of bogeys. I still had three holes left. Thankfully I managed to grab one in the last three, then shoot 66 and all of a sudden you’re in contention.” Henrik Stenson played the front nine in 38, with an inward half of 32 assisted by an eagle three at the 16th. He thereby matched Fleetwood’s aggregate. Statistical gurus highlighted the Swede as a decent US Open bet before a ball was struck, owing to his accuracy over this PGA Tour season. The 2016 Open champion answered with a smile when asked whether the imperious Johnson remains catchable. “He’s always catchable,” said Stenson. “I think he’s playing some really good golf, obviously, coming off a win last week and he has posted two really good rounds. He’s going to be hard to catch but I’ll let him answer those questions. Thank you.” And with that, Stenson was off. Tiger Woods waved goodbye with a smile of his own when holing out for a birdie on his closing hole, but 72 in his second round was not sufficient to repair damage done on the previous day. Woods headed home with an aggregate of 10 over par for only his eighth missed major cut as a professional. The three-times US Open winner, who partnered Johnson, was high in praise for the tournament leader. “Dustin was in complete control of what he was doing,” Woods said. “He’s hitting the ball so flush and so solid. It’s windy and blustery here, it was raining early but he’s hitting right through it. “It was good to see because I watched a little bit of it last week and he was doing the same thing down there. He has brought it up here and is doing it under these conditions. He’s got beautiful speed on the greens. Every putt looked like it was going to go in. Even though it didn’t, it just had that look and that pace.” Woods was later asked whether he truly feels this latest return from injury can yield a 15th major title. “Absolutely,” was the firm response from the 42-year-old. Well, if the man himself has faith, then maybe everyone should."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/15/cristiano-ronaldo-portugal-spain-diego-costa-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T09:16:25Z","webTitle":"Cristiano Ronaldo steals the spotlight despite Diego Costa’s best efforts | Paul MacInnes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/cristiano-ronaldo-portugal-spain-diego-costa-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/15/cristiano-ronaldo-portugal-spain-diego-costa-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Ronaldo steals the spotlight despite Diego Costa’s best efforts","bodyText":"Age shall not wither him nor custom stale his infinite variety. Ruthless Ronnie was at it again, his 51st career hat-trick topped off with a superlative last knockings free-kick hit with a new technique. Alongside that there was the pace he should have lost five years ago, an efficacy of action that bordered on the supreme and the spatial awareness of a quantity surveyor. The Portugal captain gave a display that was enough to jump-start the World Cup in and of itself. But the delight of this match was that his performance was only one of many intriguing subplots. Let’s dwell on the big man for a little longer, though. Thirty-three years old and off the back of another Champions League title, another 40-goal season, there remains not one sign of a weakening of his will to win. Perhaps, in fact, it is the opposite, as if the impediments that nature tries to put in his way have been transformed into just another opponent on the pitch, another obstacle to get round. On the evidence of this match Ronaldo appears even to be winning the battle with time. The pace he showed on the counterattack against Spain was terrifying. It may not be common to see him sprinting as much as this, given the way Real Madrid tend to dominate the ball, but there is no doubt he still has it in him. At the same time he has the cunning and mental wherewithal that only experience can bring. Even then they are tools that are available only when one is determined to use that experience to advantage. He knew Nacho was the uncommon link in this Spanish side and so, in the third minute, he ran at it. Pulling out the stepovers as if he was still a teenager, he duly drew a foul and stepped up to convert the penalty by sending David de Gea the wrong way. Ronaldo’s 27 first-half touches were judicious, every one; in the 16th minute a single backheeled flick on the halfway line sprang the entire Spain defence. With his second goal, just before half-time, you would not put it past him to have hit the shot straight at De Gea just to put the Spanish keeper under extra psychological pressure. The late, uproarious third was a free-kick. Rather than being struck through the laces in the way he trademarked (before being imitated by so many others) he whipped it round the Spanish wall. He also rolled up the right leg on his short shorts before striking it, another Ronaldo innovation. So far, so iincomparable, but that was hardly all. At the other end, weighing in at 192 pounds and standing out like a redwood in a team of bonsai trees was Diego Costa. Before the Spanish FA decided to create a national psychodrama by asserting their primacy in HR matters, Costa’s place in the team was probably the most contentious issue in camp. Was his skill set suited to a team who have a long-standing way of playing? If not, would he be willing or able to adapt himself to their needs? The answers, on this display at least, were no and not really, but rather delightfully it did not matter. The Spanish No 19 was a one-man plan B and he was available from the first whistle. His tiki-taka teammates were not overly inclined to use his very particular set of skills but when they did Costa was in the mood for merking. His first goal began with the incidental pleasure of watching Pepe misjudge the milking of a minor infraction. It ended with that simple combination of brute strength and artisanal precision that is the mark of the former Chelsea man. Costa’s second goal, bundled in on the line from a Sergio Busquets knockdown was just as characteristic. He may not be able to dance round three opponents before playing a cross through a full-back’s legs, but he is certainly good for some other things. One match, two headlines, and both delivered by men the subject of investigation by Spanish tax authorities. After a relatively lacklustre start to the tournament that would have been enough. But this game had a supporting cast of storylines, too, and Uruguay v Egypt would have loved to have borrowed any one of them. First, there was that De Gea blooper. It seems a long time since Alex Ferguson had to attack referees after matches in order to deflect attention from the Spaniard dropping crosses. In fact it may be De Gea’s first error since 2011. But it happens to the best of them, as well as most England keepers. Then there was a dazzling display from Isco, and a severe case of stage fright from Goncalo Guedes. Oh and Nacho, a guy who has six goals in his Real Madrid career, scores his first for his country with a strike that is almost certainly through to the goal of the tournament montage if not the top three. This was a match all right and for those who, at 6.50pm, had written it all off as indigestion, it turns out they were wrong. Fully blown cases of World Cup fever have now been confirmed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/15/spain-portugal-world-cup-group-b-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T19:58:38Z","webTitle":"Cristiano Ronaldo hits hat-trick as Portugal deny Spain in six-goal thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/spain-portugal-world-cup-group-b-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/15/spain-portugal-world-cup-group-b-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Cristiano Ronaldo hits hat-trick as Portugal deny Spain in six-goal thriller","bodyText":"After all the fall-out, the football: a classic clash, Portugal’s manager Fernando Santos had called it the day before and it turned out he was not far off. Twice Portugal led, twice Spain equalised and then took a lead that felt like a liberation. But, with one minute to go, Cristiano Ronaldo curled in a wonderful free-kick to complete a hat-trick and give a superb night an unexpected ending. For all that other stuff sometimes seems to eclipse the game and for all it can feel as if the garnish has eaten the steak in the words of one Spanish coach, the game fights back. Football tends to find a way. Here Spain found a way and Ronaldo certainly did. Portugal almost got a winner, too, right at the end – twice, in fact – but that would have been even harsher on Spain than the result already was. Portugal had three efforts on target, only five overall, and all three went in. After the days Spain have had, seeing their manager announce a move to Real Madrid in the afternoon and their president sack him the following morning, listening as the federation and Madrid accused each other, defeat might have hurt Spain. Yet for most of the night here there was little sign of any lasting effects of what Sergio Ramos called “delicate days”. Perhaps it was simple: perhaps recovery was always most likely to come with the opportunity to get back to what they know: playing football very, very well. They might have lost their manager two days before the World Cup but Spain are still Spain. And Ronaldo is Ronaldo. Spain did not win because of him and in part because of a mistake from David de Gea too. But while the late equaliser may leave regret, there should be comfort in the fact that even conceding after three minutes had not sunk them. Nor did conceding a daft second just before half-time. Spain have Isco, Andrés Iniesta and David Silva, after all. They also have Diego Costa: the one big doubt, even from Julen Lopetegui’s era (all of three days ago now), he appeared at their moment of greatest need, scoring twice. Any vulnerability was tested immediately. Only two minutes had gone when Ronaldo tumbled over Nacho Rodríguez to win a penalty from which he opened the scoring. The clock showed 3.30. Five minutes later Spain appeared to be still disoriented, denied the thing that makes them Spain: the ball. It did not last. Costa laid off to Silva who hit over and bit by bit They worked their way in, Isco taking responsibility to get them going. But the risk remained. In the air and on the run Portugal looked faster, stronger, higher. Portugal’s intention had appeared clear after 47 seconds when Pepe waved Gonçalo Guedes forward and sent it long towards him. Guedes is swift indeed but twice he failed to finish dangerous breaks, his team tearing through the middle. On the first he seemed unsure what to do, doubting whether Ronaldo was going to join the run. On the second, a slick, precise move that released Bernard Silva on the right saw Ronaldo drop it off to him in the area but he was indecisive. While Spain had the ball, Portugal carried arguably the great threat. But then, suddenly, Costa did what Costa does. He may seem an awkward fit with Spain at times but he is good at this and he brought them level, gave them life and changed the game. He may have changed Spain’s tournament too. He leapt with Pepe, crashing into him, forearm first. Pepe tumbled, Costa continued. He turned, stopped, bumped, turned again, away from José Fonte and Cédric Soares, and struck into the bottom corner, three men lying on the floor inside the Portuguese penalty area. Spain’s substitutes raced from the bench, as if they were released. As if they all were. This game, though, had a lot more left in it. Isco thumped a shot off the underside of the bar that landed plumb on the line and, although Spain were denied, it seemed they were back: the ball moving fast, Isco and Iniesta combining, Jordi Alba whizzing along outside. A sharp combination between Costa, Isco, Iniesta and Alba finished with Iniesta’s shot skidding past Koke and just wide. In truth clear chances were few and Portugal speared passes into space beyond Spain, for whom corners often felt more like a concern than an opportunity. Guedes, Silva and Ronaldo led the race and just before the break, Guedes controlled near the edge of the area and laid back to Ronaldo. His shot was simple enough but it slipped in off De Gea’s hands and into the net. The remedy came fast. A planned free-kick – presumably Lopetegui’s legacy – saw Iniesta clip to Sergio Busquets, who nodded back across the six-yard box for Costa to force the finish from close range. And then, two minutes later, as Spain worked their way in on the left once more, a sliced clearance came to Nacho on the edge of the area. He thumped the ball on the bounce and it flew in off both posts. The touch and passing had been good before; it was impeccable now. Spain took control, the ball theirs. There was even the occasional olés amidst the fans trying to get a Mexican wave going. If that sounds like Spain, they looked like Spain too. They also looked set for an impressive, therapeutic and deserved victory. But, as Fernando Hierro, the man who never expected to be standing there on the touchline, said: “When there’s someone like Ronaldo out there, these things can happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/jun/19/david-copperfield-summer-of-magic-exhibits-his-collection-of-wonders","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T15:00:10Z","webTitle":"Summer of magic: David Copperfield exhibits his collection of wonders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jun/19/david-copperfield-summer-of-magic-exhibits-his-collection-of-wonders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jun/19/david-copperfield-summer-of-magic-exhibits-his-collection-of-wonders","fields":{"headline":"Summer of magic: David Copperfield exhibits his collection of wonders","bodyText":"Those attending the press preview of the New York Historical Society’s latest exhibition expected a tour of David Copperfield’s personal collection of magic paraphernalia, widely regarded to be the biggest and most comprehensive such archive in the world. What we didn’t expect, however, was a tour guided by Copperfield himself, who emerged from behind a lectern in the museum’s vestibule, in the sleek all-black ensemble he often wears onstage, to unveil Summer of Magic: Treasures from the David Copperfield Collection. Both an ode to the rich history of magic in New York City, and an itemized primer on the conjurors and illusionists who preceded Copperfield, the show came about after the museum’s assistant curator of exhibitions, Cristian Petru Panaite, emailed the magician last fall asking for a tour of his collection. Known as the International Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts, it’s housed in a windowless Vegas warehouse and contains over 200,000 trinkets and artefacts that amount, more or less, to a multi-century history of magic, from Harry Keller to Chung Ling Soo. “The New York Historical Society has been interested for quite some time in exploring magic as entertainment and as art,” said Panaite, who in 1991 watched Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear on television in his native Romania, where such spectacles were censored until after the fall of communism. “I wrote David, having read about the collection, and I actually remember waking my wife up after getting a text back from him. So it’s very special and surreal for me to be able to curate this exhibition.” To watch Copperfield explore the exhibit, staged just a mile north of the Times Square magic shops he perused obsessively as a teenager, is a bit like watching an episode of Cosmos with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. One moment Copperfield’s an unabashed fanboy, presumably no different than the 12-year-old who regularly took the train from New Jersey to the Tannen’s Magic Shop. And the next he’s a walking encyclopedia, lecturing us about Harry Houdini’s infamous metamorphosis trunk and breaking down heated rivalries among early 20th century magicians. “Houdini didn’t like many magicians because they were all ripping him off,” he said. “I know the feeling.” Copperfield, who began performing professionally at age 12 as “Davino the Boy Magician”, was inspired by Houdini’s daredevilry, which had an emotional component that transcended mere showmanship. “It wasn’t just a trick or a challenge, they were rooting for him. And that’s why we remember Houdini to this day,” he says. “I saw this and said, ‘Gosh, this is kind of cool.’ My personal passion was telling stories based in Broadway or MGM musicals, so we invented this next piece you’re about to see...” The 61-year-old proceeds to “Death Saw”, the massive, and massively anxiety-inducing, moving contraption he used to chop himself in two in a 1988 special on CBS. “People thought this was going to be an escape because, when someone would get strapped to a table or train tracks, everyone was conditioned to expect them to get out before the train hits,” he said as footage of the original stunt played. “The audience was really upset. A few years later they knew what was coming, but the first time they really freaked out.” Though Copperfield emerged from the death saw unscathed, other illusionists haven’t been as lucky. In the section of the exhibition dedicated to the “Masters of Magic”, various ephemera from 19th century conjurors like Alexander Herrman and Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin are displayed in perspex cases. Among them is the musket with which Williams Ellsworth Robinson, who performed as an Asian man named Chung Ling Soo, fatally attempted the “bullet catch” trick at the Wood Green Empire in London in 1918. “16 people have died doing this,” said Copperfield. “But the most famous one was Chung Ling Soo.” In another corridor is a recreation of Tannen’s, the magic shop Copperfield describes as the center of his boyhood existence. It was there he saw entertainers like Dick Cavett, Frank Sinatra and Orson Welles – “everybody on the Ed Sullivan show,” as he puts it. “It was like being in heaven,” Copperfield said. “It’s important to remember, because there’s fewer and fewer magic shops today, but the brick-and-mortar magic shop was a place you just couldn’t believe. You’d save your money and buy the magic piece and when you’d go home you thought you were the hero.” Although Summer of Magic is nothing if not nostalgic, the items as assembled illustrate how the craft constantly points toward the future. George Méliès, the illusionist-turned-film-maker, shot A Trip to the Moon almost 70 years before Neil Armstrong stepped foot on it. And a turban on display, which once belonged the vaudeville magician Alexander the Man Who Knows, was equipped with radios before people knew what they were. “This is important because magic has given us technology we wouldn’t normally have,” said Copperfield. “The magic I’m doing, eventually the secret will be revealed and it will become common. Kids see something, a trip to the moon, and go, ‘Maybe it is possible.’ I think that’s a great legacy to have, and that’s why I do what I do.” Summer of Magic: Treasures from the David Copperfield Collection is on view at the New-York Historical Society until 16 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/16/ireland-portugal-greece-spain-ten-years-after-crash-austerity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"Ten years on, how countries that crashed are faring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/16/ireland-portugal-greece-spain-ten-years-after-crash-austerity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/16/ireland-portugal-greece-spain-ten-years-after-crash-austerity","fields":{"headline":"Ten years on, how countries that crashed are faring","bodyText":"Ireland Three years after it was saved from bankruptcy in 2010 with a €67.5bn rescue loan, Ireland became the first stricken eurozone state to stand on its own two feet. Dramatic austerity measures, including steep cuts to many public sector workers’ pay, had satisfied the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund that their loans would be safely paid back. The finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, was quick to dampen the celebrations with a warning against ever allowing another property bubble to grow and burst. The crash, he said, caused the country’s worst period since the potato famine of the 19th century. Noonan was probably upset to see a recent Knight Frank global property report that ranked Ireland in the top five hotspots over the past year, and figures showing prices in the swankier areas of Dublin are getting close to their 2007 peak. A dearth of housebuilding over the past 10 years, despite rising household incomes and a sharp increase in employment (from 1.8 million in 2012 to well over 2.1 million last year), has also sent rents soaring, leaving many young workers to miss out on the recovery. Meanwhile homelessness remains a major problem across the country. And in some areas negative equity and mortgage arrears mean the scars of recession remain. More than 8% of the population live in consistent poverty and 7% of mortgages are still more than three months in arrears. It makes for a divided nation, uneasy about a recovery. A recent Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI poll found that 52% of voters are “dissatisfied with the way the government is running the country” compared with only 37% that are satisfied. Portugal Lisbon followed the post-crash route charted by the UK and Ireland of punishing austerity before voters in 2015 ditched the rightwing government led by Pedro Passos Coelho in favour of the socialist leader António Costa. Since then, austerity has eased, consumer and business confidence has recovered and GDP growth has stayed above 2%. Costa recently told the European parliament that, thanks to his government’s alternative economic approach, Portuguese people, in contrast to many European countries, had regained their “trust in the democratic institutions and in their belief in the EU”. He reeled off a list of economic achievements, including reduced inequality, increasing employment and a budget deficit well within EU rules. Last year the European commission released Portugal from its bailout conditions. Last October Costa swept the board in local elections that gave the socialists a record haul of 158 town halls out of the country’s 308 cities and towns. Like Ireland, Greece and Spain, the country suffered an exodus of young people in the wake of the crash, many of whom are unlikely to return. With a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of 146% last year, there is still a mountain to climb to reduce the credit bill. Greece The collapse of the rightwing New Democracy government amid riots and strikes in 2015 ushered in the radical leftist government of Alexis Tsipras, who agreed a bailout with the EU of €86bn. It was the third time Greece had almost gone bust since 2010, when the Greek debt crisis started and the country received €110bn in bailout money before Brussels agreed a further €130bn in 2012. After almost 10 years of eye-watering austerity, in which taxes have risen, welfare subsidies have been cut, pensions reduced and thousands of public sector workers made redundant, the government is poised to agree the final tranche of loans from the EU before being set free in August. But there are few economists who believe a country with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 180% can generate the funds needed to invest in the economy and pay back the loans. Tsipras is set to agree terms for the end of the third bailout that will mean further austerity measures and running a large public sector surplus until 2022. No other OECD country has managed to spend less than it receives in taxes for as long as the Greeks are expected to. More hopefully, tourism is back at record levels and some young professionals are beginning to return after a decade abroad. Spain Madrid avoided a comprehensive bailout, but the collapse of its banking system meant that in the crisis months of 2012, when Greece and Ireland were on the brink, Mariano Rajoy’s rightwing government agreed to borrow €100bn from Brussels. Rajoy was under pressure after the giant banking group Bankia had asked for a €19bn state rescue, and international investors effectively locked Spain out of the financial markets. Like Ireland, Spain has recovered strongly since then. GDP growth between 2015 and 2017 averaged 3.2% as employment climbed and household incomes recovered. But some regions have bounced back more quickly than others, causing political strife. Several leaders from Catalonia, which boasts the headquarters of Mango and Zara, among other companies, remain either in jail or exile following protests that brought the region to the brink of breaking away. Rajoy was recently deposed following a vote of no confidence that ushered in the socialist leader Pedro Sánchez, who is expected to ease austerity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/17/beyonce-jay-z-put-visionary-film-touki-bouki-africa-spotlight","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T05:00:09Z","webTitle":"How Beyoncé and Jay-Z put a visionary African film back in the spotlight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/17/beyonce-jay-z-put-visionary-film-touki-bouki-africa-spotlight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/17/beyonce-jay-z-put-visionary-film-touki-bouki-africa-spotlight","fields":{"headline":"How Beyoncé and Jay-Z put a visionary African film back in the spotlight","bodyText":"The image is arresting: a man sits astride a motorcycle, the handlebars adorned with the giant skull of a zebu, its horns forming a wide skeletal embrace. His head is turned; something beyond the frame has caught his attention. Seated behind him is a woman, her hands on his shoulders, staring straight down the lens. To some, this photograph will be instantly recognisable as a homage to Touki Bouki (the title means “The Hyena’s Journey”), generally credited as the first African avant-garde film. The fact that the couple in the modern restaging are Jay- Z and Beyoncé, with the image spearheading the promotional campaign for their On the Run II world tour, has propelled this little-known but visionary Senegalese film into the spotlight some 45 years after it was made. Jay-Z and Beyoncé leave the UK this weekend with praise for the two-and-a-half hour stadium extravaganza ringing in their ears. In the Observer, Kitty Empire called parts of the show “unbearably exciting”, while Rachel Aroesti in the Guardian declared it “staggeringly impressive”. It’s tempting to hope that even a handful of the millions of fans who flock to the tour between now and October will investigate the film that has been one of its inspirations. Difficult to see since its initial release in 1973, Touki Bouki re-entered circulation 10 years ago when it was restored as part of the World Cinema Project by Martin Scorsese, who called it “a cinematic poem made with a raw, wild energy”. It was filmed in Senegal for about $30,000 by the actor-turned-director Djibril Diop Mambéty and tells of the young cowherd Mory (Magaye Niang) and his student girlfriend Anta (Mareme Niang), who dream of fleeing the dusty, desperate streets of Dakar’s Colobane district for Paris. But the prospect of leaving home is a complicated one for these Africans inculcated by colonialism. Touki Bouki was radical in resisting the social realist tradition already sweeping through African cinema in favour of a more impressionistic, herky-jerky romanticism reminiscent of Godard. “What matters here is not realism,” wrote the critic Amy Taubin when the film resurfaced briefly in New York in 1988, “but how film as one form of storytelling reveals the collective fantasy of a culture. The couple’s escape attempt might have happened, or it might have been imagined by the man, the woman or both as they lay dreaming in the sun.” Reality, memory and daydreams flood into one another through sophisticated cross-cutting and dislocations of sound and image: the roar of Mory’s motorbike plays over a shot of cattle, while Josephine Baker sings of “Par-ee, Par-ee, Par-ee” as the camera surveys the parched rural landscape. That song makes several crackly appearances, though each time the stylus skips back so that we never hear more than a few seconds. The song is doomed to be stuck in its groove, dreaming of better things but never quite getting there – much like Mory, who freezes on the gangplank, tormented by the memory of a cow being dragged unceremoniously to slaughter. Mambéty wasn’t the first film-maker to equate doomed humans with their bestial equivalent – Eisenstein used the analogy in his 1925 film Strike – but the colonialism that has left Mory alienated at home, yet unable to escape, gives the material a powerful new tenor. The picture won prizes in Cannes and Moscow but was poorly received at home. “Here in Senegal, it was a big commercial flop and was taken off screen after only four days,” recalled Ben Diogaye Bèye, its assistant director. “By showing the fantasies of the youth of Colobane, Djibril also brought out their defects and they did not forgive him for that.” He didn’t direct another feature until Hyènes 19 years later in 1992. Magaye Niang attributed this extended gap to Mambéty’s perfectionism: “His aim was to make masterpieces.” The director’s own explanations tended toward the cryptic or whimsical. Shortly before his death from cancer in 1998 at the age of 53, he was questioned about his lack of productivity. “I had a love affair with a princess called Tortoise,” he said. Though Mambéty died young, Touki Bouki has had an unusual and extended afterlife. It continues to be highly regarded, and not only by Scorsese. The black British film-maker John Akomfrah has called it “an absolute gem” and “the one indisputable masterpiece of the African avant garde.” Mambéty’s niece, the actor and film-maker Mati Diop (herself the daughter of the renowned musician Wasis Diop), directed the 2013 semi-documentary A Thousand Suns, which centres around a public screening of Touki Bouki and asks why Niang, like the character he played, never left Senegal. “Touki means ‘to travel’ and you are stuck!” his friends taunt him. “You should have travelled!” The film ends with a poignant phone conversation between him and Mareme Niang, who did make the break, like her character Anta, and now lives in Alaska. Diop has professed herself “a little troubled” about the appropriation of Touki Bouki by Jay-Z and Beyoncé. “It looks like it’s an art director who brought them the image, and no one has been concerned about what artistic and political story is behind it,” she told Libération. “It is depressing and fascinating at the same time, the unbearable lightness of the mainstream.” It is certainly unfortunate that the couple invoked the glories of African cinema on a tour that doesn’t call at a single country on that continent. Perhaps in the wake of their tumultuous relationship, and the references that On the Run II makes to their personal ups and downs, they were drawn merely to the incendiary nature of its vision. “Touki Bouki was conceived at the time of a very violent crisis in my life,” Mambéty once said. “I wanted to make a lot of things explode.” As Scorsese later observed: “That’s just what he did. Touki Bouki explodes one image at a time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/16/world-cup-needs-iconography-lionel-messi-lifting-trophy","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T06:00:38Z","webTitle":"World Cup needs the iconography of Lionel Messi lifting trophy | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/16/world-cup-needs-iconography-lionel-messi-lifting-trophy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/16/world-cup-needs-iconography-lionel-messi-lifting-trophy","fields":{"headline":"World Cup needs the iconography of Lionel Messi lifting trophy","bodyText":"Moscow is a fascinating place to enter for the first time, its fringes marked by an endless scroll of huge stickle-brick buildings and gaudy roadside shopping complexes. Heading in from this angle, before the austere majesty of the city centre, it seems the chief beneficiary of Russia’s great opening out was that well-known US imperialist Colonel Sanders, who can be seen grinning down like Lenin’s crispy-fried southern gentleman cousin from his endless lighted placards, impassive, stoical and oddly comforting. But then, like many other nations, Russia does love an icon. Look around the early days of this World Cup and certain faces just keep looming up in wide-screen scale. Statues of the actual, non-chicken Lenin can be found at 82 Moscow locations, including the Luzhniki Stadium, where the Father of the Revolution towers above stalls for Qatar Air and Chinese yoghurt, eyes turned towards the skyline with a look of fearless destiny, mixed with a little mild exasperation. To the north of the city the entrance to the Spartak Stadium is guarded by a 25-metre effigy of Spartacus himself, sword drawn in defence of the pitch where Lionel Messi and Argentina will play Iceland on Saturday afternoon. Meanwhile, turn on your TV to catch the previews and the chances are the visage of that other great anti-hero José Mourinho will come leaping out of the screen in his role as pundit for Russia Today. Mourinho was a star of the opening‑day coverage, windswept on a balcony above Red Square, bathed in wondrous evening sunlight, looking like the man who sold the world. At one point there was an embarrassment of televisual riches as we cut from José straight to Mark Bosnich, dressed in an open collar shirt with hair swept back, resembling a glamorous society helicopter‑salesman who lost it all in a ponzi scheme and is now living in a Reno motel. Mourinho is billed as a “co-host” on RT. He will not like that. And to be fair it is hard to think of anyone less suited to a career as a TV presenter. But Mourinho’s lip-curling manner, his refusal to be impressed by anything at all, is quite refreshing, as is his total conviction that, whatever else might be going on, the real story here is called José Mourinho and is sneering pityingly at Peter Schmeichel on a Moscow rooftop. Except, of course, it is not. Messi may be about to turn 31, with 124 caps on the clock, but he remains the most significant presence at this World Cup, albeit not without a little nuance. At the pre-match press conference in Moscow there was the usual hushed tribute of his all-time qualities but there is something a bit different about Leo in Moscow. Travel to any football event over the last decade and Messi comes at you from every angle, decorating the street stalls, the hoardings and TV stings. So far in Russia the greatest player of the modern age has been present in dilute form. In part this is perhaps commercial. Messi sells his image to Pepsi and Mastercard. The World Cup is all Visa and Coke. Plus he is more or less unavailable these days, safe within his own sealed space, a star beyond the everyday. There is something more, though, something to do with stars and Messi’s own unspooling into the legacy years. The old talk about how he needs to win a World Cup to complete the game will be trotted out again. But this is one cliche that could do with a refit. In fact the opposite is true. It is instead the World Cup that needs Messi these days. It is tempting to rail against the lure of celebrity, to yearn for new faces and underdog triumphs. In its great years the World Cup simply made its own stars. But it has not had an outstanding trophy-winning individual performance for some time. The last obvious poster boy was Ronaldo in 2002. Zinedine Zidane was brilliant for periods in 2006. Germany were an advert for a way of playing, an industrial-scale production project. But what about the madness, the iconography, that old, insatiable Maradona-scale will to power? This is how things are now. Club football is more than ever driven by a personality cult, captivated by the preening, oddly sensual obsession with star players. Even the angles and lines of the TV coverage promote this feeling of opposed personalities, the fast‑cut to some beaming, yowling star, HD-captured, wondrously groomed, decked in flattering muscle‑tight nylon. The Messi-Ronaldo industrial complex has fed on this, has thrown every unit of its brilliance into driving European club football on to its current state of supremacy. It has been thrilling to watch. But the World Cup needs a taste now, needs to align itself with those currents of power, a tournament that craves the defining image of Argentina’s No10 – or indeed Cristiano Ronaldo or Neymar – lifting the trophy. The question remains: has it missed the boat? Ronaldo is 33 now and Portugal are not Real Madrid. Neymar could yet apply the full range of his princely powers and use this tournament as a springboard for his own succession plans. But Messi would be the real catch. This grandfatherly old juggernaut would be defibrillated at a stroke by a touch of his genius, would feed off that image, Leo with the great, golden Blatter-head cradled aloft. Odd as it might sound, the question is whether he really needs it in return – or at least how much and how desperately."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/15/nhs-funding-budget-boost-jeremy-hunt-philip-hammond-negotiations","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T18:09:35Z","webTitle":"Hunt and Hammond 'gridlocked' over NHS funding rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/nhs-funding-budget-boost-jeremy-hunt-philip-hammond-negotiations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/15/nhs-funding-budget-boost-jeremy-hunt-philip-hammond-negotiations","fields":{"headline":"Hunt and Hammond 'gridlocked' over NHS funding rise","bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt and Philip Hammond remain “gridlocked” over how much extra money the NHS should receive, hours before Theresa May is due to unveil a spending bonanza designed to rescue the ailing health service. The health secretary and the chancellor have still not agreed the percentage increase to be received by the NHS in England from next April in a dramatic break with eight years of Conservative austerity policies. It is understood that May is keen to mark the 70th birthday of the health service on 5 July. Hunt is holding out for a rise that would bring NHS England’s budget to between £157bn and £160bn – up to £32bn more than it gets now – by the end of this parliament in 2022-23. But Hammond, worried about the potential impact of such a dramatic uplift in health spending on the wider public finances, is trying to limit the rise to a more affordable sum. Hammond, Hunt and Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, spent much of Friday in negotiations, conducted initially by telephone and in the afternoon at 11 Downing Street, the chancellor’s official residence. Their talks followed newspaper reports that May could soon hand the NHS a funding boost of anywhere between £4bn and £6bn a year. The main sticking point between Hammond and Hunt is the percentage, somewhere between 3% and 4%, of the annual increase to be received by the NHS every year from 2019-20 until and including 2022-23, to honour the prime minister’s pledge of handing it a long-term funding deal. “They are gridlocked between the completely different amounts [either 3.3% or 4%],” said a source close to the negotiations. A well-placed Whitehall source added: “They are not miles apart, but equally they are not inches apart either.” Stevens, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Health Foundation and NHS bodies have made clear that the service needs a series of 4% rises, but a 3.3% increase is the very least it must receive. Hunt has endorsed the 3.3% figure as the bare minimum, while May also believes anything less will mean the NHS is unable to significantly improve its performance. A 4% annual rise for the next four years would increase the NHS budget by £32.3bn to £160.5bn by 2022-23, an average of £8.1bn a year, according to analysis by the Health Foundation. But restricting the rise to 3.3% would bring the budget to £156.2bn, an annual increase of £7bn, leaving Hammond £4.3bn to spend in other areas, such as the military, police or schools. Hunt and Stevens are hoping to persuade Hammond to agree a rise of at least 3.5%, and ideally above that, so the NHS can make major progress on improving cancer, mental health and maternity care and strides in other key priority areas. The trio have to iron out the final details of the funding package before May announces the budget boost in an expected appearance on The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One on Sunday morning, and then gives more detail at an event with Hunt on Monday. The risk for the government if Hammond does not agree to Hunt and Stevens’ demands has been underlined by new analysis by the Health Foundation, showing that limiting the rise to 3.3% would force patients to wait even longer for care. According to the foundation, that would lead to: • The number of patients waiting for planned hospital treatment soaring from 4.2 million to a record 5.5 million. • Even fewer patients requiring urgent cancer treatment receiving it within 62 days of being referred by their GP. • And even larger numbers of A&amp;E patients having to wait more than the supposed four-hour maximum to be treated and then admitted, transferred or discharged. Prof Anita Charlesworth, the Health Foundation’s chief economist, said: “Annual increases of 3.3% a year above inflation are the minimum required to prevent services from further decline. But stemming decline should not be the goal for the NHS in its 70th year. “After eight years of austerity, people are waiting too long for care, the NHS doesn’t have enough clinical staff, public health budgets have been cut and just four in 10 people with a mental health problem get any help at all. “If we are to make any inroads into these problems and secure the health service for the future, funding needs to increase by at least 4% a year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/24/caitlin-moran-interview-how-to-be-famous","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T09:00:22Z","webTitle":"Caitlin Moran: ‘I address the taboos that need to be busted’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/24/caitlin-moran-interview-how-to-be-famous","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/24/caitlin-moran-interview-how-to-be-famous","fields":{"headline":"Caitlin Moran: ‘I address the taboos that need to be busted’","bodyText":"Raised and home-schooled in Wolverhampton, Caitlin Moran became a journalist aged 15 and is now an award-winning writer at the Times. Her 2011 nonfiction memoir How to Be a Woman is an international bestseller, while How to Build a Girl, the first novel in her semi-autobiographical trilogy about a teenager called Johanna Morrigan, is being made into a feature film. Its sequel, How to Be Famous, is out on Thursday (Ebury Press, £14.99). This is your third book with a ‘how to’ title. How come? I like writing useful books. I didn’t go to school. Everything I learned was from reading everything that interested me in Wolverhampton’s Warstone’s library. With a “how to” title you know what you’re going to get. If you call it, like, The Crying of Dolphins, people think: “Hmm, is that relevant to me?” Every book of mine is a list of topics I haven’t seen addressed, taboos that need to be busted, secrets that need to be told, things that I want to boggle at. What is everybody else not talking about or too scared to talk about? Although your new novel, with its plot about a powerful man sexually exploiting younger women, is very in tune with what everyone’s talking about. Yes, imagine sitting here every day and going on Twitter and you’re like: “Shit, this is literally the plot to this book!” I’d had the idea for 10 years. It was always about sexual shame, a tape, and becoming famous for the wrong reasons. When something awful happens and you become news, how do you deal with that? Revenge porn is a huge thing now for younger women. Johanna realises she needs to speak out. She’s saying: “Take your shame, it’s not mine.” And that was what the #MeToo movement was doing on a global scale. And it’s working! These fuckers are going to go to jail, it’s changing the industry. Johanna’s defiance seems to embody that of the #MeToo movement. What’s really important in the book is that Johanna would not be able to get to that defiance if she had not met Suzanne. Her friend Suzanne is older, she’s been through more, and she gives Johanna a platform. This is the thing that’s missing on social media, particularly in activism, it’s all young people with their anger. I wanted to write about female friendships and feminist mentors. We need more of that at the moment with activism. We tend to kill or ignore our tribal elders. Who is your feminist mentor? I loved Germaine Greer growing up – obviously she’s problematic now – but she wasn’t scared and I absolutely couldn’t imagine not being scared. Also when I was 17, Courtney Love took me under her wing – Suzanne is a bit based on her – I interviewed her a couple of times. Your books and your sitcom Raised By Wolves are based on your real life. Do you ever worry that you’ll run out of material? Within the panoply of fat, clever, working-class girls who really like to shag – I don’t think we’re overserved for those role models yet. Also, teenage girls are a cipher. Their concerns tell you precisely what the problems are with being an adult woman in any era. And right now, one in 10 teenage girls is being referred to mental health services. Girls are rejecting the idea of being an adult woman. Do you think it’s the worst time to be a teenage girl? We’ve heaped a whole load of pressure on these women. My generation had it easy. When I was a teenager the Berlin Wall had come down, we were all taking ecstasy and running around like Pac-Men in nightclubs going “everything’s going to be great, hooray for liberalism”. We see these things being reversed now: the property and the jobs market have changed, there’s a rise in nationalism and populism. The thing is, the internet foregrounds all of our disagreements and we don’t have anywhere where we see all of our progress. So your book celebrates being a teenager, but the current reality is quite terrible? That’s why talking about things like teenage fandom and good sexuality is really important, all the things in the book. If you’re full of beauty and positive things it’s harder for stuff to get to you. Joy is not a luxury that you can tack on when you’ve sorted everything out, joy is how you will sort out your problems. There are bad things about social media but I look at my girls’ feeds expecting to just see loads of people posing in porny [positions] but they’re following all these brilliant accounts with girls who are showing their [fat] rolls or a thing they’ve crocheted. They’ve found their people. The internet can be whatever you choose it to be. My kids both like to work hard at school but I always say: “It’s as important for you now to come and watch this film, come for a walk, jump in this lake, these are your alternative plans.” It can’t just be school and Instagram. You once said, when you’re thinking about the next day’s writing you salivate. Do you do anything particular when you’ve finished writing? I don’t just salivate. I get tingly nips and my knees go warm. This [laptop] is my playing field, I’m like David Beckham there. I always time my finish so it’s exactly the minute before my kids come home from school. If I’ve smoked a lot, I’ll quickly have a shower so they can’t smell the fags. What’s your next book? A sequel to How to Be a Woman. I’m going to do trans issues, caring, mental illness, anxiety, ageing. I’m very excited. And how’s the film adaptation of How to Build a Girl going? It feels like a big fuss to make a film. When you’re writing a script, you’re writing about getting drunk on a bus. Some poor fucker is going to have to find a period-appropriate bus, clear a street, find actors... It’s such a hoo-ha. It’s really mortifying. But it is magic. Were you involved in the casting of Beanie Feldstein (the best friend in Greta Gerwig’s film Lady Bird) as you? Oh yes. The producers hadn’t been truthful with me that the chances of finding a big actress with the range to play a teenager who is clever, unusual and funny, but who’s also big enough to front a movie, were infinitesimal. We tend not to have big actresses, they just look at Hollywood and go, ‘Well there’s no point me being an actress. I’m just going to be the fat, funny friend.’ That she was invented just in time to do this movie is joyful. She’s going to be a huge star. She glows. What’s currently on your bedside table? I’m reading A History of God by Karen Armstrong. I’m working on a couple of projects where I look at the origins of God. Why did we invent this guy? And what’s his relevance now? Is there an author that you always return to? I reread The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole pretty much every year. It’s extraordinary. It’s that thing you see so often in female writers – Nina Stibbe’s another one – to write something light, brilliant and frothy is incredibly hard. It’s like making bread: you have to knead that fucking dough for a long time to make it light as a feather. Anyone can write a serious, miserable book. What book might people be surprised to find on your bookshelf? If they saw how badly I spelled, they’d probably be surprised that I have a dictionary. I still don’t really know anything about grammar or spelling. And they’re big on grammar at school these days. It breaks my heart. Some of my stuff is set texts at GCSE and A-level, so I get kids saying: “We’re analysing you today, why have you used a past participle there?” And I literally don’t have a clue. I learned to write by reading. I tell my kids there’s probably something in this house that will be more use to you than the stuff you’re learning at school. Are they fans of your work? No! Who wants to read their mum writing about masturbation? We did an Easter egg hunt and one of the clues was hidden in my book and they refused to open it. The shits. They said: “I don’t want to read the bit about the hairiness.” • How to Be Famous by Caitlin Moran is published by Ebury Press (£14.99).

In what is being described as a legally unprecedented move, members of a group called 1011 have been banned from mentioning death or injury, and from mentioning named postcodes in a gang context. They must also notify police within 24 hours of releasing new videos and give 48 hours’ warning of the date and location of any performance or recording and permit officers to attend. The court order was condemned by the campaign group Index on Censorship, which said it could create a precedent that caused problems for other artists. “Banning a kind of music is not the way to handle ideas or opinions that are distasteful or disturbing,” said the chief executive, Jodie Ginsberg. “This isn’t going to address the issues that lead to the creation of this kind of music, nor should we be creating a precedent in which certain forms of art which include violent images or ideas are banned. “We need to tackle actual violence, not ideas and opinions.” The Metropolitan police denied the court order amounted to censorship. Members of 1011 are in a gang and had been imprisoned after admitting a conspiracy to commit violent disorder. Police also hinted that they may ask the courts to issue more such orders. A Scotland Yard spokesperson said that the orders were increasingly being considered. Yonas Girma, 21, Micah Bedeau, 19, Isaac Marshall, 18, Jordan Bedeau, 17, and Rhys Herbert, 17, all from west London, are serving jail or detention sentences of between 10 months and three-and-a-half years. They were arrested in Notting Hill, west London, last November while armed with three machetes, a large knife and two baseball bats, along with masks, balaclavas and gloves. The five men told Kingston crown court they were about to make a drill music video, but police believe they were about to launch an attack on members of a rival group called 12 World. The court heard that members of 12 World had threatened Micah Bedeau’s grandmother after she entered Shepherd’s Bush, which they regarded as their territory. A video of the incident was uploaded onto YouTube. In the clip, played in court, they said: “Micah come get your grandma, she’s lacking [without protection] on our strip. You’re lucky I don’t rock [punch] her face.” Recorder Ann Mulligan issued the criminal behaviour order at the request of the police. It is active for three years. The judge said their arrests averted a “very serious violent incident” between two gangs. It also prevents the men from making any reference to the death of Teewiz, the nickname of Abdullahi Tarabi, 19, who was stabbed to death in Northolt, north-west London, in April last year. UK drill is a cousin of Chicago drill, and is a sub-genre of rap. Its lyrics not only describe gang warfare, but sometimes include threats and taunts against named gangs and individuals. Groups frequently make videos of themselves performing the songs, and post them on YouTube and other internet sites where they are viewed tens of thousands of times. Earlier this year the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, warned that disputes conducted by young people on social media can escalate quickly and violently. In May, YouTube took down around 30 music videos following a request from the Met. DCS Kevin Southworth said: “We believe this to be one of the first times, if not the first time, we have succeeded in gaining criminal behaviour orders that take such detailed and firm measures to restrict the actions of a gang who blatantly glorified violence through the music they created. “We’re not in the business of killing anyone’s fun, we’re not in the business of killing anyone’s artistic expression – we are in the business of stopping people being killed. “This isn’t about us straying into the area of regulation or censorship – we are not trying to ban anyone from making music nor are we demonising any one type of music. But the public rightly expect us to take action in a case such as this where a line has very clearly been crossed and the safety of individuals is put at risk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/29/muscles-prime-athlete-material-coco-khan","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-29T12:59:42Z","webTitle":"I have muscles and a death wish – surely that makes me prime athlete material?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/29/muscles-prime-athlete-material-coco-khan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/29/muscles-prime-athlete-material-coco-khan","fields":{"headline":"I have muscles and a death wish – surely that makes me prime athlete material?","bodyText":"Don’t you just love it when science backs up the things you already knew? Recent research has declared that – it’s official – boys do more exercise than girls, with working-class girls being particularly inactive, and ethnic minority girls especially. As a member of the latter demographic, I have always known this; I’d barely broken a sweat until my university days, and even that was from an especially hot Nando’s. You see, where I was growing up (council house, east London), sports were simply not a thing. You might see the odd lad chasing a football, and if one of those lads got a trial for West Ham, you might then see him being chased (by a bunch of girls). But that was the most exercise many of us got, and at my secondary school – which had more BAME pupils than not – the girls’ PE class was the truant’s delight. University changed all that. There, many of the girls played sports. They were in teams, they went on tours, they wore sleeveless jackets that they refused to call Puffas (they called them gilets, as if that is a real word). And while I was turned off by that specific brand of total knob, I did recognise the health benefits. Which is why, a few years ago, I joined a gym. My arms, which had the strength of a baguette, soon became firmer and stronger. My legs did the same, and my lung capacity grew. So now I am ready. I am going to join a sports team. Or at least, I’m trying to. I can’t quite get past the try-out bit. I tried the local women’s netball squad, but couldn’t shoot; I tried the running club, but got a stitch after five minutes; and in martial arts it is apparently bad form to shriek, “You hit me! I can’t believe you hit me!” Frankly, it all seems very judge-y. Can’t these people see that I might not have had the benefit of exercise seamlessly integrated into my life from childhood, but I do have a disproportionate amount of enthusiasm and an underlying death wish? That’s prime athlete material! Though I do have high hopes for an antique-wooden-boat rowing club I’ve discovered. Let’s just say it’s a very London experience. We row on the Thames between an airport and some sewage works, and there’s no trial, no 5am starts – and no obligation to race because there are no other teams to race. Ah, the sweet taste of victory (by default).

Not since the 1997 Lions tour have South Africa been beaten in a best-of-three series on home soil. Such historical context is worth keeping in mind as England seek to improve on their 42-39 first Test defeat at Ellis Park last week. Once again they will be playing at altitude; once again they have prepared at sea level rather than on the Highveld. At 1,400m up, Bloemfontein is 350m below Johannesburg but it remains an alien environment for most visiting European teams. Last time England played here in 2007 they lost 58-10 and it needed a supreme individual effort by a young Jonny Wilkinson to steer them to a 27-22 win in 2000. With the Springboks head coach, Rassie Erasmus, back in the same city where he spent more than a decade as a player and coach, Eddie Jones’s squad will have to dig monumentally deep at the end of a long season to avoid going 2-0 down with one to play. It will be as much a mental as a physical challenge, the memory of a glorious first 20 minutes at Ellis Park having been clouded by the subsequent failure to protect a 24-3 lead. This week has involved much chat about honesty sessions and lessons learned but the same nagging old question keeps resurfacing: are England an excellent side simply struggling for consistency or a team in danger of being overtaken by too many of their rivals a year out from the World Cup? In that respect the result this weekend is slightly less relevant than the performance. If the visitors go down having shown up well for 60 minutes, South Africa will have fully deserved their victory and Jones will have some grounds for optimism. Should the Boks, alternatively, cruise past 30 points again, win comfortably and go on to secure a 3-0 series margin it will be hard for anyone at the Rugby Football Union to claim the Twickenham rose garden is blooming. This is a significant weekend, then, for England’s captain, Owen Farrell, and several of the squad. As Jones rightly observed this week, good teams drive themselves rather than being spoon fed by the management. “By the time we get to the World Cup, I want to team to be owned by the players,” the head coach said. “It’s a player-driven game. I can’t go out at Ellis Park and tell them what to do after 20 minutes. I can’t tell them to slow the game down, to do the fundamentals well.” Nor is it always possible to sprinkle instantaneous magic dust over young players. “I’d love to be winning all the time but any team that’s had success goes through these testing periods.” The hope must be that Farrell’s captaincy also benefits in the longer term, with Jones even suggesting the growth of an international rugby leader is not dissimilar to the ascent of man from the earliest homo sapiens. “That’s how captains start, on all fours, then they gradually get upright,” the head coach said. “Owen is not a fully fledged captain yet, but he will move towards that.” It is a debatable metaphor, not least because Farrell does not have a billion years in which to complete his personal evolution, but Saracens’ recovery from a seven-game losing sequence to lift the Premiership title this year has taught him something about patience. “The last thing we should do now is panic,” Farrell said before the squad transferred from their beachside base near Durban back up to altitude. “We had a good training session on Wednesday when we felt like we were more in control in what we were doing and we have to carry on with that this weekend.” One of the theories circulating within the England camp, after four successive Test defeats, is they are simply trying too hard. Farrell, though, also concedes their decision-making around the breakdown needs to improve markedly. “The main thing is to be decisive. We can’t half do one thing and half do another, otherwise you get caught somewhere else. It’s about trusting your instincts. There are a lot of good players here and the first thing that pops into your head is usually the right thing. If we are decisive we will be able to set our defence quicker.” While stopping the buzzing Faf de Klerk and neutralising the threat of the free-running Willie le Roux will clearly be fundamental, so too will reducing the inflated penalty count that has killed England lately. Maro Itoje, a serial offender at Ellis Park, is nevertheless adamant the series can be turned around. “Keep the faith,” said Itoje, part of the Lions squad who roared back to draw 1-1 with the All Blacks last summer. “We came out here with the ambition to win the series and we have two more Tests to go so our aim is still intact. I feel we have a very good scrum and lineout and if we implement our game that forward battle is one we are capable of winning. I’ve got 100% belief in our group, where we’re trying to go and what we’re trying to achieve. As long as we stay together we’re going to be a very, very, very good team. I’ve been in other environments where we’ve lost a run of games and that experience has made us stronger in the long run.” Fair enough but, ultimately, Tests are about the here and now. The vast majority of England’s starting XV are World Cup probables while the Springboks team would be drastically short of experience without their durable prop Tendai Mtawarira. The ever-popular “Beast” is thrilled to be winning his 100th cap – “When I was in Zimbabwe as a young boy I never thought in my wildest dreams I would be on this platform” – and should also jog out from the tunnel quicker than his opposite number Mako Vunipola did on the occasion of his 50th Test last weekend. England, who could fall to sixth in the world rankings if they lose heavily, will have their work cut out to swerve a fifth successive Test defeat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jul/06/country-diary-heeding-the-voices-of-experience-on-the-banks-of-the-beck","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-06T04:30:17Z","webTitle":"Country diary:  heeding the voices of experience on the banks of the beck","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/06/country-diary-heeding-the-voices-of-experience-on-the-banks-of-the-beck","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jul/06/country-diary-heeding-the-voices-of-experience-on-the-banks-of-the-beck","fields":{"headline":"Country diary:  heeding the voices of experience on the banks of the beck","bodyText":"“Those gorgeous flowers blooming in the meadows around here look good enough to eat.” I had overheard this comment, in an American accent, from a visitor to the Wensleydale Creamery in Hawes. I mention this later to Joe Ivison. “They do if you’re a cow,” he says. “They like munching dried flowers in their winter hay.” Joe, a nonagenarian, is seated on a hillside bench above the ford crossing Gayle Beck. This is where the hamlet’s elders hold court during summer afternoons. Today Joe’s companion is sixtysomething Mike Webster, who was the creamery’s engineer for many years. Both offer advice, sometimes unsolicited, to visitors pondering the ford. An old car tyre swing dangles from a sycamore branch by the beck. This is Laiker End, “laik” meaning “to play” in Yorkshire. A flat limestone slab stretches the length of a cricket pitch across the river bed from this bank, with its hill and its huddle of houses. On the far side there are eggs for sale, with an honesty box. In spate conditions, the water here can rise wheel-arch high, preventing vehicles crossing. During this dry spell, however, the beck is only inches deep, and cars and vans easily splash through. But it’s apparent that looks deceive. “Go back!” Joe shouts as a group of slinky-togged cycling club riders dismount and walk their steeds to the water. “The bridge downstream is safer.” The cyclists confer, then retreat, calling: “Thanks, pal.” Mike says sometimes strangers try to pedal across, unaware of the undulating dimples under the water that become slimy with algae, causing tyres to skid. “And down they go. Crash.” A rider and her horse pause by the beck. Joe has told me that in his clog-wearing youth he had problems with the iron caulkers on their soles, which could also skid underwater on the crossing, causing a tumble. And today’s mild-steel horseshoes are no better; a horse could slide on the wet rock, fall, and even break a leg. This horse is picking its way through a pool to one side. “Knew they’d go that way,” he says. “Local knowledge. They’re from a farm up the hill.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/15/should-i-start-a-romantic-relationship-with-my-best-friend","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T11:30:11Z","webTitle":"Should I start a romantic relationship with my best friend?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/15/should-i-start-a-romantic-relationship-with-my-best-friend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/15/should-i-start-a-romantic-relationship-with-my-best-friend","fields":{"headline":"Should I start a romantic relationship with my best friend?","bodyText":"My best friend and I have known each other for more than three years and it’s very clear that he loves me.

An open letter posted on the website ipetitions says Bergdorf’s role is “an an insult to all the women film-makers who struggle on a daily basis to get their films made”. Referring to Bergdorf throughout as male, the letter says: “We question the suitability of a male who has benefitted from the very structures we are critiquing as a speaker on the subject of women’s agency in relation to film-making … What kind of cultural work is being performed when a male is speaking on behalf of women film-makers?” “This speaker is upstaging the very urgency of women’s voices with another ‘what about men?’ narrative. As much as we support the rights of gender non-conforming males to be heard, this is not the forum for it.” The letter is authored by the film-maker and writer Julian Vigo and the film-maker Deirdre O’Neill. In a further statement to the Guardian, Vigo said: “The BFI conference allocated a space that should have been taken up by a woman film-maker to a man and so it seems our voices continue to be denied.” The summit is described by the BFI as “a day of talks and events on women, power and film”. It includes events such as Before and After Time’s Up and RIP #strongfemalecharacter. In a statement, the BFI said: “For our keynote speaker we expressly wanted a voice outside of film-making that could widen the lens. We invited Munroe because she represents a contemporary and interesting perspective on the subjects of the day. “We appreciate that Munroe’s involvement has provoked a strong and mixed reaction and we hope it will help further the gender debate in a positive and constructive way and encourage audiences to recognise and acknowledge the quality and value of difference, which we believe is a benefit to our industry and to our wider society.” Bergdorf was fired by L’Oréal in 2017 after posting racially charged comments on Facebook, and was subsequently appointed to Labour’s advisory board on LGBT rights. She quit that role in March after attacks in the tabloid press and by Conservatives. Bergdorf’s lack of experience as a film-maker has also come in for criticism: though she was involved in making Channel 4’s recent documentary What Makes a Woman, Bergdorf has no directing or producer credits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/19/university-accommodation-on-or-off-campus-at-home-or-in-halls-its-up-to-you","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T10:57:48Z","webTitle":"University accommodation: on or off campus, at home or in halls ... it’s up to you","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/19/university-accommodation-on-or-off-campus-at-home-or-in-halls-its-up-to-you","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/19/university-accommodation-on-or-off-campus-at-home-or-in-halls-its-up-to-you","fields":{"headline":"University accommodation: on or off campus, at home or in halls ... it’s up to you","bodyText":"There’s more to student housing than finding a new bedroom. For “commuter” students living at home and studying locally, it can be a time to renegotiate the family living dynamics. For those studying further afield, this will be their new home – a place to make friends, develop independence and maybe even learn to cook. Many first-year students start off by living in university-owned halls. This can be the safest option, says Paul Burns, accommodation office manager at the University of Manchester, because “there are staff and mature students around to help”. Another benefit of halls is that they are the ideal place to meet lots of other young people in the same situation, says Rachel Bell, residences manager at the University of Southampton. Live on or near the campus and life may be a little more convenient – you’ll be close to university facilities such as the library and computer labs, for example. But being off campus and closer to the city, with “a bit of separation”, is no bad thing either, according to Bell. “There’s potentially more space and you get the benefits of living in the city centre. So it’s not so much campus versus city, as looking at what the different halls offer,” she says. “Try to find halls that have flats with lots of people living together,” says Will Sawyer, a journalism student at Kingston University London. “It means you’ll have a big kitchen and there will always be someone to talk to.” Shared accommodation can also save you money, Burns points out. At the top end of the market, private sector accommodation has become more commonplace. “There are some very high-quality private halls out there nowadays,” Bell says, “but do check what you’re signing up for and the length of the contract.” What will happen if your son or daughter has to withdraw from university? “Not all private places will release you from the contract,” she says. Be sure to ask about upfront costs, a spokesperson for the National Union of Students (NUS) says. “A majority of properties in the private rented sector will either have a holding deposit, admin fees, or both,” they say. Living at home is no longer an unusual choice for students. Research from the Sutton Trust shows that the number of “commuter students” has grown over recent years. Yousef El-T is studying medicine at King’s College London and lives at home. “I’m quite lucky to be honest,” he says. “A lot of my friends are doing the same. I sometimes even meet my friends on the tube going home. People just think it’s normal.” Whichever option your son or daughter is leaning towards, parents can help with research. Burns says parents are invaluable when it comes to “things like reading the small print, which some 17-18-year-olds are less inclined to do”. If you’re asked to be a guarantor, check whether you are liable for just one room, or the whole flat, Bell says. Parents should also make sure students have a realistic idea of their budget and encourage their student son or daughter to look with an open mind. “Our experience is that students all have a good time in halls, even if they don’t get exactly [the place] they want,” she says. Ultimately, students should take a lead role in managing their accommodation. And for worried parents who’ve not heard from their children, university-owned halls, have an extra appeal. “We can go and knock on the door and ask students to ring their mum or dad,” Bell says. “Often they’ve just been having too much fun and forgotten to call.” A commuter student’s guide Do some research Commuter students should contact the university early on to find out what support is available to them. Many universities will have networks or societies that are specifically for students living at home. Parents should encourage their children to consider joining up. Set some ground rules You may need to sit down and negotiate how the new arrangement will work. Perhaps your son or daughter will agree to contribute a certain amount towards rent and bills, and cook once a week, in return for more space? Have two-way discussions Parental support at this time is invaluable, but it is also a time for students to start taking on more responsibility. It will help if students contribute their own ideas for making the living arrangement work. Expect lifestyle changes Parents need to be mindful that university is not just a school for older people, says Burns. There are different schedules and pressures. For example, students may have days without lectures, but that doesn’t mean they are not still working. Allow space to study Finding a good space to study can be tricky for commuter students. If there is a quiet area of the house, perhaps that could be transformed into a study room. Alternatively, your son or daughter could stick around to study on-campus, or go to a local library or cafe. Encourage them to get out El-T says his biggest tip for commuter students is to get involved in everything. There are lots of benefits to living at home – such as cheaper rent and parental support when the academic pressure kicks in – but with further to travel, commuter students can also miss out on the more sociable aspects of university. To avoid that, encourage them to be involved, but without pushing them away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/15/talking-horses-beware-backing-odds-on-shots-at-royal-ascot-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T10:24:21Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Beware backing the odds-on shots at Royal Ascot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/15/talking-horses-beware-backing-odds-on-shots-at-royal-ascot-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/15/talking-horses-beware-backing-odds-on-shots-at-royal-ascot-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Beware backing the odds-on shots at Royal Ascot","bodyText":"Cracksman shortened with several bookmakers on Thursday for the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot next week, and John Gosden’s colt now seems likely to be the first odds-on shot of the meeting when he lines up for the feature event on Wednesday, and the only odds-on favourite all week in a Group One event. Before anyone gets too heavily involved, however, a few of the lessons of history when it comes to odds-on chances at the Royal meeting are worth bearing in mind. Across the week as a whole, a total of 36 horses have set off shorter than evens since 2003. Of those, 20 have returned to the winner’s enclosure, a strike-rate of 55.6%, and a level stake on all 36 would have shown a small loss of 3%. It pretty much goes without saying that all were ridden by top-class, experienced jockeys, though it is striking that Ryan Moore has ridden the last seven odds-on shots at Royal Ascot and 10 of the last 11, a run that stretches back to his win on Gleneagles in the St James’s Palace Stakes in 2015. The only other jockey to ride an odds-on chance since then was Yutake Take, who finished last of six on A Shin Hikari when he set off at 8-13 for the Prince Of Wales’s Stakes in 2016. Frankie Dettori, meanwhile, has ridden only two odds-on favourites since 2003 – and both were beaten. Treve, 8-13 for the Prince of Wales’s Stakes in 2014, was only third behind The Fugue, while Kheleyf, who was the same price to win the Norfolk Stakes for David Loder back in 2003, finished second to Russian Valour. In addition to Treve and A Shin Hikari, Aidan O’Brien’s So You Think also set off at odds-on in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes in the last 15 years, and the fact that he managed to win at 4-5 in 2012 does not entirely make up for his defeat at 4-11 the previous year. On the other hand, odds-on favourites in Royal Ascot’s Group One events show a slightly better rate of return. Of the 36 odds-on chances since 2003, 24 were in Group Ones and 15 were winners, returning a profit on stakes at starting price of 0.1% (which is effectively Frankel’s win at 1-10 in the Queen Anne in 2012 tipping the balance). Tread with caution, in other words, and the same advice applies to a bumper offering of six cards on Friday which could easily overwhelm the unwary punter. Daybreak (4.20) is one runner that might offer some value at around 11-2 for the fillies’ handicap at Sandown Park. Hughie Morrison’s three-year-old had to switch to find running room at Goodwood last time out and then finished strongly to get within a neck of the winner. Aclimatise (3.45) is a worthy favourite on the same card, while Mr Buttons (2.55), in the Rous Selling Stakes at York, and Imperial State (3.30) are two more to consider on the afternoon cards. Sassie (7.40) also has a squeak at around 8-1 on the evening card at Goodwood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/15/russia-world-cup-press-reaction-saudi-arabia-golovin-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T09:50:09Z","webTitle":"‘The people should celebrate’: Russian press reaction to rout of Saudi Arabia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/russia-world-cup-press-reaction-saudi-arabia-golovin-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/15/russia-world-cup-press-reaction-saudi-arabia-golovin-putin","fields":{"headline":"‘The people should celebrate’: Russian press reaction to rout of Saudi Arabia","bodyText":"“Exhale!” screamed the top line in the Russian daily Sport Express. As Russia steamrollered their way to a 5-0 thrashing of a helpless Saudi Arabia side on Thursday, the local press breathed a collective sigh of relief – the kind of deep breath needed after all the oxygen spent billing this team as Russia’s worst ever. With expectations so low, the national side’s convincing victory was a revelation. “They played like Atlético Madrid,” declared Sports.ru, one of the country’s most popular sport websites, lauding Russia’s stout defence and pacey attack. Football is supposedly this country’s national sport, but berating the national team – in bars, online, at the bathhouse – comes a close second. So when Russia delivered a magisterial performance on Thursday night the morning papers wheeled out their psychologist couches to figure out just what had happened. “There were simply no optimists left in the country besides those required to be,” the leading daily Sovetsky Sport wrote. “And when nothing at all is expected, something awakens in our capricious football character.” Chalk it up to the Russian soul. Still, there were voices to remind the country this was not Portugal, Uruguay, or even Egypt that Russia had defeated. “Guys, have you not forgotten that this was Saudi Arabia?” tweeted Vasily Utkin, a popular sports commentator. By way of a warning, Sovetsky Sport even took the extra step of printing the results when Russia trounced Tunisia in 2002 and the Czech Republic at Euro 2012 before falling to weaker sides in their next matches. “I’m sure that the team will just take this as part of their warm-ups. The team shouldn’t celebrate, the people should celebrate,” Sport Express wrote. But it looked like a celebration. Every goal was vindication, each maligned player had his moment. Komsomolskaya Pravda, the popular and outspoken tabloid, praised the defensive midfielder Yury Gazinsky, that “most inauspicious choice of [Stanislav] Cherchesov before this World Cup”, for the header that put Russia 1-0 ahead. Denis Cheryshev’s late lofted shot, knocked from the outside of his left foot into the top-right corner of the goal, was a “marvel”. And Sports.ru asked: “Is Golovin a genius?” The answer? “Definitely – in this match.” Golovin was singled out for special attention, and Russian journalists reacted with some shock to the rush of foreign reporters looking for a star player on Russia’s side before the match. “‘Who is Golovin?!’ the poor photographers and cameramen shouted in panic before the game,” Komsomolskaya Pravda reported. “And all the Russians understood, finally, who the real star of our team is: Smolov? No. Akinfeev? No. Artem Dzyuba, God help him. It’s Golovin!” As one online wit wrote on Twitter: “Russia haven’t been this strong on the left wing since Lenin and Stalin.” In Russia, your fortunes can change in a moment. Days ago, Dzyuba had to beg the press and the country to support the national team. A rogue Russian lawmaker before the game even suggested making criticism of the national side a criminal offence. But what really mattered was the scene up in the VIP box, where Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman sat watching the game with Gianni Infantino smushed between them. As Russia racked up the goals, Putin would shrug and smirk, before leaning across the table to shake the hand of the Saudi crown prince. His press secretary told a state news agency later that Putin had not apologised to Salman for the victory. “These are emotions!” Dmitri Peskov said. “People don’t apologise when they win at sport.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/15/argentina-beware-iceland-world-cup-2018-uruguay-jorge-valdano","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T09:41:20Z","webTitle":"Argentina beware: Iceland’s warriors show size does not matter | Jorge Valdano","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/15/argentina-beware-iceland-world-cup-2018-uruguay-jorge-valdano","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/15/argentina-beware-iceland-world-cup-2018-uruguay-jorge-valdano","fields":{"headline":"Argentina beware: Iceland’s warriors show size does not matter","bodyText":"How many inhabitants does a country need before we have a right to demand a footballing style? I have been thinking that as Argentina prepare for their opening game, just as I wonder that every time I think of Uruguay, who have been determined to win since the beginning of time without getting into debates about the way they do it. There is no need for a “how” when you have achieved something so huge as winning the World Cup twice with a population now at 3.5 million. There is a deeper culture there, too. “Garra Charrúa” – that Uruguayan warrior spirit, the name given to the way they play football – is serious: the Charrúas were natives, who stood up to the Europeans by attacking Don Juan Díaz de Solís and his landing crew who first docked on those shores in 1516. They were killed and eaten. Now, that’s a discovery. As for Uruguay’s footballing culture, that is built from the beginnings of the World Cup, with class as well as dignity and bravery. Uruguay is called “the little country” for a reason, and it has always stood out for the surprising depth of its football and its continued prestige given that it has such a small base upon which to draw. But now even “the little country” looks big against the emergence of Iceland, a national team built upon a population of nearly 340,000 people – 10 times fewer than Uruguay – including women, children and the over‑35s. Those who are left over and have some talent are only enough to make up a handful of football teams. Those tenacious, hardworking players, who celebrate every victory as if they were conquering territory, deservedly qualified for the World Cup finals, after impressing at the last European Championship. Iceland’s side is the daughter of scarcity, an extreme climate and a spirit of sacrifice and solidarity that, beyond playing football, enabled them to survive. An optimistic country where, the way they tell it, there is a phrase you hear repeatedly: “Everything will be OK.” Right now they are awaiting their World Cup debut against Argentina on Saturday and I hope they don’t make the mistake of thinking “everything will be OK”. A little respect please, Icelanders; rein yourselves in a little. Because in Argentina we have Leo Messi, a highly sophisticated creature, the culmination of genetics fed by a cultural fever that goes back more than a hundred years. Like Alfredo Di Stefáno and Diego Maradona, Messi is the final product at the end of the line. So much passion for football, so much madness, has to have some benefits. But Iceland are coming and we’re scared because they don’t come alone. Those 23 warriors who represent a country with no standing army have 340,000 fanatics behind them, all of them dedicated to their heroes, and millions more around the world – romantics desperate for impossible things to keep happening. As John Carlin, a fine journalist who has visited the country many times, put it: they’re a people who make the most of what they can when they can and who work extremely hard. It’s a line I’d like to make my own and, without the need to add anything to it, it defines them in footballing terms too. This generation of players will surely never be repeated but its strength is collective, constructed upon a daring, almost foolhardy sense of adventure that fills them with pride, humility, bravery and solidarity. The team spirit has made a rock of them that can be cracked by only one thing: individual talent. In Moscow, then, there are two competing histories facing each other: that of Iceland, a small country that wants to add footballing pages to its legend, and that of Argentina, a country that has made football a way of life, of being, and that, while its politicians go asking for help from the IMF again, seeks new heroes at the World Cup. Looking at our first opponents, a martyr would do too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/15/number-of-children-waiting-six-months-for-dental-operations-soars","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T21:30:27Z","webTitle":"Number of children waiting six months for dental operations soars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/number-of-children-waiting-six-months-for-dental-operations-soars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/15/number-of-children-waiting-six-months-for-dental-operations-soars","fields":{"headline":"Number of children waiting six months for dental operations soars","bodyText":"The number of children in England waiting longer than six months for a dental operation under general anaesthesia has risen by 52% over the past three years, data provided by NHS trusts suggests. The figures also show a 15% increase in the number of children on waiting lists for such treatment between 2015 and 2017. In the worst-performing trust, Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS foundation trust, children waited 253 days on average for treatment. The Labour party, which obtained the figures through freedom of information requests, said a deterioration in child dental care was driving some people to desperate measures. Jon Ashworth, the shadow health minister, said: “It is completely unacceptable that vulnerable children are increasingly waiting for months in agony to have their teeth fixed. “We’ve also heard horrific stories of people forced to resort to DIY dentistry kits in utter desperation. In the fifth-richest nation in the world, this is a damning indictment of Tory neglect of our health service.” The responses from 33 NHS trusts show there were 13,548 under-18s on waiting lists for dental operations under general anaesthesia in 2017, compared with 11,806 in 2015. The number of children waiting more than six months rose by 514 to 1,498. On average, children waited 85 days for treatment last year – 15 days more than in 2013. Labour wants the government to boost investment in oral health and take “radical action” to help reduce health inequalities, such as banning the advertising of junk food on family TV programmes. The numbers of children on dental waiting lists last year ranged from 3,534 in Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS foundation trust, to 33 in James Paget University Hospitals NHS foundation trust in East Anglia. A spokesman for Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS foundation trust said it had seen increasing demand because it was the only major centre for specialist paediatric dental services in the region. He added: “We have increased our paediatric outpatient clinics and operating capacity, as well as additional substantive medical posts, which has resulted in a reduction in our waiting lists since March 2018.” Figures published earlier this year show the number of operations to pull out rotten teeth in children rose by 17% to 42,911 between 2012-13 and 2016-17. As a result, the cost to the NHS increased from £27.3m to £36.2m. The chair of the British Dental Association, Mick Armstrong, described the growing waiting lists as “symptomatic of government failure to tackle a wholly preventable disease”. He added: “The vast oral health inequalities we are seeing between rich and poor are not inevitable. The battle for good oral health is won or lost in early years, and ministers should not be waving a white flag when cost-effective policies are available that can make a lasting difference.” Professor Michael Escudier, dean of the faculty of dental surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons, said that as well as restricting junk food adverts, the availability of such products in price promotions and at the point of sale should be limited. He also called for the introduction of supervised teeth-brushing programmes in nurseries and breakfast clubs. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said a record number of children (6.9 million) visited a dentist last year, almost 60% of the population. “We’re determined to make sure all children get the right access and support to achieve good oral hygiene, whatever their background or location,” she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/28/our-men-are-leaving-us-the-rohingya-women-facing-life-alone","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-28T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"'Our men are leaving us': the Rohingya women facing life alone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/28/our-men-are-leaving-us-the-rohingya-women-facing-life-alone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/28/our-men-are-leaving-us-the-rohingya-women-facing-life-alone","fields":{"headline":"'Our men are leaving us': the Rohingya women facing life alone","bodyText":"Sara Khatun is deeply cynical about marriage. One of many Rohingya women trying to cope alone in the refugee camps of Bangladesh, she was left by her husband and has five children to look after. Sitting in the bamboo porch of a meeting place, out of the monsoon rains, she relates the serious problems that men cause in the Cox’s Bazar camps. “If I was unmarried I would never get married,” she says. On top of the trauma caused by gang rapes in Myanmar, and pressure for girls to get married at a young age, a new issue is emerging for women in the camps: abandonment. Those working there report a rising number of husbands simply leaving – either to slip off into the black economy of Bangladesh beyond the Rohingya settlements, or with other women. The ramshackle and chaotic camps are already beset by violence. Men routinely beat their wives and girls are now forbidden to leave their sweltering huts unless in full burqa, in the hope that it will make them less likely targets for rape. The problems associated with abandonment are so common, with such grave ramifications, that it is classified as gender-based violence. Women who do not have husbands are at greater risk of harassment and attack, and have to undertake – single-handedly – a huge number of arduous tasks to help their often large families survive. These include cooking, collecting water, monsoon-proofing their huts, fixing roofs, breastfeeding, chopping and carrying firewood, and collecting rations. Since most marriages that end with men abandoning their wives are undocumented, no statistics are available. Girls are expected to marry early – sometimes as young as 12 – after which they leave the family home. And if their husband leaves them, it’s even harder for them to look after themselves and their children. Some aid workers say they have heard of cases where one man has married as many as six women in the camp. At another women’s centre, a ledger records why women are seeing counsellors. The acronym “GBV” – gender-based violence – crops up frequently. “Polygamy counts as GBV,” a worker explains. “Lots of men are leaving their wives for other women in the camp. In Myanmar, they would have been punished by law – perhaps they would be given a fine.” There is no punishment here, however, and Taslia Akter, a counsellor from one of the women-friendly spaces run by Care International, says the problem is growing. “A good number of women visiting the women-friendly space have shared that the instances of men abandoning their wives and children for a second marriage have gone up,” she says. “Unlike in the camps, back in Myanmar one had to go through strict legal procedures prior to getting married, such as submitting forms at the marriage registration office for approval. The situation is slightly different here.” Women who have been abandoned often blame their own “bad luck”, and some become depressed. *Rohima, 20, is adjusting to life since her husband absconded. “We got married in the camp but my husband went off with another woman,” she says. Sitting on the floor of her friend’s hut amid a group of women, she lifts her hand to her swollen stomach. “She will give birth in two weeks,” says her friend, Mariam. “I can’t do anything,” Rohima says. “A few weeks ago, I managed to borrow a telephone and called him. He said: ‘Who are you? I don’t know you’ – and hung up the phone.” Her husband is one of the small number of refugees who have managed to escape the camp and find work outside. He now lives in Chittagong, about 85 miles away, with his new wife. Mariam explains that none of the group of five women have husbands, and that they all support each other. Most of the men were killed in Myanmar, apart from Rohima’s husband.“We have a good bond – these friends are more than my sisters. “We are from different villages, but we are neighbours here. We are worried about the monsoon rains, it’s very difficult to live in this weather. We do not have enough wood even to cook food. We are all helpless, but we will try to help by talking and sharing our stories with each other.” Khatun, 45, is part of a community group, coordinated by the organisation ActionAid, that visits troubled households in the camps. “Yesterday I saw a woman who had been beaten so badly by her husband that her eye was swollen. I told her: ‘If you are not in control of this problem you can come to the women-friendly space.’ She replied: ‘I’m not able to go outside because he will beat me more.’” “She also said: ‘My husband wants to get married to another woman, and when I told him not to, he beat me.’ “Sometimes I feel surprised by how common it is, but I have to work to help manage it. Some people listen to me very well, but some are very dangerous.” Back on the baking hot bamboo porch, Khatun says: “Sometimes when I see women whose husbands are about to leave them, I say: ‘If he is able to get married to another woman, you can live happily.’ “I feel sad, but I don’t want other people to feel sad. I want peace for women.” *Name changed to protect identity"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jul/13/wakaliwood-inside-ugandas-action-movie-studio","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-13T09:00:06Z","webTitle":"Inside Wakaliwood: Kampala's action movie studio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/13/wakaliwood-inside-ugandas-action-movie-studio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/13/wakaliwood-inside-ugandas-action-movie-studio","fields":{"headline":"Inside Wakaliwood: Kampala's action movie studio","bodyText":"When the trailer for Who Killed Captain Alex? went viral on YouTube, film-maker Isaac Nabwana’s mobile phone starting ringing with calls from around the world. One individual went further. After seeing 40 seconds of the promo for Uganda’s first action movie, American Alan Hofmanis gave up his life in Manhattan to move to Wakaliga, Kampala, to help Nabwana, aka IGG, develop Ramon film studio – and Wakaliwood was born. In Kaliti, a village about 20 miles from Kampala, Alan Hofmanis and Isaac Nabwana watch video rushes while waiting to shoot night scenes. Nabwana shoots a fight scene for The Ugandan Expendables with Ivan, a stuntman, Charles Bukenya, a member of Uganda’s national kung fu team, and Henry the Barbarian, a film regular. Nabwana shoots film regular Apollo for Operation Kakongoliro: The Ugandan Expendables. The Ramon Film Studio has produced more than 40 movies. Who Killed Captain Alex was produced in 2010 for just $200, while 2016’s Operation Kakongoliro! The Ugandan Expendables cost $2,000, the studio’s biggest production budget to date. While Nabwana watches, in a jail built between two houses in his family compound, Ritah, the female hero in Who Killed Captain Alex?, rehearses the kung fu fight witht Kasekende Mustafa Katwalo, aka Mustafa Lee. To attract more viewers and break new ground, Nabwana wanted a female lead for Who Killed Captain Alex? Wakaliwood actor Ronald Kazibwe, alias Sergi, chooses the guns that he will use in the next scene in a film in which he plays a villain. Dozens of people work on Nabwana’s films, taking on all roles both in front and behind the camera: acting, doing stunts, designing props and costumes, technician duties and stage management. From the machinery to accessories and costumes, everything is homemade. Many of the actors live in the rehearsal rooms where costumes are kept. Actor Ronald Kazibwe, aka Sergi, drinks tea while Ronald Burya hesitates to wear a dirty T-shirt and Suudi Ryagoba irons some trousers during a compulsory rehearsal day. Charles Bukenya is a martial arts teacher, actor and stuntman, while Brenda Nantume, a hairdresser, holds her daughter after travelling 20 miles to be part of the shoot. With little hope of pay for the moment, Wakaliwood members have side jobs. In a country where film piracy is common, Wakaliwood movies are mainly sold door-to-door and as quickly as possible, before pirated copies make it on to the market. Left: a group of hoodlums point their guns to the hero, off-camera. Right: the the ingenious props man Daouda Bisaso fixes on to a stuntman’s chest a plastic strip on which is glued, with mastic, the handle of a knife. That a film studio is able to flourish in a place where cinema has little history may surprise some. Yet, Wakaliwood has emerged despite what from the outside may appear to insurmountable obstacles. In Wakaliga in front of the Nabwana family compound, a video for a song by dancehall and reggae artist Racheal M Natembo is being shot. Wakaliwood is also lending credence to a Ugandan pop culture that some observers have linked to Quentin Tarantino for convenience. But it can only be understood by going beyond the violence that flows through the stories, the litres of food colouring that stains the fallen, and the archaic and mischievous special effects. An al-Shabaab villan dies in a whirlwind of blood in Once a Soldier as Nabwana films the scene. For the bloody special effects, condoms are filled with food colouring and tied with a plastic ribbon around the chest of a stuntman. A metal ring is glued to the condom and fishing wire is attached to it, to be pulled by an assistant at the appropriate time. Cow blood was used in the past but some of crew members became ill after accidentally swallowing it. In a Wakaliwood movie, there are always tens of gangsters, hoodlums or bad guys whose main job is to be killed by the good guys. To attain the high body count, the bad guys wear balaclavas, or caps, or beards. This allows crew members to play numerous baddies destined for a bloody end. The Waka Starz are Wakaliwood’s apprentices. Here they wait to take part in the video for Racheal M Natembo’s latest song. The singer ism Nabwana’s daughter. The film-maker’s half-brother Robert Kizito discovered kung fu 30 years ago through Bruce Lee’s films. Mimicking them to his brother, Kizito was bitten by the martial arts bug while inspiring Nabwana towards a love for the films. He scoured central market of Kampala for Chinese martial arts magazines to dissect the positions from the diagrams inside their pages. A kung fu master, Kizito and his followers were filmed by his brother for Wakaliwood’s first ever action scenes. The Waka Starz are taught kung fu by Bukenya, who teacher is Kizito. Bukenya’s son is a member of the Waka Starz, third from right, so is Nabwana’s daughter, far right. Alan Hofmanis plays Jesus in a video for Ronald Buryahika, Wakaliwood actor and Christian music star. Nabwana was child during the bloody rule of Idi Amin. The film-maker recalls the swollen corpses in a dumping ground near his home and the soldiers drumming at the doors of the houses, shouting: “Fungua mlango, panda gari” (“Open the door, get in the truck” in Swahili) .Mixing memory and his love Bruce Lee films, Nabwana has emerged as unique film-maker. On the set of the zombie movie Eaten Alive, a movie inspired by a cannibalism case that happened a few years ago in western Uganda. Alan Hofmanis plays a man who comes to Uganda to meet his in-laws but ends up being eaten by cannibals, and right: Daouda Bisaso plays a man whose wife is eaten alive. Wakaliwood has captured the imagination of a nation, from the drivers of boda boda, (motorbike or bicycle taxi) to President Yoweri Museveni, who did not hesitate to incorporate support for the industry as a campaign promise during the 2016 presidential election. In the cinema hall he rents, a long shed with paperboard and wooden walls, Emmie, a VJ, offers live commentary in the local language Luganda to an audience watching a film. A VJ adds extra colour to a movie with their jokes, gamut of expressions,tone, rhythm, the turn of phrase and extra dialogue. Emmie is part of the Wakaliwood family. He comments on every movie and his commentary is part of the movie. Nabwana said he cannot shoot a movie without considering Emmie’s commentary. Audiences pay 500 Ugandan shillings (20p) a ticket for a US blockbuster and 1,000 shillings (42p) for a Wakaliga movie. The comedians of Wakaliwood in costume during a promotional video shoot for social media. I have been going to Wakaliwood for years, but I have not managed to unravel the mystery of Nabwana’s trajectory. It is the defiance of the impossible, like the life-size Bell Huey helicopter by the props crew in the yard of his family compound. Visitors describe him as a pop-culture prophet preaching from his slum the good word of cinema, communicating a certain idea of his country rather than basking the sun of international film festivals. Wakaliwood’s actors sing the anthem of Ramon Film Studio at the end of every day in the rehearsal room.

A Norwegian artist, exhibiting in the UK for the first time, is attempting to heal both through her work. The project, installed by Mari Meen Halsøy at the William Morris Gallery in Walthamstow, north-east London, recreates the wall of a shattered building known as the Yellow House. The building is located on the former “green line” that divided Christian east Beirut and Muslim west Beirut during the 1975-90 war. At first glance the work combines beautiful pieces of traditional tapestry, some as small as postage stamps, which are dyed in muted shades of grey, blue and ochre. In fact, each has been precisely matched in size, shape and colour to a hole left in the Yellow House wall by bullets or shells, many of which took human lives. Each tapestry is made from a tracing on cotton fabric taken directly from the wall’s surface. Halsøy, who lives in Beirut, has made similar “bandages” for the wounds on many other buildings, often leaving them in situ. One has been covered in graffiti and then repainted with the rest of the wall. “You see the wounds in the buildings everywhere,” Halsøy says. “The house that I live in in the Christian quarter has bullet holes, though my landlord has filled them up, but you do not see the wounds in the people. “But everyone has stories. When you speak to them, the stories come pouring out. Often people come up to me when I am working in the street, curious, and ask what I’m doing, and then they tell their stories or they send me to other people to hear their stories.” She recalls being invited into a small sitting room, where she was offered tea. Then, falteringly, a man told the story of how he and his family had taken refuge in the mountains, returning to Beirut when they thought the fighting was over. But the man witnessed two members of his family being shot dead against the walls of the sitting room. “I fell in love with Beirut, but the wounds are so deep,” Halsøy says. “You see the holes and think how the bullet has torn through the hardness of the wall, and then think of what it has done to the soft fabric of human flesh.” Her installation is part of an exhibition called Weaving New Worlds, which brings together 16 female artists working in textiles, many using ancient craft to express contemporary political ideas. “Some of the most interesting and radical work in contemporary art is now being created in textiles,” says the show’s curator, Lesley Millar. “This is not a story of genteel craft work.” Weaving New Worlds is at the William Morris Gallery in Walthamstow, London, from 16 June to 23 September.

Sexton is one of eight changes made by the Ireland head coach, Joe Schmidt, from the Brisbane match. Most of the players called up are, like Sexton, from Leinster, who had a hectic end to a season as they won the European Champions Cup and the Pro14. “Johnny is always happiest when he is on the field,” Schmidt said. “I thought he was superb last week and helped out Joey [Carbery, who started at 10], but he has been able to look after himself a bit more this week and get himself ready to go.” Defeat would not only cost Ireland the series but would risk their losing second place in the world rankings to Australia whose head coach, Michael Cheika, has – for the first time since taking charge of the Wallabies in 2014 – named an unchanged 23. “Sexton is a maestro, but he is also one of the toughest roosters out there,” Cheika said. “If we put too much focus on him, he will pick us off. It was pleasing to win last week, but we need to raise our standards if we are to back it up. We had to cram a lot into the first Test because we had not played since last year and it was fair to give the guys another opportunity.” The return of the back-rower David Pocock after a year’s sabbatical made a difference with Ireland struggling at the breakdown, an area where they excelled in the Six Nations. “We were a bit flat,” said Schmidt, who expects his players to be sharp second time around."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/15/why-is-theresa-may-expected-to-increase-nhs-funding-by-6bn-a-year","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T13:06:06Z","webTitle":"NHS funding: where will the money come from and how will it be spent?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/why-is-theresa-may-expected-to-increase-nhs-funding-by-6bn-a-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/15/why-is-theresa-may-expected-to-increase-nhs-funding-by-6bn-a-year","fields":{"headline":"NHS funding: where will the money come from and how will it be spent?","bodyText":"Theresa May has announced an increase of £20bn a year to the NHS’s budget. She said that the decision signalled the government’s commitment to the health service ahead of its 70th birthday. What has led to the funding plan? Since last year Hunt has been arguing two things: firstly, that, after eight years of 1% budget rises, the NHS needs to start receiving significant extra funding as soon as the economy allows; and secondly, that the service needs a long-term funding plan and the recent policy of small increases and in-year injections of extra, in effect “winter crisis” emergency funding, needs to end. Will some of the rise come from a ‘Brexit dividend’, as has been claimed? Not exactly. Last November Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, told ministers the NHS needed to start receiving 4%-a-year budget increases as soon as possible, given the service’s increasing inability to meet key patient treatment waiting times and desire to make real progress in key areas, such as cancer, mental health and primary care. He also in effect demanded the government deliver on the promise made during the EU referendum campaign that Brexit would free up £350m a week extra for the NHS. Since then leading leavers, including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, have called on May to honour that pledge, even though it was not a government promise and was not in the Conservative manifesto last year. Others have pointed out that official forecasts predict that leaving the EU will weaken the public finances, at least in the short term. Why does Stevens see rises of 4% as so important? It’s not justthe NHS chief that backs that figure as the minimum the service needs to cope with the rapid increase in demand for care and also to transform how it works. Health thinktanks, organisations representing NHS providers and almost every group representing doctors back the annual 4% rise as do influential independent bodies such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Office for Budget Responsibility. Also, although the NHS has received rises averaging 3.9% a year since 1955, that has slowed to just over 1% a year since 2010. Recent research by the IFS and the thinktank Health Foundationshowthe NHS’s average annual increase since its creation in 1948 has been 3.7%. The last eight years represent a period of unprecedented austerity, in relative terms. In cash terms, 4% annually over at least four years would mean the NHS’s budget of £125bn increases to more than £146m by 2022. How did all this lobbying influence May’s thinking on the NHS? A: In March, when she addressed the Commons liaison committee, May committed to giving the NHS a multi-year funding settlement, though gave no more detail. Both Hunt and Stevens have talked about the health service’s need to have certainty that it will receive substantial extra funds for the next 10 years. However, it is likely the deal will give the NHS specified, guaranteed increases only until the end of this parliament.Why was May’s commitment to a long-term plan important? It came a day after 92 MPs from all parties, including many select committee chairs, told the prime minister in a strongly worded letter that the NHS needed to get back to receiving the sorts of annual budget increases that it enjoyed until the coalition’s austerity programme began in 2010. Her pledge intensified a behind-the-scenes battle between Hunt and Hammond over exactly how much money the NHS should get. Hunt has been pushing for the rise to be as close to 4% as possible, whereas Hammond initially said anything above 2.5% was unaffordable. The fact that it looks like the final increase will be at least 3% a year suggests that Hunt has had significant success in the battle for May’s ear. He has warned her that the increasingly visible problems in the NHS – including the biggest winter crisis last year, deepening understaffing and the inability to meet A&amp;E and cancer treatment targets – will only intensify without a radical rethink in the government’s approach to the the service, and that would carry obvious political risk. But Hammond seems to have gained more control of the process as the announcement has drawn close. Hunt is now concentrating his lobbying on the chancellor, not May. What will the new money be spent on? On Thursday Hunt told the annual conference of the NHS Confederation that, whatever the sum, it would be used to deliver “a small group of bold ambitions”, including new waiting time targets for mental health care, improve Britain’s poor cancer survival rates, make maternity care safer and complete the government’s declared mission of integrating health and social care services in England. Where will all this extra money come from? No one knows yet. Hammond will set that out in his next budget, in November. There will also be a new, detailed plan for how the NHS will spend the money – the improvements it will make in return for May’s largesse – around the same time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/19/plantwatch-surge-in-hay-fever-rooted-in-our-modern-lifestyles","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T20:30:21Z","webTitle":"The surge in hay fever is rooted in our modern lifestyles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/19/plantwatch-surge-in-hay-fever-rooted-in-our-modern-lifestyles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jun/19/plantwatch-surge-in-hay-fever-rooted-in-our-modern-lifestyles","fields":{"headline":"The surge in hay fever is rooted in our modern lifestyles","bodyText":"This has been the worst month for hay fever for 12 years. Grasses had perfect growing conditions over late April and in May with warm sunshine and showers. That was followed in June by hot dry conditions when the grass flowers matured and shed clouds of pollen on light breezes and up people’s noses. The strange thing is that hay fever was incredibly rare when it was first reported by John Bostoc, a London doctor, nearly 200 years ago. Yet in those days far more people lived and worked in the countryside, where grasses grew everywhere. Today, hay fever has reached epidemic proportions and afflicts more than a fifth of the British population, even in towns where you might imagine grass pollen is less of a problem. This statistic has been blamed on modern lifestyles, including factors such as obsessive hygiene and excessive use of antibiotics. Above all, air pollution from traffic is a huge factor in the upsurge of hay fever. Exhaust fumes help weaken pollen grains, making them split open more easily and spew out the allergic substances that trigger the condition. And polluting gases, such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide, also make hay fever sufferers more sensitive to pollen allergens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/15/labour-live-festival-jeremy-corbyn-clean-bandit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T11:53:50Z","webTitle":"Labour Live: can the troubled festival recapture 2017's Corbynmania?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/15/labour-live-festival-jeremy-corbyn-clean-bandit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/15/labour-live-festival-jeremy-corbyn-clean-bandit","fields":{"headline":"Labour Live: can the troubled festival recapture 2017's Corbynmania?","bodyText":"It was intended to build on that 2017 Glastonbury moment, when tens of thousands of people chanted “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” in an outburst of post-election euphoria. But with Labour Live – the party’s attempt at running a music and politics festival, one year on from the Glastonbury love-in – organisers will just be hoping a few thousand people turn up and the rain holds off. Insiders say more than 3,000 of 20,000 tickets have been sold, though the party won’t confirm this. The trade union Unite has been giving away tickets just to ensure a decent crowd at the White Hart Lane recreation ground in Tottenham, north London, on Saturday. In a week in which Theresa May has faced incessant battles to force Brexit though the parliament, Labour staffers talk of little other than the prospects for Labour Live, with its success or otherwise being seen within the party as an indicator of whether Corbyn’s popularity has peaked. One senior party employee said that while the idea – the brainchild of the MP Ian Lavery – was well intentioned, the leader’s team was too optimistic, declining to take on expert help and, particularly, refusing to allocate enough funding. “There was just this belief that artists would perform for free like they do in election campaigns for the good of the Labour party, but this has none of the intensity of a campaign,” one said. Key figures in the party, led by Corbyn’s all-powerful chief of staff, Karie Murphy, have a fight on their hands to ensure the event is seen as a success. They secured a badly needed coup on Thursday when Clean Bandit were announced as headliners and ticket sales have picked up somewhat since. Up to then the best-known act had been the indie group The Magic Numbers. Well-known Corbyn supporters, the band were among those who appeared in support of the Labour leader at a rally in Birmingham where thousands gathered last June before the general election. The difficulty in attracting high-profile acts had hampered ticket sales for months and sources say at one point in the spring Labour seriously considered cancelling the event. They decided not to after it was said at a crucial meeting that grime artist Stormzy had been booked. That turned out not to be the case, and while hasty attempts were made to secure his presence it did not prove possible. Reports that he had demanded a £100,000 fee have been denied by the party. It even proved difficult for Labour to book party stalwart Billy Bragg due to his tour commitments; Bragg already had a gig booked in Kent on Saturday night. Labour Live’s first acts are due on the main stage shortly after noon. There will be turns from local MPs David Lammy and Kate Osamor, the party’s general secretary Jennie Formby, and Corbyn himself, who is due on at 5.30pm after an introduction from the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Corbyn will be followed by The Magic Numbers, while “original Sex Pistol” Glen Matlock and Reverend and The Makers due on later. Ticket prices were slashed from £35 to £10, while Corbyn got more involved in an attempt to recreate the 2017 election spirit. He told the Fire Brigades Union annual conference in Brighton last week: “We have new types of political events such as the Labour Live festival. It will have musicians, speakers, activists, trade unionists all coming together in one place … to learn from each other … but also to enjoy ourselves while reflecting on how far Labour has come as a movement.” Although not everybody in the audience was convinced. A constant stream of leaks from inside Labour have not helped. Party sources said the festival’s drinks supplier – the Workers Beer Company – was refusing to supply beer kegs as it didn’t think there would be enough people to justify them. Organisers were said to have “gone to war” with the company, though it remains to be seen whether revellers will be served draft beer or bottles and cans. Event costs could be as high as £1.4m, though the exact figure is a closely guarded secret and will not be known until the event is over. Insiders at Unite and Labour have said the trade union is underwriting most of the costs, though neither the party nor the union will comment. Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, is due to appear at the festival’s “solidarity tent” for People’s Question Time, while his union is also sponsoring a hip-hop karaoke event, challenging attendees to “prove you are better at karaoke than they are!”, and an ice cream van, which will carry the slogan “Ice cream lovers of the world – unite” and play a jingle version of The Red Flag. A Labour spokesperson said that the party “couldn’t say right now” whether it would repeat Labour Live in the future. “We thought it worth trying as Glastonbury isn’t on this year. We’ll see how it goes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/16/furious-locals-lose-bid-to-buy-hastings-pier-for-community","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T12:19:27Z","webTitle":"'Furious' locals lose bid to buy Hastings pier for community","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/furious-locals-lose-bid-to-buy-hastings-pier-for-community","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/furious-locals-lose-bid-to-buy-hastings-pier-for-community","fields":{"headline":"'Furious' locals lose bid to buy Hastings pier for community","bodyText":"Campaigners fighting to save Hastings pier for the community are “devastated and furious” over its sale to a businessman for a fraction of what it cost to rebuild. The Eastbourne hotelier Sheikh Abid Gulzar was reported to have paid £50,000 for the pier, which was rebuilt with £12.4m of lottery money but went into administration last November. Friends of Hastings Pier had raised more than £477,000 of a £500,000 target to buy the pier and keep it open to the public for free. A company was willing to set up a joint venture with FOHP to secure the future of the structure. After news of the sale to Gulzar emerged late on Friday night, angry locals gathered on the pier to offer to buy it off him for £65,000. He refused the offer. “We are devastated but we are also furious,” James Chang, a spokesman for FOHP, said. “Why would the administrators mess us about leading us to believe we have time and the chance to buy the pier if we haven’t. “Everyone is very upset. We now have a lot of questions about how this was handled.” In a statement explaining its decision, the administrator Adam Stephens said its main concern had been to “find a viable buyer for this important heritage asset”. During an impromptu protest on Wednesday at what residents call the “people’s pier”, Jess Steele, a leading FOHP campaigner, said there was a clear alternative to private ownership. She said the group had found a commercial partner willing to enter into a joint venture to secure the future of the grade II-listed pier, which won an architectural award last year. Gulzar, 73, nicknamed “Goldfinger” for his love of the colour, upset residents in neighbouring Eastbourne after he painted part of the pier, which he also owns, gold without planning permission. He has banned dogs, cycles and fishing from the pier. FOHP has said the Hastings pier should belong to the community and needs to break even, not make a profit. Gulzar said he aimed to turn the pier into a “world class attraction and, more than anything, to make it profitable”. He added: “I want to get a top restaurant on the pier, but we have to see about planning permission. There will be other plans to reveal in the near future which will also help business.” • This article was amended on 18 June 2018 to remove an incorrect reference to there being an entrance fee at Eastbourne pier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/15/what-current-scale-migration-crisis-europe-future-outlook","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-21T17:28:50Z","webTitle":"What is the current state of the migration crisis in Europe?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/what-current-scale-migration-crisis-europe-future-outlook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/what-current-scale-migration-crisis-europe-future-outlook","fields":{"headline":"What is the current state of the migration crisis in Europe?","bodyText":"More than three years after Europe’s biggest influx of migrants and refugees since the second world war, tensions between EU member states over how to handle irregular immigration from outside the bloc – mainly from the Middle East and Africa – remain high. What is the scale of migration? Numbers are sharply down from their 2015-16 peak because of a 2016 EU deal with Turkey, new border fences in the Balkans, and a 2017 bilateral arrangement between Italy and Libya, but tens of thousands of people are still trying to reach Europe. The UNHCR says Spain has taken in 56,200 irregular migrants arriving by sea so far this year, Greece 28,700 and Italy 22,500. Overland arrivals in Greece have climbed sharply to 14,000, a three-fold increase on the same period last year. The underlying factors that have led to more than 1.8 million migrants coming to Europe since 2014 have not gone away; most observers believe it is only a matter of time before the number of arrivals picks up significantly once more. Why is it a problem? Everyone agrees Europe needs to urgently overhaul its asylum and immigration rules. At present Spain, Italy and Greece take most of the strain owing to their geographical position on the Mediterranean Sea and the fact that, under EU law, asylum seekers must lodge their applications in the first EU country they enter. However, no one can agree on what to do: some countries want tougher external border controls, others fairer distribution of new arrivals. Any solution will have to balance the concerns of “frontline” southern states with those of wealthier northern “destination” states, while dealing with the refusal of hardline central and eastern ones (such as Hungary and Poland) to accept any migrants at all. What is the wider political context? With anti-immigration sentiment on the rise across the continent, the presence in Italy’s government of the far-right League party of Matteo Salvini, which campaigned on a pledge to send 500,000 irregular migrants home, is making itself felt. The similarly rightwing, populist Freedom party is sharing power in Austria. In Germany – which welcomed more than 1 million migrants in 2015 under Angela Merkel’s open-door policy – the rightwing Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has kept immigration firmly at the top of the political agenda. After a series of electoral setbacks, the chancellor has said she will not stand again. Polling shows immigration and terrorism remain EU citizens’ top concerns. Where do things stand? The death toll on the central Mediterranean route to Italy has fallen in the past year, but the number of those drowning as a proportion of arrivals has risen sharply to 2,054 so far this year, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Amid a string of high-profile cases of migrant rescue boats left drifting at sea, NGO vessels have all but disappeared from the main migration routes to Italy following Salvini’s announcement after taking office this summer that he was closing Italian ports to non-Italian rescue vessels. European leaders papered over their divisions at a crunch summer summit but have so far dodged any formal agreement on refugee quotas, with central states rejecting any form of mandatory action. What will happen now? Merkel is on record as saying the future of the European Union hinges on whether it can find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration, but although leaders agree on the need to ease the burden on Italy and Greece, details are scarce. Efforts will be shared, but only voluntarily. Members are to take in rescued migrants and establish centres to assess asylum claims on their soil, and the bloc will explore regional processing platforms in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. But so far none of these countries have agreed to help, while a couple have ruled themselves out. Meanwhile Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, is leading a call among some states for a “strong border” to stop an “invasion”. Nothing is yet settled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/15/david-squires-on-putin-spain-and-the-world-cup-2018-kick-off","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T09:55:00Z","webTitle":"David Squires on … Putin, Spain and the World Cup 2018 kick-off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/15/david-squires-on-putin-spain-and-the-world-cup-2018-kick-off","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/15/david-squires-on-putin-spain-and-the-world-cup-2018-kick-off","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on … Putin, Spain and the World Cup 2018 kick-off","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/15/a-bruising-week-in-a-difficult-year-for-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T16:22:26Z","webTitle":"A bruising week in a difficult year for Theresa May | Anne Perkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/15/a-bruising-week-in-a-difficult-year-for-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/15/a-bruising-week-in-a-difficult-year-for-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"A bruising week in a difficult year for Theresa May","bodyText":"When Theresa May landed at Heathrow at 7am last Sunday, one of the most critical weeks since she became prime minister almost exactly two years ago had just begun. The arcane nature of the wrangling over the precise way parliament can have a meaningful vote on a Brexit deal without actually binding the government’s hands can be misleading. It may look like a obscure trial by textual analysis. But it is being described as high noon for Brexit. After the overnight flight from the near-farcical G7 summit in Quebec, May went straight to the Sunday church service in her Maidenhead constituency before sitting down to prepare for the week ahead. The importance of the two days of votes on Lords amendments had been highlighted the previous week when Boris Johnson was recorded warning that Brexit would happen, but not necessarily in the right way. “I am of the view it will be fine. [Brexit] will happen and I think it will be irreversible,” he was taped saying at a Conservative Way Forward dinner. “The risk is it will not be the one we want and the risk is that we will end up in a sort of anteroom of the EU, with an orbit around the EU, in a customs union and to a large extent in the single market.” The sense of an impending watershed lay behind some reports in the pro-Brexit press of plots to unseat the prime minister as soon as the withdrawal bill is on the statute book. Then the focus will be on shaping Britain’s future relations with the EU and the rest of the world. That is why a meaningful vote on the final deal is so critical. In next Wednesday’s vote on the amendment, Brexiters believe May has offered enough to split the rebel camp. But neither faction knows for sure. The numbers on each side as well as the actual outcome will establish where the parliamentary majority lies. Brexit dominates May’s in-tray, but she wants her record to stand for more. One priority in the past few days has been to repair the self-inflicted damage from her fumbling response to the Grenfell Tower fire a year ago, in a week unlikely to be surpassed for awfulness. She signed off an article for the London Evening Standard apologising for getting it so wrong. It was published on the eve of the first anniversary. On Monday she answered an hour of questioning from MPs on the G7 summit. Her closing sentiments could have applied as much as to the week ahead of her as to the summit. “This was a difficult summit with, at times, some very candid discussions, but the conclusion I draw is that it is only through continued dialogue that we can find ways to work together to resolve the challenges we face.” On Tuesday, as the resignation of Dr Philip Lee, a junior justice minister, stoked speculation that she was facing a real prospect of defeat, May chaired cabinet. As soon as it ended, the first of two days of debates on the EU withdrawal bill began – including the amendment that Brexiters had set out to portray as an attempt to stop Brexit happening at all and frustrate the will of the people.While Dominic Grieve, the rebels’ negotiator, publicly bargained in the chamber with the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, only a few feet away in her office behind the Speaker’s chair, May was desperately trying to fend off defeat by pledging further talks on the amendment. May is inscrutable in meetings, her face impassive. It can be an effective device in the short term, allowing people to believe they have got what they want. The MPs emerged confident that they had a deal on a meaningful vote. A government defeat was averted. But as May returned to Downing Street to host a reception for Grenfell survivors, her official spokesman cast doubt on the concession the rebels had claimed. Nothing more than talks had been promised, he said. It was not just the confusion over what might have been said that indicated the fragility of May’s position as she prepared for prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. That morning the Guardian reported that her Home Office legacy was being unpicked by her successor but one, Sajid Javid, and Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary. After eight years of nailed-down controls on visas for skilled workers, the ceiling on the number of visas available for doctors and nurses would be lifted. Then on Friday, she abandoned two years of opposition to a substantial increase in spending on the NHS. She conceded an increase for the health service but in a further sign that she cannot always get her way in cabinet, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has still not signed off on a final deal. In a year when it has often seemed that things could not get worse, this has been a bruising week. She has succeeded in reversing all 15 of the Lords amendments but some victories came at a heavy cost. The meaningful vote will be back on Wednesday. This week’s losers now feel betrayed. Sarah Wollaston, one of a longstanding group of Tory rebels, is not alone in talking of betrayal and arguing that the bad faith makes it more likely that the government will be defeated. “Goodwill has been very badly undermined,” she said on Friday. “However that matters far less than the final Brexit deal which will have a profound influence on people’s lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/15/lib-dem-bounce-lewisham-east-labour-brexit-stance-byelection","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T09:50:43Z","webTitle":"A Lib Dem bounce in Lewisham should not shift Labour’s Brexit stance | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/15/lib-dem-bounce-lewisham-east-labour-brexit-stance-byelection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/15/lib-dem-bounce-lewisham-east-labour-brexit-stance-byelection","fields":{"headline":"A Lib Dem bounce in Lewisham should not shift Labour’s Brexit stance","bodyText":"Labour’s resounding victory in Lewisham East is destined to be interpreted thus: because the Liberal Democrats surged from a paltry 4.4% to nearly a quarter of the vote, while Labour’s share fell from two-thirds to just over 50%, Labour should pivot to a firmly anti-Brexit stance. For those of us who don’t like Brexit but particularly fear an ideologically driven Tory hard Brexit, this would be a big mistake. Turnout in the byelection was miserably low: a mere third of eligible voters took part. In last year’s general election, nearly seven out of 10 participated, handing Labour its biggest ever victory in the constituency, surpassing the figure chalked up in the landslide year of 1997 by nearly 10 percentage points. Both turnout and Labour’s success are linked. Corbyn’s Labour mobilised younger voters and previous non-voters who may be persuaded to march to a polling station in a general election, but not in a byelection. Those particularly fired up about an issue – in this case Brexit – can make a particular impact in a low-turnout byelection, knowing that they won’t risk a Tory victory in doing so. Lewisham East is one of the top 10% most pro-remain constituencies in Britain – and yet, even with Brexit in acute crisis, the avowedly pro-remain Lib Dems got a lower share of the vote than in 2010. That they can celebrate this result is a sign of how far the Lib Dems have plummeted – and in another high turnout general election, it would seem reasonable to expect a result similar to last year’s. Brexit is a Tory-engineered mess that Labour did not want. The party has to walk a political tightrope on Brexit because it represents staunchly pro-remain communities like Lewisham, Hackney and Islington, as well as heavily pro-leave communities like Doncaster, Hull and Ashfield. After Labour accepted the referendum result, voted for the triggering of article 50, and made no firm commitments on the single market or customs union in the general election, the narrative was that it would fatally alienate remain voters. But that did not happen. Since then it has softened its approach to Brexit, not least committing to a customs union – and it rightly frets over its leave flank. The only seats Labour lost last year voted decisively for Brexit, such as Mansfield, Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and Stoke-on-Trent South. Labour’s majorities slumped in strongly pro-leave constituencies (such as Ashfield, Dudley North and Bolsover), and Labour MPs representing these communities report that Brexit supporters ask in baffled tones why Britain hasn’t left the EU yet – and believe politicians are trying to thwart their vote. The reason those such as Gloria De Piero and Caroline Flint – Labour MPs who could hardly be described as Corbynites – are emphatic about the need to implement the referendum result is because they know what their constituents are telling them. That doesn’t mean signing up to whatever the Tories put forward, no matter how hard a Brexit, but it does mean accepting that the debate is about how we leave the EU, not if we should. Amid all the noise, the fact is if you voted leave or remain in 2016, polling suggests you would vote the same way again. To borrow Theresa May’s phrase, nothing has changed: not meaningfully, anyway. There is a strong case to be made that, after a second referendum campaign, Brexit would win an even bigger majority, poison our politics even more, and make the likelihood of a hard Brexit all the more likely. There are remain voters who believe the referendum result should be implemented; there are others who would like it reversed, but will vote Labour because they understand what the alternative is. If Labour is to form a majority government with a transformative programme to deal with some of the injustices that drove Brexit in the first place, as well as avoid an ideologically driven Tory Brexit, it needs to build a broad coalition of remain and leave voters. That means offering a compromise: accepting the referendum result but remaining in a customs union, for example. It must also talk about other issues. May wanted to frame last year’s general election as a rerun of the referendum. Labour did not let her, shifting the conversation on other domestic issues, allowing it to deprive the Tories of their majority. The next election is not in the bag for Labour, and its leaders know that. Outside of an election campaign, they haven’t managed to recapture the sense of insurgency that drove their vote surge last year, and that should worry them. But if they fall off their Brexit tightrope, Jacob Rees-Moggified Tories will win the next general election, leaving us with the worst Brexit of all and a profoundly reactionary government to boot. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/jun/18/charity-commission-head-care-workers-pay","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T07:15:43Z","webTitle":"Charity commission head urged to mediate in row over care workers' pay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/jun/18/charity-commission-head-care-workers-pay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/jun/18/charity-commission-head-care-workers-pay","fields":{"headline":"Charity commission head urged to mediate in row over care workers' pay","bodyText":"Charities facing what they say will be ruinous bills for back pay for care workers’ sleep-in shifts are calling on the new chair of the Charity Commission to intervene in their dispute with ministers. The #SolveSleepInsAlliance, which claims to represent charities and other providers of half of all care services for people with learning disabilities, has written to Tina Stowell, now a crossbench peer but formerly a Conservative, to ask her to raise the issue with government. Warning that charities affected will need to start to make back payments – amounting to an estimated £400m – in November, the alliance has told Lady Stowell: “This is the biggest threat to social care that any of us has seen, and charities are at the forefront.” The alliance’s move takes the long-running dispute in a fresh direction. Until now, care providers have been arguing their case directly with ministers, HM Revenue &amp; Customs, which enforces pay rules, and in the courts. A judgment is awaited from the court of appeal. By seeking to involve the charity regulator, the alliance is seeking to open a new front on grounds that it is neither fair nor financially viable to expect charities to use their reserves and/or donated funds to subsidise services for some of the most vulnerable people in society. The dispute centres on a change in HMRC guidance on pay for care workers who sleep overnight at the homes of people they support. Until early 2016, the guidance appeared to say that minimum hourly pay rates applied only when the worker was “awake for the purposes of working”. Following tribunal rulings, however, the guidance was changed. Employers who had previously paid a flat-rate sum for an undisturbed sleep-in shift found themselves liable for not only the full hourly rate for the entire shift in future, but for back pay of up to six years for present and former staff. The alliance’s letter to Stowell – signed by charities including Mencap and Choice Support and also by umbrella organisations such as the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations and Learning Disability England – says a solution must be found. Citing a self-selecting survey of 109 providers earlier this year, the letter says 68% fear for their viability if forced to make six years’ back payments. While the number of councils and NHS commissioners willing to fund full hourly pay in future is growing, it still stands at only 49%. The government must underwrite a deal by November, the letter says, as back payments then start to fall due under an HMRC scheme that gave providers 12 months’ grace if they promised to self-assess their liability. Stowell became commission chair in February amid controversy over her credentials for the role and her Tory membership. She undertook to resign from the party on appointment. The alliance’s letter points out that she said in her first speech as chair that she saw the commission’s role as to represent not the interests of charities, but those of the public. It says: ”Could we ask you to raise this matter urgently with government, so as to represent the public interest in this matter?” A commission spokeswoman said: “I can confirm that we have received the letter, are considering its contents and will respond in due course.” Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Admittedly the character is a meteorologist but he has a point: other countries have a climate whereas we in Britain have weather. But finally catching up with Haig’s much-travelled play, first seen in Edinburgh in 2014, I was struck by how it expands to acquire meanings beyond its immediate subject. Haig has seized on the historical fact that there was much tension surrounding the timing of the D-day landings in Normandy in June 1944. General Eisenhower, in charge of European operations, had set a precise date of 5 June. However, James Stagg, chief meteorological adviser to the allies, arrives at the HQ at Southwick, Hampshire, and warns of severe weather conditions on the appointed day. If he is right, the invasion will be a disaster leading to massive loss of life. But he is vehemently opposed by his American counterpart, Colonel Krick, and Eisenhower is left to make the crucial decision as to whether to delay the operation. Since we know the outcome, you might say there is little tension. Haig, however, gets round that in several ways. One is by giving us detailed information about the shifting weather patterns in the Atlantic so we begin to grasp the dilemma faced by Eisenhower. Haig also sets up a contrast in character and method between the rival meteorologists. Krick relies on analogue charts recalling weather patterns in previous years; Stagg, a tenacious, hard-headed Scot, bases his forecasts on hourly scientific readings and precise knowledge of the complexity of British weather. Haig constantly reminds us what is at stake but his play transcends its context. Given that the story involves Britain and the European mainland – though, in this case invasion rather than withdrawal – the conflict between a self-deluding optimism and a pragmatic realism takes on an unexpected resonance. I was even reminded of the debate about climate change, where wilful denial is confronted by inescapable fact. Haig seems reluctant to bring his play to an end and overstresses the coincidental pressure on Stagg, whose wife is due to give birth even as D-day is imminent, but he has found rich drama in the interaction of war and weather. As an actor, he is also ideally equipped to play Stagg. Haig’s forte is playing men in the grip of an idee fixe: in farce that can be very funny but here it means he endows Stagg, head always thrust forward in a state of permanent inquiry, with a peculiar brusque intensity. Even if Stagg’s worries about his wife occasionally intrude, Haig also makes something deeply moving out of the moment when the character’s quivering anxiety breaks through his surface stoicism. Malcolm Sinclair is exemplary as Eisenhower showing how the poker-backed professional soldier is awed by his sense of responsibility.

The final draft report from the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) was due for publication in October. It is the guiding scientific document for what countries must do to combat climate change. Human-induced warming would exceed 1.5C by about 2040 if emissions continued at their present rate, the report found, but countries could keep warming below that level if they made “rapid and far-reaching” changes. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, almost 200 countries signed up to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. Climate scientist and Climate Analytics director Bill Hare said the draft report showed with greater clarity how much faster countries needed to move towards decarbonisation under various temperature situations and that the impacts of climate change greatly increased between 1.5C and 2C of warming. Necessary actions include making the transition to renewable energy, powering the transport sector with zero carbon electricity, improving agricultural management and stopping deforestation. “This IPCC report shows anyone drawing from published papers that there are big differences between 1.5 and 2 degrees warming in both natural and human systems,” Hare said. “Two degrees warming and the tropical reefs have basically no chance – 1.5 degrees, they have a small to modest chance of survival. “There’s a range of commentary that comes out of the report that provides a stronger narrative for us to act than ever before.” He said it showed that if emissions continued on their present pathway, there was no chance of limiting global temperature rises even to 3C. Economic modelling in the draft report showed that the dangers for economic growth, particularly in developing countries, were significantly greater at 2C than 1.5C. The Greenpeace International executive director, Jennifer Morgan, said the moment of truth had come for leaders and the feasibility of achieving the Paris goals was a political choice. “This choice must be driven by a moral obligation that binds us together. Through international cooperation, real ambition and working with communities, our leaders still have the time to do what they must,” she said. “That means saying no to fossil fuels and standing up for forest and ocean protection with decisions that prove they understand the urgency. It means cutting down on meat and dairy consumption, and changing the way we produce our food.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/15/we-all-have-a-right-to-walk-home-safely","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T08:20:24Z","webTitle":"Women respond to Eurydice Dixon murder: 'We all have a right to walk home safely'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/15/we-all-have-a-right-to-walk-home-safely","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/15/we-all-have-a-right-to-walk-home-safely","fields":{"headline":"Women respond to Eurydice Dixon murder: 'We all have a right to walk home safely'","bodyText":"Eurydice Dixon was a young comedian, who is remembered as a talented performer and “remarkable” young woman with a bright future. She walked home after performing a comedy gig on Tuesday night. Her body was found on Wednesday morning in Melbourne’s Princes Park, and Jaymes Todd, 19, has since been charged with her rape and murder. Her death has prompted women across the country to talk about victim blaming, moving around their cities at night and being sick of having to live in fear. ‘We need men of goodwill to demand respect for women’ I felt sick to my stomach when I heard the news about the murder of Eurydice Dixon. Another young woman, bursting with potential, on the brink of her adult life, going about her business killed by a man who regarded her as an object for his gratification and discarded her in the most brutal possible way after he got what he wanted. I am sick of women and girls having to live in fear, on a level few men can even imagine. Most men do not rape and murder but as my sister said recently, men are like dogs, most of them are nice but some of them are vicious and you can’t tell which is which just by looking at them. What with the rise of the loathsome “incels”, the idea that men are somehow “owed” sex, and that our bodies do not wholly belong to us but to society (wear this, don’t wear that), the church (you opened your legs, now you must have the baby), the police (don’t go here, don’t go there), and the family (I’ll kill you if you try to leave, bitch), we need men of goodwill to get serious about demanding respect for women from other men, particularly if they have sons. Because the tragedy of your daughter being in the wrong place at the wrong time is terrifying to contemplate, but to have your son grow up to be the sort of man who commits such crimes? That is the worst fate as a parent (and now a grandparent) I can imagine. Jane Caro is a novelist, writer and social commentator ‘How dare we exist in spaces at night?’ There is a lot that may divide women and femmes in the world but an almost universal experience is that public spaces, particularly at night, are not safe for us. I don’t know a woman or femme that hasn’t been harassed on the street by men. It doesn’t matter what our class, sexualities, gender expression, race is – we are told implicitly and explicitly that public spaces are still not ours. We text our friends, we put them in taxis and Ubers, we don’t make eye contact, we run instead of walking, we learn self-defence – but nothing will ever be enough. The response from the police and the public is often to in some way blame the victim, what were they wearing, why were they out so late. How dare we exist in spaces at night? People have expressed a lot of shame and disappointment in the police’s response, but I am not surprised. For many black women it is police who make our walk home unsafer. Rebecca Maher was walking home and never made it because she was picked up by police and died hours later in their custody. When Ms Dhu died in police custody the public and police blamed her too. At one point she could not walk in their custody, and they told her she was faking it. We are not safe in public, and particularly as black women we are not safe in the hands of the state, nor are any of us safe at home. In the words of Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, “I are not the problem”. To my fellow women and femmes I say, neither are you. We all have a right to walk home safely. Nayuka Gorrie is a Kurnai/Gunai, Gunditjmara, Wiradjuri and Yorta Yorta freelance writer ‘There are demons in the dark’ I did not know Eurydice Dixon but I felt her death personally. Not only myself but a lot of women will feel the death of Eurydice Dixon personally, not because we know her but because her murder is the summation of fears we govern our own lives by every single day. It’s winter and it’s dark by 5:30pm, which means my normal commute home is a range of a thousand thoughts about what I would do “just in case”. Is my phone charged? Does someone at the bus stop/on the bus have a weird vibe? I’ll take my headphones off just in case. I’ll hold my keys in my hand as maybe a weapon and so I can get into my house quickly “just in case”. I’ve made a note of “friendly” looking houses in the day “just in case” something happens in the dark. I text my friends my location just as Eurydice did. I don’t know women who don’t do this because there are demons in the dark. I wish I didn’t have to and I wish this incident didn’t reiterate my fear of the dark just as Jill Meagher’s murder did. I wish we taught men to be kind and compassionate, empathetic to those outside their families. Teach them this is not weakness, Teach them not to murder women. Freya Logan is a Melbourne local, co-host of Follow Sports Like A Girl podcast and amateur footy player ‘Trust us when we tell you that the fear is real’ I look around. Is anyone following me? It’s 12am on a Friday night, and it is not okay that my first thoughts walking home involve fear of harassment or death. I’m on edge. I pretend to engage in a phone conversation. I zip my jacket up and pull my skirt to look longer. This is a safe suburb. I don’t need to be worried, do I? Young women like me internalise every “trivial” word yelled out to us and take the trauma home. What seems as a passing comment, in fact lives on with us for the rest of our lives. To my male counterparts, I say: We need you. We need you now more than ever to be our allies. In a society that seems to point all fingers at us for not taking appropriate precautions when walking home, we need you. We do not expect you to understand the overwhelming fear that engulfs young women and non-binary folk every time we walk home alone. We do not expect you to understand that we change our travel plans and brave the inconvenience to accommodate a society that repeatedly fails us. One that has failed Eurydice Dixon and left her family and friends dealing with unimaginable pain. We do not expect you to understand, but we need you to trust us. Trust us when we tell you that the fear is real. How many more sacrifices must we make before society believes it is not our fault? Kripa Krithivasan is a youth activist with Plan International Australia ‘I am permanently vigilant’ When I was younger I lived in a country town, it felt safe, and sometimes I would walk home a night; always against my mother’s recommendations. When I moved to Sydney, I walked home all the time, often drunk. At the time my attitude was one of rebellion. I have a black belt in karate, so I felt as though I would know what to do, if something were to happen. When I moved to Melbourne, I would go running around Princes Park in the evening. I had my headphones in and a defiant attitude but enough nouse to know that I should be aware of my surroundings at all times. I would notice if someone was running a bit too close, and I always took my phone. Eventually my defiance wore away and I started running with one earpiece from my headphones in, the other hanging out, so I could hear if someone was too close behind me. I stopped running around 2012, just before Jill Meagher was killed. Since relocating to our property in the Dandenong Ranges I wouldn’t say I’m “wiser,” perhaps instead a little beaten down. Operating a fitness business, I spend a lot of time working in the dark. I am permanently vigilant, for myself and for my clients. I’ve just accepted the notion that I should act in a way to try – whatever that means – to prevent a random sexual assault. Every women I know has been made to feel unsafe at some point in their life, including myself. But, as Melbourne’s lord mayor, Sally Capp, announced today, they’re going to put in a few more lights so, you know, I feel safer already. Rebecca Cameron is a personal trainer and former social worker ‘There’s creeps everywhere you go’ I live in Newcastle and travel by train into Sydney where I work in a call centre each day, so I’m on the train at 5am and home at 9pm. A lot of the time there’s not many people around. It can feel risky, but it wasn’t a job I was going to pass up, so it’s just a risk I’ve got to take. I find myself in many difficult situations. I tend to pick the train I catch based on times that are not too early, due to being abused in the past by a man before 5am, also not too late, due to young men looking to cause trouble with workers and other women such as myself at night. I have witnessed young men acting inappropriately – abusing transit officers and police, yelling, swearing at people. I’ve experienced older men leering at me. You’ve got to just completely keep to yourself. There’s creeps everywhere you go. You see the way they’re acting to school girls on the train – someone might just be standing a bit close, or it might be someone staring at your phone. Little things like that. I tend to let my partner and also my dad know where I am at all times. They know roughly what time I leave, when I’ll be at the train station. I’m really diligent, especially in the evenings. I never stay in a carriage on my own ever, especially going home. If I find myself alone in a carriage I move to another one with people in it. Stories like the one this week - it definitely makes you think. You still want to be able to go about your life, but it plays on your mind.

The policy was outlined in a “discussion draft” of an immigration proposal that aims to find common ground between rival factions of the House Republican party by pairing relief for young undocumented immigrants with billions of dollars in funding for Donald Trump’s wall along the southern border. The plan comes as weeks of negotiations over a path forward on immigration coincided with painful stories about children being separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border, the result of the administration’s “zero-tolerance” approach to immigration enforcement. The controversial practice of forcibly separating families has led to widespread condemnation from human rights groups, religious leaders and lawmakers. “We don’t want kids to be separated from their parents,” the House speaker, Paul Ryan, told reporters during a weekly press conference, echoing the sentiments expressed by several members of his own party. He called on Congress to find a legislative solution. Republicans’ “discussion draft” would keep families united by clarifying a 1997 court ruling that prevents undocumented children from being held in custody for long periods – in addition to providing protections for young undocumented immigrants, funding for a border wall and restrictions on legal immigration. The proposal comes as the US government intends to construct a temporary shelter in Tornillo, Texas, to accommodate the overflow of unaccompanied children as a result of the Trump administration policy, according to the Associated Press. A spokesman for the US Department of Health and Human Services told the AP that the facility would have “soft-sided structures”, but did not clarify whether the children would be housed in “tents”. Democrats have railed against the policy. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, drew attention to the issue after he was denied entry to a federal detention center housing unaccompanied minors earlier this month. On Wednesday, eight House Democrats, including the veteran civil rights leader John Lewis, linked arms and blocked traffic in protest of the Trump administration policy. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, called the policy “barbaric” and said “this is not what America is”. “This is the policy of the Trump administration. And they put down this practice and they take it back,” she told reporters on Thursday, adding: “What is it that they don’t get about how stupid and wrong and immoral [this is]?” Trump has repeatedly eschewed responsibility for his own administration’s policy, blaming the separations on a “horrible law” passed by Democrats. There is no such law that requires the government to separate children from their parents. The increasing number of families being separated at the border is largely the result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” enforcement policy in which immigrants entering the US illegally would be referred for criminal prosecution. Previously, the administration would allow children to remain with their parents by releasing families while they awaited civil deportation proceedings. Now the administration is choosing to release the children to relatives or foster care. On Thursday, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, cited the bible to defend the administration’s hardline approach to border enforcement. “I can say that it is very biblical to enforce the law. That is actually repeated a number of times throughout the Bible,” she told reporters during the press briefing. “It’s a moral policy to follow and enforce the law.” Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, had earlier on Thursday referenced a passage from the Bible to defend the administration’s border policy. The public criticism of the administration’s immigration policy disrupted negotiations between House Republicans this week. House Republican leadership narrowly avoided a showdown over immigration after moderate members attempted to force a vote on legislation that would provide protections for young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers. To avert the rebellion, Ryan pledged to allow votes next week on two immigration bills: a plan billed as a compromise between factions of the Republican party and a more conservative proposal backed by the conservative bloc. Their fates remain uncertain as Republicans try to marshall support while Democrats signaled that they are unlikely to back either legislation. Asked if the White House supported either plan, Sanders refused to answer directly. “The president’s already laid out a proposal that closes the legal loopholes and provides the resources to secure our border,” she said. “If the process leads to a permanent solution, as outlined by the president, then we would support it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/15/cricket-australia-rejects-rumours-abc-will-lose-radio-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T01:06:46Z","webTitle":"Cricket Australia rejects rumours ABC will lose radio rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/15/cricket-australia-rejects-rumours-abc-will-lose-radio-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/15/cricket-australia-rejects-rumours-abc-will-lose-radio-rights","fields":{"headline":"Cricket Australia rejects rumours ABC will lose radio rights","bodyText":"Cricket Australia’s outgoing boss, James Sutherland, says reports that the ABC is on the verge of being excluded from the next round of radio broadcasting rights are “mischievous and incorrect”. Sutherland, who announced his retirement at chief executive of CA last week, appeared on ABC radio in Melbourne on Friday to address rumours that cricket’s governing body was considering ending its 80-year partnership with the national broadcaster. “We’ve had a fantastic relationship with the ABC over a long period, [more than] any other broadcaster on radio or TV,” he said. “From time to time as part of our business cycle we review our contracts and go through that process and [we have] never been in a position to think about not having the ABC as a partner.” Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day Sutherland said a new broadcasting deal between CA and the ABC was “not far away”. He said negotiations between broadcasters were “getting to the pointy end” and the reports were “nothing but mischievous”. “It’s a non-exclusive arrangement just as in the past [and the timing is] more related to us being able to announce all of our partners at the same time,” he said. Reports that CA was considering dumping the ABC came only months after the decision was made to cut ties with Channel Nine thanks to the new TV deal. It sparked a predictable outcry from fans, and Sutherland said he was “not surprised” by the reaction. “I’m one of those fans as well and have been since I was a little kid,” he said. “When I’m listening on the radio that’s how I consume or engage with cricket. It’s a highly valued partnership.” Sutherland said he had spoken to the director of ABC radio, Michael Mason, after the reporting on Thursday and they had “both confirmed to each other our commitment to see this through”. Speculation that CA was considering dumping ABC was first published on Channel Nine’s Wide World of Sports website but was also pushed by Eddie McGuire on Thursday. “I heard a very interesting whisper yesterday,” Eddie said on Triple M’s The Hot Breakfast. “There is some strong mail going around that the ABC may lose the cricket on the radio.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/15/police-pro-trump-berkeley-leftwing-activists-court-case","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T10:00:13Z","webTitle":"Police worked with violent pro-Trump activist to prosecute leftwing group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/15/police-pro-trump-berkeley-leftwing-activists-court-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/15/police-pro-trump-berkeley-leftwing-activists-court-case","fields":{"headline":"Police worked with violent pro-Trump activist to prosecute leftwing group","bodyText":"A pro-Trump demonstrator who admitted hitting protesters at a far-right rally received help and support from California police, who worked with him to prosecute leftwing activists, records show. Documents and testimony in a trial surrounding a rightwing demonstration in Berkeley reveal that police and prosecutors pursued charges on behalf of Daniel Quillinan, a conservative activist who has posted fascist memes and came to the event with Kyle Chapman, now a celebrated figure amongst the “alt-right”. The authorities consistently treated Quillinan as a victim even though he was visibly armed with a knife, a wooden “shield” and a “flagpole” – and had told law enforcement that he “hit someone in the head”, according to court files. The resulting criminal trial against five anti-fascist protesters – who are accused of assaulting Quillinan during a roughly 15-second altercation – is, according to activists, the latest example of US law enforcement aggressively targeting leftwing demonstrators and favoring members of the far-right after violent clashes. In another California case, police have worked directly with neo-Nazis to go after counter-protesters, including a black activist stabbed at a white supremacist rally. “This makes a pretty clear statement of choosing sides,” Dustin Sawtelle, one of the anti-fascist defendants, said in an interview this week before the trial began. “We figured maybe they were trying to use charges as a scare tactic ... It feels like they have to prosecute somebody.” At the trial in a crowded Oakland courtroom, defense attorneys argued that local police were tolerant of the pro-Trump violence on 4 March last year, that Quillinan was an armed aggressor and fascist provocateur, and that prosecutors lacked basic evidence about the alleged assault. The prosecutor, along with several police witnesses, argued that the men were observed attacking Quillinan with punches and kicks during a short confrontation outside of the rally. The event, billed as a “March for Trump” and “free speech” event, attracted interest from members of the alt-right and was linked to the Proud Boys, a far-right pro-Trump group of self-proclaimed “western chauvinists” that has been classified by watchdogs as a hate organization. Quillinan arrived at the rally wearing a red Trump hat, and a shirt referencing the Chilean dictator General Pinochet and a far-right meme with the words “physical removal”, which he said in court referred to the removal of “communists and Democrats”. Quillinan testified that he was “conservative” and pro-Trump, but said he was not “alt-right” nor a white nationalist and alleged that his shirt and online posts referencing fascism were “jokes”. The audience of anti-fascists supporting the defendants, who some have called the “Berkeley 5”, groaned loudly when the prosecutor described the rally as a “free speech” event. Police video showed that when Quillinan arrived, an officer noted he had a knife, but said he could “keep it”, despite a local ordinance restricting the carrying of “dangerous weapons”, said the defense attorney, Shanta Driver. Quillinan said in court that he brought the knife as a “deterrent” and the wooden board he carried like a shield was a “poster”. On cross examination, he admitted he might have hit someone with the board “by accident” and also said he had used his pole to try to break up fights and struck two people. Law enforcement is aware of Quillinan’s use of the pole as a weapon. Prosecutor James Logan wrote that Quillinan admitted “he swung his flagpole” and at one point struck a man in the head. Quillinan said he offered to give the man money after he realized he was conservative. When the alleged attack by the five defendants occurred, Quillinan was receiving medical aid for a head injury. Quillinan and Jesse Grant, a police officer who was nearby, testified that the anti-fascists were walking by when one kicked Quillinan and then others started punching and kicking. The defense, however, said Quillinan tripped one of the men and then hit him with his shield. Both sides said the interaction was brief. Sergeant Grant testified that he couldn’t specify the exact actions of several of the defendants, saying it was a “scrum” and “arms and legs were flying”. A fire captain present during the incident testified that he couldn’t recognize or identify the defendants seated in the courtroom. Quillinan had also originally said one of his attackers had “red hair”, which does not match any of the defendants. Asked about this discrepancy in court, he said: “I may have misremembered.” In an interview with Quillinan the day of the incident, Grant raised the idea of charges, according to a recording, saying: “The people who attacked you – do you want them to go to jail?” “Very much so,” Quillinan replied. Jeff Armstrong, another defendant, told the Guardian that he showed up to the march to help protect people from rightwing violence: “We went to do medical aid for people and also to defend people who can’t defend themselves.” Police and prosecutors declined to comment. Quillinan, who was ordered not to speak about the case while the trial is ongoing, could not be reached. It’s unclear if any rightwing demonstrators faced assault charges for the 4 March fight. Chapman, the rightwing activist, was charged with possession of a leaded stick in a case that is still pending. Even if the five anti-fascist protesters are acquitted, the case that has dragged on for more than a year has already impacted their lives, said Sawtelle, a 41-year-old tattoo artist and martial arts teacher. He said his personal information was posted online, leading to threats, and that he lost a job as a result of the charges. He said he has also been forced to be more cautious about his activism and participation in protests. “I think that’s part of the tactic – to get people away from these things,” he said, adding: “I don’t plan on quieting down.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/facebook-news-reports-electoral-data-misuse-scandals","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T13:00:14Z","webTitle":"Could this be the end of Facebook controlling news?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/facebook-news-reports-electoral-data-misuse-scandals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/facebook-news-reports-electoral-data-misuse-scandals","fields":{"headline":"Could this be the end of Facebook controlling news?","bodyText":"Has social media – that ad-guzzling tyrant of a teenager – reached a turning point on the way to adulthood? Scandals over electoral fraud and misuse of data appear, for the first time, to be affecting the behaviour of Facebook and those who use it. Journalists love to announce a watershed moment and the relationship between those who produce most of the world’s news, and those who host it online, is still as fractious as that between parent and teenage child. But two hefty reports last week show signs of a shift. First, the Reuters Institute digital news report found that the use of social media – such as Facebook – for news has started to fall for the first time since records began seven years ago. Then, the latest study by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism found that social media groups themselves were responding to evidence of dysfunction, not by citing market forces but with “civic duty and fear of regulation”. What matters most is what this means for a news ecosystem that has seen its economic foundations shaken by social media. This issue is live, not because of weighty research, or changing patterns of behaviour, but because of what any turning point could mean for the ongoing sustainability of news. Both of last week’s studies, which focused on the end of 2017 and early 2018 and, in the institute’s case, involved more than 74,000 people around the world, suggest that doubts over possible electoral abuse by foreign agents in Russia, combined with the misuse of personal data by shadowy groups such as Cambridge Analytica, has affected public and political opinion. Add in concerns over the increasingly toxic nature of political and social discourse online, and Facebook’s algorithmic changes which prioritise interactions with family and friends, the changes have all made more impact than news publishers’ catastrophic warnings. Users accessing Facebook for news fell from 42% to 36% during 2017. In the most polarised countries – Spain, with its issues over independence, and the US – concerns over what is real and what is fake news is highest. Not that either report suggested news publishers have less to fear. The term “fake news” may refer solely to manufactured information made up to attract clicks and therefore finance, but it hurts publishers, too. Slightly more people (75%) thought publishers were responsible for unreliable news than platforms (71%). Turning points can go several ways, of course, and the news industry must hold its nerve. The use of private encrypted social media such as WhatsApp for distributing information has almost tripled in four years, which brings a whole set of new headaches. Who monitors these? Who holds them to account? There are other healthy signs with the proportion of those who have paid for online news rising, and those willing to donate on the up too, especially among the young. Media executives can still sound like slightly sad uncles excited about what their teenage nieces are up to when they talk about young people and media consumption. Whatever platform or publishers the young turn to, some things are timeless. As the century and the social media comes of age, the idea that with power comes responsibility should never go out of fashion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/15/modern-office-life-study-work","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"Snacks, slouching, stagnant wages: the office is making us miserable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/15/modern-office-life-study-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/15/modern-office-life-study-work","fields":{"headline":"Snacks, slouching, stagnant wages: the office is making us miserable","bodyText":"A study about US workplaces, released this week, contained some unappetising news: every time you tuck in the cake Janice for HR baked at home, or you help yourself to the buffet on bagel Fridays, you are in fact consuming calories. Hang on a second? Office snacks contain calories? Who would have thought? Thanks, science! This pioneering discovery that food we eat at work is not calorie-free is delivered unto us by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A study of 5,222 employees across the US found that people obtain nearly 1,300 calories per week from foods and beverages they get at the office. Mostly these are empty, unhealthy calories. “To our knowledge, this is the first national study to look at the food people get at work,” said Stephen Onufrak, the study’s lead author in a press release published on Monday. “Our results suggest that the foods people get from work do not align well with the recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.” The CDC analysis, which was presented this week at the American Society for Nutrition’s annual meeting in Boston, found that more than 70% of office calories comes from free food, either provided by their workplace or brought in by other colleagues. It’s not just the free office snacks that are killing us slowly; pretty much everything about modern working life seems designed to send us to an early, anxious grave. Most of us spend large amounts of the day sitting, for example, and studies have found there’s a direct link between the time you spend sitting and early mortality. Even frequent trips to the gym can’t offset all the sitting. Experts say the best thing to do is get up every 30 minutes for a quick movement break. Standing desks have become popular in recent years to combat the scourge of sitting, but some evidence suggests they’re not much better for you. Research in the journal Ergonomics last year advised that “replacing office work sitting with standing should be done with caution”. The study, from Curtin University in Australia, found, shockingly, that prolonged standing is not comfortable. Participants in the study (which, admittedly, had a tiny sample size of 20 people) experienced “lower limb swelling” and reduced reactions times. The treadmill desk has also been linked to lower cognitive performance, although it is somewhat miraculous that anyone is able to use a treadmill desk without being able to think about anything other than how insufferable they are. Not only are we sitting and snacking all day, we’re doing it in the uniquely modern hell that is the open-plan office. A wealth of research suggest open-plan offices increase stress levels, raise your blood pressure and reduce your ability to concentrate on difficult tasks. In 2011, a study conducted by neuroscientist Dr Jack Lewis found that the distractions inherent in open-plan offices can lead to a 32% drop in workers’ wellbeing and reduced productivity by 15%. And open-plan offices aren’t just distracting. They’re sexist. A study published last year in the journal Gender, Work and Organization found that women are more likely to become hyper-aware of how they look in open-plan offices and start to dress differently. In a press release, Dr Alison Hirst of Anglia Ruskin University said: “When changing from a more closed, compartmentalised office space to a new open-plan [office] … office workers were more conscious of their visibility and often found this unsettling rather than liberating. Women in particularly felt anxious about the idea of being constantly watched, and felt they had to dress in a certain way.” Exacerbating all this is the fact that wages have stagnated in America. Since the early 1970s, the hourly inflation-adjusted wages received by the average worker has grown only 0.2% per year. In May, inflation increased to a six-year high, further eroding wage gains. It doesn’t take a business boffin to realize that what would make office-workers truly happy and more productive is fair compensation, greater benefits, and an environment where people can work in peace and go home at a reasonable time. However, management gurus seem inordinately obsessed with free office pizza and open-plan offices where people can bump into each other for out-of-the-box ideation opportunities. As I believe Marie Antoinette, MBA, once said: “If your employee is unhappy, let them eat free office cake.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/16/australia-v-ireland-rugby-union-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T12:21:24Z","webTitle":"Australia 21-26 Ireland: rugby union international – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/16/australia-v-ireland-rugby-union-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/16/australia-v-ireland-rugby-union-international-live","fields":{"headline":"Australia 21-26 Ireland: rugby union international – as it happened","bodyText":"Read the report from Melbourne... That is all, folks. Another fantastic game of rugby between Australia and Ireland, one that had three yellow cards but could arguably have had even more. Ireland improved greatly on last weekend in Brisbane. Joe Schmidt will be delighted with eight changes he made to the team today, most notably in the front row and Johnny Sexton. They were quick to the breakdown, and limited Michael Cooper and David Pocock to scraps. For the Wallabies, Michael Cheika has a lot of thinking to do ahead of next weekend in Sydney. His team failed to keep their discipline following an early yellow card to Marika Korobete, and were plagued with handling errors. I doubt we will be seeing another unchanged team from him for next Saturday. One Test match apiece ahead of the decider in Sydney. Thank you for keeping in touch wherever you were this morning/afternoon/evening. I hope you enjoyed following the game as much as I did. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt on his team leveling the series: “We knuckled down and worked our way into the game. We accumulated points where we didn’t last week. Probably the third quarter was the turning point of the game. We really kept that pressure on. “We really kept them under pressure. Then, we were just hanging on at the end. We’re just going to glue everyone together and see how we shape up for next week.” Wallabies captain Michael Hooper: “We had no ball. We had 25% (possession). It’s tough to win a game like that. Ultimately, not good enough. We got turned over quite easily. The Irish did quite well over the ball.” Tadgh Furlong on the game: “It was tough. It was probably a bit scrappy in the first half. We had a lot of the ball and a lot of territory but didn’t really convert. I definitely felt our handling error and penalty count was lower than last weekend.” Well well well. That sets us up perfectly for a deciding Test in Sydney next weekend. That victory for Ireland was their first test win over Australia in Australia since 16 June, 1979. Exactly 39 years to the day. The men in green also cling onto second spot in the world rankings with that win. All to play for next weekend. The ball is knocked on by the Wallabies and that will be that. Ireland level the series. They made hard work of that towards the end, much harder than it probably should have been. 79 min: The Wallabies have the ball in hand. Passing through the backs and using the full width of the pitch to utilise the extra man. The home faithful inside AAMI Parks are roaring the Wallabies on. I may be made to eat my words here. The numerical advantage has helped the Wallabies and they look threatening for the first time this game. Taniela Tupou is the man who crosses the line for his first test try to set up a pulsating finale. Australia trail by five. 77 min: Folau dances around Ireland defenders for the first time this afternoon and Australia look close to going over. The Wallabies are metres away. 76 min: Jack McGrath is the guilty party. Yellow card for him and Ireland are made to play the final few minutes with 14 men. You have to feel sorry for Ireland though. Australia were previously not punished for similar offences. Deliberate knock-on confirmed. Just waiting to find out who the player was that knocked the ball forward. 77 min: Another knock-on, this time from scrum half Phipps. Hold on though. Paul Williams is going to the TMO to check for a deliberate knock-on. This could be interesting. 76 min: Ireland fans in fine voice again, urging their side to stay resilient in defence in the final moments of this game. 75 min: Fantastic defence from Ireland, who are right up in the faces of the Wallabies. Folau is not being given an inch today. 74 min: This could be that period of sustained pressure. They win a penalty five metres out from the Ireland line. They need to get this line-out spot on. 73 min: It will take something very special from the Wallabies now to claw them back into this game. They have rarely threatened inside the Ireland 22 today and I can’t recall a period of sustained pressure from them. 72 min: They don’t make it count. The ball goes forward between a pass from Latu to Koroibete. So many handling errors from the Wallabies today, I’ve lost count. 71 min: The Wallabies casually walk up the field for a line-out close to the Ireland 22-metre line. They really have to make this count. 69 min: Paul Williams’ patience is beginning to run out with the Wallabies. Foley tries to intercept an Ireland pass on half-way but knocks the ball on. Another penalty. You wouldn’t be surprised to see another Wallabies player sent to the bin soon at this rate. 68 min: Australia have a line-out 10 metres out. Crossing in the line-out. The 14th penalty they have conceded today. Ill-discipline is costing them dear. Straight down the middle of the posts for Sexton. Six from seven from him this afternoon. The Wallabies are letting this game get away from them 65 min: Tadhg Beirne is now on the field for his Ireland debut. The only Scarlets player in the Ireland squad this evening. 64 min: Beale attempts a kick in his own half aimed for Folau to collect. The 29-year-old fails to get anywhere near the ball though. A very quiet showing from Folau today. 62 min: Mix-up in the backs for the Wallabies as a pass from Folau hits replacement Pete Samu. Ireland manage to kick the ball away deep inside the Wallabies’ half. Pocock is on the deck receiving treatment. The Wallabies cannot afford to lose him. 60 min: Into the final quarter now and Australia desperately need points. Foley kicks to touch and they have a chance to build from a line-out. 59 min: The Wallabies go through eight phases and end up on the Ireland 22 metre line. O’ Mahony is there again though to win the penalty for Ireland. Anything Pocock can do, O’ Mahony can do too. Ireland take the ball from the line-out five metres out. Tadhg Furlong collects the ball and extends his arm to touch down his first try for the men in green. Sexton is successful with the conversion - he reaches 700 points for Ireland with that kick. 54 min: NO TRY! Earls is adjudged to have knocked the ball on as he touches it down and not be in control of the ball. Foley, who came across to cover Earls, is penalized for offside and Ireland have a penalty. 54 min: Heroic defence from the Wallabies. Ireland dive over in the corner through Keith Earls. It has gone to the TMO to check touch then grounding. 53 min: Ireland fans are in fine voice inside AAMI Park, hoping to push their team over the line for a decisive second try. Just one metre out.. 52 min: Ireland scrum, five metres out. Huge moment in the game. 50 min: Unbelievable! Keith Earls dashes towards the Australian line but is tackled eight metres out. All they have to do is ship the ball wide to the wing, but Jack McGrath goes himself and is penalised for double movement. 49 mins: Izack Rodda steals the line-out though. What a waste from Ireland. 48 min: And that’s their reward. A penalty. 30 metres out from the posts, Sexton kicks to touch in search of a decisive try. They need to make this line-out count. 46 min: Ireland look to be building just inside of the Australia half before hooker Niall Scannell throws the ball to a Wallaby. Ireland have the ball back though, and are now edging ever closer to the 22 metre line, spreading the ball through the backs’ hands. 45 min: Off the ball tackle by replacement Talu Latu earns Ireland a penalty. Not the first time that has happened today. 44 min: Coleman makes way for Rob Simmons for the Wallabies. Australia slowly building from their own half with a string of kicks to touch. They now find themselves mid-way inside the Ireland half. 43 min: Ireland are metres from the line and you know who wins a penalty for the Wallabies. David Pocock, again, rescues Australia and keeps them within two points of Ireland. 42 min: O’Mahoney offloads to Henshaw who bursts into the Australia 22. They have started the second half how the Wallabies started the first half. Australia 14-16 Ireland Will the second half be as frantic as the first? Ireland dominated possession and territory in the first half, going through the phases inside the Australia half for large parts of the first 40. They have dealt with the threats of Pocock and Cooper at the breakdown much better than last weekend. The yellow card to Koroibete, which at a second glance, may have been worthy of more, rocked Australia. ...And breathe. What a half of rugby that was. Ireland fully capitalised on Marika Koroibete’s early yellow card, with Johnny Sexton kicking 11 points as the Wallabies struggled. Australia managed to regain their cool and force a penalty try to stay in the game. All to play for in the second half. Thrilling first half ends with Australia knocking on the ball inside their own 22. Ireland are not happy, but Paul Williams calls time on the first 40. 38 min: Jordan Larmour collects a wayward pass on the wing and makes some decent metres. Pocock is there again to disrupt the breakdown. It’s what he does best. Australia have a scrum with 30 seconds until the half-time klaxon. 36 min: No one expected that. Tadhg Furlong, the burly Leinster prop, makes an unexpected break from midfield and carries the ball 20 metres to the Australia 22. Australia have a 22m drop-out after all of that. 34 min: Australia fail to get numbers to the ruck and Peter O’Mahony rightfully wins Ireland a penalty. Just as the Wallabies were building... 32 min: Kurtley Beale with a lovely hit on Robbie Henshaw that forces a knock-on. I thought it was lovely , but it’s now going to the TMO for review. 30 min: Crikey. I was ready to type more lines about Sexton’s kicking ability, but he terribly skews the penalty to the left of the posts and Australia can breathe a sigh of relief. For now. 28 min: Another penalty for Ireland. Caleb Timu is a very lucky boy. His late tackle on James Ryan, who is nowhere near the ball, is punished only by a penalty. Even luckier considering he had already been penalized for a deliberate knock-on. 27 min: Big blow for the Wallabies as Will Genia is replaced through injury by Nick Phipps. How much will they miss that experience at scrum half? Five metres, four, three, two, one. Are they over? They are! Paul Williams runs to underneath the posts and awards a penalty try. Just what the Wallabies needed. And there’s more...Cian Healy is sent to the bin after dragging down that rolling maul from the line-out. 25 min: Another Australia line-out, this time closer to the Ireland line... 24 min: Ireland building phases after a long kick from the right flank almost pays off. Australia earn a penalty though, and now have a chance to attack from a line-out in the Ireland half. A rare chance for the Wallabies this half. Points number 10 and 11 for Sexton. Ireland now lead 16-7. 21 min: Great defence from Pocock as the Wallabies defence holds firm. Or not...Caleb Timu puts a hand out and is blown up for a deliberate knock on. Referee Paul Williams bizarrely opts not to play advantage, despite Ireland having numbers on the right wing. Another chance for three points for that man Sexton. 19 min: Haylett-Petty takes a terrific catch, but referee Paul Williams calls play back for a penalty against David Pocock. Ireland kick to touch and have a line-out 10 metres inside the Australia half. Sexton penalty sails over as Ireland extend their lead to six points. Koroibete returns to the field and Australia can now breathe a sigh of relief that the 10 minutes with 14 men is over. 16 min: Goodness me. What a mad two minutes. Following that kick charge-down, Folau somehow intercepts a lazy Ireland pass, but is caught inside his half. Michael Hooper is penalized for not rolling away and Ireland have another penalty. They opt for goal. 14 min: Australia are in panic mode. Kurtley Beale has a kick charged down just 30 metres from his own line. The Wallabies somehow clear the ball to touch, but are desperately lacking experience to weather this storm with 14 men. Easy as you like for Sexton, who, on his 75th cap for his nation, comfortably slots the penalty to hand Ireland a three-point lead. Australia 7-10 Ireland 12 min: Ireland win the penalty from a scrum. Joe Schmidt will be delighted with how his new front row have performed so far. Sexton will go for points in front of the post here. 10 min: The Wallabies are rattled. They knock on the ball on their own 22 and Ireland have a scrum. AAMI Park is alive with the sound of Irish fans. STAT CLAXON That Ireland try was their first against Australia on Australian soil since 2008. That’s how Ireland will respond! Ireland control the maul following a line-out on the 22. Munster scrum half Connor Murray is patient with the ball in hand, and waits until the point of contact to throw the ball wide to Andrew Conway, who dives over in the corner. Sexton nails the conversion. 7-7. What a game. An early scrap following a dangerous tackle from Marika Koroibete on Rob Kearney. TMO Ben Skreen checks and the verdict from Paul Williams is 10 minutes in the bin for the 25-year-old. 6 min: Ireland building nicely after an even scrum. They are going through the phases and edging ever closer to the Wallabies’ 22. 4 min: How will Ireland respond? Can they react? They have the first scrum of the game just inside the Australian half. Stunning start for the Wallabies! Kurtley Beale runs a brilliant line at a full pace after collecting a pass from Bernard Foley. He dives under the posts to open the scoring after just 90 seconds! Conversion is good and Australia lead 7-0 after two minutes. 2 min: Ireland make a mess of the catch from the kick-off and Australia have a line-out. They build from the line-out and are playing through the backs on the edge of the Ireland 22. Here we go! Following an interesting rendition of Ireland’s Call, Michael McCormick leads the Australia national anthem with the support of Power House Rugby Club. I’d say Australia just about edged the anthems contest. Sorry Ireland, good effort. And the Wallabies... Accompanied by a young mascot each (which was a task in itself to co-ordinate 23 children with 23 adults), Australia take to the field in search of successive wins against Ireland. Here come the anthems... Here come Ireland... What a reception for the reigning Six Nations champions in Melbourne. One final group huddle before the players emerge from their dressing rooms. Just a matter of minutes until we hear the anthems. On that note, with a large Irish contingent inside AAMI Park, the Ireland national anthem could even be louder than the hosts’ Advance Australia Fair this evening. Don’t forget to have your say on the game. You can tweet me at @OliverTrenchard, just like John has done below. Let’s hope it’s a cracker, John! Wallabies win the first battle. A patch of rain in Melbourne this afternoon that could make for an intriguing game. Don’t be surprised to see a few testing box kicks from Johnny Sexton early on. Meanwhile, Wallabies coach Michael Cheika has kept faith in the same 23 players that secured victory in the first test. It is the first time in four years that Cheika has named the same team for two consecutive tests. Good. That was much easier than the Ireland team news. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt has rung the changes, making a total of eight alterations from last weekend in Brisbane. After a scrum penalty altered the course of the game in the Wallabies’ favour last weekend, Schmidt changes the whole of the front row, bringing in Niall Scannell, who is supported by Leinster props Cian Healy and Tadhg Furlong. Devin Toner and Dan Leavy come into the side at lock and openside flanker respectively. In the backs, Johnny Sexton starts from no.10 from the first whistle, while there are also starts for Garry Ringrose and Andrew Conway. While we wait for the All Blacks to see out the final 10 minutes of their game against France, let’s take a look at how the two teams line up in Melbourne this evening. Today is one of those jam-packed days of Test rugby that barely allows you a moment to catch your breath. Snacks at the ready, because Australia v Ireland is the hearty filling in a Test rugby sandwich between New Zealand v France and South Africa v England. Please do get in touch on email or via Twitter @OliverTrenchard with your thoughts on the game, predictions and any stand-out stats from the match. Here’s one to start you off: Ireland last scored a try on Australian soil 10 years ago, when Ronan O’ Gara notched a memorable try. Ireland have since played two tests in Australia and failed to cross the whitewash on each occasion. Incidentally, that game in 2008 was the last time Australia v Ireland was played in Melbourne… Think you can do better than that? Get in touch! Rugby time in Melbourne. The city that is dominated by Aussie rules today plays hosts to the larger, oval-shaped sport and the crucial second Test between Australia and Ireland. Following the Wallabies’ 18-9 victory in Brisbane last weekend, Ireland are staring down the barrel of two consecutive defeats for the first time since 2016 (v South Africa) and will be keen to ensure that the third Test in Sydney next Saturday is not a dead rubber. There is more than just the series at stake though. Oh yes. A win for Australia could see them leapfrog Ireland in the world rankings, moving into second spot behind the All Blacks. It would also be the first time they have done the double over Ireland in a Test series since June 1999. A large Ireland contingent is expected inside AAMI Park and predicted to even make up half of the total crowd in Melbourne. So you can forget about home advantage…"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/15/australian-university-students-dress-as-ku-klux-klan-and-in-blackface","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T02:48:01Z","webTitle":"Australian university students dress as Ku Klux Klan and in blackface","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/australian-university-students-dress-as-ku-klux-klan-and-in-blackface","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/15/australian-university-students-dress-as-ku-klux-klan-and-in-blackface","fields":{"headline":"Australian university students dress as Ku Klux Klan and in blackface","bodyText":"Five Australian university students who dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan and one who dressed in blackface as a “cotton-picking” slave for a “politically incorrect” themed party will be investigated after the vice-chancellor condemned their actions.

It showed five men in homemade Ku Klux Klan hoods and robes and one man in blackface and body paint, pretending to be a slave. A public description on Facebook billed the event as a two-day end-of-semester party with a “politically incorrect” opening night. “As exams have just commenced we are already looking forward to the end of term and thus, the idea of the muddy duck ‘two dayer’ has been born,” it said. “Thursday night [is a] ‘politically incorrect’ themed session kicking off at 7.30pm.

For many years, Delaney-Thiele was the director of NSW/ACT services at Ozchild, one of the state’s biggest out-of-home-care (OOHC) providers. But when the Department of Family and Community Services (Facs) moved – “before we could even blink” – to take two young relatives into care, it took every ounce of her patience and skill to negotiate their return. “At the time when they were removed, they were shuffled between four or five different carers in the space of about six weeks,” she said. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “It’s horrific. Horrific, even though we worked the system to our advantage to get the kids back. I feel for the families that don’t have that knowledge of how to navigate the system.” It took her six weeks. Today, Delaney-Thiele is an associate professor at UNSW, holds a masters in public health, and is the chief executive of the Bullinah Aboriginal health corporation on the NSW north coast. “At the time, I was critical of Facs because they gave families no options, they were just moving them into out-of-home-care at great rates.” Facs’ record of removing Aboriginal children into OOHC came under under intense scrutiny this week with the release of the long-withheld Tune report, a scathing assessment of what former senior public servant David Tune described as a crisis-driven, inefficient and unsustainable system. The report was delivered in 2016 but the NSW government refused to release it until this week. It was one of three documents the opposition and minor parties have repeatedly fought to make public, pushing the Berejiklian government to the edge of a constitutional crisis. On ABC radio on Thursday morning, the minister for family and community services, Pru Goward, said the government “probably should have” released the Tune report into child protection earlier. It was commissioned by the cabinet, so the government was following the “time-honoured Westminster tradition” of respecting cabinet confidentiality, she said. “But the really good news is now that it’s out there, you can see we have implemented Tune’s recommendations and we are doing better than he predicted we would do if we followed his recommendations.” Guardian Australia has seen government estimates for 2017-18. Based on partial year data extracted on 5 June, 886 fewer children were taken into care compared with last year. But Aboriginal children are a higher percentage of the intake. For this year, 38.4% of children taken into care were Aboriginal, and for the previous year the figure stood at 36.3%. Facs has invested $90.5m over four years in two early intervention programs to help families before they reach breaking point. The programs, developed by the New York Foundling society which is involved in rolling them out in NSW, have helped reduce the number of children in out-of-home-care in New York and, according to Delaney-Thiele, the signs are that they are working here too. “Had they been available back when we were going through it, had we been given the option to do something like this, we would’ve jumped at it,” she said. “We basically had no options whatsoever. It’s important that Facs case workers get a handle on these models as an intervention, before they remove children.” From August 2017 to February 2018, six teams have been working on family therapy programs in Newcastle, western and south-western Sydney, supporting about 150 children and their families, 50 of whom are Aboriginal. In that time, Delaney-Thiele says, not one child has been removed. “I think Facs has gone out on a limb, they’ve got funding from cabinet, and if they can’t actually show there’s been some outcomes for families, they won’t get another stab at it. Regardless of what’s happened in the past, here we are now, at a point in time where we can actually make a difference with these models.” Even so, Delaney-Thiele would like to see the government transfer responsibility for these programs to the Aboriginal health sector, because “they’re clinical health interventions”. Aboriginal medical services already work in communities, she said. They keep comprehensive records of families and their needs, and they offer a range of clinical support services. Most importantly, they are Aboriginal-led. Self-determination is at the heart of changes Aboriginal peak organisations want to make to the child protection system. The Aboriginal Child, Family and Community Care State Secretariat (AbSec) told Guardian Australia it wanted NSW to appoint an Aboriginal child and family commissioner. Its chief executive, Tim Ireland, said a commissioner could direct investment in child and family support services, set up a statewide data system to measure needs and effects, and provide early intervention programs for Aboriginal families. “We’re not suggesting an Aboriginal child and families commissioner would take over the role of Facs,” he said. “What we’re saying is a commission system would work with communities, be Aboriginal led and Aboriginal designed, to offer the kind of support families need across the whole continuum, from early intervention through to foster care. “It is not fair that we should have such little say in a system which so heavily affects our people.” More than 7% of Aboriginal children are in out-of-home care, compared with 1% of all children and young people in NSW. “We see the commissioner as playing a key role in monitoring the statutory functions of Facs, and having oversight of our own data, to make informed decisions. “To us it’s about support, services and accountability, not duplicating a mainstream approach, but realising self-determination for our communities.” But this week, Goward rejected those calls. “We’re not creating a separate system for Aboriginal children. This is core business for us,” she said. “This is Australia and we are all in this together. This is core for all of us. It needs to remain in the mainstream, as part of mainstream responsibility.” Ireland said it was baffling to be rejected “out of hand”. The call for self-determination is also happening in other states and territories. Victoria appointed its first Aboriginal children’s commissioner in 2013. Nationally, Aboriginal chid care organisations said they wanted to see a Closing the Gap target for reducing the number of Aboriginal children being removed from their families and communities. In New Zealand and Canada, similar conversations are being had. Governments in both countries are exploring ways to transfer authority for the design and delivery of programs for Indigenous children and families to Indigenous communities and organisations. Last week, the Métis Nation and the province of British Columbia signed an agreement to “significantly reduce the number of Métis children and youth in government care”, leading to the eventual legislative transfer of authority to the Metis nation. This week in NSW, with attention on a malfunctioning child protection system, there’s a chance to look at alternatives, Ireland told Guardian Australia. “I think there is an opportunity to have a public conversation about it and really ask the question, why not?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/15/lewisham-east-byelection-janet-daby-wins-but-labours-majority-cut-by-lib-dems","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T04:44:16Z","webTitle":"Lewisham East byelection winner to oppose 'extreme Brexit'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/15/lewisham-east-byelection-janet-daby-wins-but-labours-majority-cut-by-lib-dems","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/15/lewisham-east-byelection-janet-daby-wins-but-labours-majority-cut-by-lib-dems","fields":{"headline":"Lewisham East byelection winner to oppose 'extreme Brexit'","bodyText":"Labour’s Janet Daby has won the Lewisham East byelection and immediately promised to oppose a hard Brexit, after the party’s margin of victory was cut by a resurgent Liberal Democrats in the heavily pro-remain seat.

The former Lewisham councillor said the result showed “we will not tolerate an extreme Brexit in Lewisham East”. “I will oppose an extreme or a hard Brexit,” she said. “I will consider people’s jobs, the economy and people’s rights, and that will dictate to me the precedent in how I will conduct myself both within parliament and out of parliament.” The Labour share of the vote fell by almost 18 percentage points from the 2017 election, and, with a much-reduced turnout from last year, Daby secured a majority of 5,629, compared with the 21,213 seen by Alexander. The Lib Dems claimed the swing was the biggest against Labour in a seat since 2004, and the most significant since 1983 when Labour was in opposition. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, who campaigned in the constituency a number of times, said Salek had “fought a proud, pro-European campaign”. “This result sends a message to the Labour leadership that it cannot take pro-European voters for granted. “This is the largest swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats in over a decade and the failure of Labour’s leadership to oppose the Conservatives’ hard Brexit cannot be hidden or forgotten.” Salek said the result showed the party was “the real opposition here. We’re back and people are starting to notice. This is about recognising that the people have a final say on Brexit.” During her campaign, Daby had pledged to seek continued UK membership of the single market and customs union after Brexit, a notably softer proposal than that sought by the Labour leadership. On Wednesday, Jeremy Corbyn faced the biggest parliamentary revolt since he became leader, as 75 backbenchers defied party instructions to abstain and voted for an amendment for the UK to remain in the European Economic Area. Asked how much distance there was between her and Corbyn’s views on Brexit, Daby said: “In terms of the single market, our Labour view on this is that we would have a new single market where we have the same access that we presently do. “For me, it’s about ensuring that we have as close a relationship to the EU as possible and that’s what I’ll be arguing for and that’s what I’ll be putting forward my views on. “In terms of Jeremy Corbyn, I voted for Jeremy Corbyn twice in the leadership election and obviously within politics not everybody will agree on everything.” The Greens came fourth in the byelection, followed by the Women’s Equality Party. Ukip, which campaigned hard on a programme highlighting crime rates, won 380 votes. The former Ukip leadership runner-up Anne-Marie Waters, who quit to establish the anti-Islam party For Britain, took 266 votes, narrowly beating the Christian People’s Alliance and the Monster Raving Loony party.

I was going through a rough time in my life and didn’t care about myself. I’d been homeless since my parents told me to leave our family house in June 2016 and was so miserable in my situation. Everywhere I go people shun me and tell me to leave. Then, last March, I was walking around downtown Seattle with my boyfriend when we saw a group of guys with two dogs. They were yelling at one of them and she was shivering and obviously scared. I went into a store and when I came out my boyfriend had the dog. I was confused. He said to me: “I made a life choice without you; we’re keeping the dog.” He’d paid the guys $5 for her. It was an eye-opening moment for me to look at her properly. She raised her head with a look that said: “Please don’t hurt me.” She had protruding ribs, fleas, missing patches of fur and couldn’t walk properly. I wrapped her in my jacket like a little baby and promised I’d never let anybody hurt her again. And that’s my promise to her for the rest of her life. We named her Poppy after a poppy seed muffin she was trying to eat off the sidewalk. We moved from sleeping in a doorway to a tent. I stopped stealing food from stores when we were desperate; I didn’t want to go to jail for something dumb and risk losing her. I’ve applied for food stamps and now have a case manager helping me get on a housing list and get Poppy registered as a service animal so that we’re protected from being split up [by the Federal Housing Act]. People comment about how I shouldn’t be on the street with a dog. But they probably have a misconception that she’s not being taken care of. Twice a month the Union Gospel Mission does free pet care. I feed her at specific times with foods that the vet has told me will keep her healthy. I get money for her food from panhandling. She’s literally with me 24–7. She wakes up so excited every morning and gets so happy about the littlest thing, like rolling around in the grass or even just the weather being nice. Seeing her like that reminds me to stay happy for simple things too. In my mind she’s a little angel that saved me as much as I saved her. Kate Fraser Daley, 39, Portland, Oregon When my family became homeless last June, some of the time we had Tenny, our four-year old chihuahua-terrier mix, with us, and some of the time he was with friends of the family. But he was so sad when we were apart. There were times when he wouldn’t eat and just wanted to sleep. His happy-go-lucky self wasn’t there. We’d been in the same apartment for 10 years so the change was really hard on everyone. We decided to send our two cats, Snowflake and Mittens, to another friend’s house. Within the first week, Snowflake got out and ran away. My husband was absolutely heartbroken. A year on and just mentioning her name is still very emotional for him. Mittens passed away when our friends moved. When we moved into a shelter, Tenny became extremely protective of all of us. Being part of a mobile family unit is difficult for a dog, because everywhere becomes their territory to protect and there’s no actual home. We’re in a 25-family shelter at the moment. All the families sleep on bunks in one large room and we can only be there from 6pm to 8am. But Tenny is never satisfied with our surroundings. His barking has become incessant and he’s being snippety. I don’t think he’s going to calm down until we get back into an apartment. Then he won’t have to be running all over town trying to freakishly protect his family from the world, which is not the job of a dog. I know it’s unfair on him. We try to give him all the love we can and help him work through it. My husband and I actually talked about whether we are going to have to take him back to the pound. We can’t afford a lawsuit and we don’t want to risk him being put down if he bites somebody. But I said to my husband: “We don’t give up on our family.” We’re working on getting into an apartment and will see how he calms down when he has his own space to protect again. Richard Dyer, 52, Seattle My two ferrets are called Ricky and Tiny. I’ve had Ricky for five years. I rescued him when I saw somebody walking him on the street and yanking him around on a chain. And I’ve had Tiny for almost three years and rescued him after someone threw him out in the woods. They were both skittish at first because of the way they had been treated, but now they’re leash- and litter box-trained. I had wanted ferrets as pets since I was a kid. I grew up in Fort Payne, Alabama, and we had them on our land, but they were so fast you could never catch them. I’ve been homeless a little over a year; it’s not the first time, but it’s the first time in a long time. My wife and I were living in an apartment and the rent went up by $150. We couldn’t afford it and didn’t have any place to go so we had no option. Right now we’re staying in a tent. I come downtown when the ferrets are out of food. Most shelters don’t allow animals. But I wouldn’t subject my family to one anyway – they are full of drugs and disease and lice. We’re in a sanctioned camp that’s supported by several agencies and we have electricity. We pay $60 a month to be there and our neighbors at the camp love the ferrets. A while ago I was diagnosed with bipolar [disorder] and was suicidal. But since having these ferrets, I haven’t had any suicidal tendencies. They ease my stress. They come up to me every time I call and Tiny is always on my heels, he never lets me out of his sight. My favorite thing about them is how they play with each other. They can’t be apart from each other; their bond is magnificent. Ryan Mikesell, 37, Hillsboro, Oregon When I’m feeling overwhelmed by anxiety, my mini Labradoodle, Josie, climbs on my chest to calm me down. She won’t take no for an answer. She’ll be like, “Go ahead, tell me to get off. I don’t care.” I have PTSD and her doing that is a grounding mechanism for me. I feel things and she just senses it. She’s like my soulmate in dog form. My therapist loves her. My animals are my family. The oldest is Jamie, a Jack Russell-chihuahua I got eleven years ago when I was living in a house with my ex-partner. Jamie has had two litters and I’ve kept three of her puppies. In total, I have five dogs and my cat, Buddy, who I found abandoned in an alley nine years ago. I’ve been homeless for eight years. I grew up in Olympia, Washington, but my parents were very abusive and I didn’t want to be anywhere near them, so I left for Oregon. I have agoraphobia and severe anxiety. I also have diabetes and need to have a refrigerator so I can keep eating healthily. I live in a motorhome that I have nowhere to permanently park. It used to be that as long as you regularly moved your vehicle, you could park in lots of places. But since the new mayor of Portland came into office, you can get a ticket and be towed in 20 minutes. I put a call out on Facebook saying I needed somewhere to park for six months and a woman offered me her driveway, which is where I am now. The responsibility of caring for my pets keeps me alive sometimes. Jamie gave birth to her second litter in the motorhome. Feeding them made her sick and I had to take over with a bottle. It took me an hour to feed all five puppies, and I had to do it every other hour throughout the day and night. It was crazy exhausting and lasted a couple of months. My friends tried to help but the puppies wouldn’t eat for anyone else but me. I think they were imprinted because I was at the birth. We all sleep on my bed together. They each have their place and like to take turns on the pillow next to me. Jamie always has preference because she’s the boss; everyone respects her. They’ve each got such different personalities. Josie is definitely the icebreaker when we meet new people. I spend so much time with them I’ve learned a lot of their mannerisms. I can kind of tell what they’re thinking and I often get my friends laughing by pretending to do their voices. I have a healthcare financing credit card for emergency veterinary bills. It’s paid off right now and I freak out at the thought of another bill. But my dogs are my responsibility and there’s no way I would get rid of any one of them.

Whether it’s the faux outrage over the television host Samantha Bee calling Ivanka Trump a “cunt” or the yammering over Robert DeNiro’s “fuck Trump” battle cry at the Tony awards, I’m tired of those on the right feigning shock. After all, they voted in the most brash, offensive and foul-mouthed president in history. Are we really to believe that the same people who voted for a man who suggested a woman was too ugly to sexually assault now care about a naughty word for female genitalia? The same people who defended a man who said he grabbed women “by the pussy”? Are Americans really supposed to keep quiet and polite as Republicans implement policies that literally rip nursing infants from their mothers’ breasts and are building tented internment camps for children? But sure, it’s our curses that are the problem. Those on the left, too, are warning that our anger will drive more people to Trump. Frank Bruni wrote this week: “When you answer name-calling with name-calling and tantrums with tantrums, you’re not resisting him. You’re mirroring him. You’re not diminishing him. You’re demeaning yourselves. “Many voters don’t hear your arguments or the facts, which are on your side. They just wince at the din,” he says. But here’s the thing – the people who are standing by Trump right now are not people who are interested in arguments or facts. They’re supporting a man who lies with every other breath, a man who calls the press the “greatest enemy” of our country while he lauds an authoritarian dictator and shrugs off his human rights abuses. Someone who looked at a march of white supremacists where one woman was killed and said there were “very fine people on both sides”. Who called countries inhabited mostly by people of color “shitholes”. This is a president who deserves a bit of profanity. Expecting those of us who are scared and angry over what our country is becoming to speak with civility is absurd – civility died the day Trump took office. It’s like telling a woman to smile as she’s being sexually harassed on the street: we’re not just supposed to put up with injustice, we’re meant to be cheerful through it, as well. If you’re not angry enough to curse, to scream or name-call, then you’re not paying nearly enough attention. As the New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino tweeted in 2017: “Never forget to be extremely wary of every person in your life who has not experienced this last year as a personal moral emergency.” Meeting extreme injustices with polite banter plays right into the hands of this administration, because it paints their outrageous actions as just being on one side of a well-meaning debate. They’re not. This is not about disagreement, or political discourse. This is about fighting for what’s right over what is clearly and demonstrably evil. Being spittlingly angry will not drive more people to Trump and will not diminish us – the high road is about morals, not a few curse words."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/13/the-ciambra-review-rush-of-storytelling-and-style","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T15:00:21Z","webTitle":"The Ciambra review – rush of storytelling and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/13/the-ciambra-review-rush-of-storytelling-and-style","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/13/the-ciambra-review-rush-of-storytelling-and-style","fields":{"headline":"The Ciambra review – rush of storytelling and style","bodyText":"Jonas Carpignano struck gold with the non-professional cast of his new movie, set among the Roma gypsy community in Calabria – and especially with his terrific teenage lead, Pio Amato. It has been called a resurgence of neorealism with echoes of De Sica and Visconti; Martin Scorsese is executive producer, and you can see his influence in the vibrancy of the family meal scenes. But maybe it’s more an inspired naturalism or instinctualism. There is something euphoric, but also sad, about watching an unschooled performer dominate through some mysterious and serendipitous rightness in the matching of face, performer and material. Will he ever be as good again – that’s if he wants to be an actor? Will life itself ever seem as real to him as this? (Carpignano developed the movie from his earlier short of the same name and his debut feature, Mediterranea, from 2015.) Amato plays a smart, scrappy teenager in a sprawling clan from Ciambra – essentially playing themselves and individually introduced in the film’s amazing funeral scene – in Calabria’s Gioia Tauro province. They are up to various thieving exploits, which involve an open-ended turf war with the “Italians” or ′Ndràngheta mobsters. The police are always showing up, as well as power-company officials following the family’s crude attempt to bash the electricity meter. When Pio’s father and big brother are taken to prison, Pio experiences a glorious freedom and a chance to prove himself as man, breadwinner and, of course, professional thief. He pinches cars (including, in one outrageous sequence, a Carabinieri police car) and luggage from trains. He fences stuff through the “Africans” – the tented migrant community from Burkina Faso and Ghana – and Pio has a poignant friendship with Ayiva (Koudous Seihon). This connection is tested in a crisis of loyalty, and my minor quibble is that its aftermath is perhaps not shown as clearly as it might be. But what a rush of storytelling energy and style."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/13/grenfell-tower-24-hour-vigil-to-mark-anniversary-of-tragedy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T12:06:06Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower memorial events mark one year after fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/grenfell-tower-24-hour-vigil-to-mark-anniversary-of-tragedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/grenfell-tower-24-hour-vigil-to-mark-anniversary-of-tragedy","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower memorial events mark one year after fire","bodyText":"It was a day of green: scarves, ribbons, lapel badges, balloons, T-shirts, head wraps, all in the vibrant colour now identified with the devastating fire a year ago at Grenfell Tower. At the foot of the now shrouded high-rise block, a crowd of survivors, bereaved relatives, members of the local community and representatives of the emergency services fell silent for 72 seconds, one for each person killed in the blaze. Many stood with their eyes closed or heads bowed during the silence. Some held a single white rose. They were joined in their mark of respect by the Queen, Prince Philip and the Duchess of Sussex in Chester; Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall on a visit to Ireland; MPs in Westminster; the England squad training in Russia; the headquarters of the London fire brigade; and the congregation at a memorial service at St Helen’s church in North Kensington. At the tower, the Soul Sanctuary gospel choir sang Lean on Me before the silence and Bridge of Troubled Water afterwards. The names of those who died were read out, punctuated with the words “forever in our hearts” and the sound of someone sobbing. Grieving relatives took turns to write tributes on the perimeter fence in marker pen. Among those watching were the singer Adele and the rapper Stormzy. At St Helen’s, candles were lit and prayers were said. Graham Tomlin, the bishop of Kensington, told the congregation that the anniversary was a day of “painful memories, a day we remember those 72 precious lives lost”. It was also “a day for justice, as we pledge ourselves again to the slow, patient search for truth and justice for those who lost their lives, and a day for peace,” he said. Grenfell Tower was “a symbol of pain and loss and a symbol of our failure to care for one another” but it could also become “a symbol of change and renewal”. After the service, 73 doves were released from wicker baskets outside the church, one for each life lost plus one to represent fears that there may have been other people who died and who have not been identified. Among those present were the Labour MPs Emma Dent-Coad and David Lammy. The congregation then walked in silence to the base of the tower to lay wreaths, light candles and say prayers. Earlier, shortly before 1am – the time the fire service received the first emergency call – a procession reached the tower, now topped with banners bearing green hearts and the words “Grenfell: forever in our hearts”. The names of those who died were said by their relatives and friends, accompanied by a drum beat, and pictures were pinned to a “wall of truth” – a section of the fencing around the tower featuring messages and candles. At 1am, Grenfell and a dozen other tower blocks in the area, as well as 10 Downing Street, were illuminated in green. At the nearby St Clement’s church, the Lord’s prayer was said every hour – the only words punctuating a 24-hour silent vigil that will end at 6pm with another service led by Tomlin. The vigil was one of a number of commemorations, which include church services and special prayers of remembrance at al-Manaar mosque. A silent walk – the latest of a series held on the 14th of each month since the fire – will begin at 6pm near the tower and end at Kensington memorial park. Father Alan Everett, the vicar of St Clement’s, said the local community had been “dreading this week. The anniversary has stirred things up for many people. None of us quite know how we’ll feel. There’s been some discussion about re-traumatisation.” He added: “Almost everybody will be massively relieved when it’s over. Most people just want to get through this week. A background of distress and fear has been building.” Everett was woken on the night of the fire and went straight to his church. After switching on the lights and opening the doors, people from Grenfell Tower and the surrounding blocks arrived seeking shelter and solace. On Sunday, St Clement’s dedicated a garden of remembrance on the north wall of the church, facing the tower. The following day, the prime minister, Theresa May – who said this week that her response was inadequate in the hours and days after the fire – came to lay a wreath of white roses with a card saying: “In memory of all those who lost their lives at Grenfell Tower. They will never be forgotten.” Everett said he hoped the garden and church could be a place of peace and sanctuary. “It’s been very positive to turn a really grotty space into something rather beautiful for the community.” Schoolchildren across the country have been asked to wear “green for Grenfell” on Friday to mark the anniversary and to raise funds for local charities. Schools are being asked to share their activities and photos on social media, using the hashtag #GreenForGrenfellDay. Sandra Ruiz, whose 12-year-old niece, Jessica Urbano Ramirez, died in the fire, said: “Green for Grenfell Day is an opportunity to celebrate community spirit up and down the country. In the days after the fire a community of volunteers surrounded us and helped us through the most difficult of times. “If there is to be a positive legacy from this tragedy, we hope it is that we celebrate and emulate here in North Kensington and across the country the community spirit that we saw in the days, weeks and months after the fire.” The inquiry into the fire, which began hearing evidence this month, has paused for this week to allow core participants and others to take part in commemorative events."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/13/high-court-asked-to-block-sa-royal-commission-from-calling-witnesses","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T07:01:16Z","webTitle":"High court asked to block SA royal commission from calling witnesses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/13/high-court-asked-to-block-sa-royal-commission-from-calling-witnesses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/13/high-court-asked-to-block-sa-royal-commission-from-calling-witnesses","fields":{"headline":"High court asked to block SA royal commission from calling witnesses","bodyText":"In a major test of states’ powers to hold royal commissions that touch on federal issues, the commonwealth government and the Murray Darling Basin Authority have sought an injunction to prevent their staff giving evidence to the South Australian royal commission into the Murray Darling. The high court has been asked to rule on whether a state royal commission can compel testimony and documents from the commonwealth. The commonwealth and the authority filed documents in the high court on Tuesday seeking an injunction to prevent the SA commissioner, Bret Walker SC, from taking action on the summonses issued to current and former federal staff. Staff and former staff at authority and the agriculture department have been directed not to respond to the summonses and not to hand over documents. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The plaintiffs are also seeking declarations that the SA royal commission does not have authority to require answers, or demand the production of documents by federal employees. The high court summons names the secretary of the agriculture department, the the chief executive of the authority, Phillip Glyde, and two senior staff who have received summonses, but seeks an order relating to all former and current staff. The move will further inflame tensions between the states and the federal government over the Murray Darling Basin plan. It will also be an important precedent on the limit of the states’ powers to investigate issues in an era where important policy matters are often the subject of cooperative regulation between the states and commonwealth. In the case of the basin plan, the commonwealth took on the role of overall policy coordination and information collecting, while states retained the power to enforce local water plans and administer water licences. But states largely depend on the commonwealth to know how the overall plan is working. For example, the information about environmental water purchases and how it is used to help the river system is held by the commonwealth. The SA royal commission is trying to investigate aspects of the Murray Darling Basin plan, including whether environmental outcomes are being realised, particularly those that directly affect SA at the end of the river system. Counsel assisting the SA inquiry, Richard Beasley SC, said the South Australian government intended to appear to argue the matter, with Walker taking a secondary role. “Until there is a decision the commissioner is not going to enforce the summonses,” he said. “But they are not withdrawn.” The royal commission is due to hold its first hearings on Monday. South Australia and the commissioner have 14 days to file a defence. As yet there is no hearing date. A spokesman for the MDBA said: “The commonwealth and MDBA’s view is that the royal commission cannot compel the commonwealth or the MDBA to provide documents or give evidence.” “The decision to commence these proceedings is not about water resources, the content of the Water Act 2007 or the content and implementation of the basin plan. There are broader matters at play here. It is not appropriate to comment further at this time,” the spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/13/avocado-prices-new-zealand-record","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T02:57:00Z","webTitle":"Records smashed as avocado prices in New Zealand hit all-time high","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/13/avocado-prices-new-zealand-record","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/13/avocado-prices-new-zealand-record","fields":{"headline":"Records smashed as avocado prices in New Zealand hit all-time high","bodyText":"New Zealand avocado lovers can expect to fork out a little more for their favourite brunch as the price of the fruit hit record highs last month. The average price for a 200g avocado reached NZ$5.06 last month, the highest price for avocados in the country since records began, up 37% from $3.69 in April 2018 and up 50% from $3.38 in May 2017. “Seasonality impacts avocado prices,” prices manager Matthew Haigh said. “Typically, avocado prices peak in July and August, as the main harvest season is from August to March.” According to the New Zealand Avocado Growers Association, harvest volumes in the year to June 2018 were down to about half the previous season’s yield. Statistics New Zealand said the low yield affected the average retail prices of avocados. Prices for Australian avocados have remained stable. A shortage of the fruit over the new year meant customers were forced to pay up to $9 for a single avocado. However, according to Avocados Australia, the average supermarket retail price has now plateaued at between $2 - $2.50. Australia’s avocado industry recently had one of its biggest seasons ever, but the country still imports much of its avocado stock from New Zealand. It is not clear how the disappointing season might affect prices over the water. Statistics New Zealand said that the price of other fruit and vegetables, such as mandarins and broccoli, had dropped in the last month. The price of mandarins was down 35%, kiwifruit down 39% and broccoli down a nutritious 43%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/14/why-optus-stadium-is-the-right-fit-for-nicky-winmar-statue","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T18:00:25Z","webTitle":"Why Optus Stadium is the right fit for Nicky Winmar statue | Sean Gorman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/14/why-optus-stadium-is-the-right-fit-for-nicky-winmar-statue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/14/why-optus-stadium-is-the-right-fit-for-nicky-winmar-statue","fields":{"headline":"Why Optus Stadium is the right fit for Nicky Winmar statue","bodyText":"There are rumblings in the West.

Townsend does concede that Winmar’s famous stance – struck in the round four game against Collingwood in 1993, and soon to be immortalised in bronze – “underlines the power of an individual to prompt change, recognises the vast Aboriginal impact in football and is a reminder of the need for action rather than rhetoric in the quest for genuine reconciliation”. Yet despite the power of the moment captured by photographer Wayne Ludbey, who intuitively hung around to capture what became arguably the most famous football photo in history, the suggestion is that Winmar’s statue needs to be placed at Moorabbin – the home of St Kilda, the side he played for. This, I feel, is also flawed. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day In terms of the picture itself, which is forensically dissected in the book by Matthew Klugman and Gary Osmond, Black and Proud: The Story of an Iconic AFL Photo, the reason why we still talk about what Winmar did that day is because it cannot be easily defined or simply explained. It is a confluence of race, racism, colonisation, sport, identity and pain. For me the picture is a delicately poignant moment and a statement of significant power. Many things have been written about what Winmar was actually trying to say that day – I’m a proud Aboriginal man, I have guts and so on – but this only touches on things. It is deeper than that. I think it is two things that are speaking powerfully but simultaneously. For me it can be read as Winmar’s most private public moment or his most public private moment. Either way the action is historic and one which will be remembered as thrilling, brave and significant. What he is actually saying in a dignified and sophisticated way is: “White Australia, you cannot ignore me anymore.” Townsend goes on to say that the more deserving footballers, also Noongars like Winmar, are Graham Farmer and Barry Cable. This is a good argument as both Farmer and Cable’s records are stellar, and they are champions by any measure. This is hard to argue with given the importance we in Australia put on sporting records, namely longevity and on-field success. But the reason why Winmar’s stance is so powerful is simple: it has transcended the sport and the moment it was taken in. We are still talking about it today and in many respects it has nothing to do with football, St Kilda or Collingwood supporters. Just as this year’s Sir Doug Nicholls round was generously given over to the legacy of Farmer, Winmar’s story will be told at some point during the prestigious themed round. The statue then is the latest iteration in the ongoing discussion that Winmar carried on from those other players. It is the legacy that is told via sport, in this instance AFL football, that helps us understand who we are. Where we have come from. Where we need to go. Yet this resistance to the statue being placed at Optus Stadium is in direct opposition to Winmar’s original message. White Australia continues to ignore Indigenous Australians. What needs to be understood is the deep connection to country that Aboriginal identity has. Country is identity. The culture of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians is deeply rooted in the land and sea. It is why the stolen generations for many blackfellas still sting like blazes, and will for many years to come given the issue is still alive today. It’s why issues around native title and the treaty debates resonate with such power and are so hotly negotiated. Winmar wanting to have the statue placed at Optus Stadium means something about his Noongar identity and has nothing to do with the amount of games played, premierships won or Sandover medals secured. That is why the statue being at Optus is a perfectly reasonable choice given the actions of Winmar on that day, when he spoke out against the abuse and redirected the conversation that Australia so desperately needed to have and is still, in many respects, having today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/17/longman-byelection-will-one-nation-decide-who-wins","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T23:14:49Z","webTitle":"Longman byelection: will One Nation decide who wins?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/17/longman-byelection-will-one-nation-decide-who-wins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/17/longman-byelection-will-one-nation-decide-who-wins","fields":{"headline":"Longman byelection: will One Nation decide who wins?","bodyText":"Bill Feldman understands the irony of the “One Nation factor” that looms over the approaching Longman byelection, where voters who shun the major parties will decide which major party wins. “At the end of the day you put one of [Labor or the Liberal National party] in,” he tells Guardian Australia. “The One Nation vote will decide who is in or who is out.” Feldman won the Queensland seat of Caboolture – at the centre of the federal electorate of Longman – for the first incarnation of One Nation in 1998. He was the party’s state leader then led a breakaway group, the City Country Alliance. These days, Feldman is just a retired voter – the sort who scares both Labor and the Coalition and makes contests like Longman wildly unpredictable. Feldman spent his life after politics as a police union official and is now a self-funded retiree. He cares about the plight of the “working poor” and the increased casualisation of the workforce but also worries about whether the country can sustain its immigration numbers. He likes neither Malcolm Turnbull nor Bill Shorten. “Part of it is the general disenchantment with both the major parties,” he says. “I suppose federally there’s a lot of things that upset a lot of people. “They haven’t addressed those issues and I’m surprised they haven’t because in this day and age they need support from some other party to put you in front. That’s the problem with our system.” Feldman says the votes of fellow retirees will be crucial in an electorate that takes in Bribie Island and the northern end of Deception Bay, as well as the town centres of Caboolture and Burpengary. One Nation preferences tipped the scales in Labor’s favour in Longman in 2016. About 57% of One Nation voters sent their preferences to Susan Lamb, who narrowly won the seat. Last year at the Queensland state election, One Nation voters’ preferences went in the opposite direction and heavily favoured the LNP. Between 2016 and 2017, the One Nation vote more than doubled at individual polling booths within the boundaries of Longman. At some, the party won 31% of the primary vote. In recent weeks One Nation has been beset with internal conflicts at federal level, with senator Brian Burston quitting the party after a huge falling-out with leader Pauline Hanson. The upheaval in the party, which has lost four senators in various ways since the 2016 election, mirrors the pattern that emerged after its initial success in the late 1990s, when infighting and bad blood with Hanson led to a rapid electoral decline. It remains to be seen whether the federal unrest will diminish the One Nation vote at the Longman byelection on 28 July, although its support remains at 8% nationally in the most recent Guardian Essential poll and Newspoll. The electoral analyst Ben Raue says anecdotal evidence suggested One Nation campaign workers did not attend many polling booths in Longman in 2016. “Most people wouldn’t have seen their how-to-votes,” he says. “And maybe that explains why there was such an even split in preferences. “In the context of a byelection, in a relatively good area for One Nation, they should have all the booths in Longman covered. That might mean the way the party directs preferences has more impact. “It’s a very hard feat to predict. The bigger question is we just don’t know how the One Nation vote is going to go – they’re not very stable, they’re not very consistent.” The reality on the ground in Longman is a campaign where One Nation looms as kingmaker but where the major parties are still setting the agenda and even battling for the preferences of protest voters. Labor believes One Nation preferences are likely to break in favour of the LNP, regardless of any swap deal on how-to-vote cards. Party sources say Labor needs to win primary votes but will also appeal to One Nation voters for their preferences. Labor believes proposed company tax cuts will be an effective wedge between protest voters and the Coalition that will dilute the flow of One Nation preferences. Longman is home to thousands of retirees who receive franking tax credits. The LNP has handed out flyers in Longman branding Labor’s policy to abolish cash refunds for excess imputation credits as a “retirement tax”. One Nation supports neither the company tax cuts, after its recent about-face, nor the end of franking tax credits. The party, and its voters, have a tough choice to make about preferences. The One Nation candidate, Matthew Stephen, says “the major two parties have lost their way” but he would prefer to direct preferences to the LNP than Labor. Soon after Stephen made those comments, discussions about preferences broke down between the LNP and One Nation. It’s understood that One Nation will most likely maintain its policy from the Queensland election of putting all sitting members last, a move that will further complicate an already intriguing byelection. Lamb is recontesting the seat but is technically not a sitting member, having resigned under a citizenship cloud."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/18/not-safe-not-wanted-is-the-end-of-nt-fracking-ban-a-taste-of-things-to-come","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T18:00:21Z","webTitle":"'Not safe, not wanted': is the end of NT fracking ban a taste of things to come?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/18/not-safe-not-wanted-is-the-end-of-nt-fracking-ban-a-taste-of-things-to-come","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/18/not-safe-not-wanted-is-the-end-of-nt-fracking-ban-a-taste-of-things-to-come","fields":{"headline":"'Not safe, not wanted': is the end of NT fracking ban a taste of things to come?","bodyText":"When the Northern Territory government announced a moratorium on fracking in 2016, it was a victory for those fighting the expansion of the unconventional gas industry. That elation was replaced with shock and disappointment in April, when the chief minister, Michael Gunner, said the practice could resume following a 15-month scientific inquiry. “Most Australians are unaware that huge areas of the country are being transformed into industrial gas fields,” says Mark Ogge, principal adviser at the Australia Institute. “The Northern Territory is the latest chapter in the oil and gas industry’s relentless expansion.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Most unconventional gas produced in Australia now comes from coal seam gas reservoirs in Queensland. Between July 2016 and June 2017, 1358 petajoules of gas was produced from about 6,000 wells. But the industry has sought to expand its reach into areas covering the forest country of the Pilliga in the north-west of New South Wales, Western Australia’s Canning basin, the Coonawarra wine region of South Australia, and vast swathes of land in the Northern Territory. There has been a remarkable level of resistance to this from the public because of fears about the impact of unconventional gas production on water resources, farmland and regional economies once the short spikes in production reach their end point. Alliances have been formed across groups that have traditionally been at odds – the environment movement, Indigenous groups and conservative regional and farming communities. These groups have had successes including government buybacks of exploration licences, the establishment of public inquiries, moratoriums on fracking or even outright bans in some states. But organisations such as Lock the Gate, which emerged from grassroots opposition to coal and unconventional gas mining on Australia’s east coast, say the industry is fighting a “war of attrition” and the recent lifting of the moratorium on fracking in the Northern Territory is indicative of its ability to push ahead. “That’s an indication of the power of the gas industry,” says the Lock the Gate NSW coordinator Georgina Woods. “Like other extractive industries, they have a lot of reach, a lot of money, a lot of power – and governments in Australia do tend to eventually concede to extractive industries.” Pressure from the top Before the NT decision, Queensland was the only state with no restrictions on unconventional gas exploration and development (excluding the Australian Capital Territory, which has no gas reserves). Fracking is banned in Victoria and there are moratoriums in place in Tasmania and Western Australia. In NSW, there have been buybacks and cancellations of exploration licences, and the industry is now concentrated in the north-west of the state and Camden in south-west Sydney. Following the recent elections in South Australia, the new Liberal government put in place a moratorium on fracking in the Limestone coast region in the state’s south-east. The West Australian government has prohibited fracking in the Perth, Peel and south-west regions of the state but an inquiry is exploring the risks of opening up other parts of the state to production. They include the Canning basin in the Kimberley, where Mitsubishi Corporation and Buru Energy hold tenements. The WA inquiry has received 10,000 written submissions and its chairman, Tom Hatton, says the committee hopes to present its report to the premier, Mark McGowan, and the Labor state government by the end of the year. There has been tremendous federal pressure on state and territory governments to lift the bans on fracking (hydraulic fracturing). Last year, the federal Coalition, seeking to avoid long-term gas shortages, warned it could use the GST carve-up to force states and territories to lift fracking bans. At a speech in September, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, called on Gunner – who was in the audience – to “pull the trigger ... we need that gas down here”. A week after the NT ended its ban in April, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, gave the territory an extra $260m to make up for its low GST share, as well as an extra $550m over five years for remote Indigenous housing. He denied the timing of the decision was linked to the lifting of the moratorium. Yet for all the enthusiasm for new unconventional gas production at a federal level, the industry remains unpopular among the broader Australian public. In its final report summary, the NT fracking inquiry’s committee, led by Justice Rachel Pepper, wrote: “It must be noted that the strong antipathy surrounding hydraulic fracturing for onshore shale gas demonstrated during the consultations did not abate. “For a significant majority of the people participating in the inquiry, the overwhelming consensus was that hydraulic fracturing for onshore shale gas in the NT is not safe, is not trusted and is not wanted.” The NT inquiry found that fracking risks could be reduced to acceptable levels – provided 135 recommendations were implemented and certain areas, including conservation parks and Indigenous Protected Areas, were declared no-go zones for exploration. In announcing that the NT government would allow fracking to resume, Gunner promised that all 135 recommendations would be implemented in full, clearing the way for 51% of the territory to be opened up to the unconventional gas industry. The potential NT reserves cover a region that stretches from Katherine, south-east of Darwin, down to Elliott and out to Borroloola, west of the Queensland border. They include the so-called Beetaloo sub-basin, an area within the McArthur basin about 500km south-east of Darwin. They also cover some parts of Arnhem Land and regions surrounding Alice Springs. For Eleanor Dixon, a Mudburra woman from the remote NT community of Marlinja, 700km north of Alice Springs, the government’s announcement came as a shock. Dixon’s community lies within the southern part of the Beetaloo sub-basin. The basin is bordered by the town of Elliott in the south and Mataranka, home to the Mataranka thermal springs, in the north. The community, which is not within an Indigenous Protected Area, is concerned about the potential impact of unconventional gas exploration on their water catchment. “I felt really betrayed. I felt really disappointed ... disappointed in people,” Dixon says. “Because at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what title people hold or what status they have, or what reputation they hold, it doesn’t matter. I’m disappointed in people who are willing to take a risk and destroy the earth.” During the inquiry, the committee identified a total prospective gas reserve in the Northern Territory of about 257,000 petajoules, with almost 70% of this in the Beetaloo sub-basin. It’s a resource larger than any of the North West Shelf conventional gas resources, the Cooper/Eromanga basins, or the Canning basin. The report compared the Beetaloo to some of the big shale gas basins in the United States. How much of the potential reserve is eventually extracted will depend on technical and economic factors, including production costs and gas prices. Origin Energy, Santos and Pangaea Resources are among the companies that hold licences for the Beetaloo and McArthur basins. The problem with the water trigger The climate impact of opening new gas tenements, the commercial viability of any new industry, poor environmental regulation and the effects on groundwater were among the concerns voiced during the inquiry. In a place like the NT, which gets 90% of its water supply from groundwater, people are particularly conscious of any potential risks. “People are well and truly aware of the impact that contamination of water has,” says Jimmy Cocking, chief executive of the Arid Lands Environment Centre. “Darwin has a dam. Everyone else needs their groundwater.” In its final report, the committee said it had been unable to make definitive assessments of the risk of unsustainable groundwater use, unacceptable contamination of groundwater, or unacceptable impacts on aquatic eco-systems because “of a lack of baseline information and knowledge of the surface and groundwater systems and the aquatic ecosystems”. One of its 135 recommendations was that such baseline data be acquired before the NT government grants any more production approvals for onshore shale gas. Cocking also sits on the Alice Springs town council, which passed a motion calling for its water catchment to be off limits to unconventional gas. He believes acquiring such data could take years. “There’s not a lot known about how the surface water and groundwater interacts and there’s a lot of studies to be done to reduce that risk,” he says. The NT decision, along with the prospect of industry expansion in South Australia and Western Australia, depending on the outcome of its inquiry, highlights what conservationists and scientists say are weaknesses in Australia’s national environment laws as they apply to water. Under the country’s national environment laws – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act – water resources are a matter of national significance only in relation to coal seam gas and coal mining development. In 2013, the Gillard government, with the independent MP Tony Windsor, introduced a water trigger after a boom in coal seam gas development on the east coast of Australia and following concerns for the Great Artesian Basin. But the water trigger does not apply to shale or tight gas development, which are the substrates found in the NT and WA, and also in parts of Queensland and South Australia. It’s a technicality that means much of the country is not covered by the water trigger, even though the process used to extract shale and tight gas is similar to that used in coal seam gas mining. In the NT inquiry, the committee recommended that the trigger be expanded to onshore shale gas development. Conservationists want stronger national laws that offer protections and assessments at a federal level for any nationally significant water resources, and not just east coast resources affected by coal or coal seam gas development. But there are questions over what the best approach is – whether it involves extending the water trigger to include shale and tight gas or developing a new framework of national environment laws that require ministers to consider climate and water impacts when assessing development proposals. The state director for the Wilderness Society in Western Australia, Jenita Enevoldsen, favours the latter, noting that the water trigger – now being examined as part of the Senate inquiry into water use by extractive industries – has not prevented coal seam gas development or fracking on the east coast. “We are calling for the next federal government to enact new laws for nature and climate, which would protect our significant water resources for future generations from risky industries like fracking,” she says. “Due to the overwhelming evidence that the risks of gas fracking far outweigh any benefits to our communities, we are advocating for a legislated ban on fracking in WA.” Enevoldsen says strong national protections for water would be significant for the Kimberley, where ecosystems, such as the national heritage-listed Fitzroy river, rely on groundwater, but little is understood about the surface and groundwater interactions. “These ecosystems can last the whole way through the dry season, so six months or even longer without a drop of water, and they rely on being fed by groundwater,” she says. Guardian Australia asked the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, if the government would consider extending the water trigger to shale and tight gas developments, and was told no legislative changes had been recommended after a review of the trigger in 2017. Asked how the government felt about the expansion of the unconventional gas industry in the Northern Territory, and potentially in WA in future, and if it was concerned about potential risks to water and the broader environment, he said: “As the chief scientist has made clear, the unconventional extraction of gas can be done safely and should be assessed on an evidence- and scientific basis. “The Turnbull government welcomes the decision by the Northern Territory government to develop their gas resources as a means of delivering a more affordable, reliable and lower emissions energy system.” Gunner has said in a statement that his government has met its election commitment to conduct an independent scientific inquiry and either ban the practice or allow it in “highly regulated circumstances in tightly prescribed areas”. “We have accepted the key finding of the report – that if all the [135] recommendations are implemented, we can protect the environment, water, existing jobs, sacred sites and create new jobs,” he said. “We have also accepted the inquiry’s advice about no-go zones. There will be no fracking in national parks, conservation areas, Indigenous Protected Areas, towns, residential and strategic assets, and areas of high cultural, environmental or tourism value.” The industry continues its push The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea), representing the oil and gas industry, rejects the suggestion there is widespread opposition in the areas it operates. Appea’s Northern Territory and South Australia director, Matthew Doman, points to a 2014 CSIRO study which found that 9% of those in the Western Downs communities of Tara, Chinchilla, Miles and Dalby in Queensland opposed the coal seam gas industry. However, the same study found that only 6% felt the community was improving because of the industry and almost half were not coping or only just coping with the changes, while the rest were adapting. A more recent CSIRO study of local attitudes toward coal seam gas in NSW’s Narrabri found that 30.5% opposed it, 27% tolerated it, 13% approved of it and 14.8% embraced it. “The industry is committed to listening and responding to the genuine questions and concerns held by many in the community, just as we are committed to exposing the false and exaggerated claims made by others,” Doman says. “We will continue to do that as long as we seek to maintain the community’s support for the safe and sustainable development of Australia’s natural resources.” A spokesman for Origin Energy says the company plans to resume work in the Northern Territory as soon as practical, and gain the necessary approvals to complete the rest of its exploration work in the Beetaloo sub-basin. Before the moratorium, the company had drilled four wells and fracked one. He says the company aims to drill another five wells under its existing exploration permit and will complete a nine-well exploration and appraisal program by about 2021. But it has to do more assessments to determine if it is economically feasible to move to production. “Ensuring environmental protections is important to Origin – so there’s common ground here that everyone shares. We are committed to exploring and producing natural gas in a responsible way without harming the environment,” the spokesman says. “There are multiple controls and barriers to protect groundwater and the environment. When we drill, if these controls aren’t successfully met, we don’t frack. “There is also significant distance between where natural gas is found and the shallow aquifers closer to the surface – around 2km of separation sealed off by thick intervening geological layers known as aquitards.” A spokeswoman for Santos says it will resume its exploration in the McArthur basin as soon as it has approval. “The independent scientific inquiry into hydraulic fracturing in the NT considered submissions from all sections of the community, including environment groups, and, based on the evidence presented, the inquiry concluded that the risks associated with onshore gas development and fracking can be managed with effective regulation that is currently being put in place by the NT government,” she says. The bigger picture Opponents of unconventional gas exploration say the lifting of the NT moratorium should sound a warning to other parts of the country. In Queensland, producing gasfields already cover more than 30,000 square kilometres of the country region. Ogge of The Australia Institute says the “insatiable thirst of Queensland’s gas export terminals” has driven the NT to open up its iconic landscape to fracking, which is now increasing pressure on Western Australia to follow suit. “Meanwhile, the industry and federal government are increasing the pressure on the few remaining pockets resisting the expansion, particularly in Victoria,” he says. The chief executive of the Conservation Council of South Australia, Craig Wilkins, says support or opposition from governments to the unconventional gas industry does not appear to be dependent on party ideology. Instead, the consistent factor for support is incumbency, he says. “Governments in power tend to allow it to happen. Opposition parties responding to deep community concern tend to oppose it,” Wilkins says. “Why? Oil and gas companies and their lobbyists work incredibly hard to convince governments to override the community’s clear opposition and let them forge ahead.” The Lock the Gate Alliance national coordinator, Naomi Hogan, says the level of determination and organisation among the public is increasing following the NT’s decision. She says there was anger at the result and regional communities around Australia now have “their eyes wide open to the fact that inquiries can identify risks and then try and find ways around them”. “You can’t mitigate away the impacts of putting thousands of wells on the landscape.” She says there are concerns about the potential presence of gas fields in pristine parts of the NT such as the water recharge area of the Mataranka Springs and Roper river in Katherine. While the springs are in a national park that is off limits to fracking, an area south of the springs is covered by an active exploration licence owned by Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting. The company relinquished portions of the licence last year to create a 25km exploration buffer zone from the springs and the Roper river. In Elliott and Marlinja, the water system is downstream from the Beetaloo sub-basin and continues south to Lake Woods, a wetlands area that provides an internationally significant habitat for water birds. “Every bore is connected and that is why one of the biggest issues for us is protecting our water,” Dixon says. “Water plays a very big part in our culture, through ceremony. It carries songlines. As people who are connected to the land, we hold a responsibility to take care of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/14/school-chaplains-legal-challenge-argues-program-is-discriminatory","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T18:00:25Z","webTitle":"School chaplains legal challenge argues program is discriminatory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/14/school-chaplains-legal-challenge-argues-program-is-discriminatory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/14/school-chaplains-legal-challenge-argues-program-is-discriminatory","fields":{"headline":"School chaplains legal challenge argues program is discriminatory","bodyText":"The school chaplains program has been labelled discriminatory in a test case against rules requiring pastoral care workers to be connected to organised religion. In a case that could have significant repercussions on the controversial program, the requirement that potential employees of Access Ministries, one of the groups that provides pastoral care, must be Christian will be challenged in the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning Secular and atheist groups have challenged the federally funded program, which is administered by states, on the grounds it harms freedom of religion because the role itself is meant to be non-religious. The Vcat complaint takes the case of a candidate who had worked as a chaplain in three other schools, including a Catholic school, and was barred from applying from primary school positions because she was not Christian. The complaint claims Access Ministries is an employer that has advertised employment opportunities, but has discriminated against a potential employee because of her lack of religion. “The discrimination is not reasonably necessary for Access Ministries to comply with the doctrines, beliefs or principles of the religion associated with Access Ministries, because the work of a school chaplain takes place in a non-religious context and workplace, namely a government school, with a student population made up of students with a variety of religious affiliations and with no religious affiliation,” the complaint reads. “The work of a school chaplain is non-religious. As Justice Heydon explained in Williams v Commonwealth the work described could have been done by persons who met a religious test. It could equally have been done by persons who did not.” The Victorian Department of Education and Training is also named in the complaint as having “requested, instructed, induced, encouraged, authorised or assisted” Access Ministries, which applied the employment criteria. Vcat is being asked to make a finding that will stop potential applicants for the chaplaincy program from being discriminated against, based on their religion, or lack thereof. The chaplains program was a Howard government initiative and was continued by subsequent Labor governments, and then given almost $250m to continue in Tony Abbott’s first budget in 2014. The most recent budget extended the program with another $250m over four years. Advocates for the program argue it provides school students with additional support, while critics have taken umbrage at the religious components in state, secular schools Associate Prof Luke Beck, who specialises in religious freedom and separation of church and state issues at Monash University, argues Access Ministries is breaking the law with its employment requirements. “State anti-discrimination law prohibits discrimination against job applicants based on religion just as much as it prohibits discrimination against job applicants based on sex or race,” he said. “Advertising a job and saying only people from one particular religion may apply is unlawful discrimination. That’s what’s going on with school chaplain job ads. That’s what Access Ministries has done. “The high court has previously said there is no good reason why school chaplains should be religious. School chaplains provide non-religious student welfare services. “If the case succeeds, the practical outcome will be that school chaplain jobs will need to be open to all qualified applicants regardless of religious belief. Religious discrimination is wrong. This case seeks to vindicate that important principle.” The Human Rights Commission had been asked to investigate the chaplains program earlier this year, but declined on the grounds Philip Ruddock was already reviewing Australia’s religious freedoms for the government. • Additional reporting by Paul Karp"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/13/dixons-carphone-reveals-data-breach-affecting-59-million-customers","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T15:42:17Z","webTitle":"GCHQ cybersecurity experts investigate Dixons Carphone data breach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/13/dixons-carphone-reveals-data-breach-affecting-59-million-customers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/13/dixons-carphone-reveals-data-breach-affecting-59-million-customers","fields":{"headline":"GCHQ cybersecurity experts investigate Dixons Carphone data breach","bodyText":"A branch of GCHQ, Britain’s intelligence and security service, is investigating one of the UK’s biggest data breaches at a single firm, involving unauthorised access to 5.9 million Dixons Carphone customers’ cards. The National Cyber Security Centre said it was working alongside the retailer and other agencies after the attack, which also involved unauthorised access to 1.2m personal records of Dixons Carphone customers. “Anyone concerned about fraud or lost data should contact Action Fraud and we recommend that people are vigilant against any suspicious activity on their bank accounts,” the NCSC said. Dixons Carphone said it had identified the massive data breach while it was reviewing its systems and data. The consumer electronics firm said there was an attempt to compromise the cards in a processing system at Currys PC World and Dixons Travel, but said there was no evidence of fraud as a result of the incident. In a second breach, personal data such as names, addresses or email addresses have been accessed. Again, Dixons said there was no evidence that it had resulted in fraud. Alex Baldock, its chief executive, apologised for the data breach and admitted the company had failed its customers. “We are extremely disappointed and sorry for any upset this may cause. The protection of our data has to be at the heart of our business and we’ve fallen short here. “We’ve taken action to close off this unauthorised access and though we have currently no evidence of fraud as a result of these incidents, we are taking this extremely seriously.” Baldock said the company had engaged cybersecurity experts to handle the matter and had added extra security measures to its systems. The retailer will be writing over the coming days to those customers whose personal data was breached, “to inform them, to apologise, and to give them advice on any protective steps they should take”. Of the 5.9m cards that were accessed illegally, 5.8m were chip and pin protected, and no pin codes, card verification values (CVV) or authentication data were accessed, meaning purchases could not be made. However, about 105,000 payment cards from outside the EU and without chip and pin protection were accessed. The retailer said it had notified the banks concerned and they had not detected any fraudulent purchases on customer accounts. Shares in Dixons Carphone fell as much as 6% at one point on Wednesday after the data breach was announced, as investors factored in a potentially steep fine for the company, as well as potential damage to the firm’s reputation. The retailer said that while the data breach was only discovered over the past week, it occurred within the last year, before 25 May when the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules came into force. Under the previous Data Protection Act rules, the maximum fine imposed would be £500,000. Under the GDPR rules, firms could face a maximum of €20m (£17.6m) or 4% of global turnover, whichever is the greater. The independent regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office, said it was investigating the breach alongside the NCSC and the Financial Conduct Authority. A spokesman for the ICO said the investigation was at an early stage. He added: “We will look at when the incident happened and when it was discovered as part of our work, and this will inform whether it is dealt with under the 1998 or 2018 Data Protection Acts.” Alex Neill, a managing director at the consumer group Which?, said the security breach was a major concern. “This massive breach will cause real worry to millions of customers and raises serious questions about how Dixons Carphone has been looking after customers’ data. It is critical the company moves quickly to ensure those affected get clear information about what has happened and what steps they should take to protect themselves. “Anyone concerned they could be at risk of fraud should consider changing their online passwords, monitor bank and other online accounts and be wary of emails regarding the breach as scammers may try and take advantage of it.” Dixons Carphone said its investigation into the cyber-attack had yet to identify the culprit or culprits.

Malcolm Turnbull announced that Australia would jointly fund construction of an underwater telecommunication cable network, which will link remote Solomon Islands communities to Honiara. Huawei had been earmarked to build the cable, after the Solomons originally awarded the contract to the Chinese company – a move that prompted Australian intelligence and security chiefs to warn against the deal. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The cable is to have an Australian link point, to allow the Solomons and Papua New Guinea to connect to Australia’s fibre optic cable infrastructure. Sydney, Townsville and the Sunshine Coast are all being considered as connection points. Huawei has been banned from government contracts to build Australian infrastructure over concerns that its links to the ruling Chinese communist government could jeopardise Australia’s security. Last year Nick Warner, who heads the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the agency which deals with foreign intelligence, was reported to have warned the former Solomons prime minister Manasseh Sogavare against Huawei’s involvement. Australia stepped in to fill the gap, with funding put aside for the 4,000km cable in the budget. While foreign aid funding was frozen, Australia has concentrated its efforts on the Pacific, after reports about the concessional loans Beijing has been providing countries in the region have concerns that China is seeking to increase its influence in the region. Of the $4.2bn Australia will spend on foreign aid in the next year, $1.3bn is earmarked for the Pacific. Julie Bishop said the Solomon Islands accepting the Australian offer made sense, as it was “cheaper” and “likely to be faster results for them, and technically superior”. “We put up an alternative, and that’s what I believe Australia should continue to do,” Bishop said. “We are the largest aid donor in the Pacific. “We are a longstanding partner of the Solomon Islands and I want to ensure that countries in the Pacific have alternatives, that they don’t only have one option and no others, and so in this case, we are in a position to be able to offer a more attractive deal for Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea and they accepted it.” Turnbull attempted to play down the security concerns about the cable, saying instead Australia was happy to see the Solomons and PNG grow. “There have been a number of cable projects that have been contemplated, with respect to the Solomon Islands over the years,” he said. “You’ve referred to one of them. What we are doing is providing very practical and substantial support and aid as part of our foreign aid program, to provide that telecommunications infrastructure which will ensure that the Solomons Island has access to 21st century telecommunications, which, as I was discussing with the prime minister [Rick Houenipwela] today, it is going to be vital for education, for commerce, for economic development, in every aspect of their society, just as it is in ours.” Houenipwela will spend time in Queensland, a key trading partner with the Solomons, as well as Sydney and Canberra during his trip, which follows the official end of the Australian-led peacekeeping mission in his nation, which began in 2003 and ended last June. with Australian Associated Press"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/true-north/2018/jun/13/doug-fords-disastrous-agenda-can-be-derailed-by-a-massive-grassroots-movement","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T15:45:29Z","webTitle":"Doug Ford’s disastrous agenda can be derailed by a massive grassroots movement | Martin Lukacs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2018/jun/13/doug-fords-disastrous-agenda-can-be-derailed-by-a-massive-grassroots-movement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/true-north/2018/jun/13/doug-fords-disastrous-agenda-can-be-derailed-by-a-massive-grassroots-movement","fields":{"headline":"Doug Ford’s disastrous agenda can be derailed by a massive grassroots movement","bodyText":"The guardians of respectable opinion forecast that Doug Ford would never become Ontario’s Premier. Now that he has, they are suggesting his reign might be orderly and painless. While agreeing with his basic agenda, the Globe &amp; Mail is crossing its fingers that Ford “moves slowly on the public-service layoffs and program cuts…to avoid strikes and social discord.” It’s wishful thinking on every count. All indications point to Ford moving quickly and ruthlessly. He will try to govern through the “retroactive consensus” favoured by his right-wing provincial predecessors — ramming through policies, then hoping the demoralization and demobilization of the populace can be passed off as political approval. If we want to derail his agenda, we will have to shake off the shock and ensure our opposition grows equally fast. The first challenge will be contending with the mainstream media’s impulse to fixate on Ford’s clownish sideshow. A loud movement of opposition can redirect their attention to where it belongs: the impact of his policies. During the campaign, Ford preached that “help is on the way” — but what’s coming now is a whole lot of hurt. To make up for the billions of dollars he plans to give away through corporate tax cuts and a scrapped cap-and-trade program, Ford is about to embark on a slash-and-burn offensive. With a Tory transition team stacked full of corporate executives, lobbyists, and career politicians – not a “little guy” in sight – it’s unsurprising that Bay Street is signalling its pleasure: “[Ford’s] mandate sets up a clear tack away from higher taxes and big program spending, to tax relief, leaner government and competitiveness,” announced one bank economist’s missive. His promise of dollar beer aside, the vast majority of Ontarians will be paying a steeper cost across every aspect of their lives: in more crowded classrooms and hospitals, in diminished social assistance, in less available public transit and housing, in more aggressive policing of racialized communities, and in an assault on the environment. “Everything’s going out for bid”: that’s Ford giving notice about a privatization spree. On the immediate chopping block appear to be the new sex-ed curriculum, supervised-injection sites, and the minimum wage increase — all of which will make Ontarians less safe, healthy and secure. So much for a “government for the people.” At every turn, Ford will have to be reminded that this mandate for austerity was never advertised and barely endorsed: the hundred percent of legislative power he will enjoy is based, in our unreformed electoral system, on merely 40 percent of actual voters and 23 percent of eligible ones. As Ontarians search for models for their resistance, they have inspiring and powerful precedents in their own recent history. When Tory premier Mike Harris came to power in 1995 – unleashing the kind of multi-billion dollar cuts to vital programs and services that we can expect under Ford – a grassroots coalition kickstarted protests as soon as he took office. They built up toward Days of Action – one-day, one-city general strikes which spread across the province. Thousands spilled out of their workplaces and marched in the streets, including 350,000 people in Toronto. The movement damaged the popularity of Harris and forced him to back off certain policies, historian Doug Nesbitt writes. But when the labour movement’s official leadership undermined its momentum and the protests ended, his popularity rebounded. It will take nothing less than this sort of movement – and the extensive education and face-to-face organizing required to build it – to precipitate a crisis for Ford. He won the election because he was able to connect with people angry and despairing at an economic order rigged against their interests. Such a mass movement can clarify that his agenda won’t help them — it will only compound their pain. Pundits are suggesting the Liberal collapse occurred because they moved “too far to the left.” That’s nonsense, labour activists point out. When pushed by movements, they did indeed bring in some reforms worth defending, like the $15 minimum wage. But by finishing the privatization of Hydro started by the Tories, presiding over exploding inequality, and not reversing the decimation of the social safety net of the Harris years, the Liberals laid the foundation for Ford’s ascent. They have laid them as much for a rise of the left, which must now forge a populist alternative to shift Ford’s support from under him. An alternative that takes on the elite not with hollow potshots about downtown snobs, but with redistributive policies that simultaneously combat inequality, racism, and climate change. Instead of releasing such an alternative at election time, the NDP should campaign on it forthrightly year-round. This would prove they’ve learned an essential lesson: if the left can’t respond effectively to the failures of neoliberal centrism, an ugly right will triumph. Can it be done? I witnessed what might be possible when I spent a day on the campaign trail of community organizer and NDP candidate Joel Harden in Ottawa’s centre-town riding. Harden’s bustling office was ringed with posters featuring positions he unapologetically promoted: the rights of workers, LGBTQI and Indigenous peoples; a sanctuary province that would ensure equal access to services for refugees; massive investment in good green jobs, public transit and more liveable communities; and a rapid transition off fossil fuels envisioned in the Leap Manifesto. The buttons pinned on shirts didn’t reproduce Andrea Horwath’s tepid slogan of “Change for the Better.” They read: “Be Bold.” Such a progressive vision could just as well have addressed the concerns in the suburban regions almost entirely swept by the Tories: painful commutes, precarious work, paltry community services. Forget the airbrushed, inoffensive politics of many past NDP campaigns: this is what brought out hundreds of energized volunteers. These volunteers were then trained for a different kind of organizing: as they knocked on 70,000 doors over eight months, they didn’t merely check-off existing support on their clipboards — the method the NDP has mostly relied on for decades. Inspired by the campaigns of Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders, they engaged in informed discussions about issues, debunking both the Tory’s fake populism and the Liberal’s elite-friendly politics. Harden underlined the campaign’s concern for peoples’ everyday struggles by handing out his personal cell-phone number. The right-wing Sun newspaper splashed his face on its cover, trying to depict him as a fringe, radical candidate. But the combination of ambitious social outlook and empowered grassroots organizing wasn’t an electoral liability — it was the route to success. Harden resoundingly defeated a popular Liberal cabinet minister. For those hoping for a deeper revitalization of the NDP’s prospects, this much is clear: if this model of politics had been practiced across the province, they might have won the election. A new populism of the left will require weaving together a bold, positive vision with street protest, workplace organizing, and a more open and dynamic NDP — forging closer links between the party and movements like the Fight for $15 and Fairness, Black Lives Matter, and Idle No More. The first opportunity is a mass rally on June 16th. While the pundit and political class will no doubt urge caution – advising against “strikes and social discord” above all else – those about to start marching surely know better.

On Wednesday about 50 officers began searching a three square kilometre stretch of bush around the Kendall home where William was last seen in 2014 wearing a Spiderman outfit. Det Ch Insp Gary Jubelin told media in Kendall on Wednesday that police held “grave, grave fears” about William, who was three when he disappeared. “It’s been a very long time,” he said. “As I’ve said to the family, and I can’t be any more honest than what I say to the family ... until we know conclusively that William is not alive we’ll treat it with the possibility that he still is alive. But obviously we have grave concerns.” Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The return to the street from where William first disappeared – and the renewed search – is likely to lead to a coronial inquest if no new information is unearthed. Police are focusing on proving that William’s disappearance was “the result of human intervention and not through misadventure”. “The difference between this search and the search that was done originally [is that] the original search was focused on finding a little boy lost,” Jubelin said. “The search commencing today, which we anticipate will take between three to four weeks, will be focusing on a forensic search. “The purpose of this is that if we present evidence to a court, whether coronial or criminal, [we can show] beyond reasonable doubt that William’s disappearance was the result of human intervention and not through misadventure.” Jubelin believes there are people in community who know what happened to William, and on Wednesday he said police had received about 15,000 pieces of information, and had a number of persons of interest. “A matter goes to an inquest if we can’t solve [it] from a criminal perspective [and] we’re keeping our minds open to that,” he said. “But I want to also stress that we have numerous lines of inquiry, including persons of interest. We’re going to fully exhaust those before the matter goes to the coroner.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/13/i-have-to-go-pru-goward-hangs-up-on-interview-over-secret-report","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T02:04:13Z","webTitle":"'I have to go': Pru Goward hangs up on interview over secret report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/13/i-have-to-go-pru-goward-hangs-up-on-interview-over-secret-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/13/i-have-to-go-pru-goward-hangs-up-on-interview-over-secret-report","fields":{"headline":"'I have to go': Pru Goward hangs up on interview over secret report","bodyText":"NSW minister for family services Pru Goward blamed the premier’s department for the decision to withhold a damning report into NSW’s out-of-home care system. Goward appeared on ABC Canberra radio on Wednesday morning and when the questioning turned from local issues to the Tune report she appeared to end the interview abruptly with: “I have to go.” A spokesman said the ABC was aware Goward had limited time available and had now agreed to an on-air apology, after broadcasting her hang-up and then tweeting about it. The ABC said they acknowledged she did not leave the interview because of the questioning. The Tune report into the NSW child protection system, which was delivered to the cabinet in 2016, was withheld from the public for two years. It was released this week, after the Upper House of the NSW parliament ordered the release. The move was supported by a maverick Liberal Matthew Mason-Cox, who crossed the floor to support the minor parties and Labor. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Asked why it had been kept secret, Goward said: “It was a decision made by a previous minister, and of course it was written for the cabinet.” “The premier’s department particularly gave very strong advice that we need to preserve the rights of the cabinet to have confidential information provided to it and for it to remain confidential,” she said. The report, by the former senior public servant David Tune, paints a damning picture of out-of home care in NSW, finding the government spent $1.86bn on vulnerable families in 2015-16 but spending was “crisis-oriented” and had “evolved in an ad hoc way”. Goward said she was “perfectly comfortable” with the Tune report being released. “We have done wonderful things in child protection as a result of that report and I think the challenge is to find areas where we have failed to act.” The minister, who is also the member for Goulburn, had been asked to appear on the program to discuss the Murrumbateman school. The interview ran for 13 minutes and after dealing with the school issue, veered onto the Tune report. Tune said in the report there was “significant unmet demand” and inefficiency, with only one in three reports of children at risk of significant harm being investigated by a family and community services (Facs) worker. The report said the cost of providing out-of-home care – mainly foster home placements – had risen sharply since the government began transferring responsibility to non-government organisations in 2012. “The average unit cost of a child in care of an NGO is $41,000 ... while a child in [Facs] care is $27,000,” Tune said. Almost 60% of children were now in the care of NGOs and they were staying there longer because the bulk of funding was spent on out-of-home care “instead of addressing family needs earlier”, the report found. Aboriginal children are disproportionately represented in out-of-home care. In a statement responding to the release of the report, Goward said the government had committed $190m over four years from 2016-17 as an immediate response and that early results were promising, with the numbers of children in care falling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/13/theresa-may-fresh-standoff-tory-rebels-brexit-demands","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T08:18:41Z","webTitle":"May walks Brexit tightrope as Tory rift over final deal deepens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/13/theresa-may-fresh-standoff-tory-rebels-brexit-demands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/13/theresa-may-fresh-standoff-tory-rebels-brexit-demands","fields":{"headline":"May walks Brexit tightrope as Tory rift over final deal deepens","bodyText":"Theresa May faces one of the most critical moments in the Brexit process so far as she attempts to find a way of giving parliament a meaningful vote on the terms of the final deal that satisfies rebels on both sides of the party. Downing Street sources indicated that the new amendment, which must be tabled on Thursday before the withdrawal bill returns to the Lords on Monday for its final stages, was not yet agreed. Dominic Grieve, the leader of a group of Conservative Brexit rebels, started negotiations with officials on Wednesday afternoon, after the prime minister avoided defeat on his amendment on Tuesday by pledging to talk further on how a meaningful vote could work. On Thursday morning, the Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg renewed the claim that Grieve and his allies were trying to stop Britain leaving the EU. “The Commons is not and cannot be an executive body,” he wrote in the Times. Clause C of the Grieve amendment would have given parliament full control of the next steps in the process if there was no final deal by mid-February 2019. It is unprecedented for parliament to have such a role, as the academic constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor said in the Observer on Sunday. Later on Thursday morning, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, will face questions in the Commons and is expected to be pressed by both sides on how the government plans to answer its critics. His words will be picked over by both sides. There is cross-party support for Grieve, a former attorney general. But on Wednesday, a Downing Street source appeared to suggest the government was not willing to discuss clause C of Grieve’s amendment. Two of the putative rebels, Anna Soubry and Heidi Allen, quickly said that did not match their recollection of what had been promised, with Soubry urging the government to “sort it please”. Later in the day, both sides said they were more hopeful of achieving a compromise, with Grieve describing the talks as “sensible”. May is trying to walk a political tightrope between Grieve and his colleagues, who are anxious about the risk of a no-deal Brexit, and well-drilled agitators on the leave wing of her party, who are urging her not to make too many compromises. Privately the Brexiters continue to insist the parliamentary arithmetic is less tight than the chief whip, Julian Smith, fears, and that the government can defeat the rebels without making major concessions. At prime minister’s questions, May said the government intended to bring forward its own amendment, but stressed that she could not allow MPs to bind the government’s hands or to open it up to the risk that Brexit could be reversed. “I am absolutely clear that I cannot countenance parliament being able to overturn the will of the British people. Parliament gave the decision to the British people, the British people voted to leave the European Union, and as prime minister I am determined to deliver that,” she said. After prime minister’s questions, a No 10 source was asked whether her remarks meant that “as far as the government is concerned, clause C is not up for discussion as part of this amendment”. The source replied: “I think that’s a fair assessment.” Grieve and his colleagues insist they have no intention of seeking to overturn the referendum result. Rees-Mogg, the chair of the pro-Brexit backbench European Research Group, said: “It is absolutely essential that the separation of powers should be observed and that it should be made clear in any compromise amendment that the job of the government and the job of parliament are different.” A statement from the Department for Exiting the European Union said on Tuesday Davis had set three tests for any new amendment: not undermining the negotiations; not changing the constitutional role of parliament and government in negotiating international treaties; and respecting the referendum result. The high stakes for May were underlined by warnings from the rebels that the promise made by the prime minister was “a matter of trust”. The former education secretary Nicky Morgan said if a compromise amendment did not emerge, rebels could work with the Lords to ensure the changes took place. “I think it would be fairly certain that one of the members of the House of Lords would find a way to put down Dominic’s original wording that couldn’t be voted on yesterday. So we are partway through discussions and there is more to come,” she said. May was challenged by Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs over the government’s continued failure to make progress on deciding what post-Brexit customs arrangements it wants to negotiate for. He sought to embarrass the prime minister by quoting several of the leaked comments made by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, at a private dinner for Tory donors last week. “When the prime minister met President Donald Trump last week, did she do as the foreign secretary suggested and ask him to take over the Brexit negotiations?” the Labour leader asked, prompting a long pause from May and cheers from his own MPs. May conceded that the government’s promised Brexit white paper would now not be published until July, after she has gathered her ministers together at her country retreat of Chequers for a second awayday to thrash out their differences. Government sources said the cabinet breakout groups set up to discuss the two rival options for future customs arrangements had met this week, with little sign of any resolution. Brexiters, including Johnson and Davis, are keen on the idea of a “max-fac” approach, using technology to avoid a hard border in Ireland, while colleagues including the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, prefer a customs partnership. Johnson and Hammond sat alongside each other on the frontbench for PMQs, just behind the prime minister, and Corbyn reminded her that Johnson had referred to the Treasury as “the heart of remain”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/14/tories-brexit-business-jobs-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"The Tories’ chaotic Brexit has lost the trust of business, and jobs will go | Aditya Chakrabortty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/14/tories-brexit-business-jobs-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/14/tories-brexit-business-jobs-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"The Tories’ chaotic Brexit has lost the trust of business – and jobs will go","bodyText":"Early summer, and Westminster politics is a glorified beach read. Will the former SAS (Reserve) hardman David Davis stay or go? How long can dogged Theresa May keep her job? And when will the pinstriped assassin Jacob Rees-Mogg strike next? Grab another drink, slap on the Soltan, and all shall be revealed on page 194. What larks! Yet away from parliament, and far from the tabloid front pages, a serious breach is opening up in British politics. Last week some of the most senior business leaders in Britain came out of a Brexit meeting at No 10, and promptly tore the prime minister to shreds. “We’re playing economics; [the politicians] are playing politics,” said Paul Drechsler, president of the bosses’ organisation, the Confederation of British Industry. “In the world of business, we’re frustrated. We’re angry.” An extraordinary statement, especially from an executive invited to tea and biscuits with May. If supposedly tame industrialists now talk like this, you have to wonder what sounds come out of the feral lot. Yet the CBI’s impatience is shared by many. Once the long-haul arm of the Tory movement, the Freight Transport Association lashed out at May last week for “playing chicken with crucial parts of the British economy and the livelihoods of … 7 million Britons”. These are close friends of the Conservative party.As one senior representative of a leading business organisation says: “Over the past two years, most company bosses would never risk saying openly that Brexit is turning out to be a disaster, in case it scared off their best staff.” With fewer than 290 days before Britain formally leaves the EU, their caution is running out. This is a far bigger story than the one on the front pages about who promised which amendment to which band of Tories. One of the fundamental relationships in the establishment is fracturing – and the consequences for government and economy could prove to be historic. An iron rule of British politics is that the Conservatives mean business, and business means the Conservatives. Despite an early falling-out with Margaret Thatcher and a dalliance with Tony Blair, blue remains home corner for commercial companies and champions of cutting taxes and trimming red tape to a minimum. Yet in May’s two years as prime minister, business has either been cast as the enemy or relegated to a walk-on part. In that chaotic summer of 2016, as senior Tories stabbed each other in the back and themselves in the front, May was quick to grasp that many leave voters were sticking up two fingers at the British way of doing capitalism. Neither an ex-banker nor marinaded in Treasury culture, she happily blasted “unscrupulous bosses” and “corporate irresponsibility”. Among her aides was the enthusiastic leaver, Nick Timothy, whose masterplan was to use Brexit to win over working-class voters who had been chucked overboard by New Labour. Once in No 10, May’s schemes for putting workers on company boards and blocking Chinese funding of British nuclear plants turned to dust. Yet on the central policy issue of our time, business remains stuck in a non-speaking role. Take the all-important triggering of article 50: May announced it in her first conference speech as leader, just weeks after the referendum vote and before parliament had resumed. Forget about consulting industry and finance: she didn’t even give them notice. After last summer’s election debacle, and Timothy’s exit, May’s new team set up a conciliatory business advisory council that meets in Downing Street every three months or so. A long way short of the Brexit business task force called for by the CBI and others, its rotating membership – one month WPP, the next Rolls-Royce – makes it almost useless as a forum for formal input. Unsurprisingly, it was after one of these council meetings that Drechsler exploded. Ministers and aides try to calm the waters. Their efforts, while appreciated by people in business I have spoken to, are rendered void against the bungling and botching that marks the negotiations. The tens of billions taxpayers give business in subsidies and tax reliefs are now taken for granted. For as long as Brexit is treated by May first and foremost as a way to keep her own cabinet and party together, the private sector will remain frozen out. Anything else it would like – from a third runway at Heathrow to a proper industrial strategy – gets parked on the long list marked “any other business”. Imagine you are a senior manager at a major carmaker. Over the past two years, you have been assured that you would continue to “operate within” the European single market. Except that turned into “frictionless” trade – which then became “as frictionless as possible”. Meanwhile, the cabinet dreams up “customs partnerships” and other unicorns destined only to be waved away by Michel Barnier – and Boris Johnson is wittering on about yet another bloody bridge. How are you meant to plan around any of that? The answer is that the worst-case scenarios your team drew up in 2016 are, by 2018, your base case. No longer is it just banks and pharmaceutical firms looking overseas. Britain’s biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, warned this week it would shift production of its Discovery 4x4 from Solihull to EU member Slovakia. That can be explained away as focusing Midlands staff on making electric cars – but just last September, the firm said its presence in Slovakia was a “hedge” against Brexit uncertainty. The problem this poses for the rest of us is very real and very easy to sum up. Among all the 28 members of the EU, the UK ranks second only to Ireland on its level of inward investment. As Kevin Farnsworth at the University of York points out, from Thatcher onwards, British governments have touted for capital investment from abroad. It’s why George Osborne cut corporation tax so low and went on tours of China and India. It’s also why the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, says the UK relies on “the kindness of strangers”. That dependence has grown as Britain has lost more and more of its own businesses and become instead a branch-plant economy for the rest of the world. And that kindness is now being strained by a blundering Brexit. Soon the headlines will be not just about a few hundred jobs moving out of the City – but of firms scrapping their expansion plans, or factories shifting to Poland, or thousands of jobs going at a stroke of a pen. It was always a rotten and unsafe model. The irony is, it is a Conservative government that now appears intent on tearing it down – with nothing to replace it. In place of a strategy, you get the panic that broke out in Downing Street when Nissan threatened to take its money elsewhere – resulting in a private meeting with the Japanese carmaker and a series of promises made in a secret “comfort letter”. This is no more an economic policy than a bunch of flowers bought at a service station is a Valentine’s present. But then, this has been the decade in which the political and policymaking elite has inflicted upon itself wound after wound. First came the fiasco of austerity, and an economy that refused to bounce back as Osborne and Carney promised it would. Then came the Brexit referendum that Cameron claimed he had in the bag. And that has produced the slow dissolution of the Tory-corporate coalition central to contemporary British capitalism. With all that as the background, why wouldn’t you opt for a bit of beach-reading escapism? • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist and senior economics commentator"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/14/trudie-styler-i-asked-sting-can-you-do-a-five-note-dirge-for-us","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T12:00:46Z","webTitle":"'I was called Scarface at school': Trudie Styler on her teen drama directorial debut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/14/trudie-styler-i-asked-sting-can-you-do-a-five-note-dirge-for-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/14/trudie-styler-i-asked-sting-can-you-do-a-five-note-dirge-for-us","fields":{"headline":"'I was called Scarface at school': Trudie Styler on her teen drama directorial debut","bodyText":"It’s early on a Tuesday morning. A car pulls up outside a north London members’ club. “Trudie is arriving!” someone calls. A small delegation goes out on to the pavement to meet her. “Trudie” is Trudie Styler. In a black beret with a little star on the front, the 64-year-old resembles an upmarket Wolfie Smith. The website of her film production company, Maven Pictures, tells us that she is “an award-winning and prolific film producer, director, environmentalist, human rights activist and Unicef ambassador”. She also has everyone’s personal number and has homes everywhere and is married to Sting and, no, we are not here to discuss their extended tantric sex sessions in which climax can be delayed for up to three weeks, or until the next fiscal year, whichever arrives sooner. We are meeting because she has directed her first feature film – Freak Show, a high-school comedy-drama about difference, individuality and self-expression – and we have to get this in the bag over breakfast because the film’s lead, Alex Lawther, needs to dash straight to rehearsals for the West End transfer of his Calais-set play The Jungle, and Styler has a flight to catch. Off anywhere nice? “I’m going to Dublin for Sting’s musical, The Last Ship, and then I’m going on to the French Open.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu6eGixWiaU In wanders Lawther, the 23-year-old star of The Imitation Game, Ghost Stories and the Netflix hit The End of the Fucking World. In a checked shirt and glasses, running a hand blearily across his bedhead, he could pass for a young Morrissey. He falls into Styler’s arms and their embrace lasts so long that I start to feel like a gooseberry. “Trudie has something special,” he says once we have convened upstairs around a wobbly table in an empty room. “It’s because she’s a performer herself. She can talk to an actor, which is a vital thing that a lot of directors don’t always know how to do. They’re a bit frightened of actors. Whereas – and this sounds very nebulous – I felt almost as if Trudie was as much a part of playing Billy as I was.” That’s Billy Bloom, the flamboyantly queer 17-year-old hero of Freak Show, who is raised and then abandoned by his highly theatrical mother and cast adrift at a Texas school where his classmates don’t take kindly to his wardrobe. One day he’s sashaying down the corridor as Marilyn Monroe, the next he’s a bloody-eyed, chalky-faced bride of death, complete with train trailing in his wake. When the taunts and abuse become a regular occurrence, he adapts his outfits accordingly: ski goggles, or a beekeeper’s veil, provide some defence against the missiles and spit-balls. Lawther particularly enjoyed dressing up as Zelda Fitzgerald and Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction. “Anything where there was a literary or filmic inheritance was fun. And the mermaid was … interesting.” That mermaid get-up has it all: turquoise hair, marine sequins around the eyes, bubbles emanating from an unspecified outlet to the rear. “It’s a bubble machine, Ryan!” Styler says, mock-sternly. “You do actually see it, if you go back and look.” Were we not meant to assume the bubbles were coming out of his bum? “No!” she exclaims in horror. “That hadn’t occurred to me,” Lawther says. “I quite like that.” Did he take any costumes as souvenirs? “Trudie kindly gave me the Adam Ant-style pirate jacket and the orange Vivienne Westwood shirt.” “They’ll be hard to wear as a civvy,” she points out. I ask her if Sting brought home the unforgettable winged posing-pouch that he wore in Dune. “I haven’t seen it if he did,” she laughs; it’s fair to say we all seem a bit disappointed by that. Styler has been producing and executive-producing movies for decades, everything from Moon to Snatch to American Honey. What surprises did she encounter now that she is a feature film-maker herself? “The biggest one was that I was doing it at all. We had a director, but he quit for personal reasons.” Who was that? “I’d rather not say.” (I ask the PR later. “I don’t have that information,” she says.) Having put a year of preparation into the film, Styler offered to take the reins. “Everyone was enthusiastic about that, so it meant: ‘OK. Now I’m in. Let’s go. Whoah!’” The “whoah” turns out to be a reaction to the table lurching sideways, almost upsetting Styler’s coffee, but it seems appropriate under the circumstances. Along with the original director went the actor playing Billy’s mother, so Styler entreated her Central Park West neighbour Bette Midler to step in. “I wanted to use actors who championed diversity in real life and Bette has been a lifelong activist.” John McEnroe, who recently pilloried his fellow tennis veteran Margaret Court for her homophobia, plays Billy’s PE coach. “He’s a great improviser,” says Lawther, “though we had to calm him down on the swearing sometimes.” Styler was already chums with McEnroe. Who would have guessed? We should probably take it as read that she knows everyone. “I don’t know everyone!” she protests unconvincingly. Maybe not. But the “thank yous” in the end credits go on for quite some time. (Darren Aronofsky, Cary Fukunaga, Paul Haggis and Steven Zaillian all gave her notes after early screenings.) And let’s not forget it was she who introduced Guy Ritchie to Madonna. She also introduced Guy Ritchie to a film career, which is harder to forgive. It’s understandable that she has found a small part in Freak Show for her own daughter, Mickey Sumner, who was so impressive as Greta Gerwig’s flinty best friend in Frances Ha, as well as room on the soundtrack for songs by another daughter, the musician Eliot Sumner. And yet there’s no role for Styler’s husband, despite a full acting CV that includes Quadrophenia and Plenty. Where is thy Sting? “It’s true. He’s not in it. But he did give us five notes for the dirge that’s playing when Billy dresses as Zelda. We didn’t have a composer at that point and I needed something for Alex to perform to on set. So I said to Sting: ‘Can you do a five-note dirge for me?’ He said: ‘Are you being serious?’ I said: ‘Yes, and I’m leaving in five minutes.’ So he went to the piano and just … did something.” When Billy is advised in the film to “tone it down”, the phrase seems to inflame his extravagance, and soon he is putting himself forward as homecoming queen. But there’s something quite alienating in the movie about the money he has at his disposal. Would the story not have worked just as well if he was not a child of fabulous and limitless wealth, with the means to conjure an entire Mardi Gras parade on the sports field? “The film is about a kid who you think has everything,” Styler says. “Yes, he lives in a big, posh house, but big posh houses can be like mausoleums. The opulence is there, you see it, but it isn’t felt or celebrated. It doesn’t matter how rich you are. If you’re not happy, you’re not happy.” As well as being rich, it is also notable that Billy is virtually sexless, save for a bit of innocuous mooning over a soccer jock. Even the recent, candy-coloured Love, Simon ended in a full-on gay snog. Why no action for Billy? “I think he’s dealing with a lot,” Styler says. “His mum infantilised and then abandoned him, and he’s got all this trouble at his new school, so we don’t even get a chance to see how sexual a being he would be under other circumstances. He’s too busy practising his speeches and trying to be a better orator.” Freak Show may have a millionaire hero who never does anything more lustful than flutter his eyelashes, but it may provide some succour to viewers going through the sort of victimisation that Billy endures. “We all feel like we’re freaks at school,” Styler says. “You don’t feel pretty or clever enough. Nothing is comfortable until college, when you can finally be as weird as you want.” Is it different for children growing up now? “I’m not sure,” says Lawther. “When I was Billy’s age, the conversations I was having with my friends weren’t nearly as advanced or complicated as the ones I hear today between young people. I find their understanding of gender and queerness, and the politics behind that, quite daunting and thrilling.” “Sting and I have six children between us,” Styler points out, “and they’ve all been through similar things.” So the language changes but the experience doesn’t? “I think so. I had a tough time at school. I had vivid scars from a road accident when I was younger. I had a friend called Vivian who had a birthmark all over her face so she was called Beetroot and I was Scarface. The bullying got so bad that my mum took a lunchtime job at my school so she could keep an eye on me. No one was going to screw with this 20-stone dinner lady!” The film builds up to its own slogan: “Let your freak flag fly.” It’s a bit of a tongue-twister. What does it mean? “Everyone has a freak flag inside them,” Lawther says. “Whether they’re brave enough to show it is another matter. It’s about finding an individual honesty. At the start of the film, Billy is dressing for other people, to provoke or attack or just as a defence mechanism. Then he finds this inner honesty, which means he can let people in.” He looks faintly apologetic. “Is that a bit highfalutin for nine o’clock in the morning?” Freak Show is released on 22 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2020/apr/29/bollywood-star-irrfan-khan-dies-aged-53","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2020-04-29T07:02:31Z","webTitle":"Irrfan Khan dies aged 53","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/29/bollywood-star-irrfan-khan-dies-aged-53","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2020/apr/29/bollywood-star-irrfan-khan-dies-aged-53","fields":{"headline":"Irrfan Khan dies aged 53","bodyText":"Irrfan Khan, one of Bollywood’s most beloved stars who had achieved considerable success in the west, has died aged 53. He had been admitted to the intensive care unit of Mumbai’s Kokilaben hospital on Tuesday with a colon infection and on Wednesday morning a statement was released confirming his death. “It’s saddening that this day, we have to bring forward the news of him passing away,” read the statement. “Irrfan was a strong soul, someone who fought till the very end and always inspired everyone who came close to him.” Despite his status as one of Bollywood’s most celebrated actors, Khan had a reputation for modesty and integrity and news of his death sent India into mourning, prompting actors, fans and politicians from across the world to express their sadness at his death. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said that Khan’s demise was “a loss to the world of cinema and theatre. He will be remembered for his versatile performances across different mediums. My thoughts are with his family, friends and admirers. May his soul rest in peace.” Fellow Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan said Khan’s death left a “huge vacuum”. “An incredible talent, a gracious colleague, a prolific contributor to the world of cinema … left us too soon,” tweeted Bachchan. “The charisma you brought to everything you did was pure magic,” tweeted Priyanka Chopra. “Your talent forged the way for so many in so many avenues. You inspired so many of us. Irrfan Khan you will truly be missed. Condolences to the family.” Indian politician Rahul Gandhi described Khan as a “versatile and talented actor” who would be “greatly missed” while Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said India had lost “one of the most exceptional actors of our time.” In March 2018, Khan revealed he had been diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour, but after extensive treatment he recovered well enough to shoot Angrezi Medium, the film that would turn out to be his last, and whose release this March was cut short because of the coronavirus pandemic. Best known to English-speaking audiences as the police inspector in Slumdog Millionaire and for his roles in Jurassic World and Life of Pi, Khan was a Bollywood mainstay, acting in hits such as Haider, Piku and Hindi Medium. “I always object to the word Bollywood,” he told the Guardian in 2013. “I don’t think it’s fair to have that name. Because that industry has its own technique, its own way of making films that has nothing to do with aping Hollywood. It originates in Parsi theatre.” Khan was born Saahabzaade Irfan Ali Khan in Jaipur in 1966, the son of a tyre seller, and went to drama school after failing as a cricketer. He struggled to make headway in the film industry, despite being cast in a small role as a letter writer in Mira Nair’s 1988 Salaam Bombay! – to his frustration he only managed to find regular work in low-grade TV soap operas. “I came into this industry to tell stories and do cinema and I was stuck in television,” he told the Guardian. Khan’s breakthrough role came from an unlikely source: the feature debut of then-unknown British director Asif Kapadia, whose low budget samurai-esque tale, The Warrior, was shot in India. Released in 2002, The Warrior was selected for the prestigious San Sebastián film festival and won the Bafta award for best British film. Khan subsequently broke into mainstream Indian films, often playing cops or villains – including the title role of Maqbool, an adaptation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth set in the Mumbai underworld. More orthodox Bollywood productions followed, such as Rog and the slice-of-life musical Life in a … Metro. Khan also maintained a parallel career in British-American cinema: he played the chief of police in Michael Winterbottom’s A Mighty Heart, and another police officer in Slumdog Millionaire, which won eight Oscars. In later roles, he became a reliable standby character actor in big-budget Hollywood films, playing a doctor in The Amazing Spider-Man in 2012 and businessmen in Jurassic World (2015) and Inferno (2016). In 2012, he also played the adult version of the lead character in another Oscar-winner: Life of Pi, directed by Ang Lee. Director Wes Anderson said he specifically wrote a small role for Khan in his film The Darjeeling Limited just so they could work together. Meanwhile, Khan found box-office success with the Indian-produced art film The Lunchbox, in which he played an accountant who strikes up a letter-writing romance with unhappy housewife Nimrat Kaur. Khan also continued his high Bollywood profile with significant roles in the Amitabh Bachchan comedy Piku and Hindi Medium, as a rich businessman trying to get his daughter into a good school. Khan is survived by his wife, Sutapa Sikdar, and sons Babil and Ayan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/23/country-diary-they-look-like-a-crowd-of-skinheads-frowning-in-long-grass","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T04:30:00Z","webTitle":"Country diary: they look like a crowd of skinheads frowning in long grass","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/23/country-diary-they-look-like-a-crowd-of-skinheads-frowning-in-long-grass","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/23/country-diary-they-look-like-a-crowd-of-skinheads-frowning-in-long-grass","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: they look like a crowd of skinheads frowning in long grass","bodyText":"I wonder if they’re aware of the colossal creature approaching. Do they sense its lumbering footfalls? Do the walls tremble, or the avenues and galleries of their metropolis deform perceptibly under its weight? Can they sense its extravagant metabolic heat? The mounds that pimple this sloping pasture are silent. The sheep were taken off a week or two back, but there’s been virtually no rain, so the turf tops remain cropped and dry – they look like a crowd of skinheads frowning into the longer grass around, some with tiaras of speedwell. Each tump is tall enough to escape winter waterlogging and, coincidentally, the perfect height for sitting on. If the residents object to me perching on their home like some mammal Godzilla, they don’t show it. If this were a wood ant nest, my imposition would be the subject of teeming, acidic fury. But these are Lasius flavus, yellow meadow ants. They’re peaceable homebodies, shunners of light. The only sign of recent activity is a sprinkling of soil particles in the thatch of every hill, each the measure of an ant mouthful. It’s going to take a bit of destruction to rouse them, and I scrape tentatively at the side of the hump. The soil crumbles as I break into a labyrinth of tunnels. It’s unkind of me, but I have a Country diary to write. Like all ants, yellow meadows are solidly socialist. A straggle of workers emerge – six, a dozen, 30 – all daughters of the queen. But their movements suggest curiosity rather than outrage – they bumble this way and that, antennae waggling. They range considerably in size, some only 2mm long, the largest about half a centimetre. They’re the colour of golden syrup and, close up, decidedly cute. Their eyes are microscopic and seldom used – as a rule they work in the dark, tending herds of subterranean aphids plugged into the roots of grass, their husbandry practised by scent and touch – stroking, cleaning, milking honeydew. These tiny farmers have probably never seen sunlight before, but they don’t linger. There are aphids to milk, larvae to feed, tunnels to dig. A minute later, they’re gone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jun/13/trevor-noah-kim-trump-summit-freddy-kruger-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T13:27:07Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah: Trump endorsed 'the Freddy Krueger of human rights'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jun/13/trevor-noah-kim-trump-summit-freddy-kruger-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jun/13/trevor-noah-kim-trump-summit-freddy-kruger-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah: Trump endorsed 'the Freddy Krueger of human rights'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Tuesday discussed the historic summit in Singapore between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Trevor Noah Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah gave credit where it was due for the summit. “Before we start we’ve all got to admit that we were wrong,” he said. “We said the man couldn’t do it. We said his temper would blow up the summit. But yesterday he proved everyone wrong and turned the nuclear summit in Singapore into a huge win for himself. So let’s swallow our pride and give it up for a leader who’s much smarter than we thought: Kim Jong-un, everybody!” Noah, who said, the summit “belonged to Lil’ Kim,”, went on: “People are screaming for a brutal tyrant like he’s the newest member of BTS. Even Kim Jong-un is probably surprised by this reaction. He’s like, ‘I’m used to screaming, but not happy screaming!’” “It turns out Kim’s biggest admirer wasn’t in those crowds outside,” the host said. “Fanboy number one was right there at the summit.” In footage from the photo op staged between the two leaders, Trump can be heard shaking Kim’s hand and saying it is his “great honor” to meet him. “Yes, you heard that right,” Noah said. “President Trump said meeting Kim Jong-un was his great honor. This alone is what North Korea has been pining for for decades: equal standing with the American president, shaking hands, their flags side by side.” He continued: “Donald Trump flew across the world to Singapore and all he got was Kim Jong-un saying, ‘I’ll think about giving up my nukes.’ They could’ve done it over text. And while Kim gave up nothing major, he got the American president to give up a lot more.” Trump, Noah explained, agreed to halt joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, a concession that took South Korean diplomats by surprise. “I’m not saying President Trump shouldn’t have negotiated with Kim Jong-un at all,” Noah said. “But there’s a big gap between being civil with the person and endorsing the Freddy Krueger of human rights.” Stephen Colbert The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert also chimed in on the summit. “Today we all woke up in a different world, because late last night yesterday morning Donald Trump held his long-awaited summit with North Korean dictator and stuffed animal of himself, Kim Jong-un,” said Stephen Colbert. “And from the beginning, Donald Trump signaled he was serious about peace because he didn’t greet Kim with his normal alpha-male hand battle.” In Singapore, Colbert added, the two shared a lunch where “Korean stuffed cucumber” was on the menu. “Well, there’s your headline,” the host joked. “Trump ate a vegetable. “The two leaders got along great. Trump even showed Kim the inside of his Cadillac,” he continued, impersonating the president negotiating with the North Korean dictator. “What’s it gonna take to talk you out of your nukes and into this Cadillac? “Then the moment came that the world was waiting for, the signing of the histor-ish agreement,” he said. “And the reviews are in.” Colbert then cut to news coverage of the agreement signed by Trump and Kim, which was hailed as a victory by the US president and criticized as weak and inconsequential by others. “Here’s the deal,” Colbert said. “Kim got US security guarantees, but in exchange he agreed to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but that was just reaffirming an earlier agreement he already had with South Korea. “You have to promise more than Kim did when you sign the iTunes user agreement, and I’m not making that up,” the host added, before reading aloud Apple’s terms and conditions. “Apple makes you agree to not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.” Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel also addressed the summit, beginning: “Our president, Donald Trump, met with his favorite little rocket man Kim Jong-un. “A lot of pundits think it was a mistake to meet with an unstable dictator,” Kimmel joked, “but Kim Jong-un said, ‘You know what, I’m going to do it anyway.’ “The closest thing I can compare it to is when Scooby-doo met the Harlem Globetrotters,” the host quipped. “According to the president, it all went very well. Trump said that he and Kim Jong-un, after 38 minutes of meeting, developed what he called a special bond. That’s fast. His dentures take longer to bond.” Kimmel then noted that Trump claimed Kim Jong-un committed to destroy a major missile testing site, but didn’t include it in the signed agreement “because we didn’t have time”. “In fact, the president invited him to the White House, which is crazy when you consider he hasn’t even invited the WNBA champions to the White House and they’ve killed a lot fewer people. “I don’t know what the real backstory is, but I know the whole thing,” Kimmel said. “Trump wanted to make it look like he did something big, whether he did something big or not. He was not leaving this summit without claiming he made a deal. He sets the meeting, he has the sit-down, he hears what he wants to hear. As soon as the meeting is over he runs out, calls a press conference, declares victory, everyone goes home. Kim Jong-un does nothing differently at all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/13/what-paddleboarding-through-plastic-taught-me-about-our-disposables-problem","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T14:49:50Z","webTitle":"My daughter and I paddled 22 miles, picking up plastic.

Here’s what we found","bodyText":"One My Little Pony, two crabbing buckets, five balloons, six balls, seven straws, nine shoes, a dozen coffee cups, 20 carrier bags, 205 plastic bottles and lids, polystyrene and a huge amount of rope. That is just a fraction of what my six-year-old daughter, Ella, and I collected over the course of two days last weekend, as we paddleboarded around the Salcombe-Kingsbridge estuary in south Devon, scouring the foreshores of every creek and cove for 22 miles. Within seconds of setting off from South Sands beach by the mouth of the estuary, we spotted a clear plastic carrier bag floating in the shallows. Marine wildlife could easily have mistaken it for a jellyfish. Ella grabbed it with a litter picker as we paddled past. Generally, the popular sandy beaches were fairly clear of rubbish. It was further up into the estuary where we were caught by surprise. Tucked under the overhanging treeline, out of sight of tourists, we found a tranche of litter tangled in seaweed: a wheel, a wooden ladder, piping, broken glass and a stranded plastic toy dolphin. There were thousands of short strands of rope and layer upon layer of multicoloured bottle tops and shotgun cartridges among the sand and the seaweed at West Charleton, driven here by prevailing winds. Every time Ella picked up a cotton bud, I thought of Justin Hofman’s striking shot of an Indonesian seahorse swimming along, its tail wrapped around one. We set out on the paddle to raise awareness about microplastics, highlight hotspots in the estuary and involve local schools and community groups in beach cleanups. More than 150 people got involved, including 30 of Ella’s classmates, who met us in their school uniforms for a mucky beach clean at the end of Batson Creek. Each year, more than 8m tonnes of plastic enters our seas. It has been estimated that 100,000 marine mammals and turtles and 1m seabirds die annually as a result of entanglement or suffocation caused by plastic debris – think of the pilot whale in Thailand that died earlier this month after swallowing 80 plastic bags, or the Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Island fed regurgitated plastic by their well-meaning parents, their stomachs filling up with items as big as inkjet cartridges. About 60% of plastic is single-use, thrown away after being useful for only a few moments. In the past 10 years, humans have produced more plastic than during the previous century. My family and I love being by the sea in Salcombe, boating, swimming, building sandcastles and exploring the creeks. The estuary is classified as a local nature reserve and it sits within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Without a river feeding into it – the naturally sheltered harbour is a tidal inlet filled by many small streams – Salcombe is technically a “ria”, or drowned valley. In the sandy shallows, the eelgrass beds are a hotspot for breeding seahorses, while dolphins, porpoises and basking sharks swim close by in the summer months and grey seals bob about in the quieter winter months. Twice a day, at low tide, the nutrient-rich exposed mudflats become a haven for wading birds such as the curlew, with its distinctive curved bill, little egrets, which nest in the trees along the water’s edge, and shelducks, which burrow in disused rabbit holes up the creeks. Beneath the surface, rocks and pontoons teem with life – bright-red beadlet anemones, corals, sponges and fish, scallops and spider crabs – and North Sands and South Sands are rockpooling paradises on a low spring tide. But plastic pollution is ubiquitous. Microplastics have been discovered in one-third of UK-landed fish, in mussels sampled from around the British coast, in sea salt and tap water – even in bottled drinking water. Plastic has been found in deep-sea trenches and Arctic ice sheets. Personally, the madness truly hit home when I found a sealed plastic packet of smoked salmon floating in Salcombe estuary a few years ago. I became increasingly concerned by the fragments of plastic and polystyrene we would find caught up in the seaweed along the tideline, but this journey began properly last summer, when I came across Kids Against Plastic, a national movement set up by two sisters. “It’s an environmental disaster that we’re all growing up experiencing,” says 14-year-old Amy Meek. Ella Meek, 12, explains the “Plastic Clever” mindset: “We aren’t forcing people to be plastic free; that’s almost impossible. That’s why we want people to be Plastic Clever: a simpler, easier and more effective way of using less plastic. It involves cutting out unnecessary plastic, avoiding the big four polluters – plastic cups and lids, straws, bottles and carrier bags – and choosing reusables instead.” Millions of these plastic items are used fleetingly, but stay in our environment for centuries. By providing alternatives to throwaway plastic items and encouraging customers to commit to reusable options, cafes, hotels, restaurants and pubs can achieve Plastic Clever status. Like the Meek sisters, we felt overwhelmed at the sheer scale of plastic pollution and felt compelled to try to improve things on our home patch by cutting down on disposable plastics at source. Our hope is to encourage the 90 or so businesses in Salcombe to adopt the Plastic Clever mindset and put the area on the map for the best possible reason – as a leading example of successful and effective ecotourism. Wherever you live in the UK, you are never more than 70 miles from the coast. We are all connected to the ocean via our rivers, waterways and canals, so we share a responsibility to stop this flow of plastic into the sea. Plastic is not inherently bad, but our throwaway use of it, driven by a widespread, commercially driven thirst for consumption, is not sustainable. This message was echoed in the plastic we found repeatedly along our 22-mile paddle and in the conversations we had with fellow paddlers. Stand-up paddleboard champion Marie Buchanan was shocked by the scale of the plastic pollution we saw at West Charleton marsh, halfway up the estuary between Salcombe and Kingsbridge. Buchanan trains every day on these waters, but normally she speeds past the beaches: “It felt very different to paddle slowly with a different purpose and I was amazed by how much rope and plastic litter has accumulated along the tideline here, among the seaweed. Before now, I just hadn’t stopped to notice.” Beach cleanups may not be the solution, but the experiences they offer are eye-opening and transformative. While we found huge, old pontoons full of polystyrene in need of proper disposal, condoms and a sanitary towel on our journey, we also saw a cuttlefish swim past, goslings poking their fluffy heads above the reeds, comb jellies floating beneath the surface and a wise-looking grey heron take flight.

The UK consumes 3.3m tonnes of plastic annually, the report says, but exports two-thirds to be recycled. It is only able to recycle 9% domestically. Measures including increased taxes on products made with virgin plastic, and mandatory targets for using recycled plastic in packaging, could encourage an additional 2m tonnes of plastic to be recycled in the UK, the report from Green Alliance said. The analysis said simply collecting plastic and sending it abroad for recycling does not solve the problem of the global scourge of plastic pollution. “The UK does not have an adequate system to capture, recycle and re-use plastic materials,” the report said. It recommends three new measures to ensure more plastic is recovered in the UK and used as raw material in manufacturing. These are: Mandatory recycled content requirements for all plastic products and packaging; Short-term support to kickstart the plastic reprocessing market; and a fund to stabilise the market for companies investing in recycling plastic domestically. Green Alliance produced the report for a group of businesses that have formed a circular economy taskforce. Peter Maddox, director of Wrap UK, said the UK had to take more responsibility for its own waste. “Our mission is to create a world where resources are used sustainably. To make this happen in the UK, we need to design circular systems for plastics and other materials that are sustainable both economically and environmentally. This will require some fundamental changes from all of us.” The report said government action is necessary to create and support a secondary plastic market in the UK. “The government is uniquely placed to address the market failures that have led to unnecessary reliance on virgin materials to the detriment of the environment, industry and the economy.” UK businesses including supermarkets recently signed up to a pact to cut plastic. But voluntary pacts were not enough, the report said, and government action was needed. “A secondary plastic market ... could recycle an additional 2m tonnes in the UK and fulfil 71% of UK manufacturing’s raw material demand ... Voluntary initiatives like the UK plastic pact ... only thrive when supported by a credible prospect of government regulation if industry does not deliver.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/13/new-look-fast-fashion-high-price-low-cost","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T16:28:06Z","webTitle":"The high price of New Look’s low-cost strategy | Lucy Siegle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/13/new-look-fast-fashion-high-price-low-cost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/13/new-look-fast-fashion-high-price-low-cost","fields":{"headline":"The high price of New Look’s low-cost strategy","bodyText":"The refrain coming from the “fast fashion” retailer New Look reminds me of that Chumbawamba song from the 1990s. They get knocked down but they get up again (repeat ad infinitum). The brand has gone into a form of insolvency called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), shuttering 60 stores and losing 980 staff. Its leadership also pinpointed where things all went so horribly wrong. Bewitched by an “edgier, fashion-forward consumer”, it lost sight of its “heartland” (presumably non-edgy, non-fashionable consumer). In the world of fast fashion, providing the wrong product to the wrong consumer and forgetting your roots is a cardinal sin. But there’s no need to worry because yesterday New Look announced that 80% of its inventory will be flogged off at under £20 in an attempt to reclaim that heartland and a return to its value proposition. (This leaves me intrigued by the remaining 20% of stock.) Of course New Look is not alone. House of Fraser is also pursuing a CVA, Next has had a shocker and H&amp;M had to confess to $4.3bn of unsold clothes. This is presumably too much inventory to be dealt with even by the energy-from-waste plant in H&amp;M’s home town of Västerås in Sweden that is partly powered by burning fashion waste. Now some rational people might point out that when your system involves needing to burn clothing, your system is sick and you might want to change it. But not fast fashion. As woes emerge, fast-fashion brands are inclined to explain just how tough their mission is. To provide super-cheap, on-trend clothing they must outsource to factories in textile hotspots (such as Bangladesh) that can provide low-cost labour. But these are far away, exposing brands to longer delivery times. Have you all got your tiny violins ready? If they miss the window to sell then they have to be discounted, reducing margin. Meanwhile, we consumers demand the new product in store at least once a week. Otherwise we will flounce out and take our fashion pounds online, snapping up clothing from the likes of Boohoo and Prettylittlethings, heavily endorsed by celebrities. In short, the beleaguered brands seem to be saying that this fast-fashion model is killing them. Um, too bad – they invented it in the first place. The fast-fashion barons have grown rich on this model, despite the margins. They moan about risk, but from the outset it’s been clear who really shoulders it. As I wrote about in my 2011 book, To Die For, the pressure of this model is felt most keenly by the garment workers at the pinch point of production: the cut, make and trim facilities – typically outsourced to hubs such as Dhaka in Bangladesh. At this point the scramble for margin and the lack of investment in standardised facilities combine with the relentless pressure of getting giant orders out for volume retailers in the west. The impact of this is devastating, as we saw with the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in Dhaka in 2013, when 1,335 garment workers were killed. The fact that Rana Plaza did not prompt a moratorium on fast fashion tells you everything you need to know about where the balance of power sits. Brands can still dictate their terms. Even adding safety measures such as fire escapes in host factories must be paid for by increased volume of production. From New Look’s perspective, it has done everything it can to keep the engine going, even bringing some of its production back to the UK in order to turn designs around more quickly. Unfortunately it got its fingers burned when TS Knitwear (the Leicester factory with which New Look placed an order) was discovered by a Channel 4 documentary team working for Dispatches to be subcontracting to a supplier that paid garment workers in the UK £3 an hour. New Look said it had no knowledge of this. But we know that ethical scandals don’t really hit sales, so why did it go so wrong? The financial press points to an accounting scandal at South African retail giant Steinhoff, owned by Christo Wiese, who bought the brand in 2015 (he stepped down as a New Look director last month). It seems that the complex financial underpinning of the deal has unravelled. But there is also the possibility (never entertained by the industry) that consumers have consumption fatigue. More than 100bn new garments a year are now thrust on to the global market. Many are designed and made so that they are quasi-disposable, treated very much as a perishable product. Increasingly they are interchangeable. New Look’s new narrative doesn’t entertain this sort of chat. Instead it contains the traditional bounce-back ingredients: parachuting in a former executive who used to run the brand in the heady days when it was the UK’s number 2 retailer; and trumpeting clothes under £20. All, the brand says, in the service of long-term profitability. Herein lies the problem. Fast fashion is built to maximise profit for a select few, and churn out a huge volume of cheap clothing. Its vision, characteristics and need to expand and conquer means there is no long term. • Lucy Siegle is a journalist who writes about ethical living"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/14/login-with-snapchat-takes-cold-war-with-facebook-to-next-level","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T13:00:48Z","webTitle":"'Login with Snapchat' takes cold war with Facebook to next level","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/14/login-with-snapchat-takes-cold-war-with-facebook-to-next-level","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/14/login-with-snapchat-takes-cold-war-with-facebook-to-next-level","fields":{"headline":"'Login with Snapchat' takes cold war with Facebook to next level","bodyText":"Snapchat users will be able to use their account on the messaging service to log in to other apps, export their bitmoji and post information from elsewhere direct in the Snapchat app, as the company makes its most aggressive attempt yet to capitalise on Facebook’s woes. The new features, collectively called “Snap Kit”, offer a set of tools that developers can incorporate into their own apps. The Creative Kit feature is about getting content into Snapchat: similar to an earlier integration with Uber, it lets apps create personalised filters, stickers and lenses that users can share on Snapchat. Food delivery service Postmates, for instance, will let users throw an ETA for their food onto a picture – to let their friends know to hurry up. Similarly, the Bitmoji Kit lets users take the personalised caricatures that have become one of Snapchat’s core features and post them in other apps, with Tinder being one of the launch partners. But Login Kit sees the social messaging firm move into new territory, providing the sort of internet infrastructure more commonly the domain of large data-driven firms such as Google and Facebook. Users who log in using their Snapchat account will only share their snapchat username with the service – and, optionally, their bitmoji too. Everything else, such as biographical data, friend lists, and ad profiling, will stay with Snapchat, and if the login doesn’t get used for 90 days, the connection will be deleted entirely. In an interview, the company didn’t refer explicitly to its competitor, but made sure to emphasise the difference between their approaches. “Privacy and security have really been at the centre of everything we’ve done through out the lifetime of the company,” said Jacob Andreou, a Snap vice-president. “This isn’t even something that’s just the product of the recent changes in the climate.” Ultimately, he said, the company was motivated to produce the features because “it didn’t look like there were a lot of great options for our users as they use other services.” Katherine Tassi, the company’s deputy general counsel, added another coded swipe: Snap will directly vet any app that wants to sign up, requiring a human review and approval process. What’s more, she added: “We’re building privacy into the design of these developer toolkits from the start.” Snap, she said, takes the view that it isn’t enough to simply rely on privacy policies, when the best way to secure user data is to simply not share it – or even have it – in the first place. The new features are just the latest volley in the ongoing war between Snapchat and Facebook. Recently, Snap has gone on the offensive, with its chief executive, Evan Spiegel, quipping last month, in relation to the Cambridge Analytica scandal: “We would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/13/eight-members-of-oxford-grooming-ring-jailed-for-sexual-assault","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T15:13:22Z","webTitle":"Eight members of Oxford grooming ring jailed for sexual assault","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/eight-members-of-oxford-grooming-ring-jailed-for-sexual-assault","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/eight-members-of-oxford-grooming-ring-jailed-for-sexual-assault","fields":{"headline":"Eight members of Oxford grooming ring jailed for sexual assault","bodyText":"Eight members of a “predatory and cynical” gang have been jailed for grooming and sexually assaulting vulnerable girls as young as 13 in Oxford over a seven-year period. The men plied five victims with alcohol and drugs and groomed them using flattery and by giving them a sense of belonging by the gang. They raped and indecently assaulted the girls in cars, especially a Nissan Serena people carrier, in laybys, parks and guest houses, Oxford crown court was told. One of the victims said of the people carrier: “They would pick the girls, have sex with them, and dump them. Everything happened in that Serena.” The same victim said the men would take it in turns to have sex with her and gang rapes would take place after she was intoxicated with drink and drugs. Another said she still struggled to sleep and had problems maintaining relationships. Following the sentencing hearing, the home secretary Sajid Javid said: “As a father myself, I am glad this barbaric group of men is finally behind bars. Justice has been done and they no longer pose a threat to society, or the young girls they preyed on. “As the home secretary, I will do all in my power to leave the callous cowards who groom and sexually abuse children with no place to hide.” The men were all caught as part of Operation Silk, a Thames Valley police investigation into non-recent child sexual exploitation in Oxford. The offences took place between 1998 and 2005, when the victims were aged between 13 and 17. Oliver Saxby QC, prosecuting, called the abuse “routine, cynical and predatory sexual exploitation”. Sentencing them, judge Peter Ross described the gang as sinister and said the girls had been made to feel worthless. He told the offenders: “The victims were all vulnerable teenagers. They were brought into the group, of which the defendants were part, through flattery, making them feel a sense of belonging, and the provision of alcohol and drugs. “And the consequence was that sexual abuse of these girls became the norm. It is clear that there were hundreds of episodes of sexual abuse. The impact on the victims of these offences has been shattering.” Praising the women for giving evidence, a spokesman for the children’s charity NSPCC said: “The courageous victims of this vile abuse would not be silenced despite a campaign of fear and violence as they suffered manipulation and assaults by multiple men as young girls. “Instead they bravely faced these despicable men in court, helping to convict them and ultimately locking them up where they belong. “Abuse is never the fault of the victim, but sadly child sexual exploitation is an all too often hidden crime. It is up to all of us to be aware of the signs of a young person’s distress and be responsible enough to act on any concerns without hesitation.” DS Nicola Douglas, said: “I would like to say a huge thank you to the victims who have all demonstrated such courage and bravery throughout the investigation and during the trial. “Without these women telling their stories, perpetrators who exploit and commit serious sexual offences against some of the most vulnerable children and young adults in our communities will remain hidden, unpunished and free to do more harm.” Adrian Foster, chief crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, said: “These cases are, in effect, organised crime, and we approached this case in the same way we would approach any organised crime case by making connections, and building an understanding of criminal networks.” Assad Hussain, 37, was jailed for life and told he would serve at least 12 years for rape, conspiracy to rape, and indecent assault. Moinul Islam, 41, was jailed for 15 years and nine months for rape, indecent assault and supplying a class A drug. Raheem Ahmed, 40, was jailed for 12 years and Kamran Khan, 36, for eight years. Both were convicted of false imprisonment and indecent assault. Khalid Hussain, 38, was jailed for 12 years for indecent assault and rape. Kameer Iqbal, 39, was also sentenced to 12 years for rape. Haji Khan, 38, was jailed for 10 years for conspiracy to rape, and Alladitta Yousaf, 48, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years for indecent assault.

Siman Povarenkin is entitled to residency in the UK, and eventual citizenship, through his wife Irina’s visa. She moved to Britain in 2013 with their two children after investing at least £2m. Povarenkin travels regularly from Moscow to visit his family. In November 2015 Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, introduced Povarenkin to Banks, the Brexit campaigner and Leave.EU donor. Banks had insisted his contacts with Yakovenko amounted to one “boozy six-hour lunch”. In fact, Banks had three meetings with the ambassador, two in the run up to the EU referendum. Yakovenko suggested Banks might be interested in investing in Povarenkin’s mining business. The deal could potentially have netted him billions of dollars, according to documents. Banks denied wrongdoing on Tuesday in a bad-tempered session with the culture, media and sport select committee. He said the deal did not happen. “I met with him [Povarenkin], I’m a businessman, why shouldn’t I?” Banks said, adding that he had “no business” in Russia. On 17 July 2016 Banks tweeted: “I am buying gold at the moment &amp; big mining stocks.” Povarenkin is a successful entrepreneur with top-level Kremlin contacts. According to people familiar with his business affairs, the state entity involved in the potential deal was Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank. Sberbank’s CEO is Herman Gref, an influential former economics minister. In 2013 Gref had dinner with Donald Trump during the Miss Universe beauty pageant in Moscow, which Sberbank co-sponsored. Trump “had a good attitude towards Russia”, Gref said afterwards. In 2014 the US imposed sanctions on Sberbank over Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The documents suggest further meetings and discussions took place between Povarenkin and Banks, after the initial introduction, including a trip by Banks to Moscow in February 2016, the Observer reported. Banks told CNN reports of the trip were not true. On 5 July 2016, less than two weeks after the referendum, Sberbank announced it was upping its stake in Povarenkin’s company GeoProMining, from 25.75% to 31.5%. Povarenkin became rich while still in his 20s, contemporaries say. One described him as a diminutive figure with long, dark curly hair. He speaks English well and with a strong Russian accent, they said. “He was a young and wealthy guy. It wasn’t very clear what the source of his wealth was. There were literally hundreds of such people in Russia during this period,” said one Moscow businessman who met him socially. Povarenkin was born in the Siberian city of Omsk. He later worked for the Moscow private equity company Industrial Investors Group. Its boss, Sergei Generalov, was a deputy in the state parliament and energy minister under Boris Yeltsin. Generalov is in turn close to Sergei Kiriyenko, Vladimir Putin’s chief of staff. Povarenkin’s home is a six-bedroom mansion in Gribovo, a village set amid pine forests seven miles (12km) west of central Moscow. The area is favoured by Russia’s political and business elite. One of his neighbours is Vladislav Surkov, a personal adviser to Putin. One person familiar with the Moscow business world said of Povarenkin: “He’s a typical ‘minigarch’ guy who managed to cobble together a bunch of assets, deploying the typical Russian means of doing it.” The person said Povarenkin had good krysha, from the Russian word for roof, meaning a powerful patron deep inside Russia’s ruling structures. “Who his krysha really is I don’t know,” the person said. Between 2005 and 2008 Povarenkin set up GeoProMining, buying gold mining enterprises in Armenia, Russia and Georgia. The purchase would have involved substantial borrowing. Like other businessmen, including Banks, Povarenkin makes extensive use of offshore vehicles. In 2013 Irina Povarenkin and the couple’s two children moved to London, according to legal documents. She was able to do so after buying a tier one investors’ visa, available to well-off foreigners who invest at least £2m in government bonds. Povarenkin is classed as his wife’s dependent. The Home Office is currently reviewing the status of about 700 Russians, including the Chelsea FC owner, Roman Abramovich, who made use of the scheme before rules were tightened in 2015. The review follows the poisoning in March of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer, and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury. In 2015 the Povarenkins purchased an £11.3m flat in Ebury Square in Belgravia, west London, documents show. Typically the gold tycoon spends about 70 days a year in the UK, flying in regularly from Moscow to see his family. Summers are spent at a luxury chateau in Normandy that was owned by the late Yves Saint Laurent. In February 2017 the oligarch flew to London to celebrate his wife and son’s birthdays. At Heathrow airport he was served with a writ from a disgruntled former business partner, Ruslan Bestolov. Bestolov alleges that Povarenkin owes him $7.5m (£5.6m), arising from two joint mine projects in the Russian republic of Yakutia. Povarenkin denies this. In 2017 the case went to the high court, when Bestolov successfully argued that the dispute should be heard in London and not Moscow. A judge ruled that Povarenkin had a “substantial connection” to the UK, in contrast to other Russian oligarchs such as Oleg Deripaska whose visits are more fleeting. It is unclear why Yakovenko introduced Povarenkin as a potential business partner for Banks, who gave £12m to the Brexit campaign, becoming the biggest political donor in UK history. The ambassador and the oligarch appear to have a good working relationship. In 2011 the pair visited the London Stock Exchange, together with a delegation from Yakutia. A Moscow financial source described Povarenkin’s international assets as “complicated”. Asked why he might have been interested in investment from Banks, they said: “Personal, state and business interests can all be combined in Russia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/13/italy-france-trade-insults-migration-row-boils-over","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T16:49:31Z","webTitle":"EU migration row boils over as Italy and France trade insults","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/italy-france-trade-insults-migration-row-boils-over","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/13/italy-france-trade-insults-migration-row-boils-over","fields":{"headline":"EU migration row boils over as Italy and France trade insults","bodyText":"France and Italy have traded insults, rifts have widened in Germany’s ruling coalition and Austria has called for an “axis of the willing” to take action as a simmering row over how Europe should handle irregular migration finally boiled over. Rejecting French criticism of its immigration policies, Italy summoned the French ambassador on Wednesday and cancelled a planned meeting between the Italian economy minister and his counterpart in Paris. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was reportedly considering postponing a visit to Paris on Friday for talks with Emmanuel Macron after the French president said Rome had acted with “cynicism and irresponsibility” in turning away a migrant rescue ship. Italy’s hardline new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said the country had “nothing to learn from anyone about generosity, voluntarism, welcoming and solidarity” and demanded a formal apology. Salvini, the leader of the far-right, anti-immigration League party, blocked the Aquarius from entering Italian ports this weekend, prompting an international outcry. The rescue vessel, which is carrying 629 migrants, was also refused by Malta and is now heading to Spain escorted by two Italian ships. The case has reopened one of the main unresolved faultlines in European politics: how to share responsibility for migrants trying to enter the bloc from conflict zones and poor countries, mainly across Africa and the Middle East. More than 1.8 million people have entered Europe irregularly since 2014 and Italy is currently sheltering 170,000 asylum seekers. Salvini’s League scored its best election result in March elections after pledging to deport an estimated 500,000 unregistered migrants. In Germany, the hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, pulled out of an integration summit hosted by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, saying Berlin should cooperate with Vienna and Rome in combating illegal immigration. Seehofer, of the Bavarian conservative CSU party, met Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. He declared his support for Kurz’s proposal for a three-way “axis of the willing” with Italy to fight illegal migration. Kurz, who leads a coalition government with the far-right Freedom party, said a growing number of European governments were now agreed on the need to curb uncontrolled migration and crack down on people trafficking. Seehofer told reporters he had spoken to Salvini, who also supported the proposed alliance. “Rome, Vienna and Berlin should work together at the interior minister level in the areas of security, fighting terrorism – and the core issue of immigration,” he said. “I accepted that … and we will push ahead with it.” Seehofer has put himself on a collision course with Merkel, his coalition ally, by pushing a tougher line on immigration, including a proposal as part of a new draft national “migrant masterplan” that Germany should turn away at the border migrants registered in other EU states. Merkel, who is working to pull together a Europe-wide deal on redistributing asylum seekers and find a more lasting solution to illegal migration involving enhanced controls along the European Union’s external border, has dismissed the plan as in breach of EU law. It would also represent a complete reversal of the open-doors migrant policy she adopted in 2015, which saw more than 1 million migrants enter Germany and which is seen as having fuelled a sharp rise in support for the rightwing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and caused deep rifts within her conservative bloc. With xenophobia on the rise across the continent, and hard-right parties either in government or riding high in the polls in countries from Italy in the south to Sweden on the north, immigration has become an issue of existential importance for the bloc. But member states remain deeply divided over burden-sharing plans aimed at warding off any repeat of the 2015-16 migration crisis, with “frontline” states like Italy, Greece and Spain complaining they are shouldering an unfair share of arrivals, wealthier destination countries such as Germany and the Netherlands arguing they have done enough, and hardline central European governments including Hungary and Poland flatly rejecting all compulsory refugee distribution schemes. Salvini, who said last week he would not allow Italy to become Europe’s “refugee camp”, told the Italian senate he was open to a possible “axis” with Germany and Austria, ahead of a key EU summit at the end of June that will consider possible changes to asylum law to better share the burden. “With my German and Austrian colleagues … we will propose a new [immigration] initiative,” Salvini said, adding that it would apply both to the EU’s external borders and to how member states manage migrants internally. But he demanded an apology from France, challenging Paris to take in the migrants it had promised to accept under an EU agreement and accusing it of turning back 10,000 at Italy’s northern border. He said France had committed to accepting 9,816 migrants under a 2015 EU redistribution scheme to relieve pressure on frontline countries, but in three years had accepted only 640 people. “So I ask President Macron to pass from words to action and tomorrow morning welcome the 9,816 France promised to welcome as a sign of concrete generosity and not just words,” he said. Conte called France’s approach to the migrant crisis hypocritical. Macron later appealed for the two sides not to “give in to emotions that certain people are manipulating”, insisting that France was “working hand in hand with Italy” to handle migration. A French foreign ministry spokeswoman said Paris was “fully aware of the burden migration pressure is placing on Italy”. Filippo Grandi, the head of the United Nations refugee agency, said the bitter dispute over which European country should take in the Aquarius vessel was “profoundly shameful”, but said more such incidents could be expected in the coming weeks as long as the bloc remained divided on its policies toward migrants and refugees. Aloys Vimard, the Médecins Sans Frontières project coordinator onboard the rescue ship, said there was an urgent need for “politicians to discuss this, and for the EU to find a dignified solution for these vulnerable people. We are very, very concerned because political considerations are being prioritised over the safety of vulnerable people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/13/sticking-up-for-sex-workers-draws-mixed-responses","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T16:44:16Z","webTitle":"Sticking up for sex workers draws mixed responses | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/13/sticking-up-for-sex-workers-draws-mixed-responses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/13/sticking-up-for-sex-workers-draws-mixed-responses","fields":{"headline":"Sticking up for sex workers draws mixed responses","bodyText":"Neville Southall’s compassionate, commonsense support for sex workers (‘I’ve got a bit of flak because I stick up for sex workers’, 5 June) is much needed at this time. He points out the absurdity of accusing someone of supporting trafficking because they “stick up for sex workers”. Shame so few politicians listen. The recent “pop-up brothel” inquiry by an all-party parliamentary group ignored evidence from current sex workers and recommended increased criminalisation using speculation and unsubstantiated data about trafficking as justification. Meanwhile police crackdowns against sex workers continue. When we report rape and other violence the police do little or nothing – most of the time we are scared to come forward for fear of being arrested ourselves. And, to top it all, austerity cuts, particularly benefit sanctions and the change to universal credit, are pushing more women, particularly mothers, on to the game.

Did it all mean anything? I’ve got a simple, cheap and painless way for the monarchy to prove it is serious about all those nice new vibes. It is to give up a single painting from the Royal Collection. This painting has so much relevance to the modern world that it needs urgently to be placed in the National Gallery so it can provide inspiration, right old wrongs and shatter history’s glass ceiling. The masterpiece in question is Artemisia Gentileschi’s Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting. It is something almost unique: a self-portrait by a woman who painted her way to fame 400 years ago. Gentileschi was born in Rome in 1593, into a world of rigid gender hierarchy enforced through violence. Her father was the realist painter Orazio Gentileschi, a close friend of Caravaggio. That gave her access to artistic training, but in 1612 Orazio accused her teacher Agostino Tassi of raping his daughter. At the subsequent trial, Artemisia was treated like a criminal, insulted and shamed, subjected not only to psychological but also to physical torture. “It is true, it is true, it is true, it is true,” she courageously stated over and over as ropes were pulled tight around her fingers in a torture called the sibille. Now these words have inspired It’s True, It’s True, It’s True, a new play by Breach Theatre Company that premieres at the Edinburgh fringe this summer. After I told Artemisia Gentileschi’s shocking story in the Guardian, this acclaimed company sought out the verbatim transcript of the 1612 trial and have dramatised it with an all-female cast. If proof were needed that Gentileschi can speak to us today, here it is. And this is why the Royal Collection can do something of huge social value by donating this extraordinary painting to the National Gallery, where it will be seen in a public space in the heart of London, alongside such “Old Masters” as Rembrandt and Caravaggio, not to mention Artemisia’s dad. Why should his work, and not that of his more exciting daughter, be in this museum? Gentileschi did not let the humiliation of the trial destroy her, even though it ended with Tassi – in spite of condemning evidence – walking away. She went on to become one of the most celebrated artists of her time. That was almost unheard of for a woman in the 1600s. Yet what really makes Gentileschi unique is that her paintings deal explicitly with gender and power. That blazes in her Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting. When she created it in about 1638 to 39 she was at the peak of her career, a court artist to Charles I of England. This raw baroque image was painted in London – another reason it’s a national treasure. Gentileschi portrays herself as the incarnation of an emblematic device, for painting was personified as a woman in 17th-century thought. But she transforms allegory into muscular reality. She is not a symbol of painting but a real woman who paints. The act of painting has rarely looked so dynamic and forceful. This is no genteel image of a “lady” painter – which is how female artists would be shown, if at all, for centuries to come. Gentileschi pictures herself with a hefty arm reaching powerfully as she works with hair dishevelled and dress disarranged, lost in creativity. She identifies with the most physical and bold heroics of art. You think of Michelangelo painting the Sistine Ceiling, or Jackson Pollock throwing paint. This portrait consciously gives women power. You can see that by comparing it with Gentileschi’s blood-soaked depictions of Judith and Holofernes in Florence’s Uffizi and the Capodimonte Museum in Naples. In her gory versions of this Biblical story she makes Judith’s servant much younger than in most paintings by male artists. This allows her to show two strong women working together to kill a man. Given that she painted them a few years after her own rape, it is hard not to see it as a bloody retribution. In her Self-Portrait she holds a brush, not a sword. Yet she makes painting look almost as physical and athletic as holding a man down and hacking his head off. It’s not an attack on the Royal Collection to say this painting belongs in the National Gallery. It would have such powerful symbolism there. You can find it on public view at Hampton Court Palace. But this is about symbolism and context: Artemisia Gentileschi should be at the heart of our culture, and that means hanging in the National Gallery. There are precedents. The Royal Collection has a history of giving certain essential masterpieces on long-term loan to major museums. Raphael’s Tapestry Cartoons belong to the Queen but have been on loan to the V&amp;A since 1865. That reflects the 19th-century reverence for Raphael, considered by the Victorians so important that his works needed to be on view at the heart of London. Today, the Raphael Court is one of the quietest galleries in the V&amp;A. He doesn’t speak forcefully from the past. Artemisia Gentileschi does. The Windsors have the power to do something transformative merely by putting this painting in a van and sending it to the National Gallery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/13/scottish-ministers-ordered-to-end-two-tier-foi-regime","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T15:13:36Z","webTitle":"Scottish ministers ordered to end 'two-tier' FoI regime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/13/scottish-ministers-ordered-to-end-two-tier-foi-regime","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/13/scottish-ministers-ordered-to-end-two-tier-foi-regime","fields":{"headline":"Scottish ministers ordered to end 'two-tier' FoI regime","bodyText":"Scotland’s information watchdog has ruled that Scottish ministers breached the country’s transparency laws by wrongly singling out the media for discriminatory treatment. Daren Fitzhenry, the Scottish information commissioner, has ordered ministers in Edinburgh to overhaul their freedom of information (FoI) procedures after upholding a series of complaints by 23 journalists in June last year. He said his formal investigation, his first since becoming Scotland’s third information commissioner last October, found that ministers and their special advisers applied a two-tier screening system for requests by journalists, MSPs and party researchers. He found “unjustifiable, significant delays and disregard for statutory timescales” with a number of media requests, which were “expressly made subject to a different process for clearance than other requester groups”. Journalists were significantly more likely to have their requests refused or only partially answered in 2015/16 and 2016/17, and less likely to have full disclosure than ordinary members of the public. He added: “By creating and applying a process based on requester type rather than the nature of the request, not only is the spirit of FoI legislation offended but trust between those groups mentioned in the policy and the Scottish government may also be damaged.” While processes had improved significantly last year after his predecessor ordered changes last year, that extra layer of screening by ministerial aides meant 47% of media requests were issued late in 2016/17. Although he found no evidence that legal exemptions were applied to some requests for improper reasons, others were delayed for “tenuous” reasons. The commissioner made a series of recommendations and findings, including accusing ministers of inadequate record keeping on FoI requests, particularly when legal exemptions were applied, and that civil servants were often poorly trained and ill-experienced in FoI law. Fitzhenry’s inquiry was launched at Holyrood’s request after a group of journalists, including reporters on the Guardian, Times and Sunday Post, and the Ferret and Commonspace news websites, as well as union representatives for BBC and STV journalists, raised a series of complaints about official handling of FoI requests. Joe FitzPatrick, minister for parliamentary business, said his government accepted all the commissioner’s recommendations and had already begun improving the treatment of journalists’ FoI requests, and had already speeded up and improved their handling. Confirming that the government would also produce an action plan ordered by the commissioner in three months’ time, he said he had already introduced new rules that meant requests would no longer be screened because of the identity or profession of the applicant. He said FoI rules that applied to his devolved government and its agencies were already more liberal and wide-ranging than UK-wide legalisation. “Freedom of information is an important right and an important part of our democracy,” he said. Leslie Evans, the most senior civil servant in the Scottish government, said in a rare public statement that her officials had already put more staffing into handling FoI requests, developed a new tracking system and were improving case management. Opposition parties were scathing, however. Oliver Mundell, for the Scottish Conservatives, said ministers had a “shameful record” on transparency, while Rhoda Grant, for Scottish Labour, said the commissioner’s conclusions were damning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/13/eu-member-states-block-uks-access-to-galileo-satellite-programme-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T16:01:21Z","webTitle":"Security row over EU Galileo satellite project as Britain is shut out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/13/eu-member-states-block-uks-access-to-galileo-satellite-programme-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/13/eu-member-states-block-uks-access-to-galileo-satellite-programme-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Security row over EU Galileo satellite project as Britain is shut out","bodyText":"A fresh row over the UK’s involvement with the Galileo satellite programme, to which the country’s taxpayers have already paid £1bn, threatens to poison the Brexit talks after the EU shut Britain out of the project. A majority of member states have turned against the UK and voted in favour of pushing forward on the next round of contracts for the £8bn project, despite requests for a delay to allow negotiations over British involvement to progress. UK firms are being blocked from bidding for contracts. Galileo is an £8bn satellite navigation system intended to rival the US-controlled global positioning system. Once fully operational in 2020 it will provide accurate position, navigation and timing information to be used by governments, citizens, industry and the military. British companies have been central to its design and build. A technical paper handed to EU negotiators last month warned that restricting UK involvement would lead to delays of up to three years and an additional cost to the EU of about €1bn. . The result prompted a furious response from the UK science minister, Sam Gyimah, who repeated the claim that Britain was willing to “walk away” from the project, to develop a rival satellite. The UK was beaten by a “simple majority” within the 28 member states. Gyimah said: “The government has been clear that our preference is to contribute fully to Galileo as part of a deep security partnership with the EU, and that negotiations should be allowed to run their course. By forcing through this vote, while excluding UK companies from the contracts on unfounded security grounds, the European Commission has put this at risk. “There is an option on the table that would benefit both the UK and EU. If that is not accepted by the EU, we are a proud and confident nation and will be looking at all alternatives.” The development came 24 hours after European commission officials secured support from the 27 member states for their decision to treat the UK like any other non-EU country, despite concerns among some at the high-handed approach of its officials on the issue. France, the UK’s closest security partner in the EU, which is particularly keen for tight cooperation in the future, backed Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator. A commission slide presentation to the member states was made public on Wednesday that dismissed British demands as seeking to go beyond what is possible for third countries. The document insisted that the EU’s guiding philosophy was that a country withdrawing from the union could not enjoy the same benefits as a member state. Stefaan de Rynck, an aide to Barnier, tweeted on their publication: “As @MichelBarnier said in a speech on 14 May, ‘we need to put the cooperation on Galileo between the EU and the UK on a new basis’”. The development is likely to infect the wider negotiations. The UK has warned of irreparable damage to security cooperation should the EU insist on blocking its requests for a status on the project similar to that enjoyed today. Yet this week’s commission paper claims the UK is seeking a “change of nature” of the programme, turning it into an international endeavour rather than a purely EU one. There would be a loss of “strategic autonomy” for the bloc if it gave way to the UK’s calls for equal access to the design and development of the secure military-grade signal as the EU, the commission successfully argued. It was further agreed that the UK government could instead only have “observer status” on decisions relating to the project. Its space industry will also not be permitted the same access to contracts for security elements of the satellite system as member states. EU diplomats were quick to point out that the commission is not blocking the UK’s military from access to Galileo’s secure signal, just proprietary knowledge of its codes, design and development. In restricted circumstances, UK companies could also manufacture the receivers for the military-grade signal. But the commission managed to get agreement that the UK would not be offered a special status, a position that Downing Street claims would not be strong enough for it to put its faith in the satellite when its military was engaged in a conflict zone. One EU diplomat told the Guardian that the British press had tried “to blame the French, the Germans, the commission, but this [is] just the united position”. EU officials have previously suggested that offering the UK access to Galileo’s secure components and development would give Downing Street the power to switch the satellite off. A UK government source said: “The suggestion the UK could ‘switch off the system’ is absurd fearmongering which ignores the strength of UK support for Europe’s security, our shared aims in Nato, and our common interests. “It implies they wish to treat us as a hostile state, which is frankly laughable. Of course, if they really are worried about it we could easily provide safeguards on that point in the terms of our access.” Last month the chancellor, Philip Hammond, warned that the UK would “have to go it alone”, if the EU maintained their position. The UK has also threatened to seek the return of its past financial contributions. Such a move would imperil the wider withdrawal agreement by opening up the sensitive matter of the country’s £39bn divorce bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/13/dont-let-bacteria-laden-humans-contaminate-mars","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T16:44:06Z","webTitle":"Don’t let bacteria-laden humans contaminate Mars | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/13/dont-let-bacteria-laden-humans-contaminate-mars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jun/13/dont-let-bacteria-laden-humans-contaminate-mars","fields":{"headline":"Don’t let bacteria-laden humans contaminate Mars","bodyText":"The discovery of organic material that could be the remains of, or served as food for, ancient life on Mars is extremely exciting, but bitter-sweet (Mars rover finds signs of life … from 3bn years ago, 8 June).

For over 25 years, his gang has hidden behind cars, set up stings and cloaked themselves in disguise just for the thrill of saying: “You’re it.” One guy even got tagged at his dad’s funeral. It’s a true story – the Wall Street Journal profiled the dudes in 2013 – and you can write the scene that comes next. A Hollywood executive spots the headline, grabs the phone and barks: “Get me Ed Helms.” The relentlessly funny comedy Tag pairs the ever-twerpy star of The Hangover with a posse that includes Jon Hamm as an egotistical CEO, Jake Johnson as a sad-sack stoner divorcee and Hannibal Buress in his usual part of the underwritten sidekick who steals scenes by mumbling the best jokes. Ever since they graduated and spread east from Spokane, Washington in the 1990s – director Jeff Tomsic clues us into the era with the Toad the Wet Sprocket poster in Helms’ childhood playroom— Hoagie (Helms), Callahan (Hamm), Chilli (Johnson) and Sable (Buress) have spent every May sneaking around and smacking each other on the back. Only each other. Hoagie’s aggressive wife Anna (Isla Fisher) has never gotten to officially play, thanks to a no-girls-allowed rule forged in boyhood. As for fifth player Jerry (Jeremy Renner), the alpha jock has never been tapped. He’s that fast. Tag keeps them young, or at least acting like it until their knees give out vaulting a fire escape. Ironically, it also keeps these competitive best friends at a distance. When Jerry plans his wedding – 31 May, according to his hard-headed fiancee’s (Leslie Bibb) dream date – he doesn’t even invite his pals. If they attend, they’ll just tackle him at the pulpit. Besides, they’re guaranteed to show anyway. As Hoagie vows: “We get Jerry now or we die. Eventually.” How does the game mesh with their adult lives? Poorly. In an opening scene, Hoagie sabotages Callahan’s big interview with – oh hi! – the Wall Street Journal, who’s managed to be written into the film by recasting original journalist Russell Adams as beautiful blonde Rebecca Crosby (Annabelle Wallis), who impulsively decides to city-hop across America to Jerry’s wedding with these strangers without packing a toothbrush or a personality. Screenwriters Rob McKittrick and Mark Steilen don’t even hammer her into the script as a love interest, making Crosby’s presence so extraneous I kept checking the backseats of cars, expecting the film would forget she’s supposed to be there. Orson Welles might nod that he used the same reporter plot device in Citizen Kane. But for all the great, dumb pleasures of Tag, even the film itself would agree that deciphering why these guys play is even less weighty than Rosebud. Tomsic is aware of the cruelties of the game: the injuries, the trampled bystanders, the lonely geeks who long to join and the PTSD-like paranoia that’s forced Sable into therapy (which he also seems to be directing at his wife who gets mentioned once and forgotten). He’s built out this world to be about more than nostalgia, though there’s plenty of that, too, from cassette tapes to a needle-drop of the 1995 Pharcyde hit Runnin’ that’s so pitch-perfect he plays it twice. (U Can’t Touch This must have been too expensive.) The script cheapens itself squeezing in empty gags about a homophobic – and possibly closeted – receptionist (Thomas Middleditch) and Hoagie’s mom’s (Nora Dunn) inappropriate crush on one of his childhood playmates. (It’s shockingly not Hamm, who here maximizes his elastic eyebrows and cartoonish good looks.) Tag is better when it fumbles for the boundaries of the game. Beyond “amendment B: no ass-punching”, what’s the line between sporting and sociopathic? Is it Chilli’s insistence that Jerry’s wedding is a ruse? Or is it our suspicion that Jerry seems capable of doing exactly that? Tag doesn’t give Tomsic many chances for directorial flair, but when Jerry is in danger of being touched, the cinematography shifts into a thriller. The shadows sharpen, harsh white light rakes against Renner’s pores, and suddenly the Bourne Legacy hero has leaped from comedy back to the battlefield where he belongs. Renner looks like a comic, but this is his first chance to prove he can hang – even if, like Jason Statham in Spy, his misfit seriousness is the joke. He fights both mentally and physically, inviting an ex-girlfriend (Rashida Jones) to the wedding reception as a honeypot trap, and mastering defensive moves that fend off attackers without making skin contact. By the time Tomsic steals a camera move from Sam Raimi’s horror flick The Evil Dead, we’re primed to agree with Sable when he groans: “Our friend is a psychopath and this is scary.” Surprisingly, there’s emotional resonance in this slapstick flick about friends who are terrified to hug. Add that to the solid chemistry between the leads, and Tag is a fine callback to the sprawling ensemble comedies of the 1980s, back when the real-life tag team graduated high school. It’s a solid summer film that will melt away from memory by fall. Though, if it does well, you can guarantee that the studio that churned out three Hangovers is hoping for a sequel. After all, this game never ends. Tag is released in the US on 15 June and in the UK on 29 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/17/week-in-audio-nigel-farage-show-love-and-radio-between-the-ears","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"The week in radio and podcasts: The Nigel Farage Show; Slice: Politics and Personality; Between the Ears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/17/week-in-audio-nigel-farage-show-love-and-radio-between-the-ears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/17/week-in-audio-nigel-farage-show-love-and-radio-between-the-ears","fields":{"headline":"The week in radio and podcasts: The Nigel Farage Show; Slice: Politics and Personality; Between the Ears","bodyText":"The Nigel Farage Show (LBC) | lbc.co.uk Slice: Politics and Personality (Radio 4) | iPlayer Between the Ears: Omay (Radio 3) | iPlayer I listened to The Nigel Farage Show on Tuesday evening, when he interviewed those two dashing squires of Brexit, Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore. (I know. I do it all for you, dear readers.) Anyway, I say Farage interviewed them, but this wasn’t exactly Frost/Nixon. It wasn’t even Norton/Gaga, to be honest. “What qualifies as a boozy lunch?” was Farage’s opener to Banks, re Banks’s controversial meeting with the Russian ambassador. Not a bad way to kick off (answer: three or four shots of vodka, plus brandy and wine, over six hours)… except that the tougher follow-up question, which should have come straight after the jokey warm-up, never materialised. Instead, Farage kept things breezy, allowing his compadres, sorry, interviewees, to make light of everything. They chose to do so with a small range of catchphrases. If you’d been playing the drinking game and chosen “witch-hunt” and “parliamentary privilege” as your down-in-one triggers, you, too, could have experienced that exciting Banks boozy lunch feeling. (“Oh ambassador, you are spoiling us!”) After just 15 minutes, during which I gained the impression that Banks and Wigmore don’t do much other than whiz between lunches, meetings and cocktail parties (“They’re not politicians, they’re people from the world of business,” Farage explained), Nigel let his chums go. Off they trotted, presumably to another drinky-winks. Then the listeners called in. Their questions were OK, but I kept getting distracted, mesmerised by the live comments feed on the Farage YouTube stream. Many of the comments aren’t suitable for a family newspaper, but let’s just say that the Venn diagram overlap of Farage listeners and Tommy Robinson fans is quite a big one. “Bomb Iran for Tommy” was one. A joke. I think. The moment when Carole Cadwalladr, the Observer journalist investigating the connections between Leave.EU, Cambridge Analytica and the Russians, revealed herself on air was simultaneously explosive and disappointing. Cadwalladr had got her friend Liz to call in (Farage has been refusing to talk to Cadwalladr), but he dropped the call so fast you barely registered she’d got through. As 5 Live’s Danny Baker, Radio 4’s John Wilson and other presenters have pointed out, this is hardly good radio. If Farage were a proper journalist, as opposed to a narcissist with a microphone, he’d have relished getting stuck in with Cadwalladr. But he’s not. Judging by his reaction, I’d say, in the words of Margaret Thatcher, he’s frit. Cambridge Analytica came up again (it does pop up a lot) in Jolyon Jenkins’s five-part documentary last week, in that nice Radio 4 after-lunch slot. Called Slice: Politics and Personality, (Slice stands for Selfhood, Likes, Inclinations, Campaigning, Elections), this examined the central Cambridge Analytica premise that our personalities can be revealed – and thus influenced – through our online data use. But in the very first programme, Jenkins revealed that the longstanding standard test for personality is actually flawed, coming, as it does, from a scientist simply reducing all the potentially suitable adjectives in the dictionary down to five. Interesting stuff and Jenkins seemed more relaxed than usual. It was nice to hear him enjoying himself. And if you’re utterly sick of anything to do with Cambridge Analytica, then may I recommend yesterday’s Between The Ears? What a lovely programme. It concerned a European anthropologist, Laura Rival, who embedded herself in an Amazonian tribe (the Huaorani) in the 1980s. She brought her nine-year-old daughter, Emilia, with her. Sound designer Gareth Fry went to the Amazon himself to record the sounds there and these, mixed with Rival’s own archive forest recordings, made for an immersive experience. Rival was moving and revelatory. With the tribe, she said: “Life passes quickly and nothing happens.” With this programme, time stood still.

Ian Blackford, the party’s leader in the Commons, said it could no longer be “business as usual” between Holyrood and Westminster after what he described as a “power grab” by the government was passed after just 15 minutes of debate. Prime minister’s questions descended into pandemonium after SNP MPs walked out en masse as part of a protest over the lack of time given to the debate on devolution issues connected to Brexit. But the SNP was accused by its opponents of being “locked in a toxic embrace” with the Tories in which the constitutional crisis was used to shore up the party’s grassroots’ support and keep its independence dreams alive. After a day of high parliamentary drama, Blackford accused the government of attempting to claw back powers from Holyrood, including over farming, fisheries and the environment, after leaving the EU without giving MPs time for debate. The SNP leader was ejected from the Commons for repeatedly refusing to sit down after the Speaker, John Bercow, declined his request for an immediate vote on holding a fresh debate so MPs’ voices could be heard. With Bercow struggling to keep control of the rowdy chamber, he ordered Blackford to be barred from the Commons for the rest of the day, citing his “persistent and repeated” refusal to sit down and allow May to continue. After a brief standoff, in a planned move the entire contingent of SNP MPs marched out of the chamber in protest, to sarcastic cheers of “Bye!” from the government benches. Outside the Commons and surrounded by more than a dozen of his MPs, Blackford said: “This is the beginning of something, not the end … They’re taking us on, so they’re going to find we are taking them on. We’ll use every measure at our disposal. “This isn’t a stunt, this is about the harsh reality of the British government acting against the interests of the Scottish people and the Scottish government. It’s new territory, this can’t be business as usual. “It is a complete breakdown in relations because there’s disrespect which has been shown to the Scottish parliament by the Conservatives. They need to understand that there is a change in the relationship as a consequence.” His threat to cause trouble on a “day-by-day, week-by-week” basis raises the prospect of the SNP, the third biggest party in the Commons, obstructing votes, delaying debates and raising as many obstacles to the passage of legislation as its 35 MPs can muster. The SNP outrage was prompted by the amount of time devoted to debating Lords amendments to the EU withdrawal bill on Tuesday. While three hours was devoted to a series of proposals including the meaningful vote, devolved issues only got 15 minutes. The party said it had signed up 1,110 new members since midday on Wednesday after the row. At the heart of the row is the government’s plan to retain control of 24 key areas once powers return from Brussels, which it says will be a temporary move in order to allow rules and regulations to remain in place across the whole UK. The vast majority of the 158 devolved policy areas powers will return directly from Brussels to the devolved administrations. The Scottish parliament refused consent for the Brexit bill in February. The SNP leader and Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted minutes after the walkout that she was “right behind” her party’s MPs, claiming that Scotland and Holyrood were “being treated with contempt” by Westminster. However, the Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine said: “Neither the SNP or the Conservatives appear to want a solution to the impasse, it suits them both. The SNP wants to crank up the grievance narrative to help them get another independence referendum that most people do not actually want. “And it suits the Conservatives to have the constitutional debate kept alive. They’d far rather keep talking about that, than the matters people really care about.” The Labour MP Paul Sweeney said: “The SNP’s only oxygen is on constitutional issues and they and the Conservatives are locked in a toxic embrace on the matter. As long as they can keep the focus on the constitution and not on issues like fighting poverty or investing in our economy they’ll continue to feed the beast.” The Scotland secretary, David Mundell, who will make a statement in the Commons, said: “It was putting a stunt over substance. If the concerns were real then their priority would have been to have a debate to hold the government to account.” On Thursday, the first minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, will call on May to “come clean” on Brexit. In a speech to be delivered at King’s College in London, Jones will say: “I urge the prime minister to use the UK government’s eagerly anticipated white paper as last opportunity to come clean on Brexit, to erase the wobbly red lines and to get the country into a proper Brexit-ready position. “The UK government is set on a course where the UK neither has its cake nor gets the chance to eat it. Worse still, is the very real possibility of a catastrophic no-deal Brexit.” He will continue: “It is to go back to the drawing board. Rub out the red lines and argue for a dynamic and positive relationship with the single market, a solution where the UK makes a positive commitment to working with the EU27 to retain alignment with the single market as a regulatory space, and a new, durable customs union with the EU. “If we are to achieve the right Brexit outcome, we need a different approach to the negotiations. Rather than acting as cheerleaders for populist attacks on the core principles of the EU, we need to provide reassurance that we respect the rights of the EU to safeguard the coherence of the single market, which we did so much to create.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/13/pmqs-verdict-resilient-may-sees-off-corbyn-attempts-at-ridicule","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T12:20:51Z","webTitle":"PMQs verdict: resilient May sees off Corbyn's attempts at ridicule","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/13/pmqs-verdict-resilient-may-sees-off-corbyn-attempts-at-ridicule","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/13/pmqs-verdict-resilient-may-sees-off-corbyn-attempts-at-ridicule","fields":{"headline":"PMQs verdict: resilient May sees off Corbyn's attempts at ridicule","bodyText":"Key points In a PMQs almost derailed by an SNP protest, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn again traded blows on Brexit. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, was ordered by the Speaker, John Bercow, to leave the Commons chamber after trying to disrupt PMQs with a vote for the house to sit in private. He was doing this as a protest against the way Scotland has been treated over Brexit, the EU withdrawal bill in particular. MPs were meant to debate Lords amendments relating to devolution on Tuesday night, but the debate lasted just 15 minutes. Before the kerfuffle, Corbyn told the prime minister “the sad truth and reality” was that many survivors of Grenfell Tower were still waiting for a permanent home. He also asked whether May did as Boris Johnson had suggested when she met Donald Trump and asked the US president to take over the Brexit talks. May said people had claimed before December she would not get a deal on Brexit then. On Grenfell Tower, she said every household had received an offer of temporary or permanent accommodation, and 183 have accepted. Corbyn said the government was now working on the basis that the transition could continue until December 2021, not December 2020. Which December was she talking about? Corbyn was wrong, May replied: he was talking about the backstop. Corbyn said he was not sure whether it was a backstop or a backslide. When will the white paper be published? May did say it would be published before the June summit. May said it would be published after that. The summit was not about Brexit. Many issues were coming up, including sanctions against Russia. She pointed out Corbyn quoted a minister saying it would be published in July. July was after June. Corbyn said May had to face the fact there may be a meltdown – not his words, but the words of Johnson. Johnson also accused the Treasury of being the heart of remain. Did May back the foreign secretary in wanting more friction for trade? May closed by telling the Commons Corbyn was trying to organise a music festival. The headline acts were John McDonnell and a band called the Magic Numbers – that just about sums it up. Snap verdict May is certainly resilient. After a run of PMQs defeats on Brexit, and with her Brexit strategy looking increasingly threadbare and ill-fated, she still managed to see off fairly comfortably Corbyn’s attempts to ridicule her. Corbyn’s manner was good – he sounded particularly confident – but mostly his script let him down. His first question was terrific, but he prefaced it with a comment about Grenfell that allowed May to focus on that in her reply (quite effectively) before having to address the Trump point. Then he asked a series of questions that just hadn’t been properly thought through in advance, because May was able to swat them away quite easily. December 2021 or December 2020? May’s always been able to state her policy clearly (it’s just that it’s not plausible). Publishing the white paper before the June summit? I don’t think she ever had promised that (Corbyn may have been relying on a newspaper report – not always a good guide). Postponing the June summit? Such a non-starter as an idea, it is hard to see why Corbyn thought it would cause May problems. Having started with a strong question, Corbyn ended well, too, with a rousing soundbite about clashing egos, which of course will play well on the news and on social media. But May’s peroration was funnier, lifted by what was, by PMQs standards, a half-decent joke. Memorable lines Corbyn on Johnson: When the prime minister met Donald Trump last week did she do as the foreign secretary suggested and ask him to take over the Brexit negotiations? May on Corbyn: I’ve heard that he is trying to organise a musical festival, Labour Live. I’ll pass over the fact it’s going to have a solidarity tent with no Labour MPs in it. The headline act is the shadow chancellor and the Magic Numbers – that sums them up.

Matteo Salvini, Italy’s new anti-migrant interior minister, blocked the Aquarius rescue ship carrying 629 people from docking in its ports at the weekend, prompting international outcry. In a speech to parliament on Wednesday he demanded an apology from the French president and challenged France to take in the migrants it had promised to take under an EU agreement, accusing it of turning back 10,000 migrants at Italy’s northern border. Salvini said France had committed to accepting 9,816 migrants under a 2015 EU redistribution scheme to relieve frontline countries of the pressure of asylum-seekers. The scheme never got off the ground. Salvini said in three years France had accepted only 640 people. “So I ask President Macron to pass from words to action and tomorrow morning welcome the 9,816 France promised to welcome as a sign of concrete generosity and not just words.” Giuseppe Conte, the new Italian prime minister, also hit back at France’s criticism, calling its approach to the migrant crisis “hypocritical”. “Following the statements made in Paris yesterday about the Aquarius case, the minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, Enzo Moavero Milanese, has summoned the ambassador of France to Italy this morning,” the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The summons came as the migrants, who were pulled from the sea in rescue operations on Saturday night, make their way to Spain on Italian naval vessels, after Spain’s new prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, stepped in on Monday and said they would be welcome in the port of Valencia. The Aquarius, which had been on its way to Sicily, got caught in a standoff between Italy and Malta after both countries refused to allow it to dock. It was the first major anti-migrant move made by Salvini, the hardline leader of the far-right League party. A week earlier he called for an end to Sicily being Europe’s “refugee camp”. Amid the diplomatic tensions, an Italian coastguard ship, Diciotti, carrying 900 migrants and two bodies, arrived in Catania, Sicily, on Wednesday morning. More than 600,000 migrants have landed on Italy’s southern shores over the last five years and the country has long urged its EU partners to share the burden. A controversial pact between Italy and Libya has led to a 70% decrease in arrivals since last summer. But the deal is facing a legal challenge at the European court of human rights (ECHR) amid allegations that it prompted serious human rights violations, including torture and slavery, against those who make the treacherous Mediterranean crossing. Many who arrive in Italy venture north in an attempt to cross into France, Austria or Switzerland. But border controls make this nearly impossible. A cat-and-mouse situation has played out between Italy and France at the Italian border town of Ventimiglia since 2011, with French police sending back thousands who have tried to cross the border, either by train or a dangerous mountain path. A report in the French newspaper Le Monde last week said a hunter had discovered the body of a migrant who attempted the mountain route over the winter. The global medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has also criticised the Italian government’s response, accusing it of risking people’s safety and putting politics before lives. Aloys Vimard, MSF’s project coordinator on board the Aquarius, said the Italian coastguard had dropped 900 migrants off in Sicily on Wednesday morning, while those on the NGO rescue ship had been turned away from Italian ports. “This should not be a precedent: rescued people should be taken to the nearest available port,” he told the Guardian. “More than 900 people are disembarking in Catania, Sicily, and we’re a bit concerned that Italy has been toying with the lives of 629 rescued people by denying them disembarkation at the closest safe port. There’s a need for politicians to discuss this and for the European Union to find a dignified solution for these vulnerable people. “We are very, very concerned about the situation because political considerations are being prioritised over the safety over hundreds of vulnerable people.” Vimard said the situation on the Aquarius had improved significantly after more than 500 people were transferred to Italian vessels on Tuesday afternoon, leaving 106 people on the rescue ship. “The conditions very difficult when there were 629 people on board; they couldn’t lie down and the ship was overcrowded for four days,” he said. Vimard said the crew and passengers were hoping to reach Valencia on Saturday evening, though much would depend on the weather. “The weather is deteriorating and we’re making sure that people are safe – we’ve put ropes across the deck so people can move to the toilet without falling over. It’s going to be tough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/13/cate-blanchett-to-debut-at-national-theatre-in-new-martin-crimp-play","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T11:59:20Z","webTitle":"Cate Blanchett to debut at National Theatre in new Martin Crimp play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/13/cate-blanchett-to-debut-at-national-theatre-in-new-martin-crimp-play","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/13/cate-blanchett-to-debut-at-national-theatre-in-new-martin-crimp-play","fields":{"headline":"Cate Blanchett to debut at National Theatre in new Martin Crimp play","bodyText":"Cate Blanchett is to return to the UK stage for the first time in seven years when she makes her debut at the National Theatre in a new play by Martin Crimp. It was announced on Wednesday that the Australian actor, who lives with her family in East Sussex, has been cast with Stephen Dillane in a production to be directed by Katie Mitchell. Blanchett is an experienced stage actor and with her husband, Andrew Upton, was in charge of the Sydney Theatre Company from 2008-2013. But the actor has been best known in recent years for her movie roles, including Blue Jasmine, Carol, the Hobbit films and Ocean’s 8. Her last UK stage appearance was at the Barbican in London in 2012 in Botho Strauss’s Big and Small. Crimp’s play is called When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other – Twelve Variations on Samuel Richardson’s Pamela. Richardson’s Pamela, a kind of 18th-century Fifty Shades of Grey, is an epistolary novel about a young maid terrorised and imprisoned by a libertine nobleman. It caused a sensation after it was published in 1740 with its theme of love and marriage across the social divide. The National Theatre said Crimp was using Pamela as a provocation with five characters acting out “a dangerous game of sexual domination and resistance”. It said the play would break through “the surface of contemporary debate to explore the messy, often violent nature of desire, and the fluid, complicated roles that men and women play”. Blanchett’s co-star Dillane, who played Stannis Baratheon in Game of Thrones and Viscount Halifax in The Darkest Hour, is returning to the National for the first time since The Coast of Utopia in 2002 and reuniting with Mitchell after productions which include Endgame, Uncle Vanya, The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd and Four Quartets. Mitchell, regarded by some as a theatre visionary and one of Britain’s finest living stage directors, has not directed at the National since the brutally shocking production of Cleansed in 2016. She said: “It’s great to be working with Martin again on this powerful new text and to continue my special collaboration with Stephen Dillane. At the same time I’m delighted to welcome Cate Blanchett to the National, and look forward to developing a new working relationship with this extraordinary actor.” Blanchett had been rumoured to be starring in a forthcoming West End production of All About Eve, directed by Ivo van Hove, but reportedly withdrew because of a scheduling conflict. The National Theatre said more information on the Crimp play, which opens in January 2019, would be announced in the autumn when tickets go on sale."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/14/one-new-species-of-micro-moth-found-in-britain-every-year","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"One new species of 'micro-moth' found in Britain every year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/14/one-new-species-of-micro-moth-found-in-britain-every-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/14/one-new-species-of-micro-moth-found-in-britain-every-year","fields":{"headline":"One new species of 'micro-moth' found in Britain every year","bodyText":"They are often tiny, frequently brown and always challenging to identify but an average of one new species of pyralid moth each year is turning up in Britain, according to experts. Almost 30 new species of this large family of “micro-moths” have been recorded over the last 30 years – either flying in themselves or being transported via the horticultural trade. While the abundance of moths is in decline, more than 125 new species of moth have been spotted in Britain this century alone, with 27 species establishing themselves as breeding species. People are being urged to spot and help document these new arrivals as part of this year’s Moth Night, an annual three-night event to record and celebrate moths, organised by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology and wildlife publisher Atropos. “Just because something is called a micro-moth, don’t assume it’s tiny and brown and dull and impossible to identify because some of these aren’t,” said Richard Fox of Butterfly Conservation. “Moths in general are a fantastic, interesting group of wildlife that’s still relatively diverse – there are hundreds of species in your back garden. Anyone who is interested in wildlife will find that exciting and inspiring.” Newly arrived micro-moths include Musotima nitidalis, originally from Australia and New Zealand, which reached Britain in 2009 via the horticultural trade. The moth is now found in several locations in southern England, where its caterpillars feed on ferns such as bracken. Many of the recent pyralid colonists have arrived naturally, probably assisted by climate change, including the beautifully coloured Evergestis limbata, which has settled along the south coast of England. According to Fox, most of the new arrivals are entirely benign although one, the box tree moth, will be unpopular with gardeners for its caterpillars’ habit of devouring the leaves of box hedges. Easy to see native pyralids include the day-flying mint moth, which can be found among garden herbs and the small magpie – a surprisingly large black and white moth. Common migrants include the rush veneer and rusty-dot pearl. The caterpillars of another group of pyralid moth, the china-marks, live in an air-filled bubble of spun leaves, sometimes below the surface of ponds or at the edge of streams. As well as apps and online guides, there is a new guidebook on pyralid moths to help spotters. Mark Tunmore of publisher Atropos said: “New species are being added to the British list with regularity and we want to make sure that people are well equipped to identify these. We expect Moth Night 2018 to add to our knowledge of this group of moths.” Moth Night 2018 runs from 14 to 16 June and will include moth-trapping events across the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/14/the-cookie-shot-sweet-messy-and-joyous","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T05:19:37Z","webTitle":"The cookie shot: sweet, messy and joyous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/14/the-cookie-shot-sweet-messy-and-joyous","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/14/the-cookie-shot-sweet-messy-and-joyous","fields":{"headline":"The cookie shot: sweet, messy and joyous","bodyText":"It has been five years since Dominique Ansel, the French baker-turned-celebrity-baker, created the cronut. That’s five years of the $5 (£3.75, although Ansel charges £4.50 for it at his London bakery) croissant-doughnut hybrid, which Ansel trademarked within a fortnight of it going on sale at his eponymous bakery in SoHo, New York. Five years of queues and waiting lists and pre-orders and scalping (buying and reselling at a markup), and a small but steady black-market economy on Craigslist, where, at one point, cronuts were going for $100 each. And five long, slow, unholy years of subsequent food hybrids and baked-up portmanteaus, including baissants (bagel croissants) and flagels (flatbread bagels), hoping for the same success. How do you follow that at the Dominique Ansel Bakery? With more chimeric inventions, of course, including the cannibalistic What-a-Melon Soft Serve (watermelon ice-cream inside watermelon), frozen s’mores (ice-cream inside marshmallow, served on a stick) and – what the bakery’s saleswoman told me had come closest to topping the cronut’s success: the cookie shot. Even today, the cronut endures. I could tell where the New York bakery was before I reached Spring Street by the tour group walking down the road towards it, one holding a large flag overhead Iwo Jima-style, and by the 16-person queue, which included three New York cops. Inside, people ate cronuts with cutlery. I waited, ordered a cronut (which should be spelled croughnut, but isn’t) and the cookie shot ($4.50/£4 in London). While the layered puff pastry cronut is fried to a light crisp and gently collapses in your mouth, the cookie shot requires a seat and two hands: one to pour in the Tahitian vanilla milk and one to hold the chocolate chip cookie, which has been shaped into a shot glass as big as my palm. The milk comes from Swede Farms in upstate New York and is cold-infused with vanilla beans for 24 hours. You sip and eat, the cookie somehow staying firm. People stare. You get chocolate everywhere. It’s large and sweet and joyous. Ansel created the cookie shot a year after the cronut. Recently, I’m told, they have updated the recipe – the cookies now come cold, making them easier to eat. This may have boosted sales: in London, they sell “hundreds” the baker there tells me. Essentially, the cookie shot is a spin on the milk-and-cookies formula. Purists have criticised them because, of course, traditionally you would eat the cookie, then drink the milk – impossible when the cookie also functions as a tumbler. The cuteification of an adult thing, the shot glass, is a power move; a way to render something “bad” as good, or something serious as fun.

The firm itself is also expecting a hefty fine. So let’s talk about PwC, and three other firms – Ernst &amp; Young (EY), Deloitte and KPMG – who together make up the big four accountancy firms, in charge of auditing many of the world’s corporations and banks. These four firms are interesting because, despite signing off on the accounts for multibillion-pound banks just months before the 2008 financial crisis, they’ve largely escaped public anger. One of Fred Goodwin’s first acts when he became CEO of RBS was to bring in Deloitte, a firm he had previously worked for. In 2007, shortly before the taxpayer was forced to bail the bank out of its own reckless decision-making, Deloitte failed to raise any kind of warning about its finances. Despite this, Deloitte received a payrise in 2008 from RBS, and its senior partner John Connolly collected a £5.2m pay package the next year. Following the public bailout, an investigation into RBS was conducted by the Financial Services Authority, with the assistance of PwC. (It concluded that RBS had made a series of bad decisions in the years leading up to the financial crisis, but that they were not the result of a lack of integrity by any individual at the bank and did not warrant enforcement action.) RBS replaced Deloitte with EY in 2014 – EY itself having been sued by New York prosecutors in 2010 over allegations it covered up the Lehman Brothers collapse. The firm settled the lawsuit for $10m in 2015, having agreed to pay $99m in damages to investors in a class-action settlement in 2013. Not only does the public have the right to ask just what is going on with this apparent human centipede of accountancy firms, but it’s high time we talked about nationalising them. Until 2010, we actually did have a public accountancy body called the Audit Commission, which audited £200bn spent by 11,000 public bodies. But in its infinite wisdom, the coalition government scrapped it because – according to Eric Pickles – accountancy should be done in a “competitive environment”. The Audit Commission was by no means perfect, but it was not embroiled in the number of financial scandals that the big four accountancy firms have been. Questions need to be asked about why these companies have repeatedly been found not to be doing their jobs properly; whether the motive to make money has anything to do with that, and whether a publicly owned body that audits banks and big corporations may be necessary. The collapse of BHS resulted in 11,000 job losses: the negligence of these firms has real impacts on people’s livelihoods and families. Perhaps it’s time to bring them under public control. • Ellie Mae O’Hagan is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/16/beyonce-deep-cuts-rarities-say-yes-listen-missy-elliot-flawless","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-16T09:00:42Z","webTitle":"Beyoncé: 10 of the best deep cuts, rarities and Bey-sides","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/16/beyonce-deep-cuts-rarities-say-yes-listen-missy-elliot-flawless","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/16/beyonce-deep-cuts-rarities-say-yes-listen-missy-elliot-flawless","fields":{"headline":"Beyoncé: 10 of the best deep cuts, rarities and Bey-sides","bodyText":"Say Yes Poor Michelle: since the Destiny’s Child split, she has had to watch her bandmates have considerable success while she dances the paso doble with Brendan Cole. Yet she earns a place on this list for this spectacular Christian pop hit from a few years ago. The story goes that she sent an early version of the track, which combines an old Nigerian gospel song with an Afrobeats rhythm, to her old bandmates and they loved it so much they asked to make an appearance/completely upstage her. When Beyoncé arrives on the second verse it is actually as though Jesus herself has popped by, her soaring vocal like the touch of the divine. As if to drive the point home, she wore a white tunic in the video and performed in front of a halo of light. Subtle. Listen The greatest moment in TV talent show history – when 2008 X Factor finalist Alexandra Burke introduced Beyoncé on stage. Burke acquits herself well on the song’s opening verse, but once Beyoncé starts singing she can only just hold on to the harmonies through streams of tears and snot. After they’re done, she is overcome with emotion and ends up clinging to Beyoncé’s waist and crying into her chest like she is her actual mum. Talent shows make a lot of overblown claims about making dreams come true, but when Beyoncé cheers, “Sing it girl!” at Burke you can see those dreams viscerally coming to life. This also marks the last time Beyoncé was seen conversing with another ordinary human, before she became so famous she was only allowed to hang out with Chris Martin and the Obamas. ***Flawless (Remix) The problem with putting a speech about feminism by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in the middle of your song, as Beyoncé did on the original 2013 version of Flawless, is that while it’s a powerful and motivating statement on the first couple of listens, once you’ve fully absorbed it, it becomes a bit of a buzzkill on an otherwise club-friendly track. Sensing that TED talks don’t necessarily lend themselves to repeat listens, Beyoncé released a new version featuring a verse from Nicki Minaj, so basically “the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes” becomes “flawless city, with these flawless titties, I got all these hundreds, you got all them fifties”. Same thing, basically. Daddy Lessons Beyoncé’s first venture into country came on Lemonade with Daddy Lessons, a song about passing on life advice from one generation to the next. Queens of country the Dixie Chicks started working a cover of the track into their set, and so Beyoncé arranged for them to all play the track together at the 2016 Country Music Awards. The version that emerged combines country with a New Orleans second line-style brass bassline and felt like a precursor to this year’s Coachella show, where she doubled down on the brass bands. Expect the next album to be all tuba. Crazy Feelings This album track from Elliott’s second record Da Real World is a reminder why she was the greatest producer of her era. It bumps and grinds along a synth line so lewd and flirtatious it needs to go to compliance training. Released in 1999, this also marks the first non-terrible thing Beyoncé as a solo artist did and demonstrated how her vocals have an intensity that goes way beyond girlband R&amp;B. Unfortunately, after this she would get distracted and make a bunch of terrible movies – lest we forget the MTV-produced Carmen: A Hip Hopera – and it would be a further four years until she made another solo record this good. Naive This was a bonus track on Solange’s 2002 debut album Solo Star, which has since been deleted and is not available on streaming services. It resurfaced on a EP Beyoncé released in 2004 to tie in with a Tommy Hilfiger promotion, although that too appears to have been scrubbed from the internet. It is worth hunting out, though: a slinky Chink Santana production, it’s a song about sisterly advice and condescension, with Beyoncé trying to warn Solange off a dodgy bloke. There’s a good line from 90s rapper Da Brat, too, about what would happen should a man wrong the younger Knowles sister: “Mathew [Knowles] would drill the boy.” Standing on the Sun (Remix) Originally recorded for Beyoncé’s self-titled album, the original 2013 version of this track ended up being demoted to a H&amp;M advert. You can see why: it sounds a bit “generic summer song”, the audio version of an InStyle article about the 10 best bronzers. But this bashment remix featuring king of the dancehall Mr Vegas is the closest we’ve got so far to Beyoncé making a proper carnival track. There’s even a bit of a Lady Chann flow to the second verse, Beyoncé rapping, “Want you to watch me while I wind.” Love in This Club Part II Perhaps Usher thought Love in This Club, his famous EDM ode to doing it in a disabled toilet at a busy Oceana, was a little too gauche, and decided he needed to make a version. This song has the same subject matter and hook as the original, but the tempo is slowed way down and the big synth line is replaced with bathtub R&amp;B; less a quickie in the bogs and more two hours of gentle caressing by the bins in the smoking area. Beyoncé tries her best to add a touch of class to proceedings, reminding Usher: “I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up”, but eventually succumbing to the charm of his erection: “I’m ready and willing, almost got to go/ Got you standing at attention, keep it on the low.” How romantic. My First Time This only appears on the unreleased rarities mixtape Speak My Mind, but it’s kind of crazy that it was never a huge hit. Produced by the Neptunes, it’s not miles away from some of Pharrell and Bey’s more recent collaborations such as Blow. The lyrical content is a little odd, with Beyoncé inviting someone to take her virginity with a cooing refrain of “I think I’m ready”. But you cannot argue with the production, that sickening Pharrell slick bass and randomised beat drops that make you want to smoke a blunt on a skate park on the roof of an abandoned LA car park, or whatever it was that cool people did in 2004. Irreplaceable (Live at Glastonbury) Why is this so moving? I think it’s because of the meeting of worlds. Beyoncé on stage: a life spent in the upper echelons of America, a human so seemingly perfect it’s impossible to imagine them pooing. The Sunday-evening Glastonbury crowd: wary and damp, covered in a considerable amount of actual poo. Beyoncé is left so gobsmacked by the singalong response that she gives up singing, letting the hordes scream “to the left, to the left” in what’s left of their voices. The day after this performance, she released it as a single, recognising that there is nothing quite like the sound of battered Pyramid stage crowd. SW * * * How Beyoncé made the personal political with Lemonade: Beyond the hits and deep cuts, 2016’s visual album Lemonade elevated the star from accomplished performer to totem of America’s complex culture and a national talking point. Claudia Rankine examines its impact. Lemonade, Beyoncé’s 2016 “visual album”, catapulted her into national conversations overnight. The record addressed everything from police profiling to mass incarceration to the break-up of the black family, while giving her fanbase a glimpse of her personal life. Her husband’s infidelity and the notorious altercation in the lift between him and her sister Solange – the messiness of all that – needed and received public resolution with the launch of the album. Here was where she mixed high and low, black and anti-black culture; swagger and vulnerability; feminism and consumerism. The simple truth was laid bare: she was as vulnerable as anyone. Hot sauce in her bag apparently doesn’t always turn into swag. This was the overt plot of the album but the real genius of her work was that the subplots placed her personal drama into the larger frame of the historical victimisation of black people, especially black womanhood. An excerpt from a 1962 Malcolm X speech found its way on to Lemonade in case this point was missed: The most disrespected person in America is the black woman. With Lemonade, Beyoncé’s brand and spirit was restored and recast as revolutionary and militant, although still patriotic. After a period of silence, she had returned to the Super Bowl with Black Panther outfits, handing back to mainstream America and the world a reminder of the injustices Colin Kaepernick and others would kneel for later that same year. This was a Beyoncé for the Trump era, not the one who sang Etta James’s At Last for the Obamas’ inauguration dance. At Last was in that historic moment, the integrationist anthem that Beyoncé has always stood for. The most present Queen Bey brand brings a more complete history, white supremacy and all, to the stage. In the press for the OTR II tour she wears a cowboy hat on her blond hair and stands alongside her husband, Jay-Z, who also signifies belonging and citizenship in his American flag T-shirt, both of them representing a complex America we all know to be vexed and changing, both personally and politically.

A year on, his bandmate has released a musical diary of an equally visible grief. Indeed, you wonder whether there are any filters here, or if Shinoda is similarly letting everything pour out. Opener Place to Start includes voicemail messages of condolence. The excellent Over Again, written after a Bennington memorial concert, struggles with having to say goodbye “over and over again”. Anyone who has grieved will recognise the process Post Traumatic subsequently documents, from morning pain to sudden onsets of guilt or upset. There aren’t massive new insights on mortality but unflinching candour, such when Hold it Together describes his emotional reaction to being offered condolences at his six-year-old’s birthday party. Shinoda’s struggles haven’t stopped him writing catchy songs and while it’s initially unsettling to hear such stuff channelled into anthemic choruses, the songs sing their way towards the start of healing. Promises I Can’t Keep and the closing Can’t Hear You Now are ethereally lovely, but the 16 tracks are untroubled by editing. The moodier, electronic tracks work better than the angrier, rap ones, but while Post Traumatic understandably has flaws, its raw emotion is unusually touching and many will find it a source of tears, strength and comfort."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/13/the-prime-of-miss-jean-brodie-review-muriel-spark-donmar-warehouse","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T12:00:58Z","webTitle":"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie review – words are weapons in smart take on Spark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/13/the-prime-of-miss-jean-brodie-review-muriel-spark-donmar-warehouse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/13/the-prime-of-miss-jean-brodie-review-muriel-spark-donmar-warehouse","fields":{"headline":"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie review – words are weapons in smart take on Spark","bodyText":"I can think of more urgent requirements for the British theatre than yet another version of Muriel Spark’s most famous novel. My initial scepticism, however, was overcome by the skill of David Harrower’s adaptation, the fluency of Polly Findlay’s production and, especially, the joy of watching Lia Williams offer her own take on the glittering paradox of Jean Brodie. Harrower’s most original touch is to focus as much on one of Brodie’s pupils, Sandy, as on the teacher herself. The action is framed by a 1947 interview with Sandy by a Scotsman journalist who wants to know why, having written a successful book, she is renouncing the world to enter a Catholic convent. The interview is intercut with Sandy’s memories of life at Edinburgh’s Marcia Blaine School in the 1930s and particularly of Jean Brodie. We see Brodie’s determination to instil a love of art and beauty in her pupils, witness her defiance of educational orthodoxy and learn of her relations with a raffish art teacher and a shy music master. We are also reminded of Brodie’s unstinting admiration for Mussolini. In Jay Presson Allen’s original adaptation, great stress was laid on discovering which of her pupils ultimately betrayed Brodie to the school authorities. Harrower takes that as a given and instead explores Sandy’s tortured soul and Brodie’s equivocal power. On one level, Brodie is a forerunner of Hector in Alan Bennett’s The History Boys: the inspirational teacher who charms her pupils through her radical extracurricular methods. Yet she is also, we are reminded, a charismatic fascist. Although Brodie claims education is “a leading out of what is already there in the pupil’s soul”, she is actually a rigid dogmatist, firmly announcing that Giotto is the greatest Italian artist, and even a classroom pimp in her attempt to manipulate the sexual progress of her girls. That ambivalence is crucial to Spark’s story and the key to Williams’s superb performance. For a start, Williams catches perfectly Brodie’s mix of verbal precision and gestural vagueness. When she says of her detested head teacher, “Miss Mackay thinks to intimidate me with quarter-hours”, it is in the cut-glass tones of someone who uses words as weapons. Yet when she informs the Vaughan Williams-loving music-master, “I am very fond of The Lark Ascending”, her hands spiral upwards in loose simulation of flight. Without a trace of sentimentality, Williams brings out all the contradictions in Brodie: the fastidious aesthete who is frightened of real passion, the mutinous teacher who praises 1930s Germany and Austria as “magnificently organised”. Williams follows in distinguished footsteps as Brodie but stakes her personal claim to the role. Although Harrower places too much stress on Sandy’s penitential guilt, Rona Morison is very good at conveying her remorseless watchfulness, beady intelligence and chip of ice in the heart: you feel this Sandy was born to be a spy or a writer. Angus Wright exactly catches the music-master’s mix of nervous decency and hesitant lust and Sylvestra Le Touzel is all corseted strictness as Miss Mackay. The success of Findlay’s production and Lizzie Clachan’s design – artfully suggesting we are in both a school and a convent – lies in their ability to put a fresh theatrical sheen on Spark’s familiar story. • At Donmar Warehouse, London, until 28 July.

A shadowy figure, she was snapped up to work with Madonna, Charli XCX and Vince Staples, before emerging earlier in 2018 with the first single from this debut full-length, It’s Okay to Cry. Like nearly all the tracks here, it is extremely powerful, and marks a deepening of her already unique aesthetic. Using her own quiet but determined voice, it’s like a trance track with the insistent beats removed – a brilliant trick she repeats to even more dramatic effect on Is It Cold in the Water, like a beatless trance breakdown unmoored from its original track and left floating in ecstatic inertia. It segues into cathedral-filling power ballad Infatuation, a weighty, sad track saved from mere moping by her usual authorial flourishes: whinnying sirens, urgent whispers. Her other mode of expression is the one she deployed on early tracks such as Hard: mechanistic dance tracks as sexual, tough and water-resistant as the prostate massagers she once sold as merch. But where once those tracks were tinny, here they have become steroidally imposing, gilded with distortion and industrial heft. Based around catchy chants, perfect for skipping rope games conducted by dominatrices, Ponyboy, Faceshopping and the Aladdin-quoting Whole New World/Pretend World are dazzlingly brash and butch. Pretending is less successful – a stately bit of Tim Hecker-ish ambient, where her very particular sonics get lost in reverb – but it leads into the album’s biggest pop moment, Immaterial, where all the latent J-pop vibes get brought to the fore in a high-speed pachinko cacophony. Despite software advances, so many electronic producers are content to lapse into nostalgia or a safe, compromised emotional range; Sophie has crafted a genuinely original sound and uses it to visit extremes of terror, sadness and pleasure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/13/windrush-scandal-mps-call-for-urgent-hardship-fund-for-victims","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T09:31:22Z","webTitle":"Windrush scandal: MPs call for urgent hardship fund for victims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/windrush-scandal-mps-call-for-urgent-hardship-fund-for-victims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/windrush-scandal-mps-call-for-urgent-hardship-fund-for-victims","fields":{"headline":"Windrush scandal: MPs call for urgent hardship fund for victims","bodyText":"The government must urgently set up a hardship fund to help victims of the Windrush scandal who have fallen into financial difficulty, MPs have said. Members of the Windrush generation, who arrived in the UK from 1948, as well as their children, have been wrongly targeted and in some cases left destitute by Theresa May’s “hostile environment” policies, which require employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status. The influential home affairs select committee has called for a hardship fund to be set up after hearing the stories of victims including Anthony Bryan, who lost his job when he was told he was in the country illegally, and Sarah O’Connor, who has been unable to get work or claim benefits. The committee has made the move ahead of the conclusion of a broader inquiry into the scandal. Yvette Cooper, the committee chair, said: “Some of the Windrush generation are facing destitution. People are having to settle legal bills, or are facing bailiffs due to debts run up when they were forced to give up work or had their social security payments stopped through no fault of their own. The government must step in to help people immediately. “Due to the seriousness of this issue, the home affairs select committee has agreed an urgent short report recommending that the government create a hardship fund, immediately, for those of the Windrush generation facing financial difficulties.” The government has agreed to set up a compensation scheme, but the process is likely to be lengthy, involving a consultation and a call for evidence from victims of the scandal. Lawyers have begun preparing group compensation claims on behalf of members of the Windrush generation.

The Football Banning Orders Authority (FBOA), part of the Home Office, has ordered 1,312 individuals subject to banning orders who hold a passport to surrender the document to police. The latest figures, released a day before the opening match of the 2018 World Cup tournament and five days before England’s first match against Tunisia, show that police forces in England and Wales have accounted for 1,254 passports. Police are to attempt to locate the remaining passport-holders during the tournament and will hold on to confiscated documents until the final on 15 July. Mark Roberts, a deputy chief constable and the national lead for football policing, said: “Ahead of the World Cup, a comprehensive policing operation has been in place across the country to account for passports of those on banning orders, which has once again seen only a handful of those outstanding. “The legislation used for banning orders is the most effective of its kind, and affords us the ability to ensure the vast majority of England supporters travelling to Russia are genuine fans who simply want to enjoy the tournament.” Forces throughout England and Wales have carried out enforcement action against banned individuals who failed to surrender their passports. Football-related arrests have fallen to record low since the introduction of football banning orders in 2000. The orders are imposed by courts and can last for up to 10 years. Breaching one is a criminal offence and can result in a fine of up to £5,000 and a six-month prison sentence. In addition to the banning orders, police will be deployed at major UK ports during the World Cup to stop known troublemakers from travelling to Russia before and during the tournament. A UK policing delegation is to travel to Russia, at the host country’s request, to assist Russian counterparts with policing the tournament. About 10,000 people are expected to travel from the UK to Russia to attend the World Cup. Nick Hurd, the policing minister, said: “The World Cup is a festival of football and is no place for violence or disorder. The UK’s system of football banning orders is unique and means that people intent on causing trouble in Russia will instead be staying at home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/15/mikey-and-nicky-review-john-cassavetes-peter-falk-elaine-may","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T12:00:16Z","webTitle":"Mikey and Nicky review – a neglected gem of 70s cinema","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/15/mikey-and-nicky-review-john-cassavetes-peter-falk-elaine-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/15/mikey-and-nicky-review-john-cassavetes-peter-falk-elaine-may","fields":{"headline":"Mikey and Nicky review – a neglected gem of 70s cinema","bodyText":"Masculinity never got more toxic, or more desolate, than in Mikey and Nicky, an extraordinary noir drama from the great writer, comic and film-maker Elaine May, which is showing in London next week. Starring John Cassavetes and Peter Falk, each at the top of his acting game, it is a neglected 1976 gem from a neglected Hollywood genius. May was known for her comedy but here proves absolutely fluent in the language of mobster lowlife, with an edge of caustic, disillusioned humour, and strange yet shockingly real outbursts of violence in which cafe owners and bus drivers are suddenly roughed up. Cassavetes is Nicky, a smalltimer who has stolen about a thousand dollars from the mob and now fears for his life. Hiding out in a flophouse, crazed with fear, sleeplessness, lack of food and the pain from a stomach ulcer, he calls his best friend from childhood, a connected guy called Mikey, played by Falk. Mikey shows up, wearily accustomed, it seems, to getting his buddy out of jams. He chivvies and begs and cajoles the querulous Nicky into getting shaved and dressed and coming with him to the airport where he can be spirited out of town. Nicky appears relieved yet somehow even more panicky. His moods turn on a dime, sometimes he is extravagantly grateful to his old friend, sometimes resentful and suspicious. Noting that Mikey keeps making payphone calls, Nicky keeps changing their plan – he cancels the airport idea suggesting the train instead; they head to a bar, a late-night cafe, an all-night movie theatre. He is of course right to be suspicious, because Mikey has been tasked by the mob with bringing Nicky in so he can be killed. But a weird, ambiguous current of meaning opens up between the two men as they roam the city and their childhood haunts – an unspoken negotiation. Perhaps Mikey might change his mind and let his friend get away, if his friend will only give him the genuine friendship and respect he has always craved from him. As for Nicky, he can’t be sure: openly accusing Mikey will cause him to lose the only ally and friend he has. And all the time, the clock is ticking. Nicky’s death is approaching. Maybe Mikey’s as well. Mikey and Nicky is a film about talking: the characters talk, talk, talk with theatrical vehemence and musicality. This is a stag-rutting choreography of the emotions, with a sour smell of lonely defeated men, a tang of being up all night with cigarettes and beer. May introduces women into the picture – the people who wait at home. Nicky’s abused girlfriend Nellie has to tolerate loathsome behaviour when the guys show up at her place in the middle of night. (She is played by the writer Carol Grace, who was married to William Saroyan and Walter Matthau and was acquainted with Truman Capote and may have partly inspired his character Holly Golightly.) Both men are in fact married. Mikey’s wife Annie (Rose Arrick) is a respectable wife and mother who waits for him patiently in their house in an elite neighbourhood. Nicky’s wife Jan (Joyce Van Patten) has left him and taken their baby to her mother’s. These are the people who are used to picking up the pieces when their bleary, depressed menfolk show up drunk at the family home at dawn. It is a vivid, almost sensually rancid slice of 1970s cinema, a movie in which you can almost taste the sweat in the air. There’s that wailing, moaning ambient sound of car horns on the soundtrack that you only get in American pictures of that era. And it is an extraordinary succession of scenes and tableaux: the bars – including one where Nicky makes a racist remark and narrowly escapes with his life – the movie theatre foyers, the buses, the streets. And above all, the faces; faces that Gillray or Hogarth might have drawn; faces from a nightmare or an odyssey through hell. • Mikey and Nicky is at the Lexi Cinema, London, on 18 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/15/the-piano-review-jane-campion-holly-hunter","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"The Piano review – Jane Campion's drama still hits all the right notes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/15/the-piano-review-jane-campion-holly-hunter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/15/the-piano-review-jane-campion-holly-hunter","fields":{"headline":"The Piano review – Jane Campion's drama still hits all the right notes","bodyText":"The re-release of Jane Campion’s mysterious film The Piano after 25 years is a chance to taste again its fetishism and voyeurism, its strange story of sexuality denied and displaced. It is also about the gravitational pull of death; Campion quotes Thomas Hood’s 1827 poem Silence at the very end of the credits: “There is a silence where hath been no sound, / There is a silence where no sound may be, / In the cold grave – under the deep deep sea.” (Perhaps she was savouring the fact that these words would be shown to near-emptied cinemas.) I once found something over-literary in this film. I felt it played like an adaptation of some forgotten 800-page Booker-shortlisted novel (it is actually from an original screenplay by Campion). And for what it is worth, I believe Campion’s masterpiece is her less well known Bright Star, from 2009, with Ben Whishaw as John Keats. But a second viewing of The Piano allowed me to see how unique it is. And yes, there are literary qualities: it has echoes of Angela Carter and Peter Carey, but these only add to its intelligence and distinction. And there is a fierce performance from Holly Hunter, whose face radiates intensity and enigma. Maybe, above everything else, a re-evaluation of The Piano is about seeing how little of its backstory should be taken at face value. Hunter plays Ada, a 19th-century Scottish woman who has agreed to make the arduous journey to New Zealand to marry a colonist there: Alisdair Stewart, played by the reliably excellent Sam Neill. Ada has brought along her infant daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), and among the possessions that have to be brought on to the beach by near-mutinous Māori servants when she arrives is a baby grand piano. Ada is mute; she uses sign language and writes notes – largely indignant orders and complaints – from a little pad and pencil strung around her neck. Her piano is a vital form of self-expression. Everything about Ada deeply disconcerts Alisdair, who declares that his servants cannot possibly transport this piano to their plantation. This is where his Scottish factotum comes in: Baines, played by Harvey Keitel, a man who affects Māori face markings and has, as they used to say, “gone native”. “Gone indigenous” doesn’t really convey the same imperialist flavour. Baines takes it upon himself to rescue the piano. He takes it to his own hut and asks Alisdair if he will consent to Ada giving him “lessons”. Bemused, trusting, glad of any way of appeasing his strange and angry bride, Alisdair agrees. In fact, Baines wants to watch her play, while in a state of progressive undress. His sexual obsession with her is soon requited, but the piano itself becomes a fetish, an occult symbol, generating the music of their secret love. So who is the father of Flora? Mother and daughter have a poignant consolatory fantasy about this man having been a German composer. It could be that Ada’s single-mother status was due to having once been respectably married and then widowed, and Ada does wear mourning black. This is what Alisdair believes, or wants to believe, knowing that, in the marriage market, he has little to offer but hardship. He may also assume Ada’s situation means she cannot afford to be squeamish about work and conjugal duties. But it is at least as possible that Ada has been raped – her own father’s culpability is not out of the question – and that her inability to speak is due to this. She says she lost her speech when she was six (roughly the age Flora is now) but that may not be true. We just have to ponder what has happened. The pain, and the grim determination with which the pain has been suppressed, give a force to the film. There are many extraordinary images: the piano itself, surreally marooned on the beach, is emblematic of the European imperial adventure. The amateur performance of Bluebeard by the white incomers, disrupted by its audience, is a bizarre and ominous episode. Ada’s final fainting in the mud and rain, her stark black dress ballooning up around her, makes her look like some dying sea monster, or a squid squirting out ink, or a ghost. Her love scenes with Baines are gamey and strange but also sensuous and moving. The fact that Baines’s nakedness is revealed to us well before Ada’s shows how unusual its depiction of sex is compared to most films, then as now. And Hunter’s performance is outstanding. So is the film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/13/michael-gove-appoints-uk-tree-champion","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T09:50:33Z","webTitle":"Michael Gove appoints UK 'tree champion'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/13/michael-gove-appoints-uk-tree-champion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/13/michael-gove-appoints-uk-tree-champion","fields":{"headline":"Michael Gove appoints UK 'tree champion'","bodyText":"The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has appointed a “tree champion” to stop unnecessary felling of trees and boost planting rates. Sir William Worsley, chairman of the National Forest Company which oversees the National Forest, has been appointed to support government promises to plant 11 million trees, plus a further 1 million in towns and cities. The move, part of the pledges in the government’s 25-year environment plan, comes after a controversial tree-felling programme in Sheffield. The Guardian revealed last month how Network Rail drew up a policy document exploring the option of removing all leaf fall trees from alongside its tracks in a programme of enhanced clearance. Network Rail says the document is “a piece of modelling work” that was not adopted as policy. Tree planting in England is at its lowest rate for a generation, while the loss of existing woodland is happening at an accelerated rate due to weak planning laws, according to campaigners. It is hoped Worsley will bring together mayors, city leaders and local government to prevent the unnecessary felling of street trees, while also backing the introduction of a new duty for councils to properly consult communities before removing trees. Gove said: “We have a responsibility to make sure the next generation inherit the woodlands, forests and trees they deserve. We are beginning to see good progress in growing tree cover, but we need to go further - and faster.” Worsley said: “Trees and woods are an important part of my life, as they are to local communities. They transform our landscapes, improve our health and well-being and help grow the economy. “I look forward to working with stakeholders and local authorities to promote these benefits and grow the country’s woodland cover.” Jo Johnson, the rail minister, called a halt to all current tree felling during what is the nesting season and commissioned a review into other options than felling for the rail operator. The review will report at the end of the summer. • This article was amended on 24 August 2018 following a complaint from Network Rail. The readers’ editor substantially upheld the complaint, finding that in initial reports the status of the leaked policy options document had been overstated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/13/julen-lopetegui-sacked-spain-manager-real-madrid-job","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T10:04:12Z","webTitle":"Julen Lopetegui sacked by Spain as Fernando Hierro takes over","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/13/julen-lopetegui-sacked-spain-manager-real-madrid-job","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/13/julen-lopetegui-sacked-spain-manager-real-madrid-job","fields":{"headline":"Spain sack manager Julen Lopetegui as Fernando Hierro takes over","bodyText":"Spain’s squad have been plunged into crisis after the coach Julen Lopetegui was sacked just two days before their opening World Cup game against Portugal in Sochi, with the director of football, Fernando Hierro, named as his replacement. The president of the Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, insisted that he had little choice but to terminate Lopetegui’s contract as a matter of principle after the coach negotiated with Real Madrid behind the federation’s back. The sacking comes in response to the news, released on Tuesday afternoon, that Lopetegui had agreed to take over at Real Madrid after the World Cup ends. That came as a huge surprise. Neither the players nor Hierro nor the president knew of the decision until moments before it was made public. Rubiales said that he had received a phone call from Madrid five minutes before they issued a statement announcing the appointment. He flew from Moscow to Krasnodar on Tuesday night, leaving the Fifa congress to head to the national team’s HQ to discuss how best to resolve the situation. Just after 1pm on Wednesday afternoon, after discussions with the players, he announced the decision to sack the coach, describing it as an “obligation” on a “sad day”. The announcement that Hierro would be his replacement followed three hours later. “It is a nice challenge. I could not say no: I would not have forgiven myself,” Hierro said. “We are in an extremely difficult situation; this is very, very hard,” Rubiales had said earlier. He and Lopetegui were due to appear before the media the following morning but that was put back and when Rubiales eventually appeared, an hour and a half later than scheduled, he did so alone. Another planned press conference with Lopetegui, subsequently pencilled in to follow that of the federation president, was cancelled. Rubiales had spent the morning talking to players, led by Sergio Ramos, who argued for the coach to continue. Ultimately, though, he chose to sack Lopetegui with immediate effect. “There are decisions that we are obliged to take based on an understanding of how you should behave and on ethics,” he said. He added that it was legitimate for Lopetegui to negotiate with Real Madrid but not for the federation to find out just five minutes before a formal announcement was made, a matter of hours before the beginning of the tournament. Although he sought not to point the finger directly at Madrid or Lopetegui, insisting that “if it was up to the coach I am sure he would have done things differently”, Rubiales was furious. He has been the president of the federation for less than a month and has already been forced to manage his first great crisis. He said that there was no negotiation with Real Madrid and that his request that the announcement be delayed was ignored, with the deal made public before he could respond. He attempted to contact Lopetegui to speak to him but was unable to do so as the coach was telling his news to the players. Madrid released the statement “five minutes” later, he said. “The national team belongs to everyone and we have to send a clear message to all employees at the federation that there is a way of behaving, that there are ethics,” he said. “Julen has worked phenomenally well; I have nothing at all to complain about there. But the way that this has happened obliged me to take this decision. This is a very hard day and now we have decisions to make just two days before the World Cup starts.” It was later confirmed that Hierro, who won 89 caps for Spain, would take charge of the team for the duration of the World Cup. “I am grateful that Fernando said yes,” Rubiales said. “This [episode] has not left a good taste but we will overcome this.” Hierro said: “We’ve come to fight for the World Cup. The team is excited. We have a great opportunity and that should be the focus. The message from the team was fantastic. If I were not convinced of our aspirations, I would not be here. The key will be to change as little as possible.” The Juventus manager Max Allegri, meanwhile, has claimed he turned down an offer from Real Madrid to take over from Zinedine Zidane. Speaking to Sky Italia, he said: “Real Madrid and Chelsea? Let’s say I said yes to Juventus. I spoke with the president and it was right for me to stay at Juventus. It was a decision I had already made.” “I decided to stay at Juve and I respected what I said, I thank the president of Real who gave me the chance to go. Chelsea? The decision to remain at Juventus had been taken and it was right to confirm the word given to Juventus.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"games/2018/jun/14/unravel-two-review","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T13:00:48Z","webTitle":"Unravel Two review – adorable yarn adventure knits in co-op play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/14/unravel-two-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/jun/14/unravel-two-review","fields":{"headline":"Unravel Two review – adorable yarn adventure knits in co-op play","bodyText":"The first Unravel game was a welcome surprise back in 2015, when it was announced by a nervous man holding a handmade yarn toy alongside publisher EA’s more traditional menu of guns, cars, and (foot)balls. This year, EA went one better, announcing and releasing an equally adorable sequel on the same day. But despite appearances, Unravel Two is very different to its predecessor. The first was a solitary adventure in which a curious little character made of yarn explored a world much larger than him, dragging everyday objects around so he could clamber on to them, and using the unravelled thread of his body to build bridges or swing from branches. The second features similarly mundane but beautiful environments – from forests and streams to playgrounds and barns – but with two yarn characters that can be controlled by two players together. They are attached to each other, and there’s much more freedom of movement – bigger jumps, more momentum. In this game, navigation requires cooperation. Maybe one of you needs to hold an obstacle out of the other’s way, or loop around objects and provide a rope for the other to climb. Some of these puzzles are inventive, and they’re often designed so both players get to take turns being the more active participant. But there’s an over-reliance on the yarn characters using each other as pivots to swing over gaps too large to jump across, which feels great but requires little thought. There are also challenges more easily navigated by just one character: time-sensitive segments that involve running from danger or jumping on platforms that disappear. Thankfully, one character can “hitch a ride”, jumping on the other’s back and becoming intertwined with them for however long the player wants. You can even play the entire game alone, moving one character into position and then switching to the other to solve the puzzles, then combining them into one to get through the action sequences. But this is clearly meant to be a two-player experience. Even the story, told in brief, blurry moving images in the background of each level, features two children helping each other to avoid danger. If that wasn’t enough of a parallel, the colours of the children’s clothes match the colour of your yarn characters. Confusingly, these ghostly vignettes affect the tangible world through which your characters travel, perhaps opening a door or setting a fire. Peril is far more frequent than in the first Unravel; one segment has you fleeing a forest fire, with smoke-like enemies that feel out of place in these everyday environments. The seven main levels are supplemented by several smaller but much more cerebral challenge levels, which combined feel like a separate puzzle game thrown in for free. That division between the puzzles and the action characterises the conflict at the heart of Unravel Two. In introducing cooperative multiplayer, it has opened up an entirely new way to experience the adorable conceit of yarn characters making their way through a gigantic human world – but in freeing up movement and removing some of the friction, it has lost a little of the original’s focus and heart. Unravel Two is out now for £17.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/15/stanley-a-man-of-variety-review-timothy-spall","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T05:00:09Z","webTitle":"Stanley: A Man of Variety review – Timothy Spall communes with the comedy greats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/15/stanley-a-man-of-variety-review-timothy-spall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/15/stanley-a-man-of-variety-review-timothy-spall","fields":{"headline":"Stanley: A Man of Variety review – Timothy Spall communes with the comedy greats","bodyText":"Timothy Spall turns in an accomplished performance in this macabre, airless and weirdly oppressive film; the movie equivalent of a one-man theatre show, the screenplay for which Spall developed with the project’s director, Stephen Cookson. He plays Stanley, a middle-aged man imprisoned in a nightmarish Victorian-era psychiatric hospital. He is like a cross between Reginald Christie and Philip Larkin without the poems but with a dad worryingly like Larkin’s. Stanley appears to be the only person there, tormented by garbled memories of his family and what he did to get incarcerated, and pitifully obsessed with being granted leave to visit his daughter’s grave. Stanley is also a superfan of comedy icons from the 40s to the 70s and starts hallucinating visitations from these theatrical and showbiz icons of yesteryear, including Noël Coward, Max Wall, Tony Hancock, Alastair Sim playing Scrooge and Peter Sellers playing the Indian doctor from The Millionairess. Spall, with great skill, plays them all, like Alec Guinness in Kind Hearts and Coronets or indeed Peter Sellers in Dr Strangelove. (It is also like a surreal version of the wacky act that Tommy Cooper used to do in half-and-half costumes – turning to his left, he was the Nazi interrogator, turning to his right, he was the stoic British officer refusing to buckle under pressure.) Stanley’s claustrophobic ordeal continues until we finally get an answer about his past. But this, slightly unsatisfyingly, comes in the form of intertitles just before the closing credits and doesn’t really emerge in the drama itself.

Aisha is a hologram, and I’m “playing” a US customs officer in an augmented reality experience called Terminal 3. I spend 15 minutes in my fictional airport, asking her questions based on choices that appear in writing in my field of vision. My voice triggers her responses – which start off clipped and defensive but become increasingly intimate – to the point where I feel like I’d really like to hang out with her. Aisha is one of six participants of Muslim descent that were filmed with Depthkit technology to enable a surprisingly lifelike encounter that challenges stereotypes. It puts me in the position of authority – do I choose the tough questions or the softer ones? At the end I’m asked to decide whether to let her in to the country or detain her further. There’s a lot of hype around augmented reality at the moment but this piece – which came about after the director, Asad J Malik, had a bad experience with a customs officer in Abu Dhabi – had a narrative thrust that felt different to what’s gone before. You could imagine this sort of encounter happening in your own home in the not too distant future. It was one of many immersive installations at Sheffield Doc/Fest’s Alternate Realities programme, which featured 27 interactive and immersive projects including films, games and web projects. Experiences ranged from Gabo Arora and Saschka Unseld’s The Day the World Changed, a room-scale experience that bears witness to Hiroshima survivors and makes a powerful case for nuclear disarmament, to Martin Hertig’s playful Sensible Data / Mixed Emotions installation, in which three machines translate a selfie into a real-time drawing of your face accompanied by an email revealing your age, gender, “beauty levels” and mood – a witty comment on personal data collection. Dan Tucker, programmer for Alternate Realities, divided offerings into two strands: The World Unknown to You – installations with impact that take you to places that are hard to access or imagine – and Better Known Truths – 360-degree films experienced in a headset. Housed this year in Trafalgar Warehouse, a suitably grungy industrial building, the exhibition was free. I chatted to a lady in her 70s who’d returned over several days and was amazed that this sort of storytelling existed. Many of the 360 films I saw seemed to have finally dispensed with the idea of “taking you into someone else’s world” by simply placing a static camera in a location. Grenfell: Our Home, made by the indie production company Parable, filmed and interviewed a group of survivors in stereoscopic 360. Rather than dwell on the well-trodden news lines, the piece is about their homes in the tower, with their plants, artefacts and hand-drawn murals sensitively reimagined through animation. Benoît Felici’s The Real Thing is a charming film set in the Chinese towns of Suzhou and Tianducheng, where replicas of famous European landmarks – including Venice’s canals, Tower Bridge and the Eiffel Tower – exist. The surreal 360 journeys through these towns are complemented by first-hand stories from people who live there, such as the photographer who muses on what it might be like to live in the “real” European city while photographing Chinese couples in their wedding attire. Face to Face, commissioned by the festival and winner of the alternate realities virtual reality award, was an extraordinary three-room experience involving the shocking story of Michelle Fox who, in 2009, was injured in a near-fatal gun accident caused by her ex-husband. She lost her eyes, nose and upper palate and now wears a silicone facial prosthetic made specially for her. The photojournalist Michelle Gabel had been documenting her life since 2014 and was then introduced to Michaela Holland, an immersive storyteller who collaborated with them on this piece. Each room in the installation is based on spaces from Fox’s home. The first is a living room, where I’m invited to spend 15 minutes absorbing her world. The walls are lined with family photographs, kids’ drawings and cuddly toys. The TV streams old home movies of her: dancing with her toddler, at a birthday party, playing dress-up with her daughter – all pre-accident. But in a drawer is a police witness statement from her friend Rebecca, describing what happened on the day of the accident. It’s gut-wrenching, visceral and heartbreaking. In the second room, a blue bathroom, I’m told to choose a facial “prosthetic”. These are in fact bespoke 3D-printed VR headsets with faces of different skin tones – there are seven or eight to choose from, and I duly reach for one that matches mine. When I don the headset, I see Michelle standing at her bathroom mirror, a bandana around her upper face, preparing to put her prosthetic on. The 360 film voiced by her shows moments of her daily life interwoven with animation and photographs. We glimpse what being blind has been like for her – like the fact that her daughter will forever remain as a five-year-old in her mind’s eye. What happens in the final room (a dining space) catches me off guard – although I won’t give the surprise away since Face to Face will hopefully be shown in other venues. Traumatic events and memories was a theme in the exhibition - just as it often is in documentary filmmaking. Mind at War was made by Australian comic book illustrator Sutu who tells the story of Scott England’s experience of PTSD after he enlisted in the US military and was posted to Iraq. Drawn with Google’s Tiltbrush, the most powerful scenes are the moments in Iraq when he’s desperately hoping not to shoot anyone and when he witnesses a father setting himself on fire after his son was run over by the US military. The experience is going to be used by NGO’s such as the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) to raise awareness of PTSD and the ambition is to distribute it for free as widely as possible. Vestige is a beautiful room scale VR piece which explores the memories of Lisa Elin in the aftermath of her husband Eric’s death in 2016. Director Aaron Bradbury had over 15 hours of audio interview with Lisa recorded over the phone. This became the backbone to scenes that visualise some of the stories she tells with the use of two actors playing Lisa and Eric who were volumetrically motion captured. It’s a bit like stepping into someone’s fragmented mind – the memories come thick and fast, brought to life by her effervescent, passionate voice. Life in VR: California Coast offered welcome relief from such intense affairs. A stunning CGI interactive experience from BBC Studios, it explored underwater ecosystems from microscopic creatures to sea otters and the humpback whale – a virtual Blue Planet that enabled you to swim with these creatures. This is VR that encapsulates the BBC’s core mission to inform, educate and entertain. As with many of the works showing at Sheffield Doc/Fest, it suggests that virtual reality is becoming ever more complex, rich and thought-provoking.

The relaxation of immigration rules, which is due to be announced imminently, represents a victory for Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid and follows a vociferous campaign by NHS organisations and medical groups. They have been arguing that medics should be taken out of the cap on skilled workers allowed to work in Britain, in order to help tackle the NHS’s deepening workforce crisis. Hunt, the health and social care secretary, and Javid, the home secretary, have been privately lobbying the prime minister to ease restrictions that between November and April denied more than 2,300 doctors from outside the European Economic Area the chance to work in the NHS. Under the current immigration system the number of non-EEA skilled workers of all sorts able to come and work in Britain on a tier-2 visa through a certificate of sponsorship is capped at 20,700 a year – a ceiling set by the Home Office. However, the government has decided that the NHS’s need for more doctors is so great that they should be treated differently, well-placed sources have told the Guardian. The rethink should mean that doctors are no longer left unable to take up job offers from hospitals and GP surgeries because they cannot get a visa. There will now be a separate system to decide which medics come. Recent official figures show that the NHS in England alone is short of 9,982 doctors. Those refused tier-2 visas in recent months have included GPs, psychiatrists and cancer specialists, all of which have a significant number of vacancies. Hospitals have said their inability to recruit doctors from outside the EEA would lead to patients facing longer waiting times for treatment and hit patient safety. Andrew Foster, chief executive of the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS hospital trust recently condemned the “bonkers decision” to ban doctors whom the NHS desperately needed. “It’s absolutely barmy that one branch of government is trying to increase the capacity of the NHS and another branch is stopping it from doing so”, he said. “Last year we got 60 doctors and we had no trouble with visas. This year, [during] the first two months we were denied all visas and in the latest round we have been successful in less than 10 cases out of the 100 [they had applied for].” Hospitals have been unable to hire doctors they had identified as highly skilled and necessary recruits because the cap on the number of professionals given a visa has been reached in each of the last seven months. The Home Office had made clear that if the rules were to change so they would operate differently in the third quarter of the year, which includes August, when newly-qualified young doctors start their NHS training, any relaxation of the policy had to be agreed by the end of this week. It is unclear if nurses will also be taken out of the cap system. They are already classed as a shortage occupation by the Home Office’s migration advisory committee. As such some nurses have been deemed a greater priority than doctors in recent months when officials have been deciding who will get tier-2 visas. Hunt has argued that doctors and nurses should be treated differently to other skilled migrants on a temporary basis, until increases in the numbers of homegrown staff he has instigated produce more British NHS staff. “If reports that the cap will be lifted for doctors are true, it will be a welcome relief to trusts in addressing immediate staff shortages, to help ensure safe, high quality care,” said Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts in England. “These visa restrictions have been a major obstacle to recruiting much-needed medical staff. For trusts it has resulted in unfilled vacancies, often filled by paying premium locum rates. For doctors, they may have given up on working in the NHS and decided to work in another country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/12/jonny-may-penalties-killing-england-south-africa-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T21:03:00Z","webTitle":"Penalties are killing England, says Jonny May before second South Africa Test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/12/jonny-may-penalties-killing-england-south-africa-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/12/jonny-may-penalties-killing-england-south-africa-test","fields":{"headline":"Penalties are killing England, says Jonny May before second South Africa Test","bodyText":"England’s players have held a meeting to discuss their on-field discipline and vowed to clean up their act in the second Test against South Africa on Saturday. After four successive Test defeats the squad have acknowledged they urgently need to reduce their penalty count if South Africa are not to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series. The defeat in Johannesburg last Saturday has left England little margin for error and, with Joe Launchbury still struggling for full fitness, the wing Jonny May accepts the pressure is mounting. “We should have realised by now the impact one penalty has on the momentum of a game, let alone back‑to‑back penalties,” he said. “In the Six Nations it killed us and it was as bad as ever at the weekend. “We have spoken as a group because we’re desperate to be the best. One penalty can really get a team going. It’s such a frustrating one because we don’t want to be giving away penalties. We know better than that. But at the moment hands up, it’s on us, because it’s not good enough. You might think it’s just a silly penalty but it can change the game. “I don’t really think about losing five in a row. I’m sure the other boys are like that as well. But we know what is at stake. We want to win the series and the pressure is on us but we have to make sure we don’t turn too desperate because it will lead to people trying too hard. Maybe that’s what we’re doing: forcing it a bit too much. “The things that are making us come unstuck are things that we can fix ourselves.” Eddie Jones will confirm England’s second Test lineup for Bloemfontein on Thursday – the hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie’s sore hamstring on the mend – and the players are keen to replicate the form they showed in the first 20 minutes at Ellis Park. “We almost shocked ourselves with how good we were in that first 20 minutes,” May said. “Eddie said that is the best he has seen us play and he has been around a lot. We felt we never should have lost that game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jul/03/kray-twins-fred-foreman-east-end-gangster","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-03T12:00:02Z","webTitle":"East End gangster Fred Foreman: ‘You don’t prove you’re a hard man by stabbing someone’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/03/kray-twins-fred-foreman-east-end-gangster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jul/03/kray-twins-fred-foreman-east-end-gangster","fields":{"headline":"East End gangster Fred Foreman: ‘You don’t prove you’re a hard man by stabbing someone’","bodyText":"Old villains don’t die these days, they end up as books or films. Half a century after Jack “The Hat” McVitie was murdered by Reggie Kray, the man who had the job of disposing of his body is the subject of Fred: the Godfather of British Crime, a new documentary. The film comes just a couple of years after the publication of The Last Real Gangster, the eighth book to which Fred Foreman has attached his name. We meet in a cafe overlooking the canal in Little Venice, west London, far from the Battersea of his war-time boyhood, the East End of his long association with the Krays and his involvement in at least three murders, and just around the corner from the sheltered accommodation where he now lives. Death comes in less dramatic forms these days. “It’s God’s waiting list,” he says of his current home. “Two died there last week. That’s all I’m looking forward to – when is it my turn?” He says this with a chuckle as he tucks into his veal, spaghetti and red wine. He has even chosen the music for his funeral, he says, a 1930s song called Live and Let Live. Some might question whether that was quite the theme tune of his life of professional crime. And it would be fair to say that no one has acquired quite as many nicknames as Foreman. Apart from the tagline of the film – “I’m not the Godfather, not Marlon Brando!” he protests – there is the Undertaker, the High Executioner, Brown Bread Fred, the Guv’nor, the Mean Machine and the tortuous Managing Director of British Crime, which was forced on him by his first publisher. Now 86, Foreman was acquitted of two 1960s murders, those of Tommy “Ginger” Marks and Frank “the Mad Axeman” Mitchell, both of which he later admitted in his autobiography, Respect, when it was published in 1997. In those days, the double jeopardy rule meant that you could not be tried twice for the same crime, but the law changed with the 2003 Criminal Justice Act so that “new and compelling” evidence can lead to a retrial. Marks had been involved in an attack on Foreman’s philandering brother, George, who was shot in the groin for having an affair with a local villain’s wife. Foreman is a little coy on the subject when pressed on film about all this by its director, Paul Van Carter. “I’m not happy about this, Paul,” he says at one stage as he revisits the scene in Bethnal Green where Marks was shot dead in 1965 and is asked to describe what happened. “I don’t know. I wasn’t there.” He is equally tightlipped about Mitchell, whom the Krays had helped escape from Dartmoor prison and hidden in London, but who had become a loose cannon; according to Foreman today, Mitchell had been armed and vowed to take six policemen with him rather than return to jail. The Krays he now describes as “bad news” – and the film makes it clear what a grim and brutal crew they were. He is also reticent about his undertaking skills in disposing of McVitie, for which he was jailed for 10 years in 1969. “There was a facility to go out to sea,” he says in the film. “Let’s just leave it at that.” That facility was for a body to be wrapped in chicken wire, attached to weights and dumped in “muddy waters”. Gang warfare in its current form has claimed many lives already this year, with dozens of fatal stabbings in London, many of them gang-related and involving much younger men than in the 1960s mayhem. How do the two worlds compare? “I think it’s terrible what’s going on,” he says. “ I have no respect for anyone just stabbing someone with a 12-inch blade – a child can stab another person. You don’t prove you’re a hard man by stabbing someone. Years ago, when you had an argument, it was a matter of a straightener – a street fight, bare-knuckle. This showed how tough you were.” Would any of today’s young post-code gang members, who also seek that word “respect” by stabbing each other, be writing their memoirs or appearing on film in half a century? “I don’t think anyone who has turned to crime these days is going to live long enough to build up a reputation, are they? It’s impossible to get away with it now, with all the CCTV and everything.” Born in 1932, the son of a respectable taxi driver and the youngest of five brothers, the elder of whom served in the second world war, Foreman was initially evacuated but returned during the blitz and witnessed some of its effects, which, he says, still give him nightmares. His own teenage years involved different forms of violence to the knife-wielders and moped robbers of today. “I was at the Old Bailey at 16 years of age for affray. One of the weapons produced in evidence was a sand-weighted sock.” He laughs at the memory. “But I don’t want to glamourise what I did because it’s not fucking glamorous, is it? I’ve done 16 years inside, so when you weigh up the pros and cons of it I don’t see it balancing out in my favour. All the money I got out of crime, it doesn’t pay off in the long term. The lessons speak for themselves: missing all your birthdays and Christmases and new years, missing out on your children growing up.” He says he sees little of his own family now. So what about those old crimes he has written about in the past? “I don’t want to glorify anything,” he says of the murders. “They’ve got relatives and I don’t want to keep rubbing it in. I knew Jack the Hat’s boys when I was living in Spain and we were quite pals together; they used to have a drink with me in Eagles, the country club I had there.” But in the film he describes in some detail shooting, not fatally, two men who had assaulted a young woman in one of his clubs. (He had an extensive property portfolio before the law caught up with him, which included clubs, pubs, flats, a casino, a recording studio and a boxing gym.) “Blew his ear off,” he says of one of the miscreants. “That was the end of that little scenario.” The foreword to The Last Real Gangster, published in 2015, was written by the actor Tom Hardy, who consulted Foreman as he prepared to play both Kray twins in Legend, the Brian Helgeland film that broke box office records that year. What did he think of the film? “Not much – but Tom Hardy was amazing. There’s only been one film (of that genre) I really liked and that was The Long Good Friday. Everyone says it was based on me – there were so many similarities.” His other long jail sentence, of nine years, was for involvement in the £6m Security Express robbery in Shoreditch, east London, in 1983. Foreman was arrested years later for handling the proceeds of the robbery after he had moved to the Costa del Crime in Spain, bought property and opened his club. Much to his indignation, as there was then no extradition treaty between Spain and the UK, he was hoisted back to England still in his shorts and flip-flops. The robbery’s ringleader was Terry Perkins who died, aged 69, earlier this year in Belmarsh jail, having been convicted of the 2015 £14m Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary. Would he have gone with Perkins on that “one last job” if he had been asked? “I’m retired! Can’t do it any more.” How did the film, which has the song “Oh, sinner man, where you gonna run to?” over its end titles, come about?

If for Maradona the ball was a musical instrument, for Messi it’s a tool which he utilises with a stunning sense of efficacy.” Valdano was part of Argentina’s most recent World Cup-winning team and Maradona’s on-field partner in that 1986 final. He does not use the word genius lightly. Attempts to explain Messi’s genius have provoked a non-negligible body of literature. Outstanding among the crop is Ramiro Martín’s A Genius in the School Football. “Aimar used to say one doesn’t think on the pitch, one makes decisions,” Martín said, referring to the former Argentina playmaker. “Messi does so in a fraction of a split second and 90% of the time he makes the right decision.” “Messi is two, three players at once,” Javier Mascherano once said, and he recently clarified for me what he means: “Conceptually, Leo does what in other teams you need three players to do: he takes care of creating play, finishing and assisting all at the same time.” Messi’s stats are a testament to this; he has surpassed most on goals scored but also in terms of assists. Mascherano thinks the constant improvement makes Messi all the more spectacular: “He is continually in ascendant evolution – year after year he becomes a better player.” On-field genius comes with an off‑pitch low profile that has rendered him enigmatic to say the least. He rarely says much and when he does it is hardly amazing. The writer John Carlin once said that having interviewed Messi twice, if he were offered him again he would refuse. “Shy,” everyone says, and almost as often the reference comes with “not so much shy as introverted”. What is unarguable is that Messi’s savant qualities exist. And that is what is of interest. After Argentina achieved second place at the 2014 World Cup, playing every minute of the tournament with every fibre of their beings, there was a hideous backlash back home dwelling on the mistakes, the could-have-beens, the ifs and the buts. The cross Messi has to bear for being Argentinian but not having won a major trophy for the nation is as unbearable as it is ridiculous. The dichotomy between club and country is the single most referred-to question thrown my way when it comes to Messi, ever since he sat on the bench as an unused substitute in 2006, sulking while Argentina went out to Germany. How come he delivers so much for Barcelona and so little for Argentina? Is it Andrés Iniesta? He doesn’t sing the national anthem was one of the criticisms. And he never played in his own country’s first division. A perception has been voiced that somehow he is sometimes a ravenous winner (for Barcelona) and other times a disconnected outsider who does not feel the emotion of the strip (for Argentina). The author Andrés Burgo disputes this. “There was never a ravenous Messi and another disconnected one: he was always ravenously disconnected,” he wrote in 2015. That came after the 2014 “fiasco” was followed by Messi leading Argentina to another final, the Copa América, where they lost against Chile. Ravenous, disconnected, introverted and somehow remarkably “one more in the team” and “just a normal guy” – quite a feat for probably the most famous guy in the world. “You’re better known than Coca-Cola,” the political journalist Luis Majul told him a few months ago in an interview aired in Argentina and Messi laughed. Why? Was it the fact itself or the nature of the comparison that cracked him up? Majul asked, as if talking to a child (because interviewers talk to him as if he is a child): “What are you laughing at? It’s true.” The reply was a shrug, an “I don’t know”, some sort of “I never think about myself in those terms” thing. A more recent interview with the popular football programme Líbero visited Messi’s personal museum of balls, trophies and football shirts – the shirts signed by former team‑mates, rivals, legends. He shows off Iniesta’s, the most recent addition: “I never asked him for his shirt before, because I was still enjoying him,” he said; now that Iniesta has left Barcelona he dared ask. “You are the number one, there is no one like you,” Iniesta’s message says. Huge efforts from the Messi brand are being poured into highlighting that he gives these interviews to Argentinian media. The view that Messi has matured – now that he is a father – and adopted leadership skills, that he is more sure of himself and dares be who he wants to be, is further illustrated by his relatively new image. “The ornamental beard, so in vogue, so ex‑con,” was the cynical take from the professional social provocateur Esteban Schmidt in Argentina. The Beckham-style tattoos (at least one of which has been removed) present a more masculine, muscular Messi. Gone is the shy antisocial Messi; in comes the new leader. “In spite of media efforts to Maradonise him, he really doesn’t pick players, select squads, or dictate formations or lineups,” said a source from within team Messi to counter rumours rife in Argentina. Much was made of the fact that in a friendly against Spain in March, when he asked not to play because of muscle fatigue, he went into the dressing room at half-time to give the pep talk. At Brazil 2014, after an initial defensive formation, apparently Messi sent word to the coach, Alejandro Sabella, that the players weren’t happy, and a more offensive lineup reigned henceforth. We can track rumours of the modus operandi back years; allegedly he texted managers with his tactical critique from the bus after a match, seats away from the manager. He is more comfortable texting than speaking. Juan Sebastián Verón claimed that the only time he saw him nervous enough to lose sleep (Messi sleeps on average a couple of hours more than most athletes, including a sacred afternoon nap) was when he had to speak to the squad as captain in 2010. Verón said Messi paced the room they shared anxiously. Messi’s phone is his friend. To the point that on the friendly tour of Manchester and Madrid it was leaked that he sat, head hung low, staring at the screen even at mealtimes; that younger players in awe dared not approach. His longstanding osteopath of yesteryear José Brau said: “The way to understand him is to watch his body language: when his head is down it’s as if he was putting up a Do Not Disturb sign.” Sometimes his head appears to be low on the pitch and he goes on to score some impossible goal and it is on the pitch that we should observe him. “A genetic miracle,” Fernando Signorini told me. Signorini has worked as a trainer with footballers for as long as he can remember and was in charge of Argentina’s physical coaching at the 2010 World Cup. “Just like Diego, his neuromuscular coordination has a cosmic power. Almost unthinkable ability to control their body in time and space, defying gravity. At maximum speed, he can take two steps with the same leg and the ball. I’ve tried to do it on sand and I couldn’t. Leo and Diego do it routinely, at high velocity, surrounded by the greatest players in the world trying to stop them. That’s how I would define his genius.” The challenge then is to create the environment that will best enable him to thrive. Successive Argentina managers have spent inordinate amounts of time not only meeting Messi on regular trips to Barcelona but questioning Pep Guardiola, the coach widely regarded as having got the best out of him. Guardiola is said to have told Sabella: “Speak to him the bare minimum, only when absolutely necessary.” Martín remembers Guardiola showing him video footage he would put in front of Messi accompanied by light hints. “What do you think if we try this?” Or: “It seems to me that we could have an opportunity if we did that …” “Suggest,” Guardiola says. And let him be. Jorge Sampaoli has also been briefed by Guardiola. Argentina’s coach seems to be cracking the Messi enigma. Sources close to the footballer say he was very pleased after their first meeting, because they “only spoke about football”. It is in keeping with Guardiola’s stance to stick to the subject. The anguish Messi feels when he loses is clear. The image of him sobbing in the arms of Mascherano after defeat in one final, the surprise retirement from international football after another (he was lured back) are indicative of a frustration bordering on the unbearable. But the absurdity of the burden the national flag represents subjects him to constant backlash – his every utterance turned against him in the most unexpected ways. “Do you feel you owe the World Cup to the Argentinian people,” he was asked. “We owe it to ourselves,” Messi replied. A barrage of manufactured controversy ensued: Messi does not feel indebted to the nation. A traitor, motivated by the deep Qatari-sponsored coffers of Barcelona more than by the glorious emotive weight of the national strip. The sports psychologist Marcelo Roffé, who worked with Messi’s generation of players at youth level, said it wasn’t Maradona who is ill – Argentinian society is ill. “How can a person be psychologically prepared to tolerate the ‘poison’ of success?” he said. “It’s not easy.” Messi has enjoyed his football more with Barcelona. The familiarity with his team-mates and his surroundings notwithstanding, perhaps he really is a creature of habit. He apparently likes order and is himself very ordered; Argentina maybe throws just that little bit more chaos his way than he can handle. Unlike Maradona, who thrived on conflict and feeds off opposition, Messi seems to need cooperation in order to succeed. He functions best as part of a well-oiled machine. It’s difficult to match that concept with Argentina, on any level. Plenty of Argentinians are football lovers in the purest sense, content to share the fact that we are from the same country as Messi and satisfied with the joy he has given. “I love you just the way you are; without cups or trophies” Alejandro Wall titled a feature-length ode of gratitude, voicing the feeling of millions. But plenty more, and perhaps the media are more guilty of this than most, still feel something is incomplete. Mascherano told me Messi has a conditioning effect on the collective performance. He also believes Messi’s best version depends on the team and Messi seems to echo this, always claiming he wins nothing alone. Maradona won a World Cup for Argentina practically single‑handedly, but at a cost. To himself and perhaps the collective ego of the nation. “This has to be very clearly stated: Messi is not Maradona; whether we like it or not,” Roffé has said. “As Argentines, we have done a lot of damage to Maradona. We can’t stop consuming him, as if he was a substance. Let’s hope with Messi we learn to modify our behaviour.” This is almost certainly Messi’s last chance to win a World Cup so the onus and pressure are on the other 22 players. Are they up to the task of helping the genius emerge triumphant? Will anything change if they do? Discussing Messi’s fantastic maturity and fitness level, Sampaoli was asked whether this was “Messi’s World Cup”. He replied: “This one, the next one, and the one after that.” It is not as if he is going to play until he is 50, came the retort from the floor, to which Sampaoli replied: “I don’t know.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2018/jun/15/great-exhibition-north-best-days-out-newcastle-gateshead","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T05:30:08Z","webTitle":"Great Exhibition of the North: best days out in the north-east","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jun/15/great-exhibition-north-best-days-out-newcastle-gateshead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jun/15/great-exhibition-north-best-days-out-newcastle-gateshead","fields":{"headline":"Great Exhibition of the North: best days out in the north-east","bodyText":"Paul Smith, lead singer, Maximo Park I came up the A19 from Teesside to Tyneside as a student and never left.

If you need an independent substitute for your Greggs fix, Pink Lane Bakery provides homemade pasties, cakes and vegan treats. Across the road is the Amnesty Bookshop, which always has interesting stock. For secondhand vinyl, try RPM and Beatdown Records. Culture-wise, check out the Cluny, an excellent music venue; the Star &amp; Shadow, a leftfield, volunteer-run cinema and event space; and Workplace Gallery in Gateshead, which hosts up-and-coming artists and the occasional “happening”. • Maximo Park play the sold-out opening event on 22 June; Paul Smith DJs at the Parental Guidance Party at Sage Gateshead, 1 July, free, sagegateshead.com Becky Unthank, singer, the Unthanks If you’re walking along the Tyne on the Newcastle side, venture a little further and you’ll find the Ouseburn Valley. Kiln, a workshop/kitchen, is one of my favourite places to hang out and eat delicious vegetarian food; you can see craftspeople making and firing pots through the glass wall. The Ouseburn is home to loads of great music venues, pubs, galleries and artist studios, and right in the centre you can find Ouseburn Farm. I recommend the Cumberland Arms for a pint of local beer. An hour north of Newcastle is Alnwick, a beautiful town with a castle and Barter Books. This treasure trove of secondhand books is housed in a Victorian railway station where you can cosy up by an open fire in one of the old waiting rooms with a cup of tea. • The Unthanks play Folk on the Tyne, Sage Gateshead, 28 July, £19.60, and are part of Aeons: a Sound Journey for Newcastle, along the River Tyne, 22 June-7 Sept, free but ticketed, getnorth2018.com Shaun Allan, virtual reality expert from HedgeHog Lab I’m really looking forward to the River Brew Co development in Gateshead, a new shipping container community under the Tyne Bridge.

For a complete contrast, I recommend the Victorian-era Saltwell Park, south of the town centre – I visit every other day. With seven miles of spotless beach, Druridge Bay, near Amble in Northumberland, is where my family and I spent many a summer’s day in the 1970s. It hasn’t changed much since.

This 18th-century fishing hamlet on the Northumberland coast is owned by the National Trust and has white-painted fishermen’s cottages set around a village green. There is a long sandy beach with blue-green rockpools, and it is a lovely walk around Embleton Bay to Dunstanburgh Castle.

One of my favourite is Sugar Sands near Longhoughton. It is usually deserted and is great for kids, birdwatchers and sea kayakers – take a picnic and a wetsuit. For coastal walks, I love the route from Budle Bay to Craster. There are views of the Holy Island of Lindisfarne and the path takes you past Bamburgh Castle, along sandy beaches such as Beadnell Bay, next to crystal-clear waters. Just south of Craster is Howick Hall , the ancestral seat of Earl Grey – you can walk to another little beach at the bottom of the gardens. • Which Way North is at the Great North Museum, Newcastle, 22 June-9 Sept, free, greatnorthmuseum.org.uk Steve Mayes, Lego artist I’d recommend a trip out to the coast at Tynemouth, eight miles east of Newcastle. The high street has a great range of independent shops, bars and restaurants. The market in the Metro station at weekends is worth a visit, not least for the beauty of the station itself. Best of all, though, Tynemouth has Riley’s Fish Shack, down on the beach at King Edward’s Bay. It serves the best food I’ve eaten anywhere, and has an incredible atmosphere – sometimes they have fire pits and deckchairs out on the sand. Another beach, Longsands, gets some good waves if you fancy surfing. Up the Tyne a little is North Shields; the Fish Quay area is well worth a look. Again, there are some great independent bars and restaurants, and working fishing vessels going out, which gives the place real character. You can get great deals on fresh fish, too. • The Lego Timeline of Northern Innovation is at the Mining Institute, Newcastle, 22 June-9 Sept, mininginstitute.org.uk Annie Rigby, artistic director, Unfolding Theatre The thing I love about living in Newcastle is that you don’t need to travel far to reach big, open spaces. A great place to fill your lungs with air is the Weardale moors in the Pennines. It really feels like you’re a million miles away from the city. I like looking at the snow poles (there’s a Weardale ski club) and imagining what it looks like in the depths of winter. The heritage Weardale Railway runs from Witton-le-Wear to Stanhope, where there are brilliant walks. Or, if you fancy taking in the views from a heated outdoor swimming pool, head to Stanhope Pool. The Lord Crewe Arms pub in Blanchland is hard to beat for a pint and some food before you head back to town (or even stay the night). • Multiverse Arcade is at multiple venues, Newcastle and Gateshead, 22 June-9 Sept, free, unfoldingtheatre.co.uk Ednie Wilson, creativity development manager, St Mary’s Heritage Centre I go on mum-and-son dates once a week – there are so many lovely places to explore in the villages around Gateshead and Newcastle. A real favourite is Wylam, about 20 minutes from Newcastle by train. Visit Daniel Farm, which has animals including llamas and Clydesdale horses, plus a great cafe and farm shop. The Boathouse pub has brilliant beers from the Hadrian Border Brewery and other north-eastern brewers. I like the Feathers Inn in Hedley on the Hill, which has well-kept beer and lovely food. I recommend the sticky toffee pudding with local ice-cream. • The Needle Points North is on at St Mary’s Heritage Centre, Gateshead, 23 June-9 Sept, getnorth2018.com Philip Bernays, chief executive, Theatre Royal There are some fantastic places to eat in Newcastle. I recommend the Broad Chare for proper pub food: the menu changes every day but the pies are brilliant, as are the scotch eggs and the pig’s ears. Dabbawal has great Indian street food, and Dat Bat is a craft beer bar serving the best sourdough pizzas. Further afield, Finbarrs in Durham is a fine-dining restaurant with regional produce such as Ribblesdale goat’s curd. At the top end, the Raby Hunt near Darlington is the only two Michelin-starred restaurant in the north-east. The 15-course tasting menu is on another planet – book early and splash out on the wine flight for a special occasion (£115pp excluding wine). For days out, we always take friends to Crook Hall and Gardens, a medieval hall in Durham – it’s a pleasant place for a wander, and the tea shop serves excellent sponge cake. Bradley Gardens in the Tyne Valley is a restored 18th-century walled garden with some smart shops. Hexham Abbey has incredible medieval paintings, carvings and sculptures – I go weak at the knees for the Celtic crosses. Northumberland is a great place for cyclists – you can cycle all day along little lanes and hardly see a car. There are some excellent cyclists’ cafes, too – I like Capheaton Tea Rooms (weekends only). • Every Thing Every Time, by artist Naho Matsuda, is outside Newcastle’s Theatre Royal, 22 June-9 Sept, free, getnorth2018.com Abbey Stobbs and Allison Birt, both 17, Young Company, Northern Stage In a city as bustling as Newcastle, my favourite thing is to escape to the seaside – go the Pulp Fiction cafe in Whitley Bay for a smoothie and enjoy the fresh sea air.

Witnessing these incredible birds take to the skies is enough to convince anyone that they should in fact be flightless (further evidenced by the fact they live in burrows, which they timeshare with the local rabbits). As well as puffins, seals, guillemots and arctic terns, you can also see the lighthouse from which 22-year-old Grace Darling and her father undertook a legendary lifeboat rescue in 1838. To the south of the Tyne you can visit the picture-postcard Souter Lighthouse at Lizard Point in Marsden – the first lighthouse in the world to be built specifically to house an electric lamp. Then round the day off with a drink in Marsden Grotto, a bar in a cave at the bottom of a nearby cliff, which was reputedly first inhabited by a man known as Jack the Blaster. However, my grandfather regularly complained about once having been stuck in the lift there in 1941, so do so at your own risk. • Bridges is at Sage Gateshead, 22 June- 9 Sept, free, sagegateshead.com David Eagle, singer, the Young’Uns Hartlepool Headland is a really magical place. It’s the oldest part of Hartlepool with so much heritage – you can visit St Hilda’s church, built in the 12th century on the site of the saint’s seventh-century monastery. Sandwell Gate is the only surviving gateway in the 14th-century town walls – it’s a lovely sheltered area to stand and look out to sea. The Heugh Battery was used to defend the town from German bombardment in December 1914, when 130 people were killed; it is now a museum. Great pubs include the Harbour of Refuge, AKA the Pot House, and the Cosmopolitan Hotel, which also has five rooms. Don’t miss Verrill’s Fish Shop, the best chippy in town – Frasier’s Kelsey Grammer is a regular (his wife is from Hartlepool). • The Young’Uns play Folk on the Tyne with the Unthanks and the Wilsons, Sage Gateshead, 28 July, £19.60, sagegateshead.com Linda Conlon, chief executive, Life In Notes on a Small Island, Bill Bryson described Durham as “perfect” – and it’s hard to disagree. It’s a compact and beautiful city that is easy to explore on foot. Highlights include the breathtaking cathedral and castle, which together are a world heritage site. Have a wander around the quaint cobbled streets – there are plenty of little shops, boutiques and cafes to explore. The Mugwump on Saddler Street has been a must-visit shop since the 1960s and is great for picking up unusual gifts, cards and clothes. The market hall is a beautifully restored Victorian indoor space where independent traders sell antiques and local produce.

Populated by broadly drawn characters whose personalities are subservient to their function to the plot, the whole kit and kaboodle emits a kind of rustic, chortling didacticism, like a cinematic Hogarth series set in the era of NHS bureaucracy and contemporary social work. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, although some viewers might harbour suspicions that, in terms of political sympathies, the film-makers’ intended audience may be less inclined to read the Guardian than the Daily Mail. Philip (perpetual supporting actor Peter Bowles) and Rosemary Twain (national treasure-candidate Sylvia Syms), a pair of chirpy, Cockney-accented suburbanites, have been married for 60 years. In that time, they’ve weathered assorted misfortunes, including losing one of their children to childhood illness and seeing their only remaining child, Neville (Steve Steen), go off the rails and end up in jail. But they’ve stuck it out and have just celebrated their anniversary when Rosemary slips and breaks a leg and has to go into hospital. Social workers assigned to her case deem Philip best off in a nursing home while Rosemary is in hospital recovering, but it emerges they have other motives and Philip doesn’t read the fine print on the contracts the eerily chirpy administrator (Carla Mendonca) has him sign. A decades old charge against Philip results in his being forced to stay at least 50 yards away from his wife, even though they long to be together again. Writer-director Paul Duddridge heaps on the rotten luck with a certain energetic glee, but too often the performances feel under-directed. The result is a tone that veers all over the shop, although Emma Richardson’s always smiling home no-help-at-all is a comic treat. But it’s hard to get a steer on how to read the film’s intentions, especially when it zigzags between ruthless, dryly rendered satire and absurdly unconvincing courtroom scenes backed by soppy music. Some may feel the narrative is particularly hard on social workers, depicting them as officious, hard-hearted professionals who care more about rules than people. Also, this set of characters happen to include the only people of colour in the film. That may be an accident of casting, but it’s details like this that draw extra scrutiny, especially when dealing with such an emotive and contentious subject."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/18/abusers-knowing-narcissistic-behaviour-kevin-spacey","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T05:59:24Z","webTitle":"By knowing how abusers like Kevin Spacey work, we can root them out | Deborah Orr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/18/abusers-knowing-narcissistic-behaviour-kevin-spacey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/18/abusers-knowing-narcissistic-behaviour-kevin-spacey","fields":{"headline":"By knowing how abusers like Kevin Spacey work, we can root them out","bodyText":"Twenty people have now made allegations of inappropriate behaviour against Kevin Spacey, the majority from his time as the Old Vic’s artistic director. Fourteen of the allegations are so serious that complainants have been advised to go to the police. Managers at the Old Vic say they are sorry they did not create an environment in which people felt they could speak out if they were receiving unwanted attention. This failure has been put down to a “cult of personality” around the actor. I’m not sure that our society quite understands how all-encompassing a cult of personality can be, or how tirelessly a person leading the cult of himself sifts and sorts and categorises every human being he comes into contact with in order to control his environment. Some current and former members of staff say that Spacey’s behaviour was an “open secret” at the Old Vic. Others insist that revelations about Spacey’s behaviour have been a complete shock to them. This isn’t surprising. Successful predators have an instinct for vulnerabilities in others, traits that they can manipulate. They sniff out shame, insecurity, self-consciousness, self-doubt, like pigs sniff out truffles. They know just as surely when a person is unlikely to accept their subjugations. These people are still useful though. They are the ones who will see model behaviour, a glossy presentation of respect, professionalism, friendship, that will further intimidate and isolate their designated victims. The former are, broadly, the people for whom a predator’s behaviour will be an open secret. The latter are, broadly, his human shield. Think of all the people who would not believe that Jimmy Savile could possibly have been a monstrous sexual predator, until the evidence had become overwhelming. They had been groomed just as single-mindedly as his victims were. I was struck, watching the Netflix series Mindhunter, by two things. First, how crude the predatory behaviour of serial killers is. Second, how successful a psychological approach to catching them seems to have been. In the latter half of the 20th century, you couldn’t move for serial killers and serial killer-related media coverage. In the 21st, thankfully, with a few regrettable exceptions, their extravagantly psychopathic activity seems to get nipped in the bud. Is it possible for us to reach an understanding of less flamboyant predators in a similar way, and protect ourselves and others from such people? The author Joe Navarro, a former FBI agent, says the one trait to watch out for in people who are likely to instigate malignant cults of personality is narcissism. Navarro has the big guys in mind – the Charles Mansons, the David Koreshes, the Jim Joneses. But his list of 50 traits to watch out for in others, published in Psychology Today, is still a helpful guide to spotting toxic behaviour. This is stuff that everyone should know and understand. Predatory behaviour can have a profoundly negative psychological effect on the people who encounter it, even at a relatively low level. When you are assaulted by a person you should be able to trust, and feel unable to do anything about it, you learn something hurtful about yourself and your place in the world. That’s what people mean when they try patiently to explain that sexual assault is all about power. When such manipulation occurs in a setting such as the company or industry you work in, it can damage your career. Even if it doesn’t, a feeling of powerlessness and inadequacy – often expressed as anger – can sometimes last a lifetime. That’s why people who sneer at small physical harms done to victims are so repellent. They don’t understand that the main aim is psychological harm. Narcissists seek power and attention. They are drawn to positions that will give them these things. Politics, entertainment, big business, the media – these are all areas that attract people with narcissistic traits. When we learn how to weed out those who are so narcissistic that they’re dangerous to others, rather than paying obeisance to them, the world will be a better place. • Deborah Orr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/17/tusk-tells-uk-no-trade-talks-without-progress-on-money-and-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T19:41:32Z","webTitle":"Ireland will block progress of Brexit talks without border guarantee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/17/tusk-tells-uk-no-trade-talks-without-progress-on-money-and-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/17/tusk-tells-uk-no-trade-talks-without-progress-on-money-and-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Ireland will block progress of Brexit talks without border guarantee","bodyText":"Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, issued a stark warning that the progress of the Brexit negotiations was at great risk of even further delay, during a day of stinging public rebukes for Theresa May as she met sceptical EU leaders at a Swedish summit. The Irish taoiseach emerged from a frosty bilateral meeting with May at the European social summit and said: “I can’t say in any honesty that it’s close – on the Irish issue or on the financial settlement.” Varadkar said he would not be prepared to back progress of the Brexit negotiations to trade talks at the summit in December without a formal written guarantee there would be no hard border in Ireland. Britain, he said, “wants a divorce, but an open relationship the day after”. At the summit in Gothenburg, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, gave the UK government an ultimatum that progress needed to be made on the Irish border and the financial settlement. Tusk also hit back at suggestions by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, that the UK needed to see more compromise from Brussels: “I appreciate Mr Davis’s English sense of humour.” May spoke to several European leaders on the fringes of the social summit including France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Swedish prime minister, Stefan Löfven. Government sources admitted it was clear from the meetings that more work was needed to make progress, though they insisted the tone was constructive. Leaving the summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, May told reporters she agreed that more needed to be done to advance the negotiations. “But we are clear and I am clear that what we need to do is move forwards together and that’s how we can ensure that we are going to get the best deal for the UK and for the EU,” the prime minister said. Tusk said the UK needed to do more on the two key issues. “While good progress on citizens’ rights is being made, we need to see much more progress on Ireland and on the financial settlement,” he told a press conference in Gothenburg. He said he had told May in an earlier bilateral meeting that “this progress needs to happen at the beginning of December at the latest”, and that he hoped some movement will have been made by the time the two leaders meet again next Friday. The president said the EU was ready to move on to the second phase of the Brexit talks, which will discuss the future trade relationship and transition period. These are due to begin, with the approval of the council, at its next summit in Brussels on 14-15 December. Later he told reporters he was “cautious but optimistic” that talks could still progress. Tusk’s deadline of the beginning of December will give May some crucial extra time to build consensus in Europe and around her own cabinet table, particularly over the financial settlement. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, had initially said Brussels needed to see progress by next Friday. Downing Street said May’s meeting next Friday with Tusk was pre-arranged and would take place in Brussels at the Eastern Partnership summit. Varadkar’s warning was the most blunt, though the EU is likely to take the lead from Ireland when it assesses whether enough genuine progress has been made on the issue of the border with Northern Ireland, one of the three key topics which must be agreed before talks progress to trade. “We’ve been given assurances that there will be no hard border in Ireland, that there won’t be any physical infrastructure, that we won’t go back to the borders of the past,” Varadkar said before his meeting with May. “We want that written down in practical terms in the conclusions of phase one.” Leaving the summit several hours later, Varadkar said he was not satisfied with the progress. “After 40 years of marriage, most of them good, now Britain wants a divorce, but an open relationship the day after,” he told Sky News. “We have heard now for 18 months … that the UK does not want a hard border in Ireland. But after 18 months of the right language we need to understand how that can be achieved in law.” “We don’t have a counter-proposal from the UK government yet which makes any sense, but we would certainly welcome one,” he said. Earlier at the summit, Varadkar was scathing about UK politicians who had backed Brexit: “It’s 18 months since the referendum. It’s 10 years since people who wanted a referendum started agitating for one. Sometimes it doesn’t seem like they have thought all this through.” A UK government source said it had been “clear from the outset there will be no hard border”, but admitted that significantly more progress was needed before the two countries would see eye to eye. Sources referred to several official documents already released by the UK government that made commitments on the Irish border. EU leaders must agree that sufficient progress has been made on three key areas before talks can move on to a future trade deal. They are the UK’s financial settlement with the EU, the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British citizens in Europe, and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. If it is not agreed at the December summit that sufficient progress has been made, it may mean no progress is guaranteed until the next scheduled European council meeting in March. In the UK, internal discussions of the financial settlement were still taking place. Boris Johnson, backed by other cabinet Brexiters, has been arguing for the government to refuse to make a firm offer to settle Britain’s EU liabilities before receiving assurances about the outlines of a future trade deal. Johnson regards the financial settlement as one of the government’s strongest negotiating cards, which it would be folly to play upfront. That would appear to fly in the face of the “sufficient progress” condition placed by the EU. Anand Menon, the director of thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, said: “This is for the birds. The EU has made quite clear that there’s a sequence.” The foreign secretary and his allies are also pressing for more clarity within the cabinet at home about the nature of the deal the government hopes to achieve, before they are willing to back the idea of pushing the potential bill above €20bn (£18bn). “It’s about a conversation about ‘what is the end state?’”, said one Johnson ally. “If we’re going to stump up a significant amount of taxpayers’ money we should know what we’re getting in return.” Davis would also like assurances about a future trade deal. But he is said by allies to be more relaxed about the ultimate size of the bill because he did not play a leading role in the Vote Leave campaign and is not personally associated with the pledge of £350m for the NHS."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/nov/17/fifa-world-cup-debacle-money-horror-death","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T18:20:22Z","webTitle":"Fifa’s World Cup debacle isn’t just about money – there’s horror and death too | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/nov/17/fifa-world-cup-debacle-money-horror-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/nov/17/fifa-world-cup-debacle-money-horror-death","fields":{"headline":"Fifa’s World Cup debacle isn’t just about money – there’s horror and death too","bodyText":"Are you feeling it yet? The Fifa corruption fatigue? It has, after all, been seven years in the making, from the oddly homespun excesses of the whistleblower Chuck Blazer, football’s own mobility scooter Liberace; to the cold, gangsterish disdain of the Grondona-Teixeira-Leoz axis, the kind of Fifa men who would carve out your liver with an ivory-inlaid oyster knife if it meant getting a step closer to a secret six-figure TV rights access sweetener. This week the US justice department court case sparked into life in New York. Its first few days provided such a vivid dose of toxic colour it is tempting to call Fifa’s continuing corruption debacle a gift that just keeps on giving. Except it fees like something else by now, a gift that has, frankly, given too much, but which still keeps on dishing up its shovel-loads of corruption and human weakness. This is the other thing about the World Cup. It isn’t only the money now. It’s the horror and the death too. A recap then. On Tuesday a prosecution witness alleged that Julio Grondona, a former senior vice-president at Fifa, had taken $1m in bribes to vote for Qatar to host the World Cup. The witness, Alejandro Burzaco, named a broadcast executive called Jorge Delhon as an intermediary. A few hours later Delhon was found dead by a railway siding in Buenos Aires. Police say all the signs suggest it was suicide. On Wednesday prosecution lawyers complained that one of the accused, the Peruvian FA head Manuel Burga, was making a repeated “slicing motion across his throat” in Burzaco’s direction as he gave evidence. Burga’s lawyer said his client had simply been scratching his throat as he suffers from dry skin. He called Burga a “gentle, meek, timid man”. Burga is accused of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering. On Thursday, and promising at least a little laughter in the dark, a court in Peru finally ordered the extradition to New York of 85-year-old Nicolás Leoz. The same Leoz who allegedly suggested the FA Cup should be renamed the Nicolás Leoz Cup in return for his World Cup vote and wandered across to the FA delegation at a drinks party and demanded a knighthood. All of which he denies, naturally. On Friday it was claimed that, not content with his $1m, Grondona decided he was inadequately bribed, woefully under-bunged. At a dinner in the Copacabana Palace hotel, Grondona had “insulted” the gathered Qataris and demanded a further £60m, part bribe, part blackmail, like the kind of bumcrack-cowboy builder who suddenly decides, with the ceiling down and the floor up, that actually there have been some complications and, yeah, need it in cash mate, cheers, we’ll be back next month. This is only the first week. There are five more to come in court. Not to mention five long years before this most painful and debilitating of World Cups is finally dredged from the gut and sent gurgling around the U-bend of history. And this is the startling, inescapable fact about all this. The next three world and European tournaments were set in place by people who have since turned out to be corrupt. The men responsible may be gone, but their citadels still stand, just as Fifa’s 2010 double-bid ceremony remains football’s own calamitous meltdown, its waste still burning in the soil. Time for another score update: as we stand, of the 25 Fifa executives involved in the voting for Qatar and Russia 13 have either been banned from football or deemed demonstrably corrupt. Only three have escaped any stain at all. We counted them out. And we counted them back in again – at least the ones who weren’t in prison, banned, dead or hiding. In between those two World Cups is Euro 2020, which was called as a divvy-up between various host cities at a meeting in Lausanne in 2012. Since then Michel Platini, whose gig this was all along, has been banned from football. His deputy, Ángel María Villar, has been arrested on corruption charges, which he denies. Even the agenda for that Lausanne meeting is a double-take. Item one: Euro 2020 decision. Item two: “Call to make sports fraud a criminal offence.” These guys. The balls on these guys. And yet what they left us endures, a background music for as far as anyone can see ahead. Vitaly Mutko, who Wada thinks was complicit in state-sponsored doping, will get to hand over the World Cup to some beaming Brazilian/Spaniard/Frenchman/Messi next summer. Platini’s Euros will be played out. Qatar will not relinquish its World Cup, which has become a point of blood-stained and blockaded nation-building honour. Re-gearing Fifa still seems miles away for all the indictments, the censorious Twitter posts (look away for a moment and Gary Lineker’s doing the draws these days). Beyond that some rich old men will go to prison. The US will continue to take down everyone involved in the decision not to award it 2022, showing previously unheard-of interest in dodgy South American TV deals, discrediting every other body involved and making its first real play in sport as a geopolitical tool since the cold war. Money and sponsorship demand that we avert our eyes and walk through this for the next five years, a place that, rather than being scoured out, looks stranger and a little more frightening with each fresh glimpse beneath the skin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/nov/17/leonardo-da-vinci-art-trump-manhattan-skyline","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T16:49:12Z","webTitle":"As Leonardo masterpiece sells for $450m, Trump effort goes for … slightly less than that","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/17/leonardo-da-vinci-art-trump-manhattan-skyline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/17/leonardo-da-vinci-art-trump-manhattan-skyline","fields":{"headline":"As Leonardo masterpiece sells for $450m, Trump effort goes for … slightly less than that","bodyText":"On Wednesday, a long-lost Leonardo da Vinci painting sold for $450.3m, rocking the art world and prompting hand-wringing over the soaring price of premium works. On Thursday, that same art world was given a reality check, when a sketch by the less celebrated Donald Trump sold for just $6,875 at an auction in Los Angeles. Trump’s untitled piece, which depicts the Manhattan skyline, barely cleared its minimum price of $5,000, to sell for $450,293,125 less than Leonardo’s Salvator Mundi. The president took on his project in 2009 for a charity event. Trump seems to have used either pencil or ballpoint pen for the piece, which measures 8in x 5in. The sketch shows what appear to be skyscrapers, alongside something representing the Empire State Building. Nate D Sanders, the auction house handling the sale, presented the sketch in a 15in x 18in frame, along with a signed photo of Trump. Despite this, Trump’s drawing failed to attract much attention among art aficionados. Sanders’ website showed there were just two bids on the piece. Trump is not the first politician to have shown a flair for art – although others have had significantly more success. George W Bush memorably took to the easel after his time in office, producing a series of nude self-portraits and a number of paintings of dogs. A book of his oil paintings reached the top spot on Amazon’s bestseller list this February. In 2012 a Jimmy Carter painting, Live Oak at Sunrise, sold for $250,000. A piece by Vladimir Putin went for $1.1m in 2008. Trump, a self-described billionaire, is unlikely to have been pleased with the $6,875 sale. But he is not the first artist to have been underappreciated in their time. Vincent Van Gogh lived in abject poverty before his death, aged 37, in 1890.

This debate must be informed by the experiences of the 6.5 million unpaid carers in the UK. The numbers of people providing unpaid care rose by 16.5% between 2001 and 2015 and increased most sharply for those caring for 20 or more hours per week. Despite what we sometimes hear from politicians, we are a society caring more, not less. Many of us are willing to take on full-time care for others, but this should not mean signing up to the financial hardship, poor health and reduced retirement income that so often goes with caring for a loved one. Others want to and can juggle providing care with paid work, when employers are flexible and good quality, reliable care services are available to back them up. Increasingly, employers realise that supporting the one in nine people caring in their workforce is necessary to retain experienced and valuable employees. Government is recognising the case for action, too, as the reality of an ageing population and longer working lives means growing numbers of us will be combining paid work and care. Consensus on the balance of state and family responsibility and the support needed by carers now and in the future is, without doubt, an area where we need a cross-government approach. The health secretary began the development of a cross-government carers strategy to do just this. Yet, despite the evidence and ideas provided by carers, employers, technologists, economists and health and care professionals, we’ve yet to see the government publish its plans. It must now do so. Heléna Herklots Chief executive, Carers UK London SE1 We must do away with ‘belief’ Your review of Rachel Hewitt’s book A Revolution of Feeling (“Passion and the fantasy of political progress”, New Review, last week) failed to mention the Enlightenment, the real precursor of change in the 18th century. Change brought about by a battle between belief and reason, not feelings and reason as argued in the book. Prior to the Enlightenment, belief ruled the roost – religious dictatorship exploited by priests and princes alike to enhance their power. The age of reason brought about a vital shift towards scientific explanations for our existence, inventions, new industries, the growth of a middle class, liberty, equality, fraternity, democracy – all still ongoing, but the exact opposite of “belief”. Belief, after all is, by definition, the very opposite and absence of fact, evidence and rational thought. I am not undermining the importance of feelings, instincts and impulses, but these are better working hand in hand with reason rather than belief. We must do away with “belief”. Our survival as a species depends on it. But we’re getting there! David Stapleton Tavistock, Devon A poison too easy to buy Jamie Doward’s report on super-strength alcohol should be taken as seriously as articles on spice and other drugs. (“The killer on our streets – super-strength cider”, News, last week). Unfortunately, the potency and cost of these drinks means that it affects more than just homeless people. My descent into alcoholism began with very expensive wine and culminated in drinking three litres of this cider every evening for two years. I doubt there are many problem drinkers who will not turn to this poison at some point because, as mentioned, for £3.50 you can buy the equivalent of eight and a half pints of lager. For all their shortcomings, alcoholics are experts at weighing up the volumes and units of cans and bottles in order to get more for less. Each morning without fail, before the shutters are even raised, there are problem drinkers waiting to buy this stuff at my local shop. As the homeless people in the article suggest, however, without these drinks, an alcoholic will find an alternative, though probably not a cheaper one. I’m not certain what the answer is to this issue. What I do know, however, is there is very little difference between someone queueing for super-strength cider at 7am and another person buying heroin or crack-cocaine. Is it wrong that opiate addicts should have to break the law to buy their drug of choice, or wrong that, for alcoholics, theirs is so easily available? Paul Robson Sheffield Brown saved country from ruin Could you please remind Iain Dale that Gordon Brown was not responsible for nearly bankrupting the country (“Is this Britain’s worst postwar government?”, In Focus, last week)? To quote Iain, “only if you are completely ignorant of our political history and basic economics” would you not know that it was the bankers and their gambling with the sub-prime mortgage securities market that nearly bankrupted the UK back in 2008. Brown’s intelligent reaction to the collapse of the sub-prime market actually saved Britain from bankruptcy. Time for Iain to swot up on both his political and economic history! Steve Chapman Bradford Drink is not curse of class work My former students (“E=mc2 … and make mine a pint while you’re there”, Comment, last week) often quote my line: “We are going to work our butts off all day, then go to the pub.” This is where class continued in both curricular and non-curricular subjects and we were closer because of it.

Presented without voiceover or soundtrack, Football As Never Before is an hour and 45 minutes of a single camera following its star around the pitch during a Manchester United game against Coventry City. Whatever its ultimate merits – and FANB does provide an absolute gold standard in mesmeric closeup shots focused, for long periods, entirely on George Best’s buttocks – the film also speaks to a more basic confusion over what exactly to do with sport on camera. In outline it looks a simple enough relationship. Film-makers are always desperate for stories. Sport presents endless stories – a continual overblown operetta of glory, hubris and pantomime colour. The question has always been how to translate this self-contained world into a coherent whole, while also justifying a subject many viewers would perhaps consider a little beneath the threshold, a little limited, a little too much like, well, sport. This might explain why, for so long, so few people bothered. The early history of sports documentaries takes in isolated sparks of arthouse brilliance, from FANB to gems such as A Sunday in Hell, a portrait of the Paris-Roubaix cycling race directed by the Danish poet Jørgen Leth. Beyond this lies the other extreme, the epic official films made by Fifa and the IOC of successive postwar World Cup and Olympic Games, their extraordinary acts and oppositions offered up without apology or even much explanation. They’re as far from arthouse George Best as you’re likely to get, but present this world with an equally narrow eye. The rise of Big Sport as a glossy mainstream entertainment product was always likely to drag sport stories out into the wider culture. Hoop Dreams was a breakthrough, a 1994 US film about junior basketball players that tells a gripping story of poverty, talent and anxiety. Around the same time, the UK was presented with the startling spectacle of An Impossible Job, the access-all-areas film about the sustained mental collapse and grim, kindly dignity of England manager Graham Taylor during the failed 1994 World Cup qualification campaign. Still, sport documentaries tended to know their place, concerned above all with broadening out, putting in context, explaining their own relevance. The ESPN 30 for 30 series provided a beautifully spun template of sporting documentary as wider social commentary. Feature films began to follow. Senna captured both its subject and its time. Zidane: A 21st-Century Portrait recycled Costard’s George Best treatment, albeit in more pompous and highfalutin fashion. One Night in Turin, a documentary on the 1990 World Cup, based around the wonderful Pete Davis book All Played Out, provided a fun, rollicking football-as-pop-culture template that has been energetically mined ever since. Never more so than now. This month two new feature-length footballing documentaries have been released. 89 tells the story of Arsenal’s dramatic, last-ditch 1989 league title victory. Kenny is about former Liverpool player and manager Kenny Dalglish. Both are notable for two things. First, neither spends any time explaining itself or apologising for being there, and both are all the better for it. This is the third wave of sports docs, beyond arthouse, beyond social commentary; sports film qua sports film, free to come swaggering in through the front door with their own self-contained story to tell. This leads on to the second thing about Kenny and 89: the two films are basically telling the same story, albeit from opposing points of view. Both are about that strange, febrile in-between time just before this world became modern, when professional football was still a frontier town of genuine extremes and un-homogenised glory, still not quite a product. Both are, whether 89 needs to say it or not, about the decline of the industrial north. And both are pegged out around the same central event – the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989 that saw 96 people die during and after an FA Cup semi-final, the result of systemic institutional failings by those in charge. Both films are entwined around Hillsborough, even if 89 tells an entirely different story. Both are moving, moreish and slickly put together, all the more so when seen as a pair. 89 is the more niche, the story of a league title sealed by the narrowest possible margin with a last-minute Friday-night 2-0 victory at the home of all-conquering Liverpool. In 89 this is pitched as a kind of heist, a Dirty Dozen-type scenario, with Arsenal’s youthful, fun underdogs entering the citadel of one of the century’s great club teams to win their first title in 18 years. There is a natural chutzpah to all this: travelling up daringly late on the day of the game; the dramatic tactical switch to a back three; and above all, the emotional heart of the film, the wonderful bond between the club’s core of young players, current and future. David Rocastle was 22 when Arsenal produced their title snatch, a gloriously composed and charming athlete from south-east London. Rocastle was a mentor to the younger Ian Wright at that time, stopping him when they met on the Brockley estates and urging him to give up smoking weed and concentrate on his football talent. In the film Wright breaks down in tears remembering this. He signed for Arsenal two years later and went on to become the club’s record goalscorer. Rocastle died in 2001 and is much missed. Otherwise 89 is the usual retro feast of period details, all enjoyably grainy screen-dissolves and cool clunky graphics. Look! A dork with a big mobile phone! Men on the trading floor in stripy jackets! Maggie Thatcher saying something! Old beige cars! Ride on Time! Pump Up the Jam! Etc! The film has amazing access. Everyone talks, although at times there is a slight sense that watching old blokes bantering and playing cards could make way for a glimpse of something else, perhaps a sniff of the darkness most evident in the figure of the former alcoholic Tony Adams. Adams is a star of the film, an extravagantly tailored, sightly eccentric figure these days, rolling his eyes and twirling his Victorian bow tie and reeling off a series of asides that might have led this film into other areas. The assorted club legends Adams and co replaced in the Arsenal back four were “pretty selfish individuals” he says. Wait. What? “We wanted success, and we’d do anything to get it, because it made us feel … better,” Adams concludes with a wicked, loopy grin, the grin of a man who knows a bit about trying to feel better. But we get no further with this. The other notable point in 89 is the absence of voices from the Liverpool side. I asked Amy Lawrence, one of the film’s producers, about this. She explained that an editorial decision was made to tell the story from one side only. The reason was Hillsborough, which happened just five weeks before that night at Anfield. The disaster is acknowledged and detailed in the film, which is dedicated to the Hillsborough dead. But in this company it would have completely taken over the narrative, turned the film into another film entirely. Instead 89 pays its respects and moves on, without ever quite losing the imprint of that potent absence. And, for all the obvious Arsenal glory, the wider story here is the collapse of Liverpool, a period of trauma that signalled the falling away of one of the great club football dynasties. Liverpool stormed back and won the league by a mile the following year. But they haven’t won it since. The recovery period has been long and painful. There’s a funny moment at the end as George Graham, Arsenal’s tough, likable Scottish manager, tries to calm everyone down in the moment of triumph, telling them to stop shouting and leaping about. “That was stupid, I don’t know what I was doing,” Graham laughs now. But maybe he did. For all the glory that night was also the passing of something. At which point, enter Kenny, another beautifully framed football film that is told entirely from the other side. Kenny Dalglish was the Liverpool manager opposite Graham on the night 89 describes. He looked absolutely shot in that film: wrung out, drained, propped up by his own padded sports coat. Kenny tells us why. Dalglish was first of all a wonderful footballer, one of the three greatest in England – along with Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo – in this observer’s lifetime. Career highlights aside, Kenny is a sombre film, if only because his has been a life with more than its share of grief and sorrow. As a player Dalglish was at Heysel, the stadium disaster caused by rushing Liverpool fans that killed 29 Italians. He’d been present as a fan 14 years earlier at the Ibrox stadium disaster, which killed 66 people. And of course he was at Hillsborough. The final half hour of the film is where it shifts to another gear, telling the story of the remarkable part played by Dalglish and his wife, Marina, in helping to steer Liverpool through a tragedy inflicted, essentially, by the viciousness of the 1980s in many areas of public life. Dalglish had this thrust upon him, becoming a face of the Hillsborough aftermath, called upon to provide wisdom and solace and a sense of institutional care when the state would not. His constancy in this role has been dad-like, laconic but unconditional. Indeed, watching the Hillsborough footage we’re reminded that Dalglish’s son Paul was in the crowd; the manager’s anxiety was personal as well as public. Dalglish addresses the crowd over the tannoy at one point. Paul, lost in the mayhem, hears him and comes to the tunnel in some distress. ”And then he was there, just there,” Paul marvels, 28 years later, because dads are magical. There is more of this kind of thing in the pipeline. Forthcoming sports docs include a film about Diego Maradona directed by Senna’s Asif Kapadia, and Netflix and Amazon series about Juventus and Manchester City, respectively. Perhaps, in time, the last few years might even come to be seen as a golden era for the straight-up sports doc, a cinematic age when so many of the best stories were harvested. From a commercial angle it isn’t hard to see why so many are being made. For a start, sports documentaries are cheap. There is a formulaic ease to knocking together another ready-made plot, with ready-made footage and a ready-made audience. And let’s face it, many of these stories are only being told because of grey-pound nostalgia. In an age when Premier League grounds are packed out by middle-aged disposable income, sporting docs tend to tell the story of a certain time, of vanished youth. On the other hand, maybe the nostalgia is justified. As 89 and Kenny demonstrate, football’s immediate pre-modern era was a time when grand, sweeping stories were still allowed to happen – before sport was commodified and processed, when the world still felt human-scale and recognisable, and where the eye is understandably still drawn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/19/gig-economy-ruling-deliveroo-riders-equipment-basic-employment-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T07:00:54Z","webTitle":"Gig economy ruling has Deliveroo riders without rights and  buying their own kit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/19/gig-economy-ruling-deliveroo-riders-equipment-basic-employment-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/19/gig-economy-ruling-deliveroo-riders-equipment-basic-employment-rights","fields":{"headline":"Gig economy ruling has Deliveroo riders without rights and  buying their own kit","bodyText":"When 21-year-old Nathaniel Shaughnessy needed to find flexible paid work, he took a courier job with fast-food delivery firm Deliveroo, and for two years biked take-away meals from restaurants to customers. In February, the Deliveroo-branded food box that clipped to the back of his bike snapped off and he was given a second-hand backpack with a broken zip as a replacement. He was told that he would have to wait until September for a new one, but when the time came to collect it, he learned that the rules had changed and workers are expected to fund replacements themselves. Under the new policy recruits are expected to pay for everything at the outset. A backpack and insulating bag cost £60. “If anyone’s equipment breaks after six months they are expected to work the equivalent of the next 13 deliveries for nothing, just for the privilege of having the kit to do the job,” says Shaughnessy. “I can only imagine what this must be like for those for whom Deliveroo is their primary source of income.” Shaughnessy’s grievance echoes that of dozens of other riders who claim the company’s practices deprive them of basic rights. Riders are classed as self-employed contractors who are not entitled to protections granted to employees and “workers” – the latter being an employment classification that carries the right to the national minimum wage, union recognition and holiday pay. Last week, a tribunal ruled that Deliveroo riders in north London were not entitled to basic employment rights because they are not “workers”. The case was brought in May by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to force the firm to accept the collective bargaining rights of its members. But in its ruling, the Central Arbitration Committee, which oversees collective bargaining law, concluded that Deliveroo couriers are self-employed because they have a right to ask a substitute to perform a job for them. By law, anyone with the right to do this is classed as self-employed, and self-employed workers aren’t entitled to collective bargaining rights. Critics claim Deliveroo manipulated the system to duck its liabilities. It changed its contract to include this crucial “substitution clause” just 11 days before the CAC hearing. The company says that it regularly updates its contracts “to ensure that they reflect the reality of how riders work”. But Annie Powell, a solicitor at Leigh Day which launched the latest legal challenge, says: “We argue that the only reason they brought in the new contract was to defeat the union’s case. The ‘substitute rule’ means that even if you don’t want, or plan, to appoint anyone else to cover for you, the fact that the clause exists in a contract means you count as self-employed and lose basic rights. The law needs to change.” The charges for essential kit were added to the contract at the same time. Again, Deliveroo insists this was to benefit its couriers who can now use non-branded items, allowing them to work for other companies between jobs. “They only buy what they need, so if they already have protective clothing, lights and helmet, they only have to buy the backpack and thermal bag,” it says. The union has described the treatment, as evidenced by Shaughnessy, as callous and disrespectful. “They routinely exercise unilateral control to change the terms on which they engage their workforce,” says Jim Benfield, a Deliveroo rider and secretary of the Courier and Logistics branch of the IWGB. Shaughnessy claims that riders are often unable to earn their dues because regular app outages prevent them from signing on for assigned shifts; the driver support team is frequently uncontactable; and payments are often miscalculated in Deliveroo’s favour. “There have been times when I’ve worked four shifts in a week doing over 20 deliveries and received the pay equivalent for less than one shift,” he says. Payments often have to be challenged after being miscalculated. The new requirement for workers to purchase mandatory equipment was the last straw for Shaughnessy who quit rather than fork out. Another policy change, introduced last month, means that riders on hourly rates can no longer work the same ongoing shift patterns to guarantee an income. Instead, they have to compete for available hours at the start of each week with those Deliveroo classes as “high performing” and who have priority. Hours are also now capped at 55 a week. Deliveroo says the change is in response to rider feedback. “It provides greater certainty over earnings by accurately matching rider supply with customer demand,” it says. “Riders can book sessions in advance, cancel at any time or choose to turn up at the last minute.” Riders, however, claim that the cap and the unpredictability has left them out of pocket. Sergio Ramos, a rider in London, reckons he has lost £125 a week. “I used to work 10 hours a day, seven days a week,” he says. “Now I’m not allowed to block book more than 55.” “Block bookings” are those made on the day that available hours for the following week are released – and the cap only applies to them. Riders can top up more sessions after that, but there is no guarantee any will be left. Deliveroo drivers who work shifts are paid £6 an hour (£7 in London) plus £1 a delivery. Those who prefer to work ad hoc earn £3.75 per delivery rising to £4.50 in rural areas. The minimum wage for over-25s is £7.50, excluding expenses. “Out of that money I have to pay for motorbike maintenance and equipment and £1,300 a year for courier insurance,” says Ramos, 40, who has four young children and reckons he’s left with £7.50 an hour before tax. “Last year I broke my hip while on a delivery and was off work for eight weeks with no income.” Annie Powell says that some of her clients earn “substantially” less than the minimum wage. “One was more than £500 below the threshold for two months’ work,” she says. “Our argument is that these riders are controlled, managed and disciplined by Deliveroo and clearly do not carry out their own delivery businesses, as Deliveroo argues.” Deliveroo says that average hourly earnings work out at £9.50 and that if the app, which details available jobs, stops working, riders on hourly pay are credited with the equivalent of 2.5 deliveries. It claims its workforce would be deprived of vital autonomy if it was given employment status as “85% of riders say that flexibility is what they value most”. It adds: “This enables them to work when and where they want, and for how long they want. We want employment law to be updated to allow us to offer riders benefits such as sick and injury pay, without limiting the flexibility they value.” The need for new legislation is a “fiction” according to a parliamentary review, which concluded that profit – not flexibility – is the motive for using a self-employed workforce. The 21st-century phenomenon of the “gig economy” has, critics claim, undone a century of progress and reintroduced sweatshop conditions. The IWGB had hoped that a tribunal ruling forcing Deliveroo to recognise union membership, would haul it into the new millennium. Last week that hope proved a forlorn one. But experts reckon the CAC ruling should not affect the latest legal challenge for fair pay. They can take heart from Uber’s recent defeat in a similar case brought by its drivers. FOR AND AGAINST SHORT-TERM WORK The so-called “gig economy” is a sector which relies on short-term contracts or freelancers. Instead of a regular salary, those who work in it get paid per job – or gig. Classed as independent contractors, they are not entitled to the national minimum wage or sickness, holiday or redundancy pay, and don’t have guaranteed working hours. Supporters claim it allows people to choose their own working patterns, while businesses are spared statutory staff overheads. An estimated five million people work this way, and the Office of Budget Responsibility forecasts that in 2020-21 it will cost £3.5bn in lost taxes. A government-sponsored review has recommended that firms with a “controlling and supervisory” relationship with workers, such as Uber and Deliveroo, should have to pay a full range of benefits, including national insurance contributions. •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/18/apu-stereotypes-documentary-the-simpsons-character-racist","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T06:00:24Z","webTitle":"Apu makes me laugh, but I can see the harm such stereotypes do | Ian Jack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/18/apu-stereotypes-documentary-the-simpsons-character-racist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/18/apu-stereotypes-documentary-the-simpsons-character-racist","fields":{"headline":"Apu makes me laugh, but I can see the harm such stereotypes do","bodyText":"There are two famous Apus in the western world and both are fictional. The first is the protagonist of three films made in the 1950s by the Indian director Satyajit Ray, which trace a boy’s journey to manhood and fatherhood, and from the paddy fields and ponds of rural Bengal to the turbulent streets of Kolkata. No finer films have come out of India, and the Apu trilogy remains among the great landmarks of world cinema – beautifully composed in black and white with a soundtrack by Ravi Shankar, they frequently appear on lists of best-loved movies. Certainly, I include them in mine. The second Apu isn’t at all like the first, though reportedly named after him as an act of homage by his cinephile creators. Apu Nahasapeemapetilon owns the Kwik-E-Mart convenience store in Springfield, the American town where the Simpsons – Homer, Marge and their children Bart, Lisa and Maggie – live in the eponymous cartoon serial, which was first broadcast in 1989 and is about to reach its 625th episode. This Apu first appeared in episode eight. His catchphrase “Thank you, come again” is delivered in a high, singsong voice; he works 96 hours at a stretch and once deleted the sell-by date on some cut-price sliced meat, poisoning the gluttonous Homer with salmonella. An overdose of fertility drugs has given him eight children, which in an outburst of patriotism he once temporarily named Lincoln, Freedom, Condoleezza, Coke, Pepsi, Manifest Destiny, Superman and Apple Pie. I have sometimes cried at the Apu Trilogy, and often laughed at his namesake in The Simpsons. But have I been wrong to find Apu Nahasapeemapetilon funny? A new documentary by the American standup comic Hari Kondabolu attacks the character as a damaging racist stereotype. “Of course he’s funny, but that doesn’t mean this representation is accurate or right or righteous,” Kondabolu told the BBC, adding that it demonstrated “the insidiousness of racism … because you don’t even notice it when it’s right in front of you. It becomes so normal that you don’t even think about it.” His film, which gets it first airing tomorrow in the US, has already attracted an unusual amount of notice. It comes at a frail moment – when Hollywood and the entertainment media more generally stand accused. Kondabolu, the American-born child of Indian migrants, was mocked at school by fellow pupils imitating Apu’s voice, which was created – like those of many other Simpsons characters – by Hank Azaria, a white actor. “Apu reflected how America viewed us: servile, devious, goofy,” Kondabolu says in his film, The Problem with Apu. “A white dude created a stereotypical Indian voice, and a bunch of white writers in the room laughed at said stereotypical Indian voice, and this led to the creation of my childhood bully and a walking insult to my parents.” Children need very few excuses to explore the weakness of others: I had buckteeth and, oh, how I hated Bugs Bunny. And satire being satire, it tends to deal in stereotypes. To pick a not entirely random example, also from The Simpsons: a Chicagoan, Dan Castellaneta, does the voice of the Scottish school groundskeeper, Willie MacDougal. It was this voice that in 1995 first uttered the phrase “cheese-eating surrender monkeys” to describe the French. It sounds perpetually angry – a strip cartoon would have bubbles over Willie’s head saying, “Grrr!” – and joyously inauthentic, which is the point. Inauthenticity can be popular, even among the people who find themselves traduced. Groundskeeper Willie’s real-life antecedent, the comic-singer Harry Lauder, became the most internationally celebrated Scotsman in the first half of the last century through his exaggeration of Scottish speech, slyness, and care with money, helped by his trademark outfit of kilt, bonnet and curly stick, to present a pawky, almost pre-industrial personality (though Lauder himself started work in the mines). His popularity both inside and outside Britain was enormous: he made 22 tours of the US sometimes by special train, and in his own estimation “must have seen, and been seen by, more citizens of the republic than any other man who ever lived”. Some people in Scotland disapproved, contending that Lauder had made “a fool out of Scotsmen”. But many more were happy to applaud this parody, not caring that he had created what proved to be a stubborn stereotype: they were comforted that the parodist was one of their own (unlike in the case of Apu, who is voiced by Azaria). But Scots were among the top dogs then. Why would they worry? Even quite late into the 20th century, signs of our top dogginess survived. The label on the Camp Coffee bottle still showed a turbaned Sikh standing attentively with a tray, as a seated Gordon Highlander supped his morning beverage, outside a tent that flew a pennant with the slogan Ready Aye Ready. (To reflect more equal times, the Sikh was eventually given a seat.) The large outline of another turban sat on the head of an ear-ringed face high above Glasgow Central station, its neon tubes shining white as the night came on, to advertise another Scottish comestible, Irn-Bru, via a little Indian boy, Ba-Bru, who was the companion of kilted little Sandy in the soft drink’s promotional cartoon. It disappeared in the 1970s, by which time everyone had forgotten that Ba-Bru was inspired by Sabu, the young Indian actor who shot to stardom in Robert Flaherty’s film Elephant Boy in 1937. These were among our small, humorous relics of imperialism in India. Others appeared in print. In the 1950s, Hurree Jamset Ram Singh remained the finest bowler among the boys of Billy Bunter’s Greyfriars in the long-running cartoon series, though by then his nickname “Inky” and his description “the dusky nabob of Bhanipur” had possibly been dropped. Hurree’s command of English was memorable. “The latefulness is superior to the neverfulness,” he might say, meaning “better late than never”. And smiling at that (as I do – who couldn’t?), I sense something similar in my reaction to Apu. I can’t think that the effect is racist, but one can never be sure. When Teachers Against Racism protested in 1972 against Helen Bannerman’s 1899 children’s book The Story of Little Black Sambo, the publisher, Ian Parsons, replied that their letter filled him with “amazement, mingled with despair”. Could it be true, he asked, that “responsible people could be so utterly devoid of humour, so totally without imagination” as to want to ban a book that generations of children had accepted as an “enchanting story, an enthralling fantasy … Could a tiger turn into butter with which to make pancakes, and could any child, black or white, eat 169 of them?” Parsons wrote sincerely, stressing that he’d supported the cause of what were then called race relations all his life. But his is the voice of another age. It was the teachers who understood that Britain was changing and that respect for black people needed to be fostered among white children “in order to avoid the kind of terrible race tension and separatism which has occurred in the United States”. Bannerman, interestingly enough, was a Scotswoman who had gone to India with her doctor husband, and there written the story for her children over a two-day train journey. The illustrations in many editions showed African children, though the text mentions Indian items: tigers, ghee, a bazaar. This blissfully ignorant combination charmed people for 70 years until it began to seem paternalistic and unpleasant. There can be no firm rule about stereotypes – it depends on their expression and who makes them, when and why. But their harmfulness or otherwise is usually best judged by the people they attempt to describe. • Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/17/rnli-recalls-lifeboat-jersey-st-helier-dispute-with-crew","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T18:20:29Z","webTitle":"RNLI recalls lifeboat from Jersey after dispute with crew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/17/rnli-recalls-lifeboat-jersey-st-helier-dispute-with-crew","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/17/rnli-recalls-lifeboat-jersey-st-helier-dispute-with-crew","fields":{"headline":"RNLI recalls lifeboat from Jersey after dispute with crew","bodyText":"The waters around Jersey have been left without an all-weather lifeboat after the RNLI ordered its vessel there to be brought back to the UK following a bitter dispute with the crew. Crew members based at the St Helier lifeboat station on the channel island announced this week that they wanted to split with the RNLI and set up an independent service. They had hoped to work with the RNLI on a smooth transition but, to the concern of islanders, the charity closed the St Helier lifeboat station on Friday. Without the knowledge of the crew, it ordered the Tamar-class lifeboat George Sullivan to return to the charity’s headquarters in Poole, Dorset. The crew will try to raise money to buy another boat, but it may take a year before an independent vessel is launched. Coxwain Andy Hibbs, who has worked on the lifeboat for 25 years, accused the RNLI of “stealing” the lifeboat, adding: “It’s disgusting what they’ve done. We’re devastated that it has ended like this.” Jersey is left with one operational inshore RIB based at the St Catherine’s station that cannot operate in severe conditions, can carries many fewer survivors than the George Sullivan and has a much more limited range. The RNLI plans to get a second inshore lifeboat at St Helier operating but said establishing all-weather lifeboat cover would take a few months. Describing it as a “sad day”, the RNLI’s director of community lifesaving and fundraising, Leesa Harwood, said: “The St Helier crew met with the RNLI earlier this week to say they felt that the relationship with the RNLI is broken and that they want to establish an independent station. “It’s with regret that we have made the difficult decision to close the St Helier lifeboat station for the immediate future. It is impossible to run a station when the relationship with the RNLI and crew has broken down to this extent. “The crew have made it quite clear that they want to leave the RNLI and set up an independent lifeboat station. In the interim period, while they pursue that aim, I do not believe that they can fully commit to the RNLI. I no longer have confidence that the station can be run without constant challenges and without constant threat of crew resignation. “The lifeboat station and shop in St Helier will be closed and secured. The crew have been stood down. The RNLI has notified the coastguard that there is no longer a declared RNLI search and rescue service at St Helier.” It is the latest twist in a stormy year for the St Helier station, which began when coxswain Hibbs was sacked over an alleged “unauthorised” rescue. His crew walked out in solidarity. He was later reinstated when it was established that he was not on duty at the time of the alleged offence and the crew returned to service, but tensions have remained since. Hibbs, a fisherman whose father Bill was a lifeboatman for 30 years, said he did not think that the RNLI would be able to find a crew to man a new all-weather lifeboat. The George Sullivan had a range of 250 nautical miles and could carry more than 100 survivors. The B-class boat at St Catherine’s can carry only up to 20 survivors and operates for a maximum of three hours. An RNLI spokesperson said: “B class lifeboats are very capable rescue craft within the RNLI fleet. With a top speed of 35 knots – the fastest coastal RNLI lifeboat – at full speed this would allow them to run for three hours covering 100 miles. “The B class is capable of launching in in rough conditions associated with onshore winds of a force 6-7 on the Beaufort scale during the day and moderate to rough conditions at night.” There are all-weather lifeboats on the channel islands of Guernsey and Alderney and the harbourmaster, Capt Bill Sadler, said crews in France would help plug the gap. He said: “I am disappointed that the relationship between the RNLI and St Helier crew has reached this point, particularly in light of the very long and positive history the Island has with the RNLI. I have talked to colleagues in Guernsey and France today to discuss flank cover.” Four gold, seven silver and nine bronze gallantry medals have been awarded to crew members based at St Helier lifeboat station in its 120-year history. Apart from during the second world war it has always been run by the RNLI."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/nov/19/bbc-ofcom-complaints-report","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T07:00:54Z","webTitle":"BBC complaints?

It is the first time a woman has held the now largely ceremonial parliamentary position in its 669-year history. Clarke, who will formally be known as Lady Usher of the Black Rod, will take over early next year from David Leakey, who has been Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod since 2011. Originating from a role created in 1348 by Edward III to guard the door outside meetings of his advisory council, the Order of the Garter, Black Rod is now a senior official in the House of Lords. The post is most visible at the annual state opening of parliament, when Black Rod is sent from the Lords to the House of Commons to summon MPs to hear the Queen’s speech. The ceremony involves the door to the Commons being slammed in Black Rod’s face. He – as it has been until now – uses his staff to knock three times on the door and gain admittance. Black Rod also organises other ceremonial events, and is responsible for “business resilience and continuity planning” for the House of Lords. Their department includes Black Rod’s deputy the yeoman usher, and the House of Lords doorkeepers. Black Rod is also officially responsible for royal sections of parliament, such as the robing room and the royal gallery. They report to the clerk of the parliaments, who is in overall charge of the administration of the houses. Before organising the Wimbledon championships, Clarke worked for the 2012 Olympic Games, the London marathon and UK Sport. Clarke said she was “deeply honoured and delighted” to be offered the post. “Over many years I have been fortunate to work at the heart of some of the world’s most complex events and institutions. To be given the opportunity to join such an experienced and dedicated team is a great privilege. “The House of Lords is a place where the smallest detail is as important as the big picture and the depth of heritage and tradition is second to none. I am truly looking forward to starting work.” The Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, said: “I am very pleased to welcome Sarah Clarke to the role of Black Rod. As the first woman to take on the role, this is a historic moment for the house. “The Lords has a great record of women taking on senior political roles. Five of the last seven leaders of the Lords and the current leader of the opposition have been women, as well as both my predecessors as Lord Speaker. “I am sure Sarah will continue that tradition and do an exemplary job as Black Rod.” Currently both the Tory and Labour leaders in the Lords are women: Lady Evans and Lady Smith. Fowler said: “People are most familiar with Black Rod for the part they play at state opening, but the job is much more than that. Some of the most important work happens behind the scenes in organising addresses to parliament by visiting heads of state and other state events, as well as ensuring we have appropriate plans in place to keep the important work of the Lords going in a crisis. “Sarah’s fantastic record at Wimbledon and elsewhere shows she is the right person for the task.” When created by Edward III the role was known as ussarius, a medieval Latin word for doorkeeper, and the origin of the modern word usher. Tasked with keeping order outside sometimes long meetings between the 25 Garter knights and the monarch, they were issued with a black rod as a sign of their authority. The current rod dates from 1873; before this time incumbents would traditionally keep their rod when they retired. The rod is topped with a gold lion, indicating the sovereign’s authority."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/17/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T13:04:04Z","webTitle":"Arsenal v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/17/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/17/arsenal-tottenham-hotspur-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview","bodyText":"Tottenham will make the short trip to the Emirates more confident than ever of showing they are the dominant force in north London.

There have been a paltry four – two by France, two by England – in more than 50 Tests since 2000. And the All Blacks just do not lose to Scotland. In the 112 years since the first of their 30 encounters, the only Scottish crumbs of comfort have been two draws: 0-0 in 1964, the last Test match to finish pointless, and a 25-25 thriller in 1983, when Peter Dodds missed a touchline conversion following Jim Pollock’s late try to level the scores. So do Scotland really have a hope of ripping up a well-worn script? Gregor Townsend is an articulate and intelligent coach who has already enjoyed one notable triumph over Australia in his time in charge, but delving into his own experience of facing down the All Black machine might be counter-productive. Townsend never came close to beating New Zealand on the six occasions he faced them, from 1996 to 2001. He was part of Scotland sides that suffered some serious shellackings at Kiwi hands, including a record 69-20 defeat at Dunedin’s House of Pain in June 2000. Townsend was at outside centre that day as the late Jonah Lomu ran in three of New Zealand’s 11 tries. Four years earlier, at the same Carisbrook ground, Townsend – playing at fly-half – scored one of Scotland’s three tries as they mustered 31 points, their highest tally against New Zealand. But that was only half the story. The All Blacks racked up 62, the electric Christian Cullen grabbing four tries. Townsend’s admiration for the way New Zealand go about their business is obvious. “Their front five pass the ball more than any team in the world,” the Scotland head coach said. “They pick a full-back [Damian McKenzie] who is only 5ft 8in but a wonderful player who proves you can be any size, and they play at a pace and tempo that really tests the boundaries of what you can do with a rugby ball.” Townsend has unveiled a side with two injury-enforced changes, the prop Zander Fagerson coming in at tight-head and the South Africa-born Cornell du Preez handed a first Test start at No8. On the other hand, he has 14 players unavailable and has to convince the remainder that the All Blacks are beatable. Maybe their fresh-faced optimism and relative lack of baggage against New Zealand will help. Nine of the starting team – the backs Lee Jones, Huw Jones and Ali Price, the front row of Darryl Marfo, Stuart McInally and Fagerson, the lock Ben Toolis, the flanker Hamish Watson and the No8 Du Preez – will be facing the world champions for the first time, along with seven of the eight replacements. Only the captain John Barclay, who made his debut in an embarrassing 40-0 Murrayfield drubbing in the 2007 World Cup, has cause to remember them with trepidation. But the burden of history does not appear to weigh heavily. “It’s just a stat,” insisted the flanker, whose move to Edinburgh next season was confirmed on Friday. “We have 80 minutes to try and change that record.” The full-back Stuart Hogg, as you might expect, set the tone for the week. “We’re not going out to stand back, watch and admire the All Blacks, are we? They’re the best team in the world, so bring it on. We are more than capable of knocking them over. If you don’t believe that, you are in the wrong place.” A succession of team-mates have taken up the baton. Toolis, whose Australian upbringing may provide additional motivation, said: “There’s always going to be areas you can find to exploit and do damage. Deep down there’s always that aggressive edge in wanting to beat them in anything.” The centre Huw Jones said: “They’re a great side but we know we can trouble them if we get it right. We can score tries against anybody.” It is certainly difficult to imagine a scenario where Scotland edge a tense gruntathon. Ireland showed in Chicago last year that to beat the All Blacks you have to be brave and score tries, apply pressure with an inventive kicking game, scramble like mad in defence and convert every chance you get. The risk is obvious, the reward a potential game-changer. The high point of the Townsend era to date, that summer win over the Wallabies, offers a template for how Scotland may pull off an even more improbable victory. “We played with good intent that day, with a lot of accuracy,” recalled Barclay. “We have to play with the same intent, be aggressive and try to impose ourselves.” That victory in Sydney has taken on a higher value since Australia toppled their admittedly weakened rivals in Brisbane four weeks ago. Scotland have not been afforded the same generosity. New Zealand have named their strongest side available, with Codie Taylor at hooker for the injured Dane Coles their only change. Is that a sign the All Blacks are taking Scotland, ranked sixth in the world, seriously? Townsend’s men should take it as a compliment. If they believe their bullish words, history could be in the Edinburgh air. If not, the gap between the two sides is likely to remain as wide as the Forth.

Andresen, 22, was handed a NOK250,000 (£23,000) fine by an Oslo court this week after she failed a roadside breathalyser test while on her way to the family chalet in the ski resort of Hafjell, three hours north of the capital, for the Easter weekend. Drink-driving penalties in Norway are means-tested, and since Andresen – a tobacco heiress with assets estimated at NOK7.7bn (£710m) – is reportedly the country’s richest woman, the fine could have been much higher. “If the decision in this case was based on a normal return on the accused’s assets, the fine should have been set at NOK35-40m (£3.2-3.7m),” the court said in its judgment, according to the newspaper VG. Andresen, who was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.06 – three times over the legal limit, which at 0.02 is one of Europe’s strictest – more than an hour after she was stopped, successfully pleaded that she had limited means. The equivalent in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is 0.08 and many Europeans have a limit of between 0.04 and 0.05. While the state prosecutor demanded the stiffest possible penalty and 18 days in prison, the court accepted that she had “no fixed income” and “the assets she possesses, at the date of this judgment, have not yet yielded a dividend”. In normal cases, Norwegian judges fine drunk drivers 1.5 times their gross monthly salary, but they have discretion to increase the amount based on what they consider to be the “real financial position” of the defendant, VG said. Andresen, who was also banned from driving for 13 months and handed a suspended three-week prison sentence, said she regretted her error of judgment. “I thought I had waited long enough not to be over the limit any more,” she told financial daily Finansavisen. “I am very sorry.” The heiress was given a 42% share in her family’s investment firm in 2007 and is ranked the world’s second-youngest billionaire by Forbes magazine. The family’s wealth stems originally from its acquisition of the celebrated Norwegian tobacco company JL Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik in 1859. • This article was amended on 17 November 2017. An earlier version said that the UK blood alcohol level limit was 0.08. This is the limit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The limit in Scotland is different to the rest of the UK: 0.05."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/17/crystal-palace-everton-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T15:28:12Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace v Everton: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/17/crystal-palace-everton-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/17/crystal-palace-everton-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace v Everton: match preview","bodyText":"These sides’ miserable starts cost them managers.

Brace yourself, because it’s Senator Al Franken. He’s been accused of kissing and groping a woman without her consent. I guess there are no good people left. Let’s just get it over with: tell us whatever you did, Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama, Tom Hanks, Malala.” “As a fellow comedian I long admired Al Franken,” Colbert went on. “But this does not bode well for Louis CK’s Senate hopes. While touring with the USO in 2006, Franken wrote a sketch where he got to kiss the female emcee, Leeann Tweeden. According to Tweeden, during rehearsal he came at her, put his hand on the back of her head, mashed his lips against hers, and aggressively stuck his tongue in her mouth.” “For those of you not in showbiz, actors call that technique sexual harassment,” Colbert quipped. “It didn’t stop there. On the way home from the tour, she fell asleep on the plane and Franken decided to take this goofy pic.” Colbert then showed the image, which shows Tweeden asleep on the cargo plane and Franken putting his hands on her breasts. He also summarized Franken’s first statement, in which he said the photo was “intended to be funny but wasn’t”, which the senator later amended with a more forceful apology. “OK, intended to be funny but wasn’t,” Colbert asked. “Your movie Stuart Saves His Family was intended to be funny but wasn’t. That photo was intended to embarrass her. That’s why he did it while she was asleep.” “Franken later released a more complete apology,” the host continued, referencing the statement in which Franken echoed Mitch McConnell’s call for an ethics investigation into Franken’s behavior. “Well, that’s nice. It would be wrong if an ethics investigation was done without his consent.” Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah also weighed in on Franken and Roy Moore. “Al Franken,” Noah said. “Hashtag, you too? This story is another example of how, at all levels, we men have been complicit in perpetuating the culture that devalues women. I don’t care who you are: Democrat, Republican, black, white, rich, poor. Men. “You forget, it’s not just Al Franken in the picture,” Noah said, noting the image Tweeden released that shows Franken touching her inappropriately as she slept. “It’s the guy who’s taking the picture, his Billy Bush.” Noah continued: “This story is bad on its own but it’s especially bad in the context of the week we’ve been having which, until today, was dominated by the man most wanted by mall cops, Roy Moore, the Alabama senate candidate who is facing multiple allegations, including sexual harassment, sexual assault and misconduct with underaged girls.” “And every day, the list just keeps getting longer,” the host said, explaining another allegation leveled against Moore, in which a woman says that, as a teenager, Moore asked for her phone number and, when she refused to give it to him, called her at school during trigonometry class. “By the way, this was in 1977. There were no cellphones. She probably got called to the principal’s office to take this call. This guy was analogue creeping in her DMs. He was probably faxing dick picks back in the day.” Noah then showed footage from a press conference held by Moore on Thursday, where he was defiant and called for Senate majority leader McConnell to step down. “That’s another way to do it,” Noah said. “Al Franken is going with the whole ‘I’m sorry, I’m going to look at myself.’ That’s so boring. This guy is like, ‘You know who needs to step down for what I did, someone else!’” “I wish I could say that what Roy Moore is trying will never work, but it’s already worked,” Noah concluded. “It’s pretty much the Trump playbook: you blame your accusers, you claim sabotage, and then you shit on Mitch McConnell. That will work forever.” Finally, Seth Meyers addressed the avalanche of sexual misconduct allegations, too, focusing on the ways politicians and lawmakers have responded to the indignities of their colleagues. “This week we started to get a sense of just how pervasive sexual harassment is in Congress, too,” Meyers said. “I’d say Congress is full of dicks, but most of them look more like ballsacks.” “This is a pervasive problem that affects every aspect of society and every political party, and everyone should be held accountable, from Al Franken to Roy Moore to Bill Clinton to the current president of the United States,” Meyers continued. “And yet, amid all of this, there are still Republicans defending Roy Moore, their nominee for Senate in Alabama, who, of course, has been accused of sexually assaulting underaged girls.” “Part of the reason Republicans are so desperate to ignore questions about Moore is that even the ones who say they believe his accusers can’t explain why they don’t also believe the women who have accused President Trump of sexual assault,” he said. Meyers then showed various clips of reporters attempting to ask Republican congressmen about the accusations against Moore; in the case of Mo Brooks, he fled a reporter’s questions while running down the stairs. Tom Cotton, the senator from Arkansas, repeatedly replied “no comment” to a question about whether or not Moore should step down from the ticket. Wyoming senator Mike Enzi insisted on discussing tax reform, to which a reporter asked, “Do you want to tax Roy Moore?” “Reporters should just keep doing that until Republicans answer the question,” Meyers joked. “’Look, I just want to talk about building a wall.’ ‘OK, should we build a wall between teenagers and Roy Moore?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/17/argentinas-navy-searches-for-missing-submarine-with-at-least-40-on-board","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T02:35:19Z","webTitle":"Argentina's navy searches for missing submarine with 44 crew on board","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/17/argentinas-navy-searches-for-missing-submarine-with-at-least-40-on-board","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/17/argentinas-navy-searches-for-missing-submarine-with-at-least-40-on-board","fields":{"headline":"Argentina's navy searches for missing submarine with 44 crew on board","bodyText":"Argentina’s navy has launched a huge search-and-rescue operation for a military submarine with 44 crew members that has been missing off the coast of Patagonia for more than two days. The last radio contact with the San Juan submarine was on Wednesday, when it was 430km off the coast of the southern province of Chubut, in the area of San Jorge bay, a naval spokesman said on Friday. Local media reports claimed the submarine had been located 70 metres down in waters 300km east of the Patagonian coastal city of Puerto Madryn by the International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liason Office. The media reports have not been officially confirmed and came as Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, tweeted that: “We are committed to using all the national and international resources that are necessary to find the Argentinean Navy’s submarine San Juan as soon as possible.” The navy spokesman, Enrique Balbi, told local television that as there was no indication of problems from the submarine, it could not yet be termed lost. “The latest official and reliable information is that the submarine has not yet been found. It’s not that it’s lost: to be lost you’d have to look for it – and not find it,” he said. A tracker aeroplane and navy ships were scouring the area in search of the missing vessel, he said. An initial search in an area around the sub’s last known position, about 430km off the south-eastern Valdés peninsula, provided no clues. Balbi said an initial search was hampered “because it was carried out at night and in bad meteorological conditions prevailing in the area of operations”. The three navy ships and two aircraft flying rotations had “already swept 15% of the search area”, Balbi told reporters. The vessel had not activated its emergency beacon, he said. The navy denied a press report that there may have been a fire onboard. “We are investigating the reasons for the lack of communication,” Balbi said. “If there was a communication problem, the boat would have to come to the surface.” The diesel-powered 66-metre-long Class TR 1700 San Juan is one of the Argentinian navy’s three submarines. It was bought from Germany in 1985 and underwent a refit between 2007 and 2014 to extend its usefulness by 30 years. It was on a voyage from the southernmost city of Ushuaia to the naval base of Mar del Plata when contact was lost. Adm Gabriel González, chief of the Mar del Plata base, said the vessel had sufficient food and oxygen. “We have a loss of communications; we are not talking of an emergency,” he said. Relatives of some of the crew members were at the base awaiting word of the search. “We are praying to God and asking that all Argentinians help us to pray that they keep navigating and that they can be found,” said Claudio Rodríguez, whose brother is a crew member. “We have faith that it’s only a loss of communications,” he told local television. Among those onboard is Argentina’s first female submarine officer, Eliana Krawczyk, a 35-year-old weapons officer. “Let us pray that nothing has happened to any crew member. At sea they are all brothers, and a submarine carries more risk than a ship,” her father, Eduardo, told Todo Noticias TV. The governments of the US, UK and Chile have offered satellites and ships to aid in the search, according to Argentina’s foreign ministry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"gnm-press-office/2017/nov/24/guardian-labs-and-google-pixel-2-launch-branded-content-campaign-the-chain-with-a-magazine-and-an-exclusive-programmatic-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"gnm-press-office","sectionName":"GNM press office","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-24T11:20:46Z","webTitle":"Guardian Labs and Google Pixel 2 launch branded content campaign - The Chain with a magazine and an exclusive programmatic campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2017/nov/24/guardian-labs-and-google-pixel-2-launch-branded-content-campaign-the-chain-with-a-magazine-and-an-exclusive-programmatic-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/gnm-press-office/2017/nov/24/guardian-labs-and-google-pixel-2-launch-branded-content-campaign-the-chain-with-a-magazine-and-an-exclusive-programmatic-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Labs and Google Pixel 2 launch branded content campaign - The Chain with a magazine and an exclusive programmatic campaign","bodyText":"Guardian Labs and Google are pleased to announce the launch of The Chain - a new branded content campaign that uses Google Pixel 2 phone to explore the impact of fashion’s most forward-thinking influencers.

Total mortgage lending slipped from £17.5bn to £16.7bn, largely because of a steep decline in loans for buy-to-let following the tax changes. But as lending for landlords has fallen, loans granted to first-time buyers have surged. Britain’s biggest building society said it accounted for one in five of all mortgages given to first-time buyers, helping a record 39,500 young buyers on to the property ladder. However, its lending to landlords plummeted by 40% to £1.7bn. Half-year profits at Nationwide fell to £588m from £615m, although the society said this was partly because of extraordinary items, and that underlying profitability was ahead. It said that future full-year profits will be in a lower range than previously thought, at £900m-£1.3bn a year, partly because of the poorer outlook for the mortgage market and partly because as a mutual it wants to return gains to customers. The chief executive, Joe Garner, said that a “sluggish” economy, partly a result of Brexit, weak wage growth and rising prices are straining its customers’ finances. “Looking ahead, the UK economy should continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate due to the uncertainties around Brexit. Despite the recent base rate rise, borrowing costs overall remain low. However, we know that low wage growth and inflation are putting pressure on household budgets and we remain alert to signs of financial strains on consumers,” said Garner. Loan impairments – where customers have fallen behind with repayments – were up from £37m to £59m, but remain a tiny proportion of the society’s total assets of £228bn. The society was ordered by banking regulators four years ago to plug a capital shortfall, but Garner said its capital position is now at an all-time high and significantly above other high street lenders. Once just a savings and loans provider, the society has emerged as one of the strongest players in current account banking. Garner said that over the past two years it has added 19% more current account customers, taking the total to 7.1m, and that it had taken more account switchers than the major banks combined. However, the society admitted that pricing pressures in mortgages and loans are intensely competitive, and that its market share is likely to decline over the next six months. The half-year results reveal just how dependent the society is on the London property market, although it said its exposure was in line with other lenders. It has lent nearly £60bn to homeowners in the capital, compared to just £16bn in the whole of Scotland and Wales, and £22bn in the rest of the south east of England. Nationwide said house price growth had moderated to the 2% to 4% band in recent months, and that it expected the market to mirror the economy, “sluggish in the near term [but] our central expectation is that it will accelerate in the years ahead, once Brexit uncertainties recede”. •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/19/uk-trade-minister-lobbied-brazil-on-behalf-of-oil-giants","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T16:38:46Z","webTitle":"UK trade minister lobbied Brazil on behalf of oil giants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/19/uk-trade-minister-lobbied-brazil-on-behalf-of-oil-giants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/19/uk-trade-minister-lobbied-brazil-on-behalf-of-oil-giants","fields":{"headline":"UK trade minister lobbied Brazil on behalf of oil giants","bodyText":"Britain successfully lobbied Brazil on behalf of BP and Shell to address the oil giants’ concerns over Brazilian taxation, environmental regulation and rules on using local firms, government documents reveal. The UK’s trade minister travelled to Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and São Paulo in March for a visit with a “heavy focus” on hydrocarbons, to help British energy, mining and water companies win business in Brazil. Greg Hands met with Paulo Pedrosa, Brazilian deputy minister for mines and energy, and “directly” raised the concerns of UK-based oil firms Shell, BP and Premier Oil over “taxation and environmental licensing”. Pedrosa said he was pressing his counterparts in the Brazilian government on the issues, according to a British diplomatic telegram obtained by Greenpeace. The Department for International Trade (DIT) initially released an unredacted version of the telegram under freedom of information rules to Greenpeace’s investigative unit, Unearthed, with sensitive passages highlighted. Shortly after, the department issued a second version of the document, with the same passages redacted. Greenpeace accused the department of acting as a “lobbying arm of the fossil fuel industry”. The UK government denies it was lobbying to weaken the environmental licensing regime, although the lobbying drive appears to have borne fruit. In August, Brazil proposed a multibillion-dollar tax relief plan for offshore drilling, and in October BP and Shell won the bulk of deep-water drilling licenses in a government auction. Rebecca Newsom, senior political adviser at Greenpeace, said: “This is a double embarrassment for the UK government. Liam Fox’s trade minister has been lobbying the Brazilian government over a huge oil project that would undermine the climate efforts Britain made at the UN summit in Bonn. “If that wasn’t bad enough, Fox’s department tried to cover it up and hide its actions from the public, but failed comically.” The document also reveals that the UK pressured Brazil to relax its requirements for oil and gas operators to use a certain amount of Brazilian staff and supply chain companies. British diplomats described the weakening of the so-called local content requirements as a “principal objective” because BP, Shell and Premier Oil would be “direct British beneficiaries” of the changes. The UK’s drive to soften the requirements continued on the day after the meeting between Hands and Pedrosa, with a senior DIT official leading a seminar on the subject at the headquarters of Brazil’s oil and gas regulator. The UK government has come under fire in the past for providing hundreds of millions of pounds of support for Brazil’s scandal-hit state oil firm Petrobras via the UK’s credit export agency. The UK’s continued oil lobbying efforts in Brazil emerged days after British ministers were touting the UK’s leadership on cutting carbon emissions at international climate talks in Bonn. Claire Perry, the climate change minister, told the summit: “we are taking our commitments under the Paris agreement very seriously and we are taking action.” A DIT spokesman said: “DIT is responsible for encouraging international investment opportunities for UK businesses, whilst respecting fully local and international environmental standards. The UK oil and gas industry and supply chain supports thousands of jobs and provides £19bn in goods exports alone. “However, it is absolutely not true that our ministers lobbied to loosen environmental restrictions in Brazil – the meeting was about improving the environmental licensing process, ensuring a level playing field for both domestic and foreign companies, and in particular helping to speed up the licensing process and make it more transparent, which in turn will protect environmental standards.” •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/22/top-10-books-about-mental-hospitals","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T11:00:18Z","webTitle":"Top 10 books about mental hospitals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/22/top-10-books-about-mental-hospitals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/22/top-10-books-about-mental-hospitals","fields":{"headline":"Top 10 books about mental hospitals","bodyText":"Both real and fictional psychiatric institutions are often described in books as places filled with fear, manipulation and danger. Authors frequently take creative liberties to up the intrigue, and frighten their readers with tales of abuse, hauntings and corruption. Although these themes may have been closer to reality in generations past, one hopes that as a society we are progressing toward better treatment and better facilities. I have worked in many mental health and addiction treatment facilities in my career as a psychotherapist, and my experiences in these places helped inform my first novel, The Blind. Its protagonist, Dr Samantha James, works at Typhlos, a fictional psychiatric institution in Manhattan that is suffering from overcrowding and underfunding. Despite feeling caught up in red tape, Sam is an intrepid clinician, doing everything in her power to reach and help her patients – something that is, happily, also a common reality. Typhlos acts as the backdrop for her journey, teetering on the edge of mental illness, and her experience is mirrored in the chaos of the institution itself. The following books are diverse representations of institutions (for both mental health and drug and alcohol treatment) as they once existed, and as they exist today, as well as the humanity and compassion that flourishes within the walls of these facilities. 1. One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest by Ken Kesey In this masterful representation of the relationships that develop between patients and staff in an Oregon institution, Kesey explores the all-important questions of who is mentally well, who is unwell, and who makes that distinction. Narrated by “Chief” Bromden, Randle MacMurphy’s relationship with Big Nurse Ratched is a brilliant example of the frightening power struggle that can exist inside treatment facilities, and the terrifying abuses of authority that can take place there. 2. I Never Promised You a Rose Garden by Hannah Green I read this book for the first time as a teenager, and was struck by the imaginary world of Yr that the author frequently visited, and discussed with her psychiatrists. The doctors, based on the author’s real-life psychiatrist, are not convinced that the world of Yr is a true delusion, and base their diagnosis on the idea that she is making up her delusions to impress her doctors. While this may seem a step in the wrong direction, the doctors are impressed with her ability to create such a magical and detailed kingdom, and believe this is an indication that she will be capable of making a successful recovery. A story of hope and understanding, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden shows what can occur when a patient is empowered to help in her own treatment. 3. Gracefully Insane: The Rise and Fall of America’s Premier Mental Hospital by Alex Beam A fictionalised setting for both The Bell Jar and Girl, Interrupted, McLean Hospital is the main character in Beam’s non-fiction work. He describes the hospital at administrative, clinical and patient levels, and explores the history of the physical plant itself, the society surrounding it, and its ultimate fate. Through the decades that McLean served as the backdrop for myriad stories of tragedy and recovery, Beam takes a critical, often aloof and sometimes comical approach to describing and dismantling the mysteries and nuances of a famed institution. 4. Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen Kaysen’s memoir explores her experiences in McLean Hospital, where she was institutionalised after an overdose, and eventually diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Kaysen describes the oscillation between feelings of madness and sanity, and struggles to determine how she can be placed squarely in one category or the other. This book has detailed portraits of fellow patients, as well as comprehensive accounts of her experiences with staff. The richness of her narrative, combined with the almost panicked storytelling make for a compelling look into life in a 1960s mental hospital. 5. A Million Little Pieces by James Frey Frey’s representation of the cold, sterile world inside a drug and alcohol treatment facility, structured with schedules and rules that are inevitably broken, echoes the real hallways where I have worked as a psychotherapist and addictions counsellor. Despite the controversy surrounding the veracity of the stories in this work, Frey illustrates an authentic journey into and eventually out of inpatient treatment. A Million Little Pieces also deftly explores the complicated role that family plays in treatment. 6. It’s Kind of a Funny Story by Ned Vizzini Vizinni’s beautifully narrated tale of institutionalisation after a suicide attempt is made all the more powerful and relevant in the wake of the author’s suicide. Having grown up in New York City, Vizzini created a semi-autobiographical young adult story of a privileged New York City teenager trudging through the depths of depression, who learns in treatment that he has talents that he can use to aid in his recovery. It’s a hopeful story, highlighting the often overlooked hopeful possibilities of psychiatric treatment. 7. I Know This Much Is True by Wally Lamb There is so much going on in this book – the experience of being a twin, survivor’s guilt, sexual abuse and self-injury – that the reader is left frightened and breathless. The institution is one of those dangerous and corrupt fictional places that have haunted and fascinated readers for generations. Throughout the twists and turns, cringes and tears one experiences, in the end it’s a powerful story of family support and loyalty in the face of severe illness and tragic circumstance. 8. Great Apes by Will Self The worlds of mental health treatment and addiction counselling are often despondent and difficult. In fictional and historical portrayals, catastrophic ends and dreadful environments are ubiquitous. Call in Will Self and his superbly satirical and thought-provoking novel, where humans and chimpanzees have switched places in the pecking order, for the comic relief we have been craving. 9. Go Ask Alice by Anonymous Although there is controversy surrounding the presentation of this book as an actual journal when it is a work of fiction, I find it an excellent representation of the fears and anxieties of adolescence that, in the case of the protagonist, lead to experimenting and self-medicating with drugs, which eventually result in her hospitalisation. The vulnerability the author expresses feels at times almost too much to bear. 10. The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath Perhaps the best-known representation of an individual experience of insanity, The Bell Jar became even more poignant in the wake of Plath’s eventual suicide, in 1963. A work of somewhat autobiographical fiction, the story takes readers on an extraordinary journey into the mind of Esther Greenwood as she descends into madness. The book is based on Plath’s experience at McLean Hospital, and it elucidates the experience of losing one’s self with such realism and clarity that one can’t help but question one’s own fragile psyche.

Allen, who has built a broadcast and writing career on nine previous near-death experiences, was picked up by helicopter from a remote airstrip on Friday after missing a planned flight home last weekend. Some on social media have questioned whether his disappearance was a publicity stunt. But allies of Allen, who is believed to have contracted malaria, suggest he is annoyed by the worldwide interest in his latest jungle scrape. Before he went missing, one of his last communications with the outside world was a knowing reference to the famous last words of the doomed Edwardian explorer Lawrence Oates. “I may be some time (don’t try to rescue me, please – where I’m going in PNG, you won’t ever find me),” Allen tweeted. His agent Jo Sarsby insisted it was “utterly not true” to suggest news of Allen’s plight had been spread for PR purposes. She told the Guardian she had raised the alarm with the media this week after being told by Allen’s wife, Lenka, that he was missing. She said: “It was us I suppose that caused all this problem, but how could we have found him without the publicity? I’ve seen accusations on Facebook that this was a hoax and I thought ‘poor Benedict’, because it was not. “I had a quick chat with him and he really isn’t feeling very well. He’s not thrilled by it because he’s an explorer like Pen Hadow and Ranulph Fiennes and that’s what they do. He’s not feeling great about the press all being involved.” Allen’s rescue was coordinated by a Hong Kong-based fixer, Steven Ballantyne, who has worked with him on previous assignments to the area. “It was through the press and it going kind of viral that people got on to to Steven,” Sarsby claimed. Ballantyne said media coverage had not hindered the rescue but had given the false impression that Allen was in physical danger from the very people who help him to safety. Allen had been seeking to reconnect with the Yaifo tribe, one of the few left in the world that has virtually no contact with the outside world, whom he visited 30 years ago. The Daily Mail described it as a “quest to reach a lost tribe of headhunters”. Ballantyne said: “Benedict has had quite an adventure and we should be proud that he, with the help of many amazing people in PNG, came so far.“Personally I would not have alerted the press, but this was not my call. The media attention has sadly given a very poor and misleading view of Papua New Guinea.” Ballantyne said he had advised Allen against travelling alone in the area without a satellite phone or tracking device. “My part was simply to help another who was potentially in trouble – trouble of his own making due to his chosen method of travel,” he said. Allen, who has three young children, is known to have annoyed his family by travelling without a tracking devices. Alex Hibbert, a polar expedition leader who knows Allen, said his family had every right to complain. “His family have reason to dole out a serious dressing down. It’s avoidably fatalistic to do away with a tiny PLB [personal locator beacon]. I gather he is highly motivated by doing things ‘properly’ and by self-reliance. He seems to be a genuinely gifted and decent man, but not one incapable of making a mistake.” He added: “Benedict is a man with a serious track record of competent solo travel and isn’t from the next generation of jack-of-all-trades adventurers, many of whom put style and Instagram before real substance. This means that he is more resourceful than most but [is someone] for whom nostalgia or purity could potentially trump the adoption of modern safety equipment.” As well as shunning modern devices, Allen is known to have a weakness for colonial-era nicknacks. His favourite piece of furniture is an Indian chest given to his great-grandfather by Rudyard Kipling, and he owns a handwritten note from General Charles Gordon, who ordered the siege of Khartoum. Allen had been due to give one of his frequent talks about his dangerous exploits to the Royal Geographical Society in Hong Kong on Tuesday. As he was lost in the jungle at the time, his audience missed out on stories of how he ate his own dog to survive in the Amazon, and how he was shot at by drug barons in Colombia. In a 2012 TedxSalford talk, Allen explained why he was drawn to such exploits. “For me it’s about making me feel alive. It is incredibly exhilarating to pull off these journeys,” he said. “It is said that I’m someone who’s almost died nine times, but the fact of the matter is I haven’t died, perhaps due to two things: preparation and belief in myself.” Denis Crowdy, an ethnomusicologist based at Macquarie University in Sydney who spent more than 10 years in Papua New Guinea, said Allen’s approach was an embarrassment. He said he and many of his contacts in the country were angry about press coverage of Allen’s plight. “Anthropologists were also deeply cynical, clearly recognising Allen and his genre of exoticist square-jawed Boy’s Own adventurer Royal Geographical Society lecture tour self-indulgence,” Crowdy said. “Why should we care about a lost, unprepared, silly, white privileged male middle-aged fool? All of the stories have been solely focused on his ‘safety’, when PNG faces some real challenges that are genuinely worthy of reporting.” After Allen’s rescue, Ballantyne hopes he will use the opportunity to change his approach. He said: “My hope is that in time Benedict will be able to put to rest the far-fetched claims made by some media reports.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/17/zlatan-ibrahimovic-paul-pogba-back-manchester-united-squad-newcastle","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T22:38:59Z","webTitle":"Manchester United set sights on Gareth Bale despite injury concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/17/zlatan-ibrahimovic-paul-pogba-back-manchester-united-squad-newcastle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/17/zlatan-ibrahimovic-paul-pogba-back-manchester-united-squad-newcastle","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United set sights on Gareth Bale despite injury concerns","bodyText":"Manchester United want to sign Gareth Bale from Real Madrid and are not put off by the forward’s injury problems because they believe they would be able to improve his condition. Bale has missed 40 of Real’s last 60 matches because of injury. He has not played since late September and is expected to be out for a further month and a half after suffering a thigh problem last week when he was nearing a return from calf trouble. That was the Wales international’s 19th injury since he joined Real in September 2013 for a then world record £85m but it is understood this is not a concern for United. José Mourinho has previously tried to bring Bale to Old Trafford and remains keen to do so, though any bid is expected next summer rather than in January. United are encouraged by Bale’s better appearance record when at Tottenham Hotspur and believe they could return him to a similar level of games. He played 52 matches in the season before his move to Madrid, 48 the campaign before and 44 in 2010-11. Bale earns about £350,000 a week after tax and is contracted until 2022. He has a €1bn (£890m) buyout clause but given his injury issues Real would demand considerably less if they wanted to sell him. United’s injury problems are easing, with Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo available for Saturday’s home game against Newcastle United. Mourinho picked out Pogba’s absence as a particular hardship for the team. Pogba pulled a hamstring during the 3-0 Champions League win over Basel on 12 September. United were unbeaten at that point but surrendered that record when losing 2-1 at Huddersfield a month later. They also lost at Chelsea in the last match before the international break. Ibrahimovic and Rojo have been out since April with knee injuries.. Mourinho said: “Now I can speak because Paul is back but you can clearly see Manchester United this season before Paul’s injury and after Paul’s injury. There are qualities in our football that influence our approach in matches, with Pogba and without Pogba, that’s as simple as that.” Ibrahimovic ended last season as United’s top scorer with 28 goals, despite his campaign ending early. Mourinho said: “Zlatan last season we played with him every minute almost until he was injured. This season we learn how to play without him but he’s a very important player. We welcome him back. “He has an incredible personality to fight such an important injury. We were all saying in 2017 he will be back but one thing is 31 December 2017 and another thing is mid-November. He was as an injured player the same super professional he is when he’s fit. “So fantastic work – same as Marcos, who had a serious injury too, a big surgery. He played with the young boys [the reserves] on Wednesday and is fine, is confident, is also ready. Paul is obviously not the same dimension, was not a surgical situation but was also bad and all three are back.” Of the 36-year-old Ibrahimovic, Mourinho added: “You cannot expect him to play 90 minutes or consecutive matches like he did all his career. Now he needs time to be back for his level, his fitness, his confidence, everything, his sharpness, but by the clinical point of view it is fantastic to be ready.” United are in second place, eight points behind Manchester City. Mourinho pointed to the two derby games as vital if they are to catch City. “I am confident that tomorrow we can win against Newcastle, and that is the way we have to look at it: to play every match thinking we can win and to think we play against City in two matches where we can interfere with the situation,” he said. “All the other matches Manchester City plays we cannot interfere with. We can watch it, we can agree with some referee decisions in their matches, yes or no. But we can’t interfere.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/shortcuts/2017/nov/17/katy-perry-ban-china-fruit-sister-taiwan","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T14:34:36Z","webTitle":"Why China has had enough of 'Fruit Sister' Katy Perry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2017/nov/17/katy-perry-ban-china-fruit-sister-taiwan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/shortcuts/2017/nov/17/katy-perry-ban-china-fruit-sister-taiwan","fields":{"headline":"Why China has had enough of 'Fruit Sister' Katy Perry","bodyText":"Name: Katy Perry Age: 33.

Except China. What’s she got against China? Nothing. She’s banned. The Chinese authorities have reportedly refused Perry a visa to perform at a forthcoming Victoria’s Secret fashion show in Shanghai. What did she do to upset them? She wore a glittery dress with sunflowers all over it. You mean she was banned on grounds of taste? Not exactly. The dress, which she wore during a 2015 concert in Taipei, appeared to support Taiwanese anti-China protesters, who have a sunflower as their emblem. Was she trying to be politically provocative? Probably not – the dress had featured in prior shows on the tour – but then she went on to wear a Republic of China – ie Taiwan – flag as a cape. And the People’s Republic wasn’t happy. They don’t recognise the republic and claim Taiwan as their territory. They’re pretty touchy about that sort of thing. Have any other entertainers been banned from China? Oh my, yes. Maroon 5 were forced to scrap two concerts in 2015, reportedly after their keyboard player sent a birthday tweet to the Dalai Lama. Whoops. Lady Gaga was refused entry to China because of her support for Tibet, as were Björk and Oasis. Justin Bieber has also been banned. What did he get banned for? Non-specific idiocy. Fair enough. Does Perry have a big following in China? She does. Among her Chinese fanbase she is known affectionately as “Fruit Sister”. Why do they call her that? Due to her habit of wearing fruit-themed costumes on stage, and performing with outsize fruit-shaped props. Does she care if she never goes to China again? It would mean a cut in income – China is a huge market for western entertainers. What are her chances of getting a visa in the future? Never say never. In July the Chinese culture bureau said: “We hope Justin Bieber is able to improve his conduct as he grows up and will once again find public favour.” Do say: “Perry deserves the right to free political expression, however inadvertent.” Don’t say: “Stick to fruit, sister.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/17/benedict-allen-explorer-racist-british-colonial","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T14:48:59Z","webTitle":"The white man’s blunders of ‘explorer’ Benedict Allen feed racist myths | Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/17/benedict-allen-explorer-racist-british-colonial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/17/benedict-allen-explorer-racist-british-colonial","fields":{"headline":"The white man’s blunders of ‘explorer’ Benedict Allen feed racist myths","bodyText":"I was happy when a notification popped up to tell me that Benedict Allen, the British “explorer” reportedly lost in the jungles of Papua New Guinea, had been found alive and well (although with possible malaria). That feeling didn’t last long. The whole notion of white men dangerously journeying to foreign lands is too intimately connected to the colonial nostalgia that pervades “Great Britain” for it to be something to celebrate. The anthropological and ethical thought behind Allen’s journey seems tepid at best. On a blog written before he set off to Papua New Guinea, he calls the Yaifo, the tribe he is attempting to revisit, an “extraordinary discovery” (they’re people, not some new species), and says that the reason he is revisiting them is to create a “brief record of their lives, if possible tracking down some of those, such as Fifi (pictured playing with a makeshift pig’s bladder ball), who’d remember me”. Has he considered the fact that he could bring deadly diseases to an isolated tribe? That his presence might be unwelcome? Or that he is feeding into an ancient narrative of black savagery, as the newspapers scrambled to describe his mission of searching for a tribe of “headhunters”? Reading the blog post, it seems this expedition was more of an attempt to cling on to his fast-receding youth than any noble scientific adventure. That was compounded by his statement that the reason he doesn’t bring GPS tracking devices or satellite phones on his trips was because “this is how I do my journeys of exploration. I grow older but no wiser, it seems … ”. You said it, Benedict. What makes it even more toe-curlingly frustrating is that he left behind, desperately worried, his wife, Lenka Allen, and children Beatrice, 2, Freddie, 7, and Natalya, 10. Lenka told the Daily Mail: “He has been so careful since I married him. He hasn’t done anything this scary and slightly reckless – it’s the first time that he has gone on his own.” His actions scream selfish midlife crisis. The wider picture is that when we talk about “explorers”, we are implicitly talking about European exploration, and within that (thanks to the patriarchal societies that have dominated Europe for centuries) exploration and adventuring by white men – from Columbus to Bear Grylls. Checking out the Wikipedia pages of “explorers” reveals hundreds of names, only 10 whom are people of colour, and even fewer women. Thankfully, in recent years there has been more anthropological discourse around this, and even fictional books that unpick the psyche of the white men throughout history who have dragged their families across the world, sometimes as missionaries and sometimes as “inventors” or “explorers” – in search of a paradise they can make their own, packed with subservient locals and abundant crops. Think Barbara Kingsolver’s The Poisonwood Bible, or The Mosquito Coast from Paul Theroux, both of which end in the failure of the white man to effect any change on the local population. Indeed, they inflict pain and suffering on the people closest to them. We should pay closer attention to this type of literature and work to erode the mentality that traditional exploration in the modern age is anything more than an “othering” of foreign cultures and people with darker skin tones. As such, it’s possible to have some tiny pinch of sympathy for Allen. There are centuries of misguided precedent behind what he has done, and there’s no denying that exploration is an intoxicating idea. It’s a trap I’ve fallen into myself. When I was 17 I visited Peru with what was then known as the British Schools Exploration Society (BSES). In my head since I had first read it, in 2001, was Journey to the River Sea, a book by Eva Ibbotson, which in hindsight is actually a fascinating comment on white colonisation. At the time, all I wanted was to mimic the excitement the main character feels when making the journey from the UK to the Amazon rainforest and meeting the local people. As it turned out, the trip was more tragic than I could have anticipated. The expedition adjacent to my own took place in Svalbard, and led to the untimely death of Horatio Chapple, an Eton student who was mauled by a polar bear. Several other BSES explorers were injured. Meanwhile, in Peru, we had problems with food shortages and the wily coral snake, which has the second strongest venom of any in the world. The creature turned up in a river we were crossing, and again in the sleeping bag of one of our expedition leaders. We found out about the death of Chapple while sitting in the belly of a steel boat that was taking us home, warned to anticipate journalists at the airport. Chapple isn’t the only young person to have died on an expedition. However, while I think there is something to be said about the explorer’s mindset putting children in harm’s way, my experience made it clear that expeditions can be done relatively ethically – eschewing and challenging the colonial, voluntourism mindset of “helping” locals build homes or, like Allen, “finding lost tribes” who probably don’t feel lost and don’t want to be found. All children should be given the opportunity to see different parts of the world, no matter what their background, or whether they happen to be born in Europe, but the UK is still reaping the benefits of its colonial exploits. We Brits are far more likely to be able to travel than some of our foreign counterparts. White men such as Benedict Allen should cease their meaningless, problematic “explorations” and focus instead on the ways they can counter the privileges they inhabit, at home and abroad. • Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff is opinions editor at gal-dem.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/20/is-eating-food-too-quickly-bad-for-health","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T08:00:24Z","webTitle":"Is eating too quickly bad for your health?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/20/is-eating-food-too-quickly-bad-for-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/20/is-eating-food-too-quickly-bad-for-health","fields":{"headline":"Is eating too quickly bad for your health?","bodyText":"Do you savour mealtimes or do you wolf your food down?

Receptors in the stomach that respond to being stretched by food, and the hormones that signal to the brain that partially digested food has made it to the small intestine, can take 15 to 20 minutes to kick in. A study of more than 3,000 men and women in Japan (where studying the impact of speedy eating is popular) found that those who ate quickly and continued until they were full were three times more likely to be overweight than those who ate more slowly. Faster eaters may also get more acid reflux than slower ones – a study of 10 healthy people asked to eat a 690-calorie meal in either five or 30 minutes found that those who ate faster had 12.5 episodes of reflux compared with 8.5 in those who ate more slowly. Another study, from China, found that people reduce their calorie intake by more than 10% if they chew their food 40 times compared with 15 times. And a further study, in which 30 young women were given large plates of pasta and asked to eat quickly, showed that while they consumed 649 calories in nine minutes, this fell to 579 when they were told to chew the food up to 20 times. Chewing more helps to digest your food – your saliva has enzymes that both lubricate and start digesting what you eat – and allows your taste buds to “notice” the meal. To eat more slowly, talk between mouthfuls (not during them), reduce your pace to match the slowest eater at the table and don’t wait to be starving before you get food.

But secondary school children in England are now more likely to have tried illegal drugs than cigarettes, according to NHS Digital. 24% of 11-15-year-olds report having tried illegal recreational drugs at least once, a nine percentage point rise on the last survey, in 2014. In the past decade, the government has raised the legal age for buying tobacco from 16 to 18, banned smoking in enclosed public spaces, introduced graphic health warnings and introduced rules that hide tobacco products from view in shops. Off-licences have become far stricter about who they sell to, and bars and clubs have introduced stricter ID requirements for entry. Fiona Sim, a family doctor and former chair of the Royal Society for Public Health, said the fall in the numbers of young people smoking and drinking reflected a general social trend.

But buried deep inside the article, a reluctant qualifier completely undermines the bombastic headline. Recent case in point: BuzzFeed’s article titled Secret Findings 60 Russian Payments “To Finance Election Campaign Of 2016”, complete with an eye-poppingly red banner which hammers home the above quote. Even more suggestive – and intentionally misleading, as it appears – was a push notification sent by BuzzFeed to promote the article. The most plausible explanation for wire transfers from a Russian bank to Russian embassies across the world makes it clear that the money was intended to fund the Russian election campaign of 2016, not the American one. It’s well hidden inside the article and surrounded by unnecessary, irrelevant details (“Seven nations had federal elections during the span when the funds were sent”.) The cycle repeats ad nauseam, each time further diminishing trust in the media – both in the US and Russia itself where the likes of CNN have historically been looked up to, argues Oleg Kashin, a prominent Russian journalist, in a widely circulated opinion piece. Sensationalist, irresponsible reporting in the west gives perfect ammunition to Russia’s own state propaganda which gleefully uses every opportunity to shut down the Kremlin’s detractors both at home and abroad. So far, the UK has been relatively insulated from the hysteria that has gripped Trump’s America for months. In the run-up to, and immediately after, the EU referendum, few voices attempted to blame Brexit on Vladimir Putin – one of them being Garry Kasparov, a career Putin critic. However cataclysmic, Brexit has up until now been seen as Britain’s own doing, for better or worse, depending which side you support. Not any more: taking their cue from America, UK politicians and media are now attempting to blame the trauma of Brexit on – who else? – Putin. The “It was the Russians wot won it” argument follows a familiar pattern of omission and exaggeration. Take a recent Sky News article: “An expert says posters linked to the Kremlin made a determined effort to interfere with the result of the Brexit vote in 2016,” says the piece. The inevitable downer waits until the seventh paragraph to pour cold water on your hopes that maybe Brexit wasn’t Britain’s own fault: “Ms Lu told Sky News: ‘First of all the number of these tweets is important to highlight. So there’s about 400 tweets here out of 22.6 million. That is a very infinitesimal fraction. So the word interference is perhaps a bit exaggerated.’” You can now expect to see many more of these hot takes, extrapolating scarce data to fit a narrative and carpet-blaming “the Russians” (really: “It is very strange that someone whose language is Russian tweets in English,” says a New York Times expert.) Especially now, when the idea has been encouraged by Theresa May’s unprompted tirade at the Lord Mayor’s dinner . There will be more headlines, statements demanding an investigation into the “Russian meddling” in the vain hope that Brexit can be reversed, and parliamentary inquiries. Russia, it will be said, influenced (or at least attempted to) the Brexit vote. Or Russian trolls simply spread divisive messages, trying to “sow discord”. What exactly does “influence” mean? Some facts at this point are not debatable: yes, there is a dedicated cyber-offensive unit (in fact, there are several; I personally know of at least three) based in Saint Petersburg where dozens of full-time employees post social media messages supporting one side of a major political or social debate, or both. The “Internet Research Agency”, as it’s now known, is well-staffed and funded by someone extremely close and loyal to Putin. But how effective are their efforts, exactly? There is still no definite quantitative research confirming that “X people were successfully influenced by social media messaging” to the point where they reversed their previous convictions and voted for a candidate or cause supposedly preferential to the Kremlin. We are often presented with figures like “120 million people were exposed to Russian propaganda on social media” based on vague metrics like “reach” or “engagement”. The idea that an outside power can influence the outcome of a national election rests on the assumption that enough citizens are so universally gullible that a tweet or a Facebook post which they’ve spent a fraction of a second viewing is enough to upend an entire life – or generations – of voting Democrat, Labour, or whatever political force the author associates themselves with. And that all of them are online. Context is also important. What played a bigger role, a #Brexit hashtag retweeted by a dozen other bots or leave’s campaign bus? What’s more divisive, a hundred Russian trolls or a Daily Mail front page? Who’s sowing more discord, a RT show watched by 0.05% of UK’s TV audience (per Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board’s latest measure) or Nigel Farage? If you consider this, Russian trolling operations seem less like pouring gasoline on fire and more like pouring a bucket of water into the ocean. Maybe it’s the very idea that someone who is not even British violated the sacred rituals of democracy that is so offensive to May? But surely, that the same democracy is so fragile and its members can be led by a cyber Pied Piper into oblivion must be more offensive? Brexit, Trump, the resurgence of rightwing populism and centrifugal forces ripping Europe apart all have deep historical roots and a myriad of contemporary factors – of which Russian meddling is but one, and by no objective measure a significant one at that. Consider this: even if Putin supported Brexit, as Kasparov argued, because he benefits from a fractured Europe – which itself is doubtful – he’s definitely not a very talented strategist. Russian officials privately sigh in exasperation: they had no plan in place for Brexit, the whole thing is baffling and they don’t know who to talk to any more (the same applies to Trump’s administration). “If they only knew,” one told me, meaning the level of confusion in their agency. If you want to effectively resist outside attempts to influence your democratic processes, you must be able to assess them realistically. Repeating vague, panic-mongering statements from self-interested parties won’t help. Putin’s Russia definitely has some capacity for general mischief-making, but it’s no super villain. Take it from someone who’s seen enough absurdity and incompetence in his 17 years spent covering it from the inside. • Alexey Kovalev is a Russian journalist and contributing editor at codastory.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/shortcuts/2017/nov/17/lentils-glitter-alternatives-banned-christmas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T13:38:39Z","webTitle":"Lentils are so 2013 – an on-trend guide to glitter alternatives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/nov/17/lentils-glitter-alternatives-banned-christmas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/nov/17/lentils-glitter-alternatives-banned-christmas","fields":{"headline":"Lentils are so 2013 – an on-trend guide to glitter alternatives","bodyText":"A nursery chain has identified glitter as a harmful pollutant, and banned children from using it when making Christmas decorations this year. Instead, Tops Day Nurseries is now promoting rice and lentils as substitute festive materials. However, not everyone has access to rice and lentils, so here are some other environmentally friendly glitter alternatives. Pasta When I was at nursery in the 80s, I glued some rigatoni to a cardboard circle, spraypainted it silver and gave it to my mum as a tree decoration. It remains in use, because a pasta Christmas decoration isn’t just for Christmas; it is for a lifetime of resentfully making your Christmas tree look as if it was furnished by a hamfisted berk. Quinoa Lentils are so 2013. If you really want kids to flaunt their lefty credentials, then it’s quinoa or nothing. A lentil-covered decoration says: “I care about the environment”, but quinoa says: “I care about the environment and recognising the ancestral practices of the indigenous Andean people”. Sausage roll particles Greggs ruined Christmas by ramming a sausage roll into a manger and passing it off as the baby Jesus. What an amazing PR move it would be for Greggs to obliterate its remaining stocks of sacrilegious pastry and hand out the remnants to children as a more thoughtful glitter proxy. Ground-up diamonds Pasta, quinoa and pastry are all well and good, but they just don’t glitter like glitter does. So here is what Tops Day Nurseries should do: encourage kids to rifle through their mothers’ jewellery, smash the prettiest items up with a hammer and glue whatever is left on to a Christmas card or whatever. Finally, Christmas can be twinkly again. Microbeads With the government’s ban on microplastics about to come into force, it presumably means that there will be a ton of microbeads suddenly milling around without purpose, freed from the lotions and toothpastes that once housed them.

But the uncomfortable truth is that a bunch of ideological Brexit clowns have perpetrated a coup on the British government and the majority of the British people. Seldom – or, to be more precise, never – in half a century of covering British economics have I encountered such a failure of leadership at a time of crisis. We came close to the abyss in 1976 but were saved by Jim Callaghan, the prime minister, and Denis Healey, the chancellor. On that occasion, after fraught talks, the two held the cabinet together and negotiated a loan from the International Monetary Fund which restored our credibility in the markets. Callaghan and Healey were political giants. So were the dissidents such as Tony Crosland, Michael Foot and Tony Benn, whom they managed to win round. And their civil servants respected what their political masters were trying to do. No such respect now, and not surprisingly. It is increasingly obvious that, in Brexit, the British public has been sold a pup. The negotiations with our EU counterparts and the debate in Westminster have reached satirical proportions for one simple reason: the government has embarked on Mission Impossible. This, I think, is the principal explanation for the deepening nastiness in tone of the more vociferous Brexiters. It started with the execrable attack by the Daily Mail on the supreme court for concluding that parliament, not the executive, should have the ultimate say. The irony that the Mail and their Brexit friends were campaigning for bringing back ultimate authority from European law to British lawyers whose judgment they objected to seems to have escaped them. Then they moved on to attack those of us who wish to call a halt to this Gadarene rush to the Brexit cliff as “saboteurs” or “traitors”. What a wonderful distortion of language it is to describe patriots as traitors! Then, last week, we had the Daily Telegraph, in former days renowned for the fairness of its news coverage, making the main news on its front page photographs of 15 Conservative MPs presented as a kind of rogues’ gallery, with the banner headline “The Brexit Mutineers”. All this smacks of panic in the ranks of the Brexiters. And yet, if there is not exactly panic in the ranks of the Remain camp, the complaint I continually hear is that it still lacks a strong leader. Why, even George Osborne’s biographer, Janan Ganesh, was hinting in the Financial Times last week that it needs someone with the determination of Gordon Brown. The recent publication of Brown’s fascinating memoirs reminds one, too, of his heroic exercise of leadership in 2008-09, in rescuing the world economy from the financial crisis. His memoirs contain a strong defence of the Keynesian measures he took and preached to others – an example of leadership that won the approbation of Presidents Obama and Sarkozy. Unfortunately, the stimulus in this country was withdrawn prematurely by the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition, whose policies of austerity from 2010 onwards damaged not only the social fabric but also investment and the productivity on which it depends. Indeed, as Remainer Philip Hammond has been drawing up the budget – due on Wednesday – the Office for Budget Responsibility has warned that the economy’s enfeebled productivity places a manifest constraint on his room for manoeuvre, as does the prospect of Brexit. This does not, of course, deter the Brexiters: not at all. Both the ubiquitous Jacob Rees-Mogg and that long-time Eurosceptic John Redwood – one of John Major’s “bastards” – have told the Treasury to make its forecasts more optimistic, so that a cushion can be provided for the damage that will almost certainly occur if Brexit is not stopped. Redwood knows the score: in his capacity as an investment adviser he has been downplaying the prospects for Britain and advising clients to invest in, er, mainland Europe. Redwood and Rees-Mogg seem blissfully unaware that, first, the Treasury no longer makes pre-budget forecasts, and, second, that it was precisely to discontinue the ancient practice of chancellors trying to fiddle the forecast that responsibility for it was put in the hands of the OBR. Incidentally, I do not blame non-experts for being misled by Brexiters’ false claims in the referendum. The Cameron government should have explained how the whole of the UK benefits from the EU. We are essentially a region of Europe, and take for granted a daily supply system of goods, services and – especially – food that would be severely disrupted by “no deal” and the consequent huge bureaucratic problems at the ports. Only last week the benefits of being part of a strong trading bloc were demonstrated when the European commission made it clear that it would be acting for the UK in the dispute between Boeing and Bombardier. Brussels has clout in trade disputes; on its own the UK would be crushed in negotiation by powerful US lobbies. When we applied to join the EEC in the early 1970s, the negotiations were founded on common objectives: both sides wanted UK entry. On Brexit there are no common objectives; hence the shambles. All this stuff about “negotiating” a £20bn divorce settlement is so much hogwash. We are legally bound to pay some £60bn in the course of the rest of the decade anyway. That is, whether or not we go ahead on this disastrous course. My impression is that people are gradually hearing the opposite message, not least the young. If the polls move markedly in favour of Remain, then whoever is prime minister should broadcast to the nation that it is time to think again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/17/eddie-jones-accuses-australia-michael-cheika-of-showing-a-lack-of-respect-england-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T12:26:10Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones hits out at Australia for trying to influence the referee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/17/eddie-jones-accuses-australia-michael-cheika-of-showing-a-lack-of-respect-england-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/17/eddie-jones-accuses-australia-michael-cheika-of-showing-a-lack-of-respect-england-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Jones hits out at Australia for trying to influence the referee","bodyText":"Eddie Jones has hit out at Australia for trying to influence the referee, Ben O’Keeffe, through the media in the build-up to Saturday’s Test at Twickenham. Jones was responding to claims by the Australia head coach, Michael Cheika, on Thursday that England will attempt to “bully” the Wallabies and that they specifically look to target their half-backs with late hits. Cheika initially said he would not be taking the issue up with O’Keeffe but it is now understood the Australia head coach was due to meet the 28-year-old New Zealander on Friday, as was Jones. Addressing Cheika’s earlier claims, Jones said: “Obviously [Australia] like the media more than the referee. The referee is an intelligent guy and I’m sure he won’t be influenced by comments made in the press. I have coached over 100 Tests and every Test I have had a meeting with the referee and it is a sign of respect that you want to know what he wants from the game and what we want and it is a mutual exchange of information for the benefit of the game. “We’ve played four games against Australia, there have been great referees in each of those four games. We play by the rules and are happy to stand by that. [Cheika] obviously feels the referees haven’t done a good job so possibly he should be taking that up with the referee not the media.” Jones also questioned Cheika’s choice of words amid a number of bullying scandals within sporting organisations in the UK at present. “It’s a nice term to use at the moment,” he said. “You get up in the morning and there is a story on cyber-bullying, a story on British gymnastics – it’s a common word to use. We have had a good preparation and those comments by Australia are literally water off a duck’s back. I don’t know about all that fun and games. They want to play a lot of games at this stage.” Soon after Cheika’s comments, the former Australia head coach Bob Dwyer further stirred the pot and warned O’Keeffe to keep a watchful eye on England’s props Dan Cole and Joe Marler, urging that “the referee tells his two touchies [touch judges] to keep a close eye on them”. In the past Dwyer has needed no second invitation to question the legality of England’s scrum and Jones responded: “I am disappointed that he is a bit late. Bob normally comes earlier in the week but … it is all part of the fun and games of England-Australia Test matches.” During England’s 3-0 series win in June 2016 Cheika was accused of gatecrashing Jones’s meeting with the referee Craig Joubert. When the sides met again last December, Jones publicly invited Cheika to his planned meeting with Jaco Peyper but the Australia coach claimed it would be a waste of time. Jones, however, insisted it was standard practice to meet the 28-year-old O’Keeffe, who is also an eye-specialist doctor. “We always meet the referee. There is nothing unusual about that and I might get my eyes checked by him,” said Jones. “He has been on the touch when we played and I met him as a young guy coming through. He is a very good young ref and is only 28, which is younger than Dylan [Hartley] who might be able to give him a few tips about life. He’s a very competent, accurate and fit referee.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/2017/nov/27/inside-crackland-open-air-crack-market-sao-paulo","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T07:30:18Z","webTitle":"Inside Crackland: the open-air drug market that São Paulo just can’t kick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/nov/27/inside-crackland-open-air-crack-market-sao-paulo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/nov/27/inside-crackland-open-air-crack-market-sao-paulo","fields":{"headline":"Inside Crackland: the open-air drug market that São Paulo just can’t kick","bodyText":"“It’s a horrible life. You don’t eat. You don’t sleep. Any money you can get goes on crack,” says Felipa Drumont. Drumont is 26, trans, homeless and addicted to crack. For the last four years, she has lived on the streets of an area of central São Paulo that has become infamous: Cracolândia, literally “Crackland”. Here, hundreds of people sit in the middle of the street, wrapped in blankets, and smoke crack openly. Others wander, wild eyed, looking for tin cans and other recyclables to sell. Most are skinny and gaunt, faces contorted from years of drug abuse. There is garbage everywhere and a thick smell of body odour. Police patrol the perimeter, just metres away. They keep an eye on things but don’t intervene with the drug-taking or dealing. Instead, they mostly watch for other crimes, such as robbery. Municipal officers and NGO workers hover nearby. Even more surprisingly, on weekdays, there are also workers with backpacks and suited office types, who scurry past on the opposite side of the street. Despite being a scene of intense urban degradation, Crackland in fact sits on prime real estate. It is next to Luz, the city’s biggest and busiest train station. Less than 100m away is a neoclassical style concert hall that last year hosted a performance by American jazz legend Herbie Hancock. There are private technical colleges nearby, and a leisure centre. The office of South America’s biggest newspaper, Folha de São Paulo, known sometimes as the New York Times of Brazil, is a few blocks away. None of it makes much difference to the addicts. Some exchange jokes or handshakes with each other, but most just look bewildered and lost. It is unlike nearly anything in any city in the world. To some, including the current mayor, João Doria, that makes it an embarrassment. After taking office in January, the business mogul declared war on Crackland. Early on a drizzly Sunday morning in May, Drumont watched as helicopters appeared overhead, and a veritable battalion of 900 armed police and security agents descended on the addicts. She says the police used rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse the crowd. “The police turned up throwing bombs at everyone,” she recalls. “Thank god I wasn’t injured, but I was terrified.” Drumont and hundreds of other addicts scattered. Many took refuge in a nearby gas station; others checked themselves in for treatment at government programmes, or were accompanied by city social services to packed homeless shelters. After breaking up the crack market, police raided local properties, seized drugs and guns, and arrested dozens of suspected traffickers. Local government officials heralded the operation a success. Doria, triumphant, declared: “Crackland is over and won’t come back.” Six months later, Crackland continues, just metres away from where it was cleared. Hamsterdam, Brazil For readers familiar with the American TV series The Wire, Crackland looks like “Hamsterdam” – a section of vacant city blocks where, in an attempt to bring down street crime, Baltimore police set up a “free zone” for drug dealers and addicts. There are, however, two key differences. First, Cracolândia isn’t located in vacant land, but right in the middle of the bustling downtown core. The area has been gentrifying, and an ambitious revitalisation is planned for 2018, including 1,200 new apartments. The second difference is that this brazen drug scene has been a stubborn fixture of downtown São Paulo for more than two decades. After Cracolândia first appeared in the 1990s, when the highly addictive smoked form of cocaine entered the city’s narcotics market, a succession of governments have tried – and failed – to end it, mostly via repressive policing. Since then, the fluxo (“flow”), as the concentration of users is known, has moved around the neighbourhood, chased from street to street by heavy-handed police operations. In 2008, mayor Gilberto Kassab sent police to disperse the addicts, just as his successor Fernando Haddad would nine years later. Kassab, as Doria did, declared: “Crackland no longer exists.” In 2012, the city’s then-justice secretary said the same thing, this time in relation to a crackdown dubbed “Operation Pain and Suffering”. Both times, the addicts simply regrouped down the street. After the raid in May, Cracolândia re-formed just 400m away, in a park. Drumont followed: the raid didn’t dissuade her from taking crack. “I used even more drugs because I was nervous and scared,” she says. Nevertheless, for those who say Crackland must go, the tactics enjoy broad approval. Supporters consider Crackland a menace, arguing that it gives power to organised crime, degrades the city and perpetuates a cycle of drug addiction and misery. Exact data is scarce, but it is thought Brazil is home to the highest number of crack users in the world. According to the last national crack survey in 2014 by the Fiocruz medical institute, there are around 370,000 regular users in 27 city state capitals and the federal district. Brazil shares porous borders with all of the main cocaine-producing nations: Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. São Paulo is also the base of Brazil’s most powerful drug trafficking gang, the PCC (“First Command of the Capital”). Authorities say the PCC plays a controlling role in supplying Crackland. According to them, the crackdown was necessary to break the hold of drug trafficking in the neighbourhood. “With the [May] operation, the state retook territory that was dominated by drug traffic, facilitating the work of health and social workers,” says Floriano Pesaro, social development secretary for São Paulo state government. As evidence for the success of their strategy, they point to a study – commissioned by the state government – showing that Crackland has got smaller: from 1,861 users before the operation in May to 414 in July, a reduction of 77%. Clarice Sandi Madruga, coordinator of the survey, says there are many reasons for the drop. Some addicts have sought help, she says; others used the opportunity of the operation to flee from debts with drug dealers. What’s more, she says, as many as one third of current Crackland residents are new arrivals who come for the services, such as health treatment and meals (provided by City Hall), and the relative safety. (Drumont corroborates that claim: for junkies, she says, there is a certainly safety in numbers, providing you don’t break the rules, such as stealing from others.) For Madruga, notwithstanding the fact that Crackland still exists, the combination of a bit of carrot and a lot of stick has worked. “Something needed to be done,” she said. Addicted and abandoned But if many Paulistanos supported the raid – 60%, according to a poll by Datafolha – many others did not. They argue that Crackland is symptomatic of the city’s wider problems: of poverty, homelessness and inequality. They say Cracolândia, for all its problems, acts as a refuge for the city’s addicted, downtrodden and abandoned. “The effort by the São Paulo government is a classic example of the ‘war on drugs’ approach that for decades has failed to reduce drug use, driven people who use drugs away from essential health services, and given rise to widespread human rights violations,” says Cesar Munoz, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. Even inside government, some officials are irate, seeing in the raid the same old discredited tactics. “The traffickers they arrested are just small-time dealers,” says Arthur Pinto Filho, a senior official of the Public Prosecutor’s Office for Human Rights in Public Health of the state of Sao Paulo. “The traffic continues,” he adds. “It was a huge waste of public money: they are in the same spot. It was a step backwards. This is the same thing that has been done for years and never worked.” Although everyone agrees Crackland is smaller than it was at its peak, many are sceptical of the government’s explanation, and say it’s probably due to a simple fact: police violence. “Even if there was a reduction of this size, it’s not because of treatment, stopping to use or quality of life,” says Thiago Calil of the NGO É de Lei, who has worked in the region for 13 years. “[Addicts] are leaving the centre because there is huge police repression.” City Hall employs more than 150 health workers in the Crackland area. Two of them, not authorised to speak on record, said that the police raids had increased mistrust and made it more difficult to approach addicts to help. Yet another criticism is that raids merely disperse users into “mini-Cracklands”, of dozens rather than hundreds of addicts. At least 22 of these have been identified across the city. “We understand from our teams that users have gone from the centre, and are using crack in other scenes, more on the outskirts of the city,” said Calil. Better 22 mini-Cracklands than one big Cracolândia, argues Felipe Sabara, secretary of social assistance at São Paulo city government. He claims it’s easier to provide social assistance to users if they are less concentrated. “The more people there are, the bigger density the crowd, the harder the approach,” Sabara says, blaming organised crime and the connection that users establish with their turf. Sabara says his team is expanding outreach services across the city to deal with the dispersal, and disputed the accusation that City Hall merely wants to sweep Crackland under the rug in order to help gentrify the neighbourhood. “We are doing the opposite,” he says. “We are resolving the problem.” Still, Pesaro is under no illusions that Crackland has easy solutions. “We know that it will be a difficult and long process,” he adds. Even Doria has backpedalled, now noting that Crackland is a historic problem, and saying the focus should be “to reduce it sensibly and end the 24-hour drug shopping mall”. Redemption Six months since the raid, Drumont is now two months clean. She lives in Tent 2, a structure set up by City Hall in the heart of Crackland, where she gets a bed and meals as part of a programme called Redemption. The beds are in portable shipping containers; there are more than 300 spaces, and warm showers. She says it was the raid that got her off the streets: the escalation of police operations prompted her to get clean and seek assistance. “Things were always bad here, but they’re getting worse,” she says. She wants to find a job, and is waiting for a space in a city shelter for LGBT people; but her first priority is to sort out her ID and other documents, which she lost while sleeping rough. She faces two huge barriers to employment, however: lack of education and her identity as a trans woman. At least in Crackland, she says, no one judged her. “We need more opportunity,” she says. “Not just meals and handouts.” Sabara says the government recognises this ultimate need, and points to the New Job programme, which he says has created more than 1,500 jobs for people living on the streets. Twenty-two are from Cracolândia. But for Cleizer Alves de Paulo, 31, who continues to smoke crack each day, such opportunities seem far off. Cleizer lives in one of the local hotels and makes money tattooing drug dealers in the heart of Crackland. He has been imprisoned five times, the first time for armed robbery. “No one wants to employ someone who is addicted to drugs,” he says. The previous administration, led by the left-leaning Haddad, instituted a programme called Bracos Abertos (“Of Open Arms”), in which some 450 addicts were given a cash stipend and shelter in exchange for sweeping the streets and other small custodial tasks. The programme was praised by international drug reform agencies, including the Open Society Foundation; but after critics said that the hotels where the addicts were housed had become dominated by drug traffickers, Doria promised to end it. Today, it scrapes by on a skeleton staff, and is expected to shut for good in December. It is precisely this pendulum swinging between two political approaches – to inflict or reduce harm – that Francisco Inacio Bastos, who led the last national crack survey in 2014, blames for Crackland’s disturbing longevity. São Paulo has changed mayor every four years, he notes, and at the heart of the Crackland problem is an ideological debate in Brazil of how drug addiction should be treated. “What we see is change of project every administration, without any continuation. It’s all political. We need a minimum of a consensus, nationwide,” he argues. “Not right or left, but based on scientific arguments worldwide. Without this, will continue as it is.” For Drumont, despite her two months of sobriety, the allure of Crackland remains strong. She abandoned her apartment after taking up crack, and like many addicts, most of whom have little contact with their families, she says Crackland’s main appeal is its community feel, however dysfunctional. “We are like a family of the excluded,” she says.

On the first question, the evidence from the general election in June and more recent surveys of public opinion suggests that people are noticing the impact of the long squeeze on public spending on the services they and their families use. Public support for further spending cuts in frontline services has reduced even if this means delaying the planned elimination of the annual deficit. But the chancellor’s ability to respond to this apparent change in the political weather is heavily constrained. The positive impact of the better than expected borrowing figures since the March budget is likely to be overwhelmed by the expected downgrade in the Office of Budget Responsibility’s estimate of productivity growth. If the target to reduce the deficit to below 2% of GDP by 2020-21 remains in place, significant increases in spending will need to be matched by tax increases. Traditionally, the first budget after an election is seen as the opportunity to get unpalatable tax rises out of the way but scope for that approach in this parliament is limited by the politics of minority government and the striking fact that tax receipts as a percentage of national income are already forecast to reach their highest level in 35 years by 2021. So if the pie is likely to be only marginally larger, what are the funding pressures facing individual public services? The government has already acknowledged the need to relax its cap on public sector pay rises for some services, identifying prisons and the NHS as priorities. The remorseless rise in demand for health and social care services is showing in lengthening waiting times for treatment and delays in discharging patients to appropriate care settings. For health and social care, long term sustainability will require fundamental system change, but in the meantime it would be a surprise not to see a further cash injection. It will also be a surprise if measures to address housing supply aren’t prominent. The government will have been pleased this week to see housing association debt reclassified as private rather than public, reducing government borrowing by an estimated £66bn, but the under-supply of affordable housing remains critical. Local government will also be hoping for clarity on the revised timetable for allowing councils to retain 100% of their business rate income as well as on the arrangements for protecting those areas previously reliant on redistribution from the national pool. An unlikely headline grabber perhaps, but this is a vital factor in councils’ financial plans. Having borne some of the largest percentage cuts since 2010, many councils have made substantial strides towards financial self-reliance and need to know when the new business rate regime will kick in. It’s hard to see how the chancellor will be able to address even this short list of strong claims for higher spending without relaxing one or more of his macro targets.

Potts enjoyed his finest moment at the track eight months ago, when Sizing John and Robbie Power finished nearly three lengths in front of Minella Rocco in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Finian’s Oscar, a Grade One winner over hurdles last season, is the horse in the string with the most obvious potential to reach a similar level over fences, and he will be the favourite at around even money when he lines up for this afternoon’s two-and-a-half mile novice chase, a race with a fine record for highlighting top-class chasing prospects. Finian’s Oscar is a worthy market leader after an 11-length success in Listed company at Chepstow on his debut over the bigger obstacles last time out, even if the bare form of that race is a little suspect as Alcala, his only serious rival in a four-horse field, slipped up when still in the race with every chance. He faces just three rivals again today, but the standard is significantly higher and William Henry (2.25) could be a value bet to beat him at around 3-1. Nicky Henderson’s runner is the only one in the field without a previous start over fences, but he does have valuable experience of Cheltenham, having finished a close second in a Grade Two at the track in January before recording a very impressive success in a novice hurdle at the April meeting. Henderson took this race 12 months ago with O O Seven, who was also making his chasing debut, and like so many of his stable companions, William Henry’s long-term future has always been over fences. Elsewhere on the card, Vision Des Flos (3.35), another runner in the Potts colours, showed enough on his debut in the Persian War Hurdle at Chepstow to suggest that he can improve past the winner of that race, Poetic Rhythm, on 5lb better terms. That was Poetic Rhythm’s fifth start over timber and both the experience and the weight concession should help Vision Des Flos to find the six lengths he needs. Exitas (1.50) is up another 10lb to a mark of 123 after his third win in four starts at Ascot last time, but he raced off as high as 137 over hurdles and his latest success suggested better yet to come. Cheltenham is naturally the centre of attention today, but Jack Of Diamonds (7.45) is another runner worth bearing in mind at Chelmsford City this evening. He is unlikely be getting any better at the age of eight but ran right up to his best when second at Wolverhampton last time out and may appreciate a slightly longer trip today in a race that should be run to suit him.

Read these 10 quotes, and then answer the simple question that follows: 1) “You can travel anywhere in the world.” 2) “How long do you want to go? How long will you have the confidence of people?” 3) “He/It’s going to take care of you.” 4) “It is down to us to change the opinions of people.” 5) “In our job it’s the distances and the quality that make the difference.” 6) “You’re in a central position, you’re in a very safe position.” 7) “We need to build our project and our era, too.” 8) “He/It has all the ingredients to go a long way.” 9) “Reliability is incredibly important.” 10) “You need to fight against your inhibitions, the fear that you won’t get over the line.” Ten quotes, all said in the last 24 hours. Four of them from the mouth of Elon Musk, when introducing Tesla’s new Semi truck, five courtesy of Arsène Wenger, when looking ahead to Arsenal’s big Saturday set-to with Tottenham, and a solitary contribution from Mauricio Pochettino of Spurs. Can you guess who said what? Can you? Huh? We’ll come back to that. Clearly, however, this outpouring of managerial quotage can mean only one thing: the Premier League juggernaut is thundering back into town, announcing its return with the rumble of its throbbing diesel engine, the parp of its horn and the squeal of its highly anticipated north London derby. This should be quite the contest, between two teams with similarly enterprising attacks – both have scored precisely 20 league goals so far this season – and contrastingly reliable defences – Tottenham’s has conceded seven goals, and Arsenal’s a hefty 16. A further statcrunch reveals both teams have averaged a 58.4% share of possession in their 11 league games so far while in terms of passing accuracy the Gunners claim bragging rights by virtue of an 84.1% running total, compared with Tottenham’s 83.9%. Mathematicians, were they to accidentally stumble upon this email, will notice the difference here is a wafer-like 0.2%, meaning that if Spurs had completed two extra passes per match – and they average 563 pass attempts – they would sit above their rivals. Fascinating, we’re sure you’ll disagree. However, Spurs have won only two of their last 32 league visits to Arsenal. This goes beyond being a poor run and tiptoes into the realms of rank underachievement. Under Pochettino Spurs have played 16 away games against members of last season’s final top six, and won one of them, which is not so much disappointing as disrespectful. “It’s important for us to start beating the big teams away. Not just Arsenal, but all of the top six,” cheered Harry Kane. “If we want to be challenging for the title, these are the games we need to win away from home. We need to go and play the way we play against them at home, and find a way to win.” Of course they have challenged for the title in the last two seasons without winning these games, so evidently if that is the limit of their ambitions they don’t have to win them at all, but if they’re actually going to finish top of the league it would probably be helpful. It all adds up to an encounter so tense and thrumming with energy you could charge a truck with it. But what, The Fiver hears you ask, will the outcome be? The Sports Analytics Machine, developed by statistical boffins at the University of Salford to use “a series of algorithms” which include “recent results, which team is at home, the strength of teams who both sides have played as well as the quality and the form of the players on the pitch” to predict the likely scoreline of football matches, has sifted through the data and declared itself confident that the most likely final score is … 1-1. Obviously. Quiz results: Musk: 1, 3, 6, 9. Wenger 2, 4, 5, 8, 10. Pochettino 7. Six right or fewer: look what you could have won.

FIVER LETTERS “As the most prominent Socceroos fan not wearing a condom in John Milce’s photo (yesterday’s Fiver letters), it should be on the record that the said fans were wearing condoms in homage to Socceroos star Aaron Mooy, as opposed to some sort of weird down under fashion statement. As you would expect of a condom-clad Australian bloke, their excitement in all three post-goal celebrations was notably expressed by the showering of all and sundry nearby (foremost my dearest and me) with beer” – Stuart Veitch. “In your paragraph about Peru’s pre-match high jinks pending their qualification for the World Cup (yesterday’s Fiver), you forgot to mention the celebratory lasers that some fans shone at All Whites players on the pitch. Perhaps the most infuriating part of the All Whites losing, though, is the insufferable gloating by boring rugby fans, who think that because the All Blacks are the best out of a dozen countries that take their sport seriously, we should stop trying at other sports” – Matthew Shore. “This may sound like a crackpot theory but I’m not convinced MLS actually exists. Some of the player names are definitely made up just like in Championship Manager when you have played it for 10 seasons and they’re creating new players based on random name generator and retired players.

USA!!! , admit it, MLS is fake news” – Noble Francis. “All those ‘Sign up now!’s at the start of recent Fivers got me thinking about The Fiver World Cup edition, which we’ll inevitably hear about soon.

According to the robot voice of Google Translate (other comedy translation services are available), it’s something that sounds rather like ‘Pant Lip’. Intriguing, but I’m not convinced that such an email would make it past my work firewall” – Scott Pratt [The FiveЯ? – Fiver Ed]. “Surely we can’t let an Aussie soaps/football thread pass by without a nod to Ailsa’s cracker against Barcelona in the 1991 Cup Winners’ Cup final?

The west of England, and the city of Brunel and Banksy, is an increasingly expensive place to live with the highest private sector rental costs outside London, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Bristol’s burgeoning youth population is bearing the brunt, in a part of the world known not just for its heritage as a cornerstone of the industrial revolution but for its cultural scene. With typical house prices more than 10 times the average salary, that might make it tougher for the next Massive Attack or Portishead to emerge. “The idea that you would own a home in a few years is ridiculous,” says Aidan Cassidy, a 23-year-old Bristol University graduate who is a member of a campaign group calling for cheaper rents in the area. “For our parents it was possible. Now people buying houses are only able to do so with the help of their parents, which is a select few relying on the bank of mum and dad.” In many ways, Bristol can be used by Philip Hammond as a positive example of Britain under the Conservatives when he stands up to deliver the budget on Wednesday. He can point to more people in work than the national average, rising wages and output per worker having shot up above the UK’s pre-financial crisis levels. But Bristol’s economic success has attracted London émigrés making a break from the expensive cost of living in the Big Smoke, while the city’s two universities have also fed an additional 10,000 students into the local population of almost 450,000 people over the past decade. Not enough homes have been built for all of these newcomers, in a city where affordability was already stretched a decade ago. The cost of a typical home has shot up at an annual rate of more than 10% in recent years, much faster than the national average. Sheena Wynne works for a charity in the city, rents a house with her partner and finds it difficult to imagine buying a home. She partly blames “buy to leave” speculation by foreign investors in London for having a knock-on effect. Houses in the capital are bought as investment assets and left empty, house hunters are then forced out of London and that, in turn, drives up costs in Bristol. “It’s pushing communities out of London and they’re looking for the next place to live,” she says. The 30-year-old from Brighton, who studied history at Bristol University and stayed in the city after graduating, sums up the view held by many young professionals her age across the UK: “I’m in a relatively well-paid job and even I am struggling to save money.” An additional £10bn for the Tories’ help-to-buy scheme – a subsidy programme for house buyers – has already been announced. But for many young people in Bristol that will not be enough. “Help to buy is a bit of a joke. For the amount you get for what you need, it’s a snowflake in the ocean,” says Ben Diamond, 23, who works for GKN Aerospace at the Airbus plant in Filton on the outskirts of Bristol. Diamond, and 22-year-old Jamie Furnell, both young members of the Unite trade union, believe they are bearing the brunt of a housing shortage, the rising cost of living, and government austerity that has forced their older colleagues to work for longer. Furnell reckons this is creating a “bottleneck of younger people who are having to work in Tescos” around the UK. The scale of the problem is such that employers are becoming concerned about their staff. Bevis Watts is managing director of ethical lender Triodos Bank, which funds green projects and social housing and employs about 150 workers in the city. “We have concerns about transport infrastructure, rising prices and affordability for the people we’re employing,” said Watts. “There is an enormous challenge to build all the houses that are needed.” Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, gave a speech in Bristol last week, talking in the city where he grew up about the government awarding an additional £2bn for affordable housing. Yet he has also suggested Britain needs £50bn in government borrowing to fund a major housebuilding programme, an idea from which Hammond has distanced himself. Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, who became the first directly elected black mayor in the UK last year, wants Hammond to break from austerity to fund the building of more houses in the city. Rent caps could be an answer, he says, adding that the government must also devolve more power to regional authorities. “Austerity has worn people down and has the resonance of hopelessness about it,” he says of the spending choices facing the chancellor ahead of the budget. “We need to start investing in cities.” With tuition fees running at more than £9,000 a year, people from poorer backgrounds are put off higher education. Hammond will use the budget to raise the earnings threshold at which fees are repaid to £25,000 from £21,000. However, that won’t do much for Michael Keating, 20, who is studying politics at Bristol University. He pays more than £100 per week to live in halls, and says the university should lower its costs in order to encourage diversity at an institution with more privately educated students than Cambridge. “The debt I’m taking on almost doesn’t feel real. You’re talking about such big numbers and you’re so young,” he says. “It’s tough to take.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/18/taylor-wessing-prize-who-is-the-man-in-the-photograph","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"Taylor Wessing prize: who is the man in the photograph?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/18/taylor-wessing-prize-who-is-the-man-in-the-photograph","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/18/taylor-wessing-prize-who-is-the-man-in-the-photograph","fields":{"headline":"Taylor Wessing prize: who is the man in the photograph?","bodyText":"Amadou Sumaila was one of 118 people rescued from an inflatable boat drifting 20 miles off the Libyan coast on a clear, calm morning in August last year. The kind of day for which people smugglers hope and their passengers pray. The young Malian and more than 363,000 other migrants and refugees crossed the Mediterranean to reach Europe in 2016. Like many of them, Sumaila had never seen the sea, never imagined that so many people could be crammed into a small boat and never thought it would be so hard to breathe. They were starting to think about death when dawn came, followed by a boat from the German NGO Jugend Rettet. The crew of the Iuventa had come to save lives, but one of its passengers, the Spanish-Iranian photographer César Dezfuli, had come determined to preserve faces. Once the 118 were safely aboard, Dezfuli asked if he could take their pictures. “I shot all the photos in the two hours before they were put on another boat to Italy,” he says. “I didn’t have the time to get into people’s stories, just to take about three photos apiece.” It was only later, while going through his shots, that Dezfuli noticed the expression on Sumaila’s face. “There was something about the way he looked into the camera and something in the clothes he was wearing that gave the photo a texture. I don’t know exactly what it was, but it just summed up the story I was trying to tell really well.” The judges of the Taylor Wessing portrait prize were also struck and unsettled by Sumaila’s gaze – it “powerfully conveys his loss, solitude and determination” – and chose Dezfuli as this year’s winner. “What I wanted to do,” says Dezfuli, “was focus on the lives of the people who were being rescued rather than just the number of people being rescued.” Sumaila, who is now 23 and living in a migration centre in Sicily, did not want to be interviewed. But he gave Dezfuli permission to share the contents of a letter in which he explains how and why he left Mali and came to travel through Algeria and Libya before climbing into the inflatable boat. “I am Amadou Sumaila, a Malian, a citizen of west Africa who left his country in 2015 pushed by the problem arising from the war, which made me fear for my life,” he writes. “I headed to Algeria, having to deal with a very difficult journey through the desert, some parts by foot, with a very strong sun over my head. But luckily someone helped me to cross that desert and I reached the city of Souaf, where I spent almost a year.” It was there that Sumaila was offered work in Libya. With no knowledge of what was going on there – and nothing to lose – he made the journey. “I never imagined that Libya would cause me so much trouble … I couldn’t go out to the street, there were armed people in every corner, people who if they see any migrant in the street, they kidnap you, they beat you and they ask you for money, and if you don ́t have anything, they can even kill you, as it was the case of some of my colleagues.” Five weeks later, he reached the city of Zintan and then, helped by an Arab smuggler, made it to Sabratha where he found himself in jail. “I had been kidnapped without knowing it. At that time I only ate once a day if I was lucky. I was in their hands. If your family doesn ́t have money to send, you do not eat. Some of the people there died of hunger, and those who didn‘t die of hunger, they died from the beatings they received, or from diseases.” His luck held out: despite becoming very ill, his mother sent money and, a few days, later, the Arab people smuggler took him to the coast and put him in the inflatable boat with 117 others. Hours later, Sumaila would be standing on the deck of the Iuventa, staring down Dezfuli’s lens. Thanks to Facebook, the two have been in contact for the past six weeks. Sumaila told the photographer that while he had initially claimed to be 16 in the hope of progressing more quickly through the system, he was actually 23. He said that he had been afraid, and had also been advised that saying he was younger would help his case. More than 15 months after being rescued, Sumaila is still waiting for news on his asylum application and nursing dreams of becoming a professional footballer. “Pretty much everyone there is depressed because they’re still waiting after so many months,” says Dezfuli. “It’s very frustrating and can take two years or two and a half. If it’s turned down, they usually end up on the street as they don’t have deportation deals with African countries.” The photographer is due to travel to the European parliament next week to present a petition calling for an investigation into how EU money is being spent to tackle migration in Libya. He hopes that his picture may help people look beyond a crisis that is all too often reduced to statistics rather than human lives. “There are a lot of emotions in his gaze, which is even stronger when you see it physically rather than digitally,” he says. “In some way, you’re confronted by his gaze and by the fact that this is a person who has a name and can be identified. It’s not just about talking about migration numbers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/nov/17/lab-notes-bottoms-up-cheers-to-a-vintage-week-in-science","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T13:10:56Z","webTitle":"Lab notes: Bottoms up!

UK Space Agency research has identified Unst, the Shetland Islands’ most northern isle as the best site in UK for spaceport to launch satellites into orbit.

In the here and now, however, scientists have made their first ever attempt at gene editing inside the body. It’s a somewhat nerve-wracking experiment: Brian Madeux, who has Hunter syndrome, has been intravenously given copies of a corrective gene and a genetic tool to cut his DNA in a precise spot. It will permanently alter his DNA, with no way to alter any mistakes editing may cause. Also raising hopes for new treatments, this time of age-related disorders, is the discovery that some members of a small Amish community in Indiana, US, carry a rare genetic mutation which appears to protect against biological ageing. So new treatments plus dog ownership (which cuts your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, apparently) could make us healthier than ever.

Faced with manpower shortages, British imperialists had recruited up to 1.4 million Indian soldiers. France enlisted nearly 500,000 troops from its colonies in Africa and Indochina. Nearly 400,000 African Americans were also inducted into US forces. The first world war’s truly unknown soldiers are these non-white combatants. Ho Chi Minh, who spent much of the war in Europe, denounced what he saw as the press-ganging of subordinate peoples. Before the start of the Great War, Ho wrote, they were seen as “nothing but dirty Negroes … good for no more than pulling rickshaws”. But when Europe’s slaughter machines needed “human fodder”, they were called into service. Other anti-imperialists, such as Mohandas Gandhi and WEB Du Bois, vigorously supported the war aims of their white overlords, hoping to secure dignity for their compatriots in the aftermath. But they did not realise what Weber’s remarks revealed: that Europeans had quickly come to fear and hate physical proximity to their non-white subjects – their “new-caught sullen peoples”, as Kipling called colonised Asians and Africans in his 1899 poem The White Man’s Burden. These colonial subjects remain marginal in popular histories of the war. They also go largely uncommemorated by the hallowed rituals of Remembrance Day. The ceremonial walk to the Cenotaph at Whitehall by all major British dignitaries, the two minutes of silence broken by the Last Post, the laying of poppy wreaths and the singing of the national anthem – all of these uphold the first world war as Europe’s stupendous act of self-harm. For the past century, the war has been remembered as a great rupture in modern western civilisation, an inexplicable catastrophe that highly civilised European powers sleepwalked into after the “long peace” of the 19th century – a catastrophe whose unresolved issues provoked yet another calamitous conflict between liberal democracy and authoritarianism, in which the former finally triumphed, returning Europe to its proper equilibrium. With more than eight million dead and more than 21 million wounded, the war was the bloodiest in European history until that second conflagration on the continent ended in 1945. War memorials in Europe’s remotest villages, as well as the cemeteries of Verdun, the Marne, Passchendaele, and the Somme enshrine a heartbreakingly extensive experience of bereavement. In many books and films, the prewar years appear as an age of prosperity and contentment in Europe, with the summer of 1913 featuring as the last golden summer. But today, as racism and xenophobia return to the centre of western politics, it is time to remember that the background to the first world war was decades of racist imperialism whose consequences still endure. It is something that is not remembered much, if at all, on Remembrance Day. At the time of the first world war, all western powers upheld a racial hierarchy built around a shared project of territorial expansion. In 1917, the US president, Woodrow Wilson, baldly stated his intention, “to keep the white race strong against the yellow” and to preserve “white civilisation and its domination of the planet”. Eugenicist ideas of racial selection were everywhere in the mainstream, and the anxiety expressed in papers like the Daily Mail, which worried about white women coming into contact with “natives who are worse than brutes when their passions are aroused”, was widely shared across the west. Anti-miscegenation laws existed in most US states. In the years leading up to 1914, prohibitions on sexual relations between European women and black men (though not between European men and African women) were enforced across European colonies in Africa. The presence of the “dirty Negroes” in Europe after 1914 seemed to be violating a firm taboo. In May 1915, a scandal erupted when the Daily Mail printed a photograph of a British nurse standing behind a wounded Indian soldier. Army officials tried to withdraw white nurses from hospitals treating Indians, and disbarred the latter from leaving the hospital premises without a white male companion. The outrage when France deployed soldiers from Africa (a majority of them from the Maghreb) in its postwar occupation of Germany was particularly intense and more widespread. Germany had also fielded thousands of African soldiers while trying to hold on to its colonies in east Africa, but it had not used them in Europe, or indulged in what the German foreign minister (and former governor of Samoa), Wilhelm Solf, called “racially shameful use of coloureds”. “These savages are a terrible danger,” a joint declaration of the German national assembly warned in 1920, to “German women”. Writing Mein Kampf in the 1920s, Adolf Hitler would describe African soldiers on German soil as a Jewish conspiracy aimed to topple white people “from their cultural and political heights”. The Nazis, who were inspired by American innovations in racial hygiene, would in 1937 forcibly sterilise hundreds of children fathered by African soldiers. Fear and hatred of armed “niggers” (as Weber called them) on German soil was not confined to Germany, or the political right. The pope protested against their presence, and an editorial in the Daily Herald, a British socialist newspaper, in 1920 was titled “Black Scourge in Europe”. This was the prevailing global racial order, built around an exclusionary notion of whiteness and buttressed by imperialism, pseudo-science and the ideology of social Darwinism. In our own time, the steady erosion of the inherited privileges of race has destabilised western identities and institutions – and it has unveiled racism as an enduringly potent political force, empowering volatile demagogues in the heart of the modern west. Today, as white supremacists feverishly build transnational alliances, it becomes imperative to ask, as Du Bois did in 1910: “What is whiteness that one should so desire it?” As we remember the first global war, it must be remembered against the background of a project of western global domination – one that was shared by all of the war’s major antagonists. The first world war, in fact, marked the moment when the violent legacies of imperialism in Asia and Africa returned home, exploding into self-destructive carnage in Europe. And it seems ominously significant on this particular Remembrance Day: the potential for large-scale mayhem in the west today is greater than at any other time in its long peace since 1945. * * * When historians discuss the origins of the Great War, they usually focus on rigid alliances, military timetables, imperialist rivalries, arms races and German militarism. The war, they repeatedly tell us, was the seminal calamity of the 20th century – Europe’s original sin, which enabled even bigger eruptions of savagery such as the second world war and the Holocaust. An extensive literature on the war, literally tens of thousands of books and scholarly articles, largely dwells on the western front and the impact of the mutual butchery on Britain, France, and Germany – and significantly, on the metropolitan cores of these imperial powers rather than their peripheries. In this orthodox narrative, which is punctuated by the Russian Revolution and the Balfour declaration in 1917, the war begins with the “guns of August” in 1914, and exultantly patriotic crowds across Europe send soldiers off to a bloody stalemate in the trenches. Peace arrives with the Armistice of 11 November 1918, only to be tragically compromised by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, which sets the stage for another world war. In one predominant but highly ideological version of European history – popularised since the cold war – the world wars, together with fascism and communism, are simply monstrous aberrations in the universal advance of liberal democracy and freedom. In many ways, however, it is the decades after 1945 – when Europe, deprived of its colonies, emerged from the ruins of two cataclysmic wars – that increasingly seem exceptional. Amid a general exhaustion with militant and collectivist ideologies in western Europe, the virtues of democracy – above all, the respect for individual liberties – seemed clear. The practical advantages of a reworked social contract, and a welfare state, were also obvious. But neither these decades of relative stability, nor the collapse of communist regimes in 1989, were a reason to assume that human rights and democracy were rooted in European soil. Instead of remembering the first world war in a way that flatters our contemporary prejudices, we should recall what Hannah Arendt pointed out in The Origins of Totalitarianism – one of the west’s first major reckonings with Europe’s grievous 20th-century experience of wars, racism and genocide. Arendt observes that it was Europeans who initially reordered “humanity into master and slave races” during their conquest and exploitation of much of Asia, Africa and America. This debasing hierarchy of races was established because the promise of equality and liberty at home required imperial expansion abroad in order to be even partially fulfilled. We tend to forget that imperialism, with its promise of land, food and raw materials, was widely seen in the late 19th century as crucial to national progress and prosperity. Racism was – and is – more than an ugly prejudice, something to be eradicated through legal and social proscription. It involved real attempts to solve, through exclusion and degradation, the problems of establishing political order, and pacifying the disaffected, in societies roiled by rapid social and economic change. In the early 20th century, the popularity of social Darwinism had created a consensus that nations should be seen similarly to biological organisms, which risked extinction or decay if they failed to expel alien bodies and achieve “living space” for their own citizens. Pseudo-scientific theories of biological difference between races posited a world in which all races were engaged in an international struggle for wealth and power. Whiteness became “the new religion”, as Du Bois witnessed, offering security amid disorienting economic and technological shifts, and a promise of power and authority over a majority of the human population. The resurgence of these supremacist views today in the west – alongside the far more widespread stigmatisation of entire populations as culturally incompatible with white western peoples – should suggest that the first world war was not, in fact, a profound rupture with Europe’s own history. Rather it was, as Liang Qichao, China’s foremost modern intellectual, was already insisting in 1918, a “mediating passage that connects the past and the future”. The liturgies of Remembrance Day, and evocations of the beautiful long summer of 1913, deny both the grim reality that preceded the war and the way it has persisted into the 21st century. Our complex task during the war’s centenary is to identify the ways in which that past has infiltrated our present, and how it threatens to shape the future: how the terminal weakening of white civilisation’s domination, and the assertiveness of previously sullen peoples, has released some very old tendencies and traits in the west. * * * Nearly a century after first world war ended, the experiences and perspectives of its non-European actors and observers remain largely obscure. Most accounts of the war uphold it as an essentially European affair: one in which the continent’s long peace is shattered by four years of carnage, and a long tradition of western rationalism is perverted. Relatively little is known about how the war accelerated political struggles across Asia and Africa; how Arab and Turkish nationalists, Indian and Vietnamese anti-colonial activists found new opportunities in it; or how, while destroying old empires in Europe, the war turned Japan into a menacing imperialist power in Asia. A broad account of the war that is attentive to political conflicts outside Europe can clarify the hyper-nationalism today of many Asian and African ruling elites, most conspicuously the Chinese regime, which presents itself as avengers of China’s century-long humiliation by the west. Recent commemorations have made greater space for the non-European soldiers and battlefields of the first world war: altogether more than four million non-white men were mobilised into European and American armies, and fighting happened in places very remote from Europe – from Siberia and east Asia to the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and even the South Pacific islands. In Mesopotamia, Indian soldiers formed a majority of Allied manpower throughout the war. Neither Britain’s occupation of Mesopotamia nor its successful campaign in Palestine would have occurred without Indian assistance. Sikh soldiers even helped the Japanese to evict Germans from their Chinese colony of Qingdao. Scholars have started to pay more attention to the nearly 140,000 Chinese and Vietnamese contract labourers hired by the British and French governments to maintain the war’s infrastructure, mostly digging trenches. We know more about how interwar Europe became host to a multitude of anticolonial movements; the east Asian expatriate community in Paris at one point included Zhou Enlai, later the premier of China, as well as Ho Chi Minh. Cruel mistreatment, in the form of segregation and slave labour, was the fate of many of these Asians and Africans in Europe. Deng Xiaoping, who arrived in France just after the war, later recalled “the humiliations” inflicted upon fellow Chinese by “the running dogs of capitalists”. But in order to grasp the current homecoming of white supremacism in the west, we need an even deeper history – one that shows how whiteness became in the late 19th century the assurance of individual identity and dignity, as well as the basis of military and diplomatic alliances. Such a history would show that the global racial order in the century preceding 1914 was one in which it was entirely natural for “uncivilised” peoples to be exterminated, terrorised, imprisoned, ostracised or radically re-engineered. Moreover, this entrenched system was not something incidental to the first world war, with no connections to the vicious way it was fought or to the brutalisation that made possible the horrors of the Holocaust. Rather, the extreme, lawless and often gratuitous violence of modern imperialism eventually boomeranged on its originators. In this new history, Europe’s long peace is revealed as a time of unlimited wars in Asia, Africa and the Americas. These colonies emerge as the crucible where the sinister tactics of Europe’s brutal 20th-century wars – racial extermination, forced population transfers, contempt for civilian lives – were first forged. Contemporary historians of German colonialism (an expanding field of study) try to trace the Holocaust back to the mini-genocides Germans committed in their African colonies in the 1900s, where some key ideologies, such as Lebensraum, were also nurtured. But it is too easy to conclude, especially from an Anglo-American perspective, that Germany broke from the norms of civilisation to set a new standard of barbarity, strong-arming the rest of the world into an age of extremes. For there were deep continuities in the imperialist practices and racial assumptions of European and American powers. Indeed, the mentalities of the western powers converged to a remarkable degree during the high noon of “whiteness” – what Du Bois, answering his own question about this highly desirable condition, memorably defined as “the ownership of the Earth for ever and ever”. For example, the German colonisation of south-west Africa, which was meant to solve the problem of overpopulation, was often assisted by the British, and all major western powers amicably sliced and shared the Chinese melon in the late 19th century. Any tensions that arose between those dividing the booty of Asia and Africa were defused largely peacefully, if at the expense of Asians and Africans. This is because colonies had, by the late 19th century, come to be widely seen as indispensable relief-valves for domestic socio-economic pressures. Cecil Rhodes put the case for them with exemplary clarity in 1895 after an encounter with angry unemployed men in London’s East End. Imperialism, he declared, was a “solution for the social problem, ie in order to save the 40 million inhabitants of the United Kingdom from a bloody civil war, we colonial statesmen must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new markets for the goods produced in the factories and mines”. In Rhodes’ view, “if you want to avoid civil war, you must become imperialists”. Rhodes’ scramble for Africa’s gold fields helped trigger the second Boer war, during which the British, interning Afrikaner women and children, brought the term “concentration camp” into ordinary parlance. By the end of the war in 1902, it had become a “commonplace of history”, JA Hobson wrote, that “governments use national animosities, foreign wars and the glamour of empire-making in order to bemuse the popular mind and divert rising resentment against domestic abuses”. With imperialism opening up a “panorama of vulgar pride and crude sensationalism”, ruling classes everywhere tried harder to “imperialise the nation”, as Arendt wrote. This project to “organise the nation for the looting of foreign territories and the permanent degradation of alien peoples” was quickly advanced through the newly established tabloid press. The Daily Mail, right from its inception in 1896, stoked vulgar pride in being white, British and superior to the brutish natives – just as it does today. * * * At the end of the war, Germany was stripped of its colonies and accused by the victorious imperial powers, entirely without irony, of ill-treating its natives in Africa. But such judgments, still made today to distinguish a “benign” British and American imperialism from the German, French, Dutch and Belgian versions, try to suppress the vigorous synergies of racist imperialism. Marlow, the narrator of Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (1899), is clear-sighted about them: “All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz,” he says. And to the new-fangled modes of exterminating the brutes, he might have added. In 1920, a year after condemning Germany for its crimes against Africans, the British devised aerial bombing as routine policy in their new Iraqi possession – the forerunner to today’s decade-long bombing and drone campaigns in west and south Asia. “The Arab and Kurd now know what real bombing means,” a 1924 report by a Royal Air Force officer put it. “They now know that within 45 minutes a full-sized village … can be practically wiped out and a third of its inhabitants killed or injured.” This officer was Arthur “Bomber” Harris, who in the second world war unleashed the firestorms of Hamburg and Dresden, and whose pioneering efforts in Iraq helped German theorising in the 1930s about der totale krieg (the total war). It is often proposed that Europeans were indifferent to or absent-minded about their remote imperial possessions, and that only a few dyed-in-the-wool imperialists like Rhodes, Kipling and Lord Curzon cared enough about them. This makes racism seem like a minor problem that was aggravated by the arrival of Asian and African immigrants in post-1945 Europe. But the frenzy of jingoism with which Europe plunged into a bloodbath in 1914 speaks of a belligerent culture of imperial domination, a macho language of racial superiority, that had come to bolster national and individual self-esteem. Italy actually joined Britain and France on the Allied side in 1915 in a fit of popular empire-mania (and promptly plunged into fascism after its imperialist cravings went unslaked). Italian writers and journalists, as well as politicians and businessmen, had lusted after imperial power and glory since the late 19th century. Italy had fervently scrambled for Africa, only to be ignominiously routed by Ethiopia in 1896. (Mussolini would avenge that in 1935 by dousing Ethiopians with poison gas.) In 1911, it saw an opportunity to detach Libya from the Ottoman empire. Coming after previous setbacks, its assault on the country, greenlighted by both Britain and France, was vicious and loudly cheered at home. News of the Italians’ atrocities, which included the first bombing from air in history, radicalised many Muslims across Asia and Africa. But public opinion in Italy remained implacably behind the imperial gamble. Germany’s own militarism, commonly blamed for causing Europe’s death spiral between 1914 and 1918, seems less extraordinary when we consider that from the 1880s, many Germans in politics, business and academia, and such powerful lobby groups as the Pan-German League (Max Weber was briefly a member), had exhorted their rulers to achieve the imperial status of Britain and France. Furthermore, all Germany’s military engagements from 1871 to 1914 occurred outside Europe. These included punitive expeditions in the African colonies and one ambitious foray in 1900 in China, where Germany joined seven other European powers in a retaliatory expedition against young Chinese who had rebelled against western domination of the Middle Kingdom. Dispatching German troops to Asia, the Kaiser presented their mission as racial vengeance: “Give no pardon and take no prisoners,” he said, urging the soldiers to make sure that “no Chinese will ever again even dare to look askance at a German”. The crushing of the “Yellow Peril” (a phrase coined in the 1890s) was more or less complete by the time the Germans arrived. Nevertheless, between October 1900 and spring 1901 the Germans launched dozens of raids in the Chinese countryside that became notorious for their intense brutality. One of the volunteers for the disciplinary force was Lt Gen Lothar von Trotha, who had made his reputation in Africa by slaughtering natives and incinerating villages. He called his policy “terrorism”, adding that it “can only help” to subdue the natives. In China, he despoiled Ming graves and presided over a few killings, but his real work lay ahead, in German South-West Africa (contemporary Namibia) where an anti-colonial uprising broke out in January 1904. In October of that year, Von Trotha ordered that members of the Herero community, including women and children, who had already been defeated militarily, were to be shot on sight and those escaping death were to be driven into the Omaheke Desert, where they would be left to die from exposure. An estimated 60,000-70,000 Herero people, out of a total of approximately 80,000, were eventually killed, and many more died in the desert from starvation. A second revolt against German rule in south-west Africa by the Nama people led to the demise, by 1908, of roughly half of their population. Such proto-genocides became routine during the last years of European peace. Running the Congo Free State as his personal fief from 1885 to 1908, King Leopold II of Belgium reduced the local population by half, sending as many as eight million Africans to an early death. The American conquest of the Philippines between 1898 and 1902, to which Kipling dedicated The White Man’s Burden, took the lives of more than 200,000 civilians. The death toll perhaps seems less startling when one considers that 26 of the 30 US generals in the Philippines had fought in wars of annihilation against Native Americans at home. One of them, Brigadier General Jacob H Smith, explicitly stated in his order to the troops that “I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn. The more you kill and burn the better it will please me”. In a Senate hearing on the atrocities in the Philippines, General Arthur MacArthur (father of Douglas) referred to the “magnificent Aryan peoples” he belonged to and the “unity of the race” he felt compelled to uphold. * * * The modern history of violence shows that ostensibly staunch foes have never been reluctant to borrow murderous ideas from one another. To take only one instance, the American elite’s ruthlessness with blacks and Native Americans greatly impressed the earliest generation of German liberal imperialists, decades before Hitler also came to admire the US’s unequivocally racist policies of nationality and immigration. The Nazis sought inspiration from Jim Crow legislation in the US south, which makes Charlottesville, Virginia, a fitting recent venue for the unfurling of swastika banners and chants of “blood and soil”. In light of this shared history of racial violence, it seems odd that we continue to portray the first world war as a battle between democracy and authoritarianism, as a seminal and unexpected calamity. The Indian writer Aurobindo Ghose was one among many anticolonial thinkers who predicted, even before the outbreak of war, that “vaunting, aggressive, dominant Europe” was already under “a sentence of death”, awaiting “annihilation” – much as Liang Qichao could see, in 1918, that the war would prove to be a bridge connecting Europe’s past of imperial violence to its future of merciless fratricide. These shrewd assessments were not Oriental wisdom or African clairvoyance. Many subordinate peoples simply realised, well before Arendt published The Origins of Totalitarianism in 1951, that peace in the metropolitan west depended too much on outsourcing war to the colonies. The experience of mass death and destruction, suffered by most Europeans only after 1914, was first widely known in Asia and Africa, where land and resources were forcefully usurped, economic and cultural infrastructure systematically destroyed, and entire populations eliminated with the help of up-to-date bureaucracies and technologies. Europe’s equilibrium was parasitic for too long on disequilibrium elsewhere. In the end, Asia and Africa could not remain a safely remote venue for Europe’s wars of aggrandisement in the late 19th and 20th century. Populations in Europe eventually suffered the great violence that had long been inflicted on Asians and Africans. As Arendt warned, violence administered for the sake of power “turns into a destructive principle that will not stop until there is nothing left to violate”. * * * In our own time, nothing better demonstrates this ruinous logic of lawless violence, which corrupts both public and private morality, than the heavily racialised war on terror. It presumes a sub-human enemy who must be “smoked out” at home and abroad – and it has licensed the use of torture and extrajudicial execution, even against western citizens. But, as Arendt predicted, its failures have only produced an even greater dependence on violence, a proliferation of undeclared wars and new battlefields, a relentless assault on civil rights at home – and an exacerbated psychology of domination, presently manifest in Donald Trump’s threats to trash the nuclear deal with Iran and unleash on North Korea “fire and fury like the world has never seen”. It was always an illusion to suppose that “civilised” peoples could remain immune, at home, to the destruction of morality and law in their wars against barbarians abroad. But that illusion, long cherished by the self-styled defenders of western civilisation, has now been shattered, with racist movements ascendant in Europe and the US, often applauded by the white supremacist in the White House, who is making sure there is nothing left to violate. The white nationalists have junked the old rhetoric of liberal internationalism, the preferred language of the western political and media establishment for decades. Instead of claiming to make the world safe for democracy, they nakedly assert the cultural unity of the white race against an existential threat posed by swarthy foreigners, whether these are citizens, immigrants, refugees, asylum-seekers or terrorists. But the global racial order that for centuries bestowed power, identity, security and status on its beneficiaries has finally begun to break down. Not even war with China, or ethnic cleansing in the west, will restore to whiteness its ownership of the Earth for ever and ever. Regaining imperial power and glory has already proven to be a treacherous escapist fantasy – devastating the Middle East and parts of Asia and Africa while bringing terrorism back to the streets of Europe and America – not to mention ushering Britain towards Brexit. No rousing quasi-imperialist ventures abroad can mask the chasms of class and education, or divert the masses, at home. Consequently, the social problem appears insoluble; acrimoniously polarised societies seem to verge on the civil war that Rhodes feared; and, as Brexit and Trump show, the capacity for self-harm has grown ominously. This is also why whiteness, first turned into a religion during the economic and social uncertainty that preceded the violence of 1914, is the world’s most dangerous cult today. Racial supremacy has been historically exercised through colonialism, slavery, segregation, ghettoisation, militarised border controls and mass incarceration. It has now entered its last and most desperate phase with Trump in power. We can no longer discount the “terrible probability” James Baldwin once described: that the winners of history, “struggling to hold on to what they have stolen from their captives, and unable to look into their mirror, will precipitate a chaos throughout the world which, if it does not bring life on this planet to an end, will bring about a racial war such as the world has never seen”. Sane thinking would require, at the very least, an examination of the history – and stubborn persistence – of racist imperialism: a reckoning that Germany alone among western powers has attempted. Certainly the risk of not confronting our true history has never been as clear as on this Remembrance Day. If we continue to evade it, historians a century from now may once again wonder why the west sleepwalked, after a long peace, into its biggest calamity yet. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/10/sprinklers-save-lives-after-grenfell-tower-fireno-government-make-homes-safe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T10:08:44Z","webTitle":"Sprinklers save lives.

So why, after Grenfell, isn’t the government doing more?","bodyText":"Almost five months ago, Theresa May promised to do what it takes to make sure a fire like that at Grenfell Tower never happens again. But instead her government has failed to act. Despite claiming in June that she had “fixed a deadline of three weeks for everybody affected to be found a home”, only 26 of the more than 200 families from Grenfell Tower have been given permanent housing. And thousands more families living in 4,000 high-rise blocks across the country still don’t know whether their homes are safe. In some cases, proper safety tests have not been carried out. In others, vital work has been identified but hasn’t started because local councils lack the funds, having had their budgets slashed by 40% by the Conservatives since 2010. The government has failed to take action and responsibility. It tasked Kensington and Chelsea council with supporting Grenfell residents even as it condemned the council’s response to the fire as inadequate. And residents in social housing blocks across the country, feeling fearful in their homes, were told that ensuring the safety of tower blocks was the responsibility of landlords and councils, not ministers. The Grenfell Tower fire was a national tragedy, exposing a national breakdown in our system of fire-safety checks and controls. It demands a national response from government to make sure it can never happen again. That’s why Labour is urging the chancellor to set aside £1bn in the budget to install sprinkler systems in all council and housing association tower blocks. This equates to just 1% of annual public sector capital spending. And it’s equivalent to only a tenth of the extra money for the help-to-buy scheme that the prime minister announced at the Conservative party conference to grab headlines rather than grapple with the housing crisis. We know sprinklers save lives. In 99% of cases, sprinkler systems extinguish or contain fires. That’s why Dany Cotton, commissioner of the London fire brigade, whose firefighters responded so bravely to the Grenfell fire, has said sprinklers must be installed in tower blocks. This is what the 2013 coroner’s report on the Lakanal House fire in Camberwell, London, demanded. Yet successive Conservative ministers have failed to act on that report, and are now failing to act in the wake of Grenfell. Scandalously, still only 2% of tower blocks have sprinkler systems. And when councils have asked the government for the funding needed to install them, they have been turned down or ignored by ministers. We don’t need another report to tell us that we need sprinklers in high-rise blocks. In the aftermath of the Grenfell fire, May promised: “If any further action is required, it will be taken.” Five months on, action is long overdue as thousands of people across the country continue to live in fear. The government must learn the lessons from Grenfell. I urge the chancellor to use the budget to set aside the funds to make homes safe, ensuring that the avoidable tragedy that took place on 14 June 2017 is never repeated. • John Healey is shadow secretary of state for housing and planning"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2017/nov/14/clay-potteries-uk-city-of-culture-stoke-students","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-14T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"History in the making: children use clay in class to rejuvenate the Potteries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/14/clay-potteries-uk-city-of-culture-stoke-students","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/nov/14/clay-potteries-uk-city-of-culture-stoke-students","fields":{"headline":"History in the making: children use clay in class to rejuvenate the Potteries","bodyText":"Late morning in Stoke-on-Trent and a class of 11-year-olds are being prepared for public speaking. You can picture the scene: a red-faced student stands mortified in front of her fellow classmates, struggling to recite a poem she had barely an hour to learn. Except, they do things differently in Stoke. “It’s fun because I use my hands,” beams Mohammed Abouebaida, a year 7 student at Thistley Hough academy, as he squishes and moulds a wet lump of clay. All round him, Mohammed’s classmates make clay soldiers or create army tanks and barbed wire fences – symbols of the first world war poems they will later recite. The idea, explains their teacher, Alison Ward, is that children learn better when they’re active: “They really enjoy it and engage. If you say they’ve got to memorise a poem, that sounds dry. This gets them to use other techniques to help them, aside from rote learning.” In schools across Stoke, clay is being brought back into the classroom in an attempt to keep alive the city’s proud pottery legacy – and keep creativity on the curriculum. Nearly 1,000 children in 15 schools across the Potteries have been introduced to clay for the first time this year under the British Ceramics Biennial’s clay schools programme. It wants every child in Stoke to have used clay in the classroom by 2021, when the city hopes to be the UK City of Culture. It’s more than a misty-eyed nod to the city’s past. In the schools that have tested the programme, teachers report positive results for otherwise challenging students, particularly boys. “They really engage with the making and creativity and the ability to express themselves visually through clay,” says Julia Rogers, director of design at Thistley Hough, a large secondary on the edge of Stoke city centre. Thistley Hough has children recently arrived from Afghanistan and Iraq, Cuba and the Philippines. Some 37 languages are spoken in the playground and for 309 of its 719 pupils, English is not their mother tongue. This means clay is a particularly valuable way of teaching, says Rogers: “It’s a visual language so the literacy barrier isn’t there. They’ve come into a new country where the experiences are very new and it must be quite intimidating, but this is something they can visually excel at, and it’s an expression for them that doesn’t involve their use of language completely.” Schools involved in the programme have worked clay into subjects across the curriculum, from science to English, history and art. In maths, students will use clay to learn geometry, shapes and angles. It is too early to say how the novel approach has affected exam results, but teachers say children appear more engaged and that there has been an increase in those choosing to study arts subjects at GCSE – bucking a national trend. “It’s done wonders,” says Alison Wilson-Hart, head of art at St Peter’s academy, a secondary school on the other side of the river Trent. “Some boys can be quite all over the shop. Give them a piece of clay and they’re engaged.” It is not only Stoke’s skyline that has changed since its pottery heyday: every school in the city is thought to have had a kiln until recently, but as its main industry declined, so did the necessity to teach it to the next generation. St Peter’s switched its long-dormant kiln back on last month and Katie Leonard, the director of the clay schools programme, wants every school in Stoke to follow suit. Leonard says she is concerned that the arts are being squeezed out of the curriculum through government policies and education cuts, and that there is a “national tide of diminishing opportunity to work with ceramics” in schools. By including clay work in core subjects, every child in Stoke should be able to explore a skill that might otherwise have been beyond their grasp. “It should be for every child in the city and I’m concerned that art will become an after-school activity and then it becomes elitist again,” she says. At St Peter’s, clay’s unlikely comeback appears to have fired up students’ pride in the Potteries. The city, like many others in post-industrial areas, has struggled to overcome the decline of its industry. But there is now a real buzz about the city’s future among children who are once again considering a career in ceramics, says Leonard. “The children over the years have been so negative about where they live, you know: ‘Stoke: nothing goes on here.’ A lot of them just want to leave when they grow up,” she says. “Now there’s more of a buzz and children are starting to see a connection between what their grandparents did, or their parents, and the future. It’s not just a dead industry, you can do something with it.” For Lizzie Critchley, 13, an art student at St Peter’s, pottery might well be something she pursues as a career, following in the footsteps of her grandfather, who worked in one of the city’s many factories. “It’s what we were known for – we had a skyline full of bottle kilns.” Her classmate, Jorja Wright, 14, says she was “flabbergasted” when she turned over a plate on a family holiday in Florida two years ago to discover it was made in her home town. Ceramics is probably not in her future plans but Jorja is enjoying rolling her sleeves up for now: “You get to do whatever you want, there’s no rules.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/09/lewis-hamilton-enjoys-his-fourth-f1-world-title-just-as-much-as-his-first","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T17:29:36Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton enjoys his fourth F1 world title just as much as his first","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/09/lewis-hamilton-enjoys-his-fourth-f1-world-title-just-as-much-as-his-first","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/09/lewis-hamilton-enjoys-his-fourth-f1-world-title-just-as-much-as-his-first","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton enjoys his fourth F1 world title just as much as his first","bodyText":"Lewis Hamilton has said securing his fourth Formula One world championship is an achievement he is enjoying equally as much as his first, for McLaren in 2008. Speaking before this weekend’s Brazilian Grand Prix the British driver declined to make any further comment on the allegations of tax avoidance made in the Paradise Papers. After taking the championship at the last round in Mexico Hamilton became the most successful British driver, with one more title than Sir Jackie Stewart and behind only Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher in the record books. “It feels good walking into the paddock as a world champion,” said Hamilton, who said he had received more than 300 messages of congratulation. “It feels like the first time. I don’t know why, but it feels so fresh and so new, it feels great.” Since taking the title Hamilton has been one of the high-profile personalities identified in the Paradise Papers; the leak revealed he avoided a £3.3m VAT bill when importing a private jet. His Mercedes team have stated that the matter is in the hands of his lawyers and he would make no further comment. “My team released a statement and I don’t have anything else to add,” he said. In 2015, when he won his third title at the US Grand Prix, Hamilton finished second to his team-mate, Nico Rosberg, in the remaining three races, giving the German momentum going into 2016 – the year he won the championship. This year, however, Hamilton has no intention of losing focus. “It is not until the end of the season that my job is fully done,” he said. “I have a good feeling in my heart. What a year it has been, I have enjoyed every moment. “The championship doesn’t really change anything except that you have the number four next to your name. I am still a racing driver at heart and I have lots of fight left in me. That we have two races to go makes it easier to keep going.” Mercedes have said they intend to use this race and the finale in Abu Dhabi as opportunities to test new concepts for next season but Hamilton is eager to keep the upper hand over his rival Sebastian Vettel. “I have to keep the pressure as it has been throughout the year,” he said. “There are still two races to go so it feels abnormal to back off at this point. It is a better time than ever to apply even more pressure.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"housing-network/2017/nov/13/benefit-cap-mother-50p-week-housing-families-foodbanks","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-13T08:02:38Z","webTitle":"A mother given 50p a week for housing: the benefit cap one year on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2017/nov/13/benefit-cap-mother-50p-week-housing-families-foodbanks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2017/nov/13/benefit-cap-mother-50p-week-housing-families-foodbanks","fields":{"headline":"A mother given 50p a week for housing: the benefit cap one year on","bodyText":"A year on from the introduction of the lower benefit cap, its abiding legacy is to push people closer to homelessness. The cap, introduced on 7 November 2016, reduced the total amount any family can receive in benefits from £26,000 to £23,000 in London and £20,000 outside the capital, leaving families with significant shortfalls between the benefits they get and the cost of their housing. In our most recent research we spoke to 18 families with capped benefit across the UK and each time we heard a familiar story – one of stress, struggle and a daily fight to remain in their home. Half of those families said they had gone without food, fuel or were otherwise in debt as a result of the cut. Among a raft of other hardships a third said they had been forced to use food banks. That’s hardly surprising when the government’s most recent figures show that nearly a third of the 68,000 families that were capped have lost by between £50 and £100 a week in benefits. One mother’s testimony poignantly sums up the impact of the policy; she told us that every day she thinks about the prospect of losing everything and being forced out of her family’s home. A single mother, she had given up work to look after her young baby and the cap slashed her housing benefit to just 50p a week. Meanwhile many housing associations and councils have told us that they have to provide intensive support to tenants affected by the cap just to make sure they can keep their home. When the original cap was first proposed it was argued that it was unfair that households who were not working were being supported to live in expensive areas, which many working families would not be able to afford. But the government’s latest figures show that the majority of people hit by the cap have children, and many are in receipt of benefits that recognise they are not able to work. In fact half of the families affected are on income support and 15% are on employment and support allowance. If the hardship the cap is causing is not a good enough reason to scrap it, then the fact that the policy is undermining the government’s own attempts to solve the housing crisis surely is. For the first time in a long time it feels like we are winning the argument that we need many more homes that people can afford. Theresa May making a commitment to invest £2 billion and talking about the need to invest in homes offered at the cheapest rents represented real progress. But this renewed impetus to build new homes will be wasted if people that need them most cannot afford them. The lower benefit cap is one of a number of policies that demonstrate the government is yet to reconcile its housing aims with its approach to welfare. Meanwhile evidence revealing the scale of poverty seems to grow by the day – most recently the Child Poverty Action Group warned that years of government cuts have left many families at risk of poverty. Welfare and housing are inextricably linked and the sooner the government realises this and takes action, the sooner it can get on with the business of solving our housing crisis.

The federal jury made its decision after a group of artists sued Jerry Wolkoff, who painted over their work at the 5Pointz building in Queens, New York City, in November 2013. 5Pointz, a former factory owned by Wolkoff, was a haven for graffiti artists from around the world and became a prominent tourist attraction. Wolkoff had given the artists permission to use the building as a canvas for “aerosol art” and the building was covered in multicolored murals and tags. But in 2013, when Wolkoff decided to demolish the building and replace it with apartments, he whitewashed the graffiti art in the dead of night. On Wednesday the jury decided that the artists’ work was legally protected under the Visual Artists Rights Act (Vara), and that meant that Wolkoff had broken the law. It was the first time graffiti, or “aerosol art” had been given that protection under federal law, potentially meaning thousands of graffiti murals across the country could now be preserved. “It confirms that aerosol art is the same as any other fine artist,” said Eric Baum, the lawyer who represented the 21 artists who sued Wolkoff. “And that the artist deserves dignity and respect.” Baum, said a jury had never determined the issue before, and that it could have far-reaching implications. “It’s a federal statute. So it doesn’t just apply in NY, it applies throughout the country.” The legal team had to prove the artists’ work was of “recognized stature” – rising to the level of merit under Vara, a 1990 law that affords artists legal protection over their work, irrespective of who owns or holds the copyright to the piece. In court Baum pointed to the artists’ years of experience and recognition within their field as proof of the merit of their work. Although the jury’s decision is a boost for the 5Pointz artists, the issue is not yet resolved. The judge in the case will now make his own decision, Baum said, which will take into account the jury’s verdict, but could reach a different conclusion. A legal precedent – which artists elsewhere could then use to protect their work – will only be set if the judge comes to the same decision as the jury. In the case Baum pointed to the 5Pointz artists’ years of experience and recognition within their field, but he said even an amateur graffiti artist could potentially have their work protected under the federal statute. “You could have an expert determine that the work of an amateur rises to the level of merit under Vara that would then provide protection,” he said. “You’re supposed to look at the artwork. Looking at the artist’s background is only one factor.” Wolkoff bought the 5Pointz building, which once housed a factory that manufactured water meters, in the 1970s. He gave artists permission to create murals on the building but said he had told them he always intended to demolish it. In 2013 he finally put those plans into action and drew up plans to raze the building and create an apartment complex. But the way he carried out those plans caused uproar. On the night of 19 November artists found the building had been almost entirely covered in white paint, blotting out art that had been painstakingly painted over the years. Kate Lucas, a lawyer with Grossman LLP, which works in the art-law field, said one consequence of the case would be to make graffiti artists – and property owners – aware of the need to set out agreements on ownership and rights to graffiti upfront. “Graffiti is hot property as art now. And if you’re a property owner who is interested in having graffiti in your courtyard or a mural on your wall or someone who’s going to decorate pieces of your property, the parties can avert a lot of problems by proactively on the front end of the project laying out what their rights and obligations are going to be,” Lucas said. “And an artist can consider: ‘What’s it worth to me to give up this control over the future of my work?’ Instead of having to put a price on that after the fact, which is what we’re seeing here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/10/white-angry-and-american-review-an-unflinching-look-at-us-despair-and-racial-hatred","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"Angry, White and American review – an unflinching look at US despair and racial hatred","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/10/white-angry-and-american-review-an-unflinching-look-at-us-despair-and-racial-hatred","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/10/white-angry-and-american-review-an-unflinching-look-at-us-despair-and-racial-hatred","fields":{"headline":"Angry, White and American review – an unflinching look at US despair and racial hatred","bodyText":"The standout moment from last night’s thoughtful, unflinching but generous-hearted documentary by journalist Gary Younge (of this parish), Angry, White and American (Channel 4), had already gone semi-viral on social media before the programme aired. As part of his examination of the mental, economic and emotional state of white America, Younge interviewed Richard Spencer, an influential figure in the “alt-right” movement – and coiner of the term, “which I think,” said Younge carefully, “is a new word for ‘fascist’”. Spencer was also a featured speaker at the violent “Unite the right” protest in Charlottesville this summer that left three people dead, including anti-fascist protester Heather Hayer. It is already quite something to read about these people and what they say and what they believe. It is something else again to watch one of them say it on camera to a black journalist interviewing him for broadcast. “Africans have benefited from their experiences with white supremacy ... how can you deny that?” Spencer asks. Younge denies it, passionately and eloquently. Spencer exults in Donald Trump’s victory. Although he doesn’t think the president shares his full vision, “People are now aware of the term ‘alt-right’, my name, that there’s a whole other right [wing] out there based in identity and race.” There is no world history without the white man, asserts Spencer – “We are the genius that drives it” – before, in essence, telling Younge to go home. He does not mean to England. “You will never be an Englishman.” Why, wonders Younge. “Because my name is Richard Spencer.” The rest of the film functioned as a riposte to such mindless bigotry, as Younge dug slowly down through the layers of contemporary circumstance, experience and history to find how it is that Spencer’s sentiments are taking root again. First, there is the sense that, as the day approaches (within a generation) that white people will become a minority, that their – well, they would call it culture, others would call it privilege, so let’s split the difference and call it way of life – is under threat. There is the real decline in income and job security since the 50s and the death of the American dream that things can only get better. And there is the opioid crisis, from which more Americans died last year than in the whole of the Vietnam war. The victims are disproportionately white. That it has been primarily defined as a health crisis – unlike the similar situation with crack cocaine that unfolded in the black community in the 80s, which was defined as a social problem to be solved by incarceration on a massive scale – is, Younge notes with characteristic scrupulousness, “both progress and the definition of white privilege”. White people are now the only group whose life expectancy is decreasing. “They’re dying of despair,” says Younge. But is it the despair that comes from poverty, unemployment and genuine injustices being perpetrated against them? A rightful sense of abandonment by governments of every stripe? Or a manifestation of the fact that when you have had every advantage, parity feels a lot like deprivation? (To wit: the unselfconscious whining of the moneyed couple who feel perennially “judged” as white southerners, despite being just about everything you may have heard about white southerners. “It hurts us inside!” they wail.) Or all of the above? As he drives out of Mississippi at the end of his journey through the US and its fracturing psyche, Younge – full of grace and insight even at his most combative moments – says he feels that, “Fear is winning. America is losing.” Apropos absolutely everything – the other major documentary last night was the opening of a four-part series looking at the life of Trump (Trump: An American Dream, Channel 4). Archive footage of a younger, paler and – most strikingly of all – perfectly articulate Trump and his acolytes, business associates, employees, wives, lawyers and diabolical father Fred illustrated the biography. The commentary on it was provided mostly by those who had stood on the sidelines, jaws dropping ever further south, as the Trump family’s ego, tactics and all-round monstrousness grew to the gargantuan proportions we know and love today. Thanks to his father’s savvy and connections and the help of lawyer Roy Cohn – McCarthy’s chief counsel during the Red Scare and “the most repulsive man I ever met in my life”, according to Wayne Barrett, then an investigative journalist for the Village Voice – the Trump empire grew. Trump got everything he wanted. On the rare occasion that he found himself thwarted by someone incorruptible or uncowable, he knew what to do. “I’ll wait for a more progressive administration and for bad times. When bad times come, I’ll get whatever I want.” They’re here, and so is he. Or he’s here and so, they are. Either way, America – and all of us – are losing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/09/vegan-cake-hula-hoops-guinness-world-records-basketball-jet-suit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T19:16:14Z","webTitle":"From a jet suit to contortion rolling, new Guinness World Records set","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/09/vegan-cake-hula-hoops-guinness-world-records-basketball-jet-suit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/09/vegan-cake-hula-hoops-guinness-world-records-basketball-jet-suit","fields":{"headline":"From a jet suit to contortion rolling, new Guinness World Records set","bodyText":"The fastest, the biggest, the highest … records are being smashed across the planet as thousands of people take part in Guinness World Records Day.

Because Patel, a cabinet minister at the time, had made the unofficial prior appointments, it made Burt’s official visit less important in Israeli eyes and angered the British Foreign Office. Patel, the international development secretary until Wednesday night, met the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on 22 August while Burt and Tony Kay, the deputy British ambassador in Israel, were only granted an audience with Michael Oren, the deputy minister at the Israeli prime minister’s office later that day. It is understood that Patel’s earlier visit to Netanyahu was mentioned at Burt’s meeting in Jerusalem, meaning that Foreign Office officials should then have been advised of her trip. The Foreign Office dispute that Patel’s meeting with Netanyahu was mentioned at this meeting. However, Burt told MPs this week that Patel first informed the Foreign Office of her meetings with Israeli officials and politicians on 24 August, two days later, coinciding with the end of Burt’s visit to the region that concluded with a launch ceremony of El Al Airlines’ first Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane at Ben Gurion airport. Burt’s three-day visit to Palestine and Israel, from 21 to 24 August, was an important one for the minister at a time of great political sensitivity in the Middle East. He noticeably managed to gain access to more senior figures in Palestine than in Israel. Apart from Oren, Burt’s Israel itinerary included meetings with Tzachi Hanegbi, the minister for regional cooperation, Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List party, and Yuval Rotem, the director general of the foreign affairs ministry. By contrast Patel met with Netanyahu, as well as Gilad Erdan, the minister for public security, information and strategic affairs, and Yair Lapid, the leader of the Yesh Atid party. She also met Rotem, meaning her visit was duplicatory and more high level. No officials were present at Patel’s meetings, other than the Conservative Friends of Israel president, Lord Polak. Burt had little difficulty meeting the most senior figures in the Palestinian territories including Riyad al-Maliki, the foreign minister, Shukri Bishara, the finance minister, Dr Sabri Saidam, the education minister, and Saeb Muhammad Salih Erekat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s chief negotiator. It is not clear if Patel knew that her visits, squeezed into a two-week summer holiday, were going to coincide with Burt’s, but normally someone in her job would be told of overseas visits by UK ministers as a matter of course. This raises questions about whether Patel intended to keep the meetings secret or was genuinely naive about the need to stick to ministerial protocol and inform the Foreign Office of her plan to meet Netanyahu. Polak, in his pro-Israel lobbying, has previously used his influence in Downing Street to push his strongly held views on Theresa May and her predecessor as prime minister David Cameron. In March 2014, Polak and the Conservative party treasurer Andrew Feldman persuaded Cameron to cut paragraphs criticising Israel’s settlement policy from his laudatory Knesset speech. The senior diplomat who had a role in drafting that address was the then director of the Foreign Office’s near east and north Africa department, David Quarrey, who is now the UK ambassador to Israel. A final question arises over whether the Foreign Office agreed with Patel to effectively not tell No 10 of what had happened or if No 10 was informed, but not the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, or May. The Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, has said that Patel met officials from the British consulate general in Jerusalem on the trip, but has not specified when or for what purpose. Next Wednesday, the foreign affairs select committee will be taking evidence from the Foreign Office’s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, allowing MPs to examine who knew what and when about Patel’s meetings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/13/britain-irrelevant-world-transatlantic-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-13T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Britain once punched above its weight.

Now we are irrelevant","bodyText":"Britain has lost its way and is having an identity crisis, says the New York Times. Just as Dean Acheson’s barb that Britain had lost an empire and not yet found a role hit home in 1962, so did an article last week by Steven Erlanger, the paper’s diplomatic editor and former London bureau chief, claiming no one knows what Britain is any more. The article sparked a storm on the twittersphere and hurt rebuttals in the rightwing British press. But the counterattacks missed the point. It is not a question of whether Britain still has some good universities or the gaming industry is doing well. The question is whether Britain still has real influence in the world: and the answer to that is clearly no. As Simon Fraser, the former Foreign Office permanent secretary, said in a speech last week: “It is hard to call to mind a major foreign policy matter on which we have had a decisive influence since the referendum.” To put it even more cruelly: we have rendered ourselves irrelevant. I work in 11 countries across the globe and no one is interested in what Britain thinks, even in those parts of the world where we had a historical role. Since the second world war, our foreign policy has been built on two pillars: Europe and the transatlantic relationship. Both are now broken, one by us and the other partly by circumstance. We are no longer able to build a coalition in Brussels behind our foreign policy objectives. No one wants to be seen to be working with a member state about to depart. And no one seriously believes that Donald Trump is sitting in Washington waiting for Theresa May to advise him on what to do on North Korea – as we were able to do with President Clinton on Kosovo. Even if we did still have influence, we don’t have any attention to spare for the rest of the world because all of our efforts are going into the destructive process of Brexit. Just as blood goes to the stomach when you have a large meal, so most of our civil servants and diplomats are working on dismantling our EU membership rather than on maximising our influence around the world, – and paradoxically we are taking on thousands more to do so in the pursuit of less bureaucracy. We can’t even get the negotiations with the EU right, even though that is supposed to be the government’s principal objective, because cabinet ministers cannot agree on what they want the end state of our relations with the EU to be. Our interlocutors in Brussels are giving up because they have nothing to engage with. And meanwhile the Brexiters are gearing up to blame the Europeans and our own quisling civil servants. The foreign policy ministerial team is in crisis: the international development secretary resigned over an ill-advised private venture in Israel; and the foreign secretary should have resigned, having apparently failed to read his brief and thereby possibly landed a British mother held in Iran with a longer jail sentence. Our politics is in turmoil, the prime minister powerless, the minority government on the verge of extinction. The cartoon sequence of teetering on the edge of the cliff is likely to continue until Jeremy Corbyn goes down in the polls, because only then can the Tories risk an election. Britain has historically been the strong and stable democracy in Europe on which others – both the Europeans and the US – could depend. In the first world war, in the second, in the cold war and in building a liberal, free-trading and open Europe, we played a central role. We took pride, as Douglas Hurd put it, in punching above our weight. Now we have taken to punching each other in a polarised and uncertain country. Italy appears more politically stable, and France far more internationally relevant. What puzzles our friends and erstwhile allies most is that all of this is self-inflicted. We didn’t have to give up the two pillars on which our nation has depended for so long. And we didn’t have to do so when we had nothing with which to replace them. So Erlanger’s judgment of our state of introverted irrelevance is, if anything, an almost British understatement of the sad position in which we find ourselves. • Jonathan Powell was Tony Blair’s chief of staff from 1995 to 2007"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/nov/10/from-raul-to-ruin-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-nasl-once-mlss-challenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T10:00:16Z","webTitle":"From Raúl to ruin: the rise and fall of the NASL, once MLS's challenger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/nov/10/from-raul-to-ruin-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-nasl-once-mlss-challenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/nov/10/from-raul-to-ruin-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-nasl-once-mlss-challenger","fields":{"headline":"From Raúl to ruin: the rise and fall of the NASL, once MLS's challenger","bodyText":"To an outside observer, it may be hard to believe that the North American Soccer League was able to play at all this season. Last winter, the league was left for dead. Having just watched two teams fold, another move to MLS, and two more head across the second division landscape to the USL, the six-year-old NASL was left with just eight clubs. News came out that the historic New York Cosmos (linked to the days of Pele and Franz Beckenbauer in brand alone) had lost $30m over their first four years and were likely to fold. This fall has seen two crucial rulings: one from the US Soccer Federation stripping the NASL of its second division sanctioning, and one from the US District Court denying the NASL’s request for an injunction to reclaim that second division status. As teams across the league plan for 2018, many believe the NASL is all but done. Ahead of the league’s championship match this Sunday, between the Cosmos and San Francisco Deltas, now is a good time to ask: where did it all go wrong? Completely separate from the national top-flight league that Pele once graced, and with which it shares a name, the NASL was founded after Nike sold its stake in the USL to an independent firm rather than the league itself. This sparked outrage among nine USL teams (whose owners formed the Team Owners Association), uncertain about the direction of this league. Instead, they formed their own second-division, which they named the NASL in order to pay respect to the history of the game in the US. This was the beginning of an interfederational feud, with the NASL and USL grappling over who was the rightful second division. The NASL was granted sanctioning at this rank, and inaugural commissioner David Downs set out a clear vision: be the best second division possible. The United States had failed to foster a truly successful lower-division at this point, and Downs saw this as a way to crack into markets untapped by MLS. Creating a foothold in these areas would lead to wider national interest. The first two years of the league went well. Teams in Tampa Bay, Minnesota and Fort Lauderdale thrived, and the NASL was ready to welcome the Cosmos the following season. Then, the league faced its first true test: Downs abruptly stepped down after the 2012 season, citing a desire to return home to New York. Downs had moved to be stationed at the league’s office in Miami, also home to Brazilian-based sports marketing company Traffic Sports. Traffic invested in four clubs as the NASL kicked off, and the lawyer overseeing their US operations, Aaron Davidson, served as the president of the league’s board of governors. It wasn’t until 2015 that this became particularly damning, as Davidson was arrested on suspicion of giving bribes as part of the Fifa sting (he later pled guilty). It took until late 2016 for the league to cut ties with Traffic, but the mud had stuck. There appeared to be a fresh start when Bill Peterson took over as league commissioner in 2013. Peterson saw Downs’ “keep it local” mentality as too reserved. He believed that the NASL’s structure (no salary cap and a lower expansion fee to join the league) primed it to one day overthrow Major League Soccer at the top of the pyramid. Peterson joined the league at the same time as the Cosmos, and the NASL became a more brash organization, earning the nickname “US soccer’s wild child” from this very publication. While the league has almost always been defined by its backroom drama, it’s impossible to deny the role it has served in developing talent. Players that have slipped through the cracks at the top flight have found a chance to forge a professional career at a livable wage. Players like Miguel Ibarra, Fafà Picault, and Haji Wright leveraged their success into international contracts (at Club Leon, FC St Pauli, and Schalke 04, respectively), with Ibarra even cracking Jürgen Klinsmann’s USMNT rosters. Christian Ramirez and Brent Kallman moved with Minnesota into MLS, becoming respected starters. A current wave of talent headlined by Nazmi Albadawi, Stefano Pinho, and Jack Blake seem destined for shots in the top-flight, as well. That wasn’t enough for Peterson, however. In his eyes, the league needed to keep up with the Beckham Rule and acquire stars of their own. The Cosmos (possibly still the most globally recognizable brand in US soccer) were reborn and played Manchester United in Paul Scholes’ testimonial at Old Trafford in 2011. Launching competitively in 2013, they acquired Spanish midfielder Marcos Senna from Villarreal, and paired him with Real Madrid legend Raúl the next season. The duo were the first marquee attractions for the league, and would later be joined in the NASL by the likes of Joe Cole, Niko Kranjčar, and Georgios Samaras. With bigger stars, the league believed their usual size of 10-12 teams wasn’t enough. Citing the low entry fees (it cost around $10m to get a franchise into the NASL as opposed to $150m for MLS) Peterson boasted frequently of the possibility of rapid expansion. Infamously, he told Sports Illustrated that there were “40 groups” in talks to join the league last summer, in the midst of two sides jumping ship for USL. This desire for rapid expansion sometimes meant less-than-watertight vetting for ownership groups. The league saw three teams join its ranks ahead of the 2016 season. One, Puerto Rico FC, was fronted by NBA superstar Carmelo Anthony, joining in the second half of the league’s split-season schedule. The second, Rayo OKC, was a puzzling case. Owned by then-La Liga side Rayo Vallecano as a brand-placement in the US, the side joined a relatively small market in Oklahoma, which already housed the USL’s OKC Energy. The Spanish ownership seldom focused on Rayo OKC, leaving the local ownership to revolt, with one member taking 60% of their stadium’s turf with him on the way out. Not only did OKC fold after one year, but Vallecano were relegated that very season. The third, however, proved to be the biggest wild card in league history. Miami FC became the fourth Florida side in the 12-team league, and floundered in the first half of the year. Coached by Alessandro Nesta, owners Paolo Maldini and Riccardo Silva were unimpressed by the club’s early results. They opened their pockets, spending $750,000 to bring in NASL Best XI midfielder Richie Ryan and $700,000 to lure Kwadwo Poku from NYC FC. The spending continued, and Miami FC became the second big-budget franchise in the league, rivaling the Cosmos. Very few clubs existed in the league without upheaval. The San Antonio Scorpions were purchased by the local Spurs’ owners and reassigned to USL. The Atlanta Silverbacks folded after 2015, with the city on the brink of hosting MLS’ Atlanta United. The once-stable Strikers were purchased by a Brazilian group led by Ronaldo, but by 2016 were caught failing to pay their players on time and folded that same season. The San Francisco Deltas are likely to have come and gone in one season, with owners calling out fans publicly to increase attendance in the face of ticket prices ranging from $34-$124. Still, the sporting side of the league continued to produce promising talent. On the sidelines, the Cosmos were led to three titles (and a possible fourth this weekend) by Giovanni Savarese. The manager has been linked to former MLS vacancies in Houston, Minnesota, and New England and seems poised to get a chance sometime soon. Likewise, his rival this weekend, Marc Dos Santos, is seen as a rising star in the US coaching ranks, having led Ottawa Fury side to the final in 2015 and the Deltas to the championship game despite their off-field troubles. The most notable successes come from some of the league’s least revered cities. North Carolina FC (née the RailHawks) formed a successful academy that hosted Albadawi and Nick Taitague, who now plays for Schalke. They put in a bid for MLS expansion alongside league rivals Indy Eleven. Indy was founded by Peter Wilt, who took a market known for a love of the NFL and racing and created a fanatic supporters’ culture. 2015 expansion side Jacksonville Armada are now led by president Nathan Walter (a former West Brom academy coach and scout) and Mark Lowry, a fellow Brit. In a league that boasts Savarese and Dos Santos, it’s Lowry who may be the best among the ranks. Still, the recent court rulings have stripped the NASL of its second-division sanctioning, and many clubs are poised to leave the league in its grave. North Carolina has agreed to head to USL, while the rest are set to decide between USL and Wilt’s forthcoming new league, NISA. The Cosmos and Miami FC appear too pricey to join the USL’s relatively-tight pocketed structure, and would be wise to try and continue their relevance in major markets in a more open league. Whatever the fate may be for these sides, the past seven years have provided not only tantalizing football, but some remarkable backroom dealings for club and league alike. As the league’s two most successful managers take the helm on Sunday, they may be dealing with more than X’s and O’s. They very well may create the final image of the short, but memorable existence of the NASL."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/nov/13/southwark-council-pension-fund-divesting-12bn-from-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-13T07:23:18Z","webTitle":"Why my council pension fund is divesting £1.2bn from fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/nov/13/southwark-council-pension-fund-divesting-12bn-from-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/nov/13/southwark-council-pension-fund-divesting-12bn-from-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Why the council pension fund I chair is divesting £1.2bn out of fossil fuels","bodyText":"Data released on 9 November shows that the UK’s local authorities invest more than £16bn into companies that extract oil, gas and coal. Collectively, the country’s local government pension funds have nearly £3,000 invested in fossil fuels for every pension fund member. Southwark has decided we will no longer do this. In December 2016, Southwark council pension fund made a landmark commitment. Following more than a year of consultation, deliberation and work with community groups we announced a decision to divest the £1.2bn fund from fossil fuels. This was a decision based not just on our political and ethical concerns, but primarily on our belief that climate change and significant investments in fossil fuels present a long term financial risk to our fund. We are clear that our action to reduce the carbon exposure of our fund is wholly consistent with our fiduciary duties as pension fund trustees. This move was not taken lightly, but we believe it is the right way forward. By backing divestment, councils can show leadership on climate change, protect public sector workers from long-term financial risk and seize the opportunity to invest in sustainable communities and the transition to a low carbon economy. In December 2015 I first met with representatives of the local community group Fossil Free Southwark. The group was primarily concerned about climate change. In the days before the meeting, Storm Desmond had brought record-breaking rainfall to the region. Only a few days after our meeting, world leaders signed the historic Paris treaty to limit global warming to 2°C. Fossil Free Southwark argued that it was a moral necessity to divest from fossil fuel companies, given their consistent hindrance of efforts to address climate change. While I was also concerned about the impacts of climate change, as a pension fund trustee I was particularly taken by their financial arguments. In 2013, a landmark study brought the idea of “stranded” fossil fuel assets into public consciousness. It argued that up to 80% of known fossil fuel reserves cannot be exploited if we are to meet climate targets, making fossil fuel assets wildly overvalued in the long term. These risks are serious and increasingly understood by the financial mainstream; even Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has highlighted the risks of overvalued carbon. In contrast, the renewable energy industry is flourishing and offers increasingly sound investment opportunities – just look at the rapid growth of offshore wind in the UK. Sure enough, when we surveyed the members of Southwark pension fund, results showed 46.7% wanted to invest in renewable energy. Following careful deliberation, it became clear to me and my council colleagues that fossil fuel divestment would not represent a risk to the stability of the Southwark pension fund, but would instead be financially prudent and entirely consistent with the funds’ responsibilities. And so, a year after my first meeting with Fossil Free Southwark, Southwark became the largest UK pension fund to commit to divesting from fossil fuel companies. In the year since then, my colleagues and I have been working on what this will look like in practice; we’ve ensured that reducing fossil fuel exposure and investing in the future of the energy sector is incorporated into our investment strategy, and are now working on a plan to implement this. We hope that by working together with like-minded councils we can find ways to achieve our shared aims for positive and cost-effective investment of our pension funds. Southwark has commissioned an in-depth assessment of the pension fund’s existing so we can measure progress in line with the divestment commitment. We have identified and are assessing a number of potential, low-carbon investments such as new passive equity funds being offered by Blackrock and also sustainable energy infrastructure funds. But the administrative fees for these type of funds can be prohibitively high for any single pension fund, so we are working closely with like-minded Labour boroughs in London seeking to join forces to reduce these fees. Once our due diligence work has been done, and once we have negotiated acceptable fees, we expect to start the divestment within the next few months. I hold the view that councils should be shifting their investment portfolios away from polluters and into a sustainable future. Recent motions passed by public-sector union Unison, and the Trades Union Congress echo this view. While the current national government lacks any serious commitment to a just and sustainable future, it is the duty of councils such as ours to build this vision. By working for divestment, councils across the UK can stand up for workers’ pensions and the nation’s future, and use local power to call for a transition to a fair and livable world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/09/cheesemaking-as-a-british-success-story","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T19:17:49Z","webTitle":"Cheesemaking as a British success story | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/09/cheesemaking-as-a-british-success-story","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/09/cheesemaking-as-a-british-success-story","fields":{"headline":"Cheesemaking as a British success story","bodyText":"It was heartening to read in Anna Turns’ article (Raw power, G2, 6 November) about flying the flag for real British cheese, and the Academy of Cheese may be welcome, but the article scarcely mentions the many positive developments since the revival of specialist British cheesemaking in the 1980s and 1990s, led among others by the late James Aldridge, the “godfather of British cheese”. The British Cheese Awards and British Cheese Week celebrate these developments, and the current vogue for cheese wedding cakes demonstrates the popularity and wide availability of good cheese. British cheese made entirely on the farm is unlikely ever to satisfy consumer appetite for “cheese made with integrity”. One look at the counters in specialist cheese shops like The Mousetrap and foodie havens like the Ludlow Food Centre, a visit to the Monkland Cheese Dairy or a taste of cheeses from Neal’s Yard Creamery, Dorstone (to quote only very local examples) will show how much progress has been made in recent years. Long may this continue. Helen Norris Lucton, Herefordshire • I was very disappointed to see Anna Turns’ article. It is not true that there are only a handful of traditional farmhouse cheeses in Britain. I was trading at the Frome Independent Market in Somerset on Sunday, selling Wootton Organic Dairy unpasteurised sheep and Jersey cows’ milk cheeses from a single farm just outside Shepton Mallett. Next to me was the stall of the Old Cheese Room with cows’ cheeses from Neston in Wiltshire, and beside them were Westcombe Dairy of Westcombe in Somerset selling their unpasteurised cheddar. All three of us had a highly successful day selling to a very responsive and appreciative public. Further down the road was the Bath Soft Cheese Company and Wookey Farm goats cheeses. That’s a handful in one small part of the south-west! Go to Wales, Yorkshire, Lancashire and many other parts of Britain and you will find many brilliant farm cheeses. It is true that supermarkets do not usually sell fine British cheeses – small producers cannot produce the quantity required, and supermarkets have no idea how to store or sell really fine cheese. But there are plenty of really good cheese shops and delis selling British cheeses, and farmers’ markets are selling them up and down the land. Tell Anna to come to the Sturminster Newton Cheese Show in Dorset next September – that’ll be an eye-opener for her.

For successful innovators, getting to the point where things really take off is a long and often winding road of hope, promise, disappointment and renewal. Entrepreneurs who grow a good idea into a business are critical to our economic success, but entrepreneurs are not only born and raised in the business community. There are about 1,000 businesses in the UK that are run by university academics who have taken the plunge and are commercialising the research that they have invested years of their lives in. These include companies such as 2D tech, which was spun out of Manchester University to find commercial applications for graphene, Run3D, an Oxford University spinout that uses biomechanical engineering to help sportspeople improve their performance, or Magnomatics from Sheffield University, which has developed a gearbox that doesn’t actually have any gears in it. If we are to maintain our position as a world leader in innovation, the UK needs these research-led businesses to scale up, not sell up. As universities minister Jo Johnson recognised recently in a speech to the Higher Education Funding Council for England, our universities need to “find a new gear” and accelerate the adoption of the best practice on research commercialisation that already exists in some of our universities so that it becomes mainstream. This view is backed up by statistics. Although patent applications in the UK have increased by around 150% over the last decade, most of that growth was in the first five years. While the number of businesses that are being spun out of our universities has been growing, the figures for those that are still operating after three years has been stagnant since 2009-10 and, on average, they have just four employees. Poor commercialisation of UK research is a problem that Johnson has committed to solve through his new knowledge exchange framework. It will benchmark performance in university-business collaboration, with the aim of driving up standards and recognising that the strengths of different types of institution are not based solely on their work in research. This should be welcomed, particularly by growing businesses that are faced with a wide choice of universities and which can struggle to identify the best partner. However, we need to make sure the framework takes a long-term view of investment and uses a measure of knowledge exchange that genuinely drives businesses to scale up and creates economic growth. At the moment some university technology transfer offices are using funding models and measures of success that are just too short-term. We should not use a single measure, like the exploitation of intellectual property, simply because it is easier to quantify. Innovate UK will work with the government and Research England to make sure that the new framework looks to the long term, with a variety of measures that genuinely link through to growth and create the right incentives. In particular, the framework must acknowledge that research that can transform our industries comes in many different forms, not just patents and IP. For instance, a great deal of work is already being done to develop artificial intelligence systems and algorithms that will analyse big datasets, but since you cannot patent an algorithm in the UK, using that as your indicator would be a flawed measure. The framework will also need to drive knowledge from our universities into established businesses of all sizes to develop new products and services because this is just as important as support for new companies that are starting out. That is where schemes like knowledge transfer partnerships can help. Run by Innovate UK, the research councils and devolved administrations, these transfer a graduate or more senior researcher into a business for between 12 and 36 months to deliver an innovation project identified by the business. This is a three-way partnership between the business, the university and the academic in which all benefit. This week we received an additional £30 million from the national productivity investment fund to substantially expand the programme. When the framework is introduced, universities will be able to use schemes like these partnerships to demonstrate how they are commercialising research. Knowledge transfer from our universities and the commercialisation of university research matters. So long as we get the measures and incentives right, the framework can bring benefits not just to the international reputation of our businesses and universities, but also to the wider economy.

Typhoon Damrey made landfall on 4 November in the country’s south-central coastal region, with winds of 135km an hour. At least 100 people have died, according to Vietnam’s disaster management authority. A further 18 people remain missing following days of torrential rains that left some areas submerged in three meters of water. As communities struggle to recover, another tropical storm, Haikui, is building in the South China Sea and is expected to hit Vietnam within the next 48 hours. “This typhoon [Damrey] caused severe damage to large areas,” said Hung Ha Nguyen, community safety and resilience manager for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “It is the strongest storm to make landfall into Khanh Hoa province and the south-central region in the last 20 years.

The storm has destroyed homes and inundated vast swaths of agricultural land, damaging crops. “According to our field assessment teams, there is little support on the ground,” said Hung Ha Nguyen. “The government has committed to support 3,400 tonnes of rice to affected people, but in order to reach the affected people it might take weeks or days.” Melanie Ogle, disaster risk management delegate for the IFRC, said: “There have been wide power outages, a lot of areas are cut off and there’s a huge number of people affected.” Ogle said there was an urgent need for emergency shelter as well as sanitation equipment, such as water purification tablets, to prevent the outbreak of disease. “It doesn’t take very long in tropical conditions [for disease to spread] where there has been flooding and contamination of water sources, especially if there’s no hygiene promotion going on,” she said. “There’s a risk of dengue fever, malaria, typhoid and influenza.” Unicef, the UN children’s fund, said there are about 1 million children live in the areas worst affected by the storm, many of whom have missed out on school as a result. “This storm has hit some of the poorest provinces in the country. A lot of farmers have had their fields destroyed, or their harvest and crops damaged,” said Louis Vigneault-Dubois, a spokesman for Unicef in Vietnam. “These families are living on the edge, faced with such catastrophic events they’re going to struggle over the next couple of months, and it will impact their capacity to feed their children,” he said. About 25,000 hectares (61,750 acres) of agricultural land, including 10,000 hectares of rice fields, have been inundated. A further 25,000 marine cages, used for fishing, have also been destroyed, according to Vietnam’s central steering committee for natural disaster prevention and control. More than 120,000 houses have been destroyed or damaged in the storm, which hit areas of Khanh Hoa, Phu Yen and Binh Dinh provinces the hardest. Areas in at least five provinces are thought to remain underwater. Da Nang, a coastal city in central Vietnam hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference attended by Donald Trump, suffered minor damage. Damrey is the 12th and deadliest typhoon to hit Vietnam this year. Last month, the country experienced deadly flooding in which 75 people were killed and 28 reported missing. Aid workers fear typhoon Haikui will bring further misery over the weekend. The provinces of Quang Tri, Thue Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen and Khanh Hoa are braced for additional rainfall and winds up to 111 km an hour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/09/doctor-whos-hardest-task-yet-making-yellow-braces-happen","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T16:45:55Z","webTitle":"Doctor Who's hardest task yet – making yellow braces happen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/09/doctor-whos-hardest-task-yet-making-yellow-braces-happen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/09/doctor-whos-hardest-task-yet-making-yellow-braces-happen","fields":{"headline":"Doctor Who's hardest task yet – making yellow braces happen","bodyText":"Yellow braces. In the grand history of fashion – women’s fashion, at least – yellow braces are not something that have ever had a moment. Not even a nano-second. But then, Doctor Who has never really been a slavish follower of fashion. While the world’s designers spend their whole time in a constant shift between decades (anyone looking at the new Vogue out this week would be forgiven in thinking the time machine had got lost in the 70s), the Doctor has never really paid much attention to the sartorial codes of his – and now her – travels through different eras. But those braces are something else. Red braces and the new Doctor would have been in tricky skinhead territory. Especially with those boots. But the mustard yellow brings to mind fellow sci-fi traveller Mork (of late-70s throwbacks Mork &amp; Mindy) who, when he wasn’t in his red bacofoil and crimplene boiler suit, was rarely seen without his wonderfully upbeat rainbow coloured braces. There is something reassuringly children’s TV presenter about the braces, too. And maybe, given Dr Who’s core audience, that’s no bad thing. When the monsters get too scary, the Doctor’s attire will be a comforting distraction. Every Doctor worth their Tardis has to have a signature. For the first Doctor, played in 1963 by William Hartnell, the look was a Dickensian cravat tied around his wing collars in a neat bow. He also liked the occasional monocle. The most memorable doctors have boasted instantly recognisable looks. For third Doctor Jon Pertwee, it was a dash of Liberace with big hair, ruffled dress shirt, bowtie and velvet smoking jacket. The fourth Doctor (I would argue that the golden age was 1974-78) was an opportunity for Tom Baker to cast off his construction site overalls and go through the BBC dressing-up box. He was a true style leader; his maxi coat, beaten up hat and that handknit stripey scarf could well have inspired Richard E Grant’s look in Withnail and I. So the wardrobe of Jodie Whittaker’s first female Doctor is of some considerable importance (some might argue even more importance than the latest Gucci collection). The mustard yellow braces hold up navy culottes which are a 70s favourite enjoying something of a comeback. They are very practical for a woman on the go, as are the sturdy boots. The coat has subtle stripes that match the stripe on her top – perhaps a nod to the great Baker’s scarf – and looks as though it could be reversible which would be very handy if you only had one change of clothes for an entire TV series. She is practically attired, fashionably timeless. Almost anti-fashion, in fact. But then, like all of her predecessors, she has her mind set on far more pressing matters like saving the Earth from impending doom. But just you wait. Fashion works in mysterious ways and those yellow braces may well have their moment yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/10/michal-gove-bees-pesticides-ban-neonicotinoids-environment-secretary","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T09:00:14Z","webTitle":"Michael Gove is backing a ban on bee-killing pesticides.

But it’s only a start","bodyText":"There was good news this morning for the hundreds of thousands of people who have been calling on the government to endorse a ban on neonicotinoids, the main culprit for the precipitous decline in the world’s bee population. Michael Gove, the responsible government minister, has finally confirmed that the UK will support an extended ban against the use of these pesticides. It’s been a long time coming – and has taken years of effort from campaigners all over the UK. Make no mistake: this ban will do much to limit the damage done by these dangerous chemicals. But Gove’s new position isn’t a radical one. In fact, he’s just catching up with the 77% of the public who, in a recent poll, agreed that pesticides that harm bees and other pollinators should be completely banned. Although he claims that it is only now that the scientific evidence stacks up, there are many who would disagree. SumOfUs members have campaigned for a ban for years on the strength of scientific evidence, as have many others. Gove’s application of the precautionary principle is disappointingly late to the party. In fact, the minister seems to be a part-time user of the precautionary principle at best. This morning, the UK voted to reauthorise glyphosate’s license at an EU committee (although the committee itself didn’t reach a final conclusion). Josie Cohen of the Pesticide Action Network explains, “There’s enough evidence showing that glyphosate causes cancer and damages the environment to get rid of it from our food and farms. It’s especially urgent because it’s found everywhere – one study found glyphosate and pesticides like it cropping up in 60% of bread sold in the UK.” In short, it might be a good day for bees, but the prospects are not looking so bright for those of us hoping that the pesticides used to treat our most basic foodstuffs won’t ultimately be responsible for giving us a life-threatening illness. There is no question that this decision on neonicotinoids is the right one, albeit delayed. And it may not be without political cost, as the big farmers that typically support the Conservatives find themselves confronting a shift in their farming practices. But for his renewed enthusiasm for environmental protection to look like more than political expediency, there is considerably more that he must do. First, Gove must demonstrate that the UK will uphold high environmental protection standards whatever happens with Brexit. At the moment, it is hard to shake the image of the UK being dragged kicking and screaming along with the bolder environmentalists in the EU when it comes to prioritising our long-term environmental wellbeing over short-term profits and good relationships with the corporate giants producing the pesticides. Gove could easily and robustly push back against this, if he wished to do so, by introducing the precautionary principle into UK law, via the European Union withdrawal bill, which returns to the House of Commons for debate next week. The necessary adjustments to make this possible have been proposed: now all that needs to happen is for the government to pass the legislation in its amended form. To do so would be a huge victory for the health of our environment and wildlife for generations to come. The scandal of neonicotinoids’ continued use might be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the adverse side effects of our over-dependence on dangerous pesticides in agriculture. If the minister wants to safeguard the health of his voters and their children, he must do more than sluggishly ban the very worst offender. Instead, he must take a bold stance when confronted with similar evidence about other dangerous pesticides – and ensure the passage of legislation that will ensure his successors are required to do likewise. • Hannah Lownsbrough is executive director of SumOfUs"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/nov/09/simon-cowell-show-brexit-x-factor-reality-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T18:47:34Z","webTitle":"Can Simon Cowell redeem himself with a new show for the Brexit era?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/nov/09/simon-cowell-show-brexit-x-factor-reality-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/nov/09/simon-cowell-show-brexit-x-factor-reality-tv","fields":{"headline":"Can Simon Cowell redeem himself with a new show for the Brexit era?","bodyText":"Whatever happened to telly demagogue Simon Cowell, arguably the first great populist of the new era, who once bestrode the ratings on both sides of the Atlantic? His X Factor was the undisputed jewel in ITV’s crown, and the topic on which everyone from primary school children to prime ministers felt obliged to have an opinion. Now, his karaokosseum is playing to sparse audiences, the power ballad equivalent of an April Premier League game at the Emirates. Yet during those heady glory years, Cowell was the Karaoke Sauron. “Not yet wholly evil,” as Tolkien wrote of the necromancer in his second age, but disturbingly adept at “corrupting other minds”. To get a sense of how far Simon has fallen, you have to remind yourself of how elevated he once was. American Idol alone was estimated to be worth $2.5bn to Fox. Not only was Cowell the linchpin judge on the two top-rating shows on both sides of the Atlantic at the same time, but he dominated both off-seasons with his Got Talent format. He owned The X Factor, and would later export it (ultimately unsuccessfully) to the US. When he did so, he literally asked Fox if it could reschedule the World Series to stop it interfering with the programme’s rollout. And Simon was confident enough to share this story, just as he was to declare that a couple in Los Angeles had once offered him $150,000 to come back to their house and give his snarky judge’s verdict on their lovemaking. Although he claimed never to have voted, meanwhile, his political endorsement was courted feverishly by Conservative and Labour leaders. In the middle of dealing with the financial crisis in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown wrote personal letters to each one of The X Factor’s 12 finalists. For Simon’s part, he believed that the franchise’s popularity in territories such as China and Afghanistan meant he had “kind of given democracy back to the world”. His decision to back David Cameron was the Sun’s splash the morning before the 2010 election. The karaoke industrial complex was fairly inescapable. By way of a typical vignette from one year, X Factor winner Joe McElderry attended the military awards run by the Sun, the show’s house journal. There, he was introduced to Cameron, who duly went on to tell radio listeners in an interview that he was backing Joe for the Christmas No 1. Perhaps most ominously, Cowell was able to justify any corrosive debasement of the public sensibility with the fact that it was what they had voted for. He was the most enthusiastic exponent of that phrase “the will of the people” since the other guy. And now … well, in one sense, decline was inevitable. Nothing lasts for ever, and Britain’s stocks of vibrato-happy teens with mildly redemptive backstories had been comprehensively overfished. But the story of what went wrong for Cowell is really the story of what went right for what he represented. Mankind could bear much more reality than even Simon had predicted. Politicians such as Brown, who had naively called for “an X Factor politics”, must see they have now got what they wished for. Reality TV has completed its hostile takeover of the news. Arguably, the biggest reality star of that golden era became the Republican nominee for president, and I need hardly remind you where he sits now. Entertainment formats limited to weekly slots have lost out to the news cycle, where it is always primetime, and no one knows what is going to happen next, other than that it is sure to be driven by the holy grail of reality programming: conflict. On UK shores, it is worth remembering that Simon was obsessed with plebiscites – one of his ideas was for a show running weekly referendums on hot-button issues. “I think there could be some kind of referendum-type TV show,” he told Newsnight, “where you can speak on both sides and then open it up to the public to get an instant poll.” There might be a red phone on stage, he thought, allowing No 10 to ring in – ! – and explain its position. “It would be controversial,” he mused. “The public would eventually make the decision.” Furthermore, it would be “a good way for me to get involved in politics”. And why not? He was the music mogul who never listened to music at home. Why shouldn’t he be the political puppetmaster with no interest in even voting? Anyway, that was then. Keenly conscious of his wildly diminished relevance and the lowest X Factor ratings in its 14-year run, Simon this week had an announcement for us. “Watch this space,” he told reporters. “We’ve got a new show soon. I can’t say more but it’s still music. You’ll like the one we’re making.” Well now. Could he give any more detail? “You’ll have to wait,” teased the Herbert Asquith of weaponised Auto-Tune, “but you will see more about it soon.” And when we do, we will know whether Simon is accepting managed decline, or if the erstwhile spirit of the age is launching a bid to return to a position of uber relevance. As a longtime student of his work, I think I know what the old Simon Cowell would have done when designing his new format. He would have located the wellspring of division, conflict and noise in this country, and he would have powered his show on it. Which is to say – obviously – that he would have found a way to re-run the Brexit referendum every week. Come on: what better way to get people talking and voting? Off the top of my head, he could still locate this notional show in his karaokosseum. In fact, he already should have. This year, instead of turning off the same old X Factor, we should be tuning in as two sides of a draw are whittled down in a show called Brex Factor. Thus, groups of singers who identify under the Leave and Remain banners would eventually yield two finalists. Each of these would be given a Christmas single – probably East 17’s Stay Another Day and the Spice Girls’ Goodbye, although we could clearly argue about song choices all day. Either way, the pair would go head-to-head for the Christmas No 1 slot. Sales determine the winner. Then we do the whole thing again next year. Yes, the old Simon wouldn’t have avoided the central culture war of our single-issue nation: he would have run towards it and tapped into it. If you want a crash course in post-moral telly mechanics, you need look little further than Mike Darnell, Fox’s apocalyptic president of alternative programming (now at Warner Bros). Darnell once lamented the negative coverage of a Fox show called Who’s Your Daddy?, in which a now-adult adoptee had to pick her biological father from a lineup to win $100,000. “Regret is a big word,” he declared in mystification to an interviewer. He regretted only one thing about it, he explained, and that was that the huge controversy generated was “outside the programme – so it doesn’t translate into ratings.” And so with the Cowell of yore, who would surely have looked at the Brexit shitstorm and come to a single conclusion: why is no one turning this into TV ratings, phoneline income and unit sales? Will he now fill that gap? As he says, we must wait and see. But it’s the most Cowellian way out of his downward spiral, and any self-respecting horseman of the apocalypse would only embrace it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2017/nov/10/10-best-things-to-do-this-week-mudbound-morrissey","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T09:00:14Z","webTitle":"The 10 best things to do this week: Mudbound and Morrissey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/nov/10/10-best-things-to-do-this-week-mudbound-morrissey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/nov/10/10-best-things-to-do-this-week-mudbound-morrissey","fields":{"headline":"The 10 best things to do this week: Mudbound and Morrissey","bodyText":"Exhibitions British Wildlife Photography awards In light of flashier, worldwide photography awards such as the Wildlife Photographer of the Year (currently on show at the Natural History Museum), it is easy to forget that, despite its small size, the UK is abundant in nature, too.

One: on the night of 30 April 1915, the ship’s cat of the RMS Lusitania went awol in New York. The next day, the ship sailed for Liverpool without him; a week later it was torpedoed by U-boats and sunk. Two: in the ruins of Pompeii, there have been found no cat remains, although mosaics and statues indicate that cats were favoured pets. Countless people perished in the destruction of Pompeii, as did hapless dogs. But when they died, they did it cat-less. I mention these feline feats of scarpering in times of crisis because the reader needs to be warned: Hiro Arikawa’s bestselling Japanese novel features a cat with a heart, who feels loyalty and gratitude and would never abandon his loving human master – not at the first rumble of an erupting volcano; not even on hearing rumours of enemy submarines lurking in the Irish Sea. So we must start with a question. Is this a book for cat lovers who can’t handle the truth? Nana is the protagonist. A stray cat in Tokyo with a strong survival instinct, he is taken in by a young man named Satoru after being hit by a car. Nana finds he has fallen on his feet. Satoru is a cat lover from youth; gentle and intuitive, he still mourns his first cat Hachi, from whom he was traumatically separated as a child. The name “Nana” derives from na, the Japanese word for seven – the shape of Nana’s tail; Hachi was named after the number eight because of markings on his head. Nana is scornful of Satoru’s literal-mindedness when it comes to naming cats, but he has the usual feline instinct for knowing which side his crispy chicken is battered, and decides to stick around. Five happy years of cohabitation pass in a single sentence, and then Satoru tells the cat that they must make a journey. They will visit Satoru’s childhood friend Kosuke, with the purpose of rehoming Nana. Satoru is not forthcoming about the reason. “We just can’t live together any more,” he says. I wrote “Oh no, is Satoru ill?” in the margin, but that’s me; I’ve seen a lot of films. At this stage, Satoru’s motives are officially unclear. The reunited Kosuke and Satoru reminisce about the number-eight cat, and we learn about Satoru’s talent for friendship and the shock of his parents’ death. But does Nana stay with Kosuke? The structure of The Travelling Cat Chronicles is deceptively simple. With alternating sections of third-person and Nana-the-cat narration, it consists of three journeys to friends, followed by a pilgrimage across a beautifully evoked landscape. There is then a heart-breaking last journey that left me in bits. I’ve rarely changed my mind so much about a book in the course of reading it. I started out quibbling with the translation (would a cat that exclaims “Good lord” also say “yada yada”?), but before long, I had surrendered to Arikawa’s powerful emotional agenda, according to which a human’s love for his cat is not delusional but self-fulfilling, just as all loving sacrifice is its own reward. People who love animals are often made to feel bonkers. To be fair, we ask for it. But the desire to consider the happiness of a four-legged friend is not ignoble; it is humane. And we do get something back. This book reminded me of Caroline Alexander’s Mrs Chippy’s Last Expedition (1997) – narrated by the carpenter’s cat aboard Shackleton’s ship Endurance, when it was marooned in Antarctic ice. In that excellent novel, the cat narrator seems at first gimmicky; but it becomes movingly clear that the presence of a cat to feed and look after is what keeps the men going. In The Travelling Cat Chronicles, Nana is at one point left with other caged animals on a ferry, and Satoru keeps checking up on him. Other animals mock Nana for being pampered, but a cat speaks up. “Don’t you understand? It’s his master who’s the lonely one?” What Nana observes and experiences through their journeys is Satoru’s huge, lifelong capacity for quiet consideration, which is moving enough in itself. But when the cat responds to his love – well, you ought to laugh, but I couldn’t. “Cats are not so heartless,” declares Nana. “How could I ever leave him?” I know, I know. What a sap I am. But anyone who has ever unashamedly loved an animal will read this book with gratitude, for its understanding of an emotion that ennobles us as human beings, whether we value it or not. • The Travelling Cat Chronicles is published by Doubleday.

Democratic gains were, of course, cause for good cheer. But political optimism, along with trust in analysis and faith in the accuracy of polling data, belong to the certainties of the pre-Trump world. The failure of Trumpism in Virginia and New Jersey were good signs; but so what? Even the re-election of Bill de Blasio for a second term as mayor of New York had some head-scratching elements to it. It was a comfortable victory over Republican Nicole Malliotakis, with De Blasio winning 66% of the vote. In spite of this, to call him a popular mayor isn’t quite right. His progressive policies have been largely successful – most notably, his introduction of universal free pre-school for four-year-olds in the city, an initiative he wants to roll out to three-year-olds – yet there persists the sense that De Blasio is not equal to the task of stewarding a city such as New York. This is probably down to style. There is thought to be something unforgivably shambling about him. His lateness to meetings is legendary. He persists in travelling an hour south of Gracie Mansion, the official mayor’s residence, to use the gym in his old neighbourhood in Brooklyn. This is an inexplicable eccentricity, given the bad publicity it generates, although I know some New Yorkers for whom it is so audacious a move as to constitute the mayor’s one dash of style. Regardless, De Blasio is generally regarded to have neither the snap and hustle of a Bloomberg, nor the manic charm of an Ed Koch. He is a different political beast, less showy, more plodding. It is encouraging that a politician with such relatively low-watt charisma can win on the basis of a solid record in office. But that doesn’t mean anyone has to love him. Stop taking the tabloids Perhaps the most startling thing about the mayoral race was the relatively insignificant role of the tabloids. During most of De Blasio’s first term, Murdoch’s New York Post portrayed him almost daily as a scary crypto-socialist with an anarchist wife who was coming to take your child’s lunch money. At one point, it practically called him a douchebag on the front page. In Britain, the role of the rightwing press in electoral politics is taken seriously for good reason: governments appease tabloid editors and proprietors on the understanding they can swing elections (even if attempts to discredit Jeremy Corbyn have not so far had the intended effect). In New York, though, no one seems to take the blindest bit of notice. Three days before the election, the New York Post ran a typical piece under the headline All the reasons you shouldn’t vote for De Blasio. Still he won by a landslide. I don’t know why this is, exactly. The tabloids in New York have never had the same reach as those in Britain, partly, I guess, because newspaper culture in the US is weaker and more decentralised, and partly because fewer people read them. (The New York Post has a circulation of around a quarter of a million, a fraction of that of the Sun.) Either way, some aspects of American democracy can still teach the old world a lesson. First they take Manhattan … We repay the Americans by exporting the Daily Mail to them, in this case in its exciting new television format. DailyMailTV is starting out small in New York as a recurring segment on the local news station PIX11 News. One has the feeling PIX11 doesn’t have a full handle on the implications of what the “Daily Mail” means, but anyway, according to the press release, the new segment will be fronted by “former NFL player and sports analyst Jesse Palmer”, who will “check in with reporters chasing down stories from bureaus all over the world”. (For which, one assumes, read a bunker in the aggregation galley of the Daily Mail’s New York offices.) At least some things in life remain constant. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/09/giant-solar-power-plant-uk-biggest-north-kent-coast-subsidy-free-power-station-faversham","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T15:55:03Z","webTitle":"UK's biggest solar farm planned for Kent coast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/09/giant-solar-power-plant-uk-biggest-north-kent-coast-subsidy-free-power-station-faversham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/09/giant-solar-power-plant-uk-biggest-north-kent-coast-subsidy-free-power-station-faversham","fields":{"headline":"UK's biggest solar farm planned for Kent coast","bodyText":"An enormous solar power station is planned for the north Kent coast that would be the UK’s biggest and dwarf existing solar farms, providing a significant boost to an industry that has stalled since ministers halted subsidies 18 months ago. Cleve Hill, a mile from the historic town of Faversham, would have five times the capacity of the UK’s current largest solar farm and provide enough power for around 110,000 households if it comes online in 2020 as proposed. Developers Hive Energy and Wirsol Energy hope to lay solar panels across 890 acres (365 hectares) – equal to more than 400 football pitches – of farmland near the village of Graveney. The companies think that falling technology costs and the economies of scale from supersizing the solar farm mean it will work without subsidies. Only one big subsidy-free solar farm has been built since support was axed by the government in 2016, near Flitwick in Bedfordshire, but that was an extension to an existing solar farm built using earlier subsidies. Hugh Brennan of Hive Energy said: “The Cleve Hill solar park is a pioneering scheme that aims to optimise the technological developments in solar energy.” A consultation has begun and letters sent out to residents ahead of local meetings in December, with the project’s backers stressing they are aware of the site’s importance for wildlife. The area’s salt marshes and mudflats are used by migrating birds including marsh harriers and lapwing. Readers will also know the marshes as similar to the nearby childhood home of Pip in Charles Dickens’s Great Expectations. One resident said he was in favour of renewable energy but there were concerns locally over the sheer scale of the project. Adrian Oliver, owner of the Freewheel cycling cafe in Graveney, said: “I think people are worried about the scale of it, and the infrastructure [roads] impact as it gets built. “I don’t think anyone is anti the fact that it is a brilliant energy source. I’m broadly for it as long it’s done well and doesn’t disturb the wildlife.” He added that the area had experienced some traffic during the building of a substation for the world’s biggest offshore windfarm, the London Array. The proposed solar farm would connect up to the substation. Cleve Hill’s backers said public rights of way that run across the site would not be affected, and footpaths would not be permanently closed. They also promise to limit any impact on wildlife, with a proposal to establish a mitigation area for birds. The Kent Wildlife Trust said its main concern was about the impact on birds that live on its nature reserve adjacent to the site. Brent geese from the reserve, for example, sometimes rest up on the farmland. “The scale is unprecedented. We have a lot of questions,” said Greg Hitchcock, the conservation officer at the trust. The RSPB said it was examining the plans and that it was too early to comment. One green group welcomed the solar farm but said that its enormous size showed government policy meant that community-backed solar plants were being “frozen out”. Max Wakefield, lead campaigner at climate charity 10:10, said: “It’s a real ray of sunshine to see such ambitious clean energy projects emerging in the UK despite the policy obstacles. But the scale this project has had to adopt in order to be commercially viable is also a warning.” The Solar Trade Association echoed that view. “Government policy of excluding solar from clean power auctions is driving larger projects in a bid to get the economics to work,” said a spokeswoman. Cleve Hill could have a capacity of as much as 350MW, though its backers said the final size had not been decided. The scale means the project will need to gain approval from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A medium-sized conventional power plant would generate around 1,000MW. Britain’s biggest existing solar farm is at Lyneham in Wiltshire. It produces 69MW and is owned by the government. There are also several around the 50-60MW mark. However, most of the UK’s solar farms are relatively small, and only around 80 can generate more than 20MW. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/10/gender-pay-gap-widening-for-women-in-their-20s-data-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T00:01:03Z","webTitle":"Gender pay gap widening for women in their 20s, data shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/10/gender-pay-gap-widening-for-women-in-their-20s-data-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/10/gender-pay-gap-widening-for-women-in-their-20s-data-shows","fields":{"headline":"Gender pay gap widening for women in their 20s, data shows","bodyText":"The gender pay gap for women in their 20s is growing after years of decline, with some young women being paid less than men from the start of their careers, figures have revealed. The figures were released on Friday, named as Equal Pay Day and the day of the year when women in effect begin to work for free due to the pay gap. Gender rights campaigners said the data highlighted a “national scandal” created by the same power imbalance that allowed sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. They warned that the UK was going backwards in addressing the issue, with the gulf widening for young women. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: “The pay gap is widest for older women as it grows over our working lives but we are now seeing a widening of the pay gap for younger women too, which suggests we are going backwards and that is extremely worrying.” Sophie Walker, leader of the Women’s Equality party, stressed that the gender pay gap had to be viewed as part of the same power imbalance that had lead to a series of sexual harassment scandals in politics, the media and entertainment industry. “Unequal pay is one of the main barriers to equality and is a key factor in sexual harassment and violence against women,” she said. “The pay gap is another national scandal that we don’t understand, and it has this same national narrative around it that women are somehow choosing this treatment – this idea that inequality is some sort of lifestyle choice.” The gender pay gap for women in their 20s has been widening recently, and is now five times greater than it was six years ago, although older women still face greater pay discrimination than workers at the start of their career. Progress has stalled on closing the gender pay gap, which now stands at 14.1% according to the Office for National Statistics, with no movement on the figure in the last three years. At the current rate of change it will take 100 years to close the male-female gap in pay. According to the ONS, older women face the greatest discrimination, with women in their 50s paid on average 18.6% less than their male colleagues. While the gap among younger women had almost been eliminated, in the last six years there was a notable increase, from 1.1% in 2011 to 5.5% this year. The gap is highest in London (20.7%), followed by the south-east at 16.3%. It is lowest in Wales, at 8.3%, and the north-east, at 10.2%. The gap is higher in the private sector, at 17.1%. But it has fallen by 4.3% points since 2011, while in the public sector it has plateaued at just above 14%. Fawcett Society research published this year found that the mean aggregate pay gap for Pakistani and Bangladeshi women was 26% and for black African women it was 24%. Using the hashtag #paygappledge, the Fawcett Society is encouraging workers across the UK to take action to tackle the gap by starting a conversation at work and speaking to their employers, while companies and the government are being urged to make tangible, effective changes. The Women’s Equality party is coordinating thousands of women to send an “out-of-office” message today in protest about in effect not being paid for the remainder of the year. “Imagine the chaos if all of those women in all those areas of work simply walked away from their jobs today,” said Walker. “Shops shut, hospitals in crisis, businesses forced to close, dads scrambling to find childcare cover. It’s time for fair pay.” The government has set a deadline for businesses with more than 250 staff to report their gender pay gap (which will be available on the government website) by 31 March 2018. Some companies have already started reporting, including the BBC, which was fiercely criticised after several high-profile employees were found to have salaries significantly lower than their male counterparts. Maria Miller, the MP for Basingstoke and chair of the women and equalities select committee, said: “We continue to hear warm words from the government on eliminating the gender pay gap but clearly progress remains disappointing. Businesses must also take responsibility. “We continue to push for urgent action and reiterate that flexible working, sharing unpaid caring responsibilities, and supporting women returning to work after having children, are all key to tackling the problem.” Walker said that a main reason for the pay gap was that the UK had the most expensive childcare in the world. “It takes away the choice about whether and how much women want to work. And when women take up lower-paid part-time roles and men dominate more senior jobs, there is a power imbalance, and that is where harassment thrives because women are being forced into a position of dependency.” Carole Easton, chief executive of the Young Women’s Trust, said that even if women did have children or were at the beginning of their career, discrimination was there; it started “from the moment women start work”. The trust’s research revealed that young female apprentices earned 8% less than their male peers, leaving them more than £1,000 a year worse off. “At this rate, today’s young women will be retired before equal pay becomes a reality,” Easton said. “Often this is because the sectors women tend to work in – such as administration, health and social care and retail – are not valued and paid as much as they should be. Government data shows that male graduates of almost all degree subjects are out-earning women within just a few years of completing their degrees.” Anne Milton, minister for women and for skills and apprenticeships, , said that despite the passing of the Equal Pay Act nearly 50 years ago too many women were still held back in their careers. “The pay gap won’t close on its own, we all need to take action to make sure we address this,” she said. “That is why we have introduced a legal requirement for all large employers to publish their gender pay and bonus data by April 2018. I’m pleased that some of our top companies are leading the way and have already reported. By shining a light on where there are gaps they can take action to address it‎.” ‘The way jobs are set up has held me back’ Laura Davies enjoyed her job in retail. She wanted to do more training, push herself further and earn more money, but when she became pregnant aged 20 she found that many of the avenues were closed off. “When my employers found out I was pregnant they made things very hostile, they didn’t want me to stay,” she says. “So I had no choice but to leave.” Until recently, Davies, now 27, was working part-time, but found that her childcare responsibilities meant she could not go on to a higher level of pay. “I left at the end of July in my last job, they refused flexible working and they turned me down for promotion because they thought I was not committed, which wasn’t true. Now I’m self employed because I think it’s the only way I’m going to get ahead.” She, and friends, she said, who were also young mothers, felt the odds were stacked against them. “Most people think the wage gap is comparing the same wage in the same job, but young mums work lower paid jobs, which don’t have the potential for progression, aren’t flexible enough [for trying] new things or training courses,” she says. The options open to young women, with or without children, in lower-paid work, are a frustration, she says, adding that even at apprenticeship level jobs dominated by women are paid and valued less. “There is a mentality that young mums aren’t hard workers, but my friends are some of the hardest working I know,” she adds. “Especially being young you have to work so much harder to prove that you can do it.” Davies now works from home as an online marketer, working hours that fit around looking after her son. But she feels as if several employers have failed to see, and help her realise, her potential. “I feel the way jobs are set up has held me back. Billions of hours are being wasted because mums aren’t being used to their potential. Why can’t employers find a flexible way of working? I’d have loved the potential to progress in my retail job, but because I worked part-time and I was a new mum they didn’t feel I was the fit … I had to do it myself and push myself up the ladder.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/09/boris-johnson-hails-donald-trump-as-great-huge-global-brand","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T14:42:27Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson hails Donald Trump as 'great huge global brand'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/09/boris-johnson-hails-donald-trump-as-great-huge-global-brand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/09/boris-johnson-hails-donald-trump-as-great-huge-global-brand","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson hails Donald Trump as 'great huge global brand'","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has described Donald Trump as “one of the great huge global brands” and said he was penetrating corners of the world’s consciousness that few other presidents have managed to reach. The UK foreign secretary’s praise on the US cable show Fox and Friends came as he may find himself hauled in front of a parliamentary committee for failing to correct remarks in which he suggested a jailed British dual Iranian national may have been training journalists in Iran, leaving her open to further charges. Johnson’s description of the US president came on Trump’s favourite TV channel Fox News. He is in US to speak to members of Congress about the need to retain the Iranian nuclear deal, which the president has refused to re-certify. “The American president is one of the great huge global brands and is penetrating corners of the global consciousness that I think few other presidents have ever done,” he said. He also defended Trump’s controversial tweets, saying they were an effective means of communication “no matter how rambunctious”. “Yes a lot of people don’t like it and a lot of people relate to it,” he said. “In an age when people have been turned off politics it’s more direct and it’s more communicative than a lot of previous presidents have managed.” Johnson accepted he faced some consular issues in Iran after his remarks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe were seized on by the Iranian judiciary to press further charges against her. She is currently serving a five-year jail term after being accused of espionage – a charge she denies. Labour MPs are considering sending him to the privileges committee for making an untruthful statement to the effect that she had been conducting journalism courses in Iran. Johnson has accepted his remarks could have been clearer, but insists they were deliberately misconstrued and refuses to apologise. He claims to have had assurances from Tehran that his remarks have had no effect on the judicial process in Iran, and said he had underlined that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had not been training journalists in his conversation with the Iranian government. Johnson has promised to visit Iran before Christmas and if appropriate will visit her in jail. Some Tory MPs are aghast at his handling of the issue and claim his remarks have made Zaghari Ratcliffe a much more precious bargaining commodity for Tehran."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
