The Wesfarmers chairman, Michael Chaney, is being accompanied on store visits by Archie Norman, the retail turnaround expert who chairs Marks &amp; Spencer and advises the Australian group. In February, Wesfarmers said it was considering quitting the UK after losses spiralled at Homebase which has more than 200 stores and 12,000 staff. Customers had dwindled after the new owners stripped out home furnishings ranges and turned some stores into outposts of Bunnings, its successful DIY brand in Australia. Perth-based Wesfarmers bought Homebase for £340m two years ago but the botched takeover saw the unravelling retailer lose close to £100m in the last six months of 2017. The Australian firm had intended to spend £500m over several years to turn Homebase into a British version of Bunnings, which is famous for low prices and “sausage sizzles”. The Wesfarmers chief executive, Rob Scott, told investors in February that “all options are open” as it wrote off A$1bn (£547m) in the deal. “There’s value in this network and we want to make sure that we reduce the trading losses and hopefully put the business on to a path to profitability,” said Scott. Norman is said to have counselled Wesfarmers against buying Homebase, arguing it would not be a transformational deal for what is one of Australia’s biggest companies. Homebase would be hard to integrate with the existing Bunnings chain, which has larger stores and a different product range, he argued. Wesfarmers is now said to be working with investment bankers at Lazard to review options for Homebase. Norman, who also chairs Lazard’s London operation, declined to comment. Wesfarmers is saddled with Homebase’s £1bn rent bill over the length of its leases and has already said it could close up to 40 of the worst-performing stores. A handful of disposals have taken place so far. A new management team, led by former B&amp;Q executive Damian McGloughlin, has set about rejigging its product range to once again appeal to British shoppers. It has dropped the “lowest prices are just the beginning” advertising strapline and introduced “your home improvement and garden centre”. Given the tough choices faced by Wesfarmers, private equity firms, including Hilco, Endless and Lion Capital, are said to be circling the business. Another name being linked to a possible deal is the discount chain B&amp;M. It is unclear whether any bid would be for the whole of Homebase or, in B&amp;M’s case, a parcel of stores. Homebase’s troubles have added to the gloom engulfing the British high street following a spate of restructuring and refinancing deals. In recent weeks, fashion chain New Look has used a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to close 60 stores and renegotiate rents. Flooring retailer Carpetright is exploring a similar restructuring strategy that could lead to the closure of up to a quarter of its stores, while Mothercare is rumoured to be considering a CVA to speed up the closure of about a third of its 143 stores. The baby goods specialist is already locked in talks with lenders that are expected to conclude by the end of next month. It is also seeking additional financing to fund its improvement plans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/07/harold-prince-theatre-musicals-interview-at-90","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T12:41:04Z","webTitle":"Hal Prince at 90: ‘Musicals should\r\nbe dangerous’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/07/harold-prince-theatre-musicals-interview-at-90","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/07/harold-prince-theatre-musicals-interview-at-90","fields":{"headline":"Hal Prince at 90: ‘Musicals should\r\nbe dangerous’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"He is the renowned American producer-director who staged some of the most famous musicals of the 20th century, including West Side Story, Cabaret and Fiddler on the Roof, winning more Tony awards than anyone else. Now, at the age of 90, Harold “Hal” Prince is embarking on two more musicals. One is inspired by an award-winning documentary, How to Dance in Ohio, about a group of autistic children who find a way to realise their potential. The other, set in the 19th century, explores the roles and responsibilities of men and women – “an old-fashioned musical done in a new-fashioned way”, he says. “A very contemporary subject, and we’re trying to have a lot of fun with it.” The roll-call of celebrated names with whom Prince has collaborated is extraordinary: “I did the first musical with Kander and Ebb, who wrote Cabaret, the first musical with Bock and Harnick, who wrote Fiddler on the Roof, and Steve Sondheim wrote the lyrics for West Side Story, so I’ve had great good fortune working with people who were very fresh.” In Prince’s recent memoir, Sense of Occasion, he recalls picking up West Side Story after Sondheim told him that they had lost their producer and there was “absolutely no interest from anyone on Broadway in doing a show about gang warfare in Hell’s Kitchen”. Prince jumped at the chance: “Sondheim and Bernstein played the score, and soon I was singing along with them.” On Jerome Robbins’s direction of West Side Story, Prince says: “During the rehearsal period of West Side, he related the cast thoroughly to their gangs. Half were Jets and half were Sharks. They travelled in packs away from the theatre. They were young and inexperienced, and identification improved their acting.” Though he continues to work in the business, Prince has reservations about the world of the modern musical, where the stars sell the show, rather than the show creating the stars. An exception, he points out, was Hamilton, which wowed audiences and produced hits without relying on the household names beloved of investors. The groundbreaking productions of the 70s and 80s, he says, were made possible by dozens of investors but could not be staged today because investors are no longer prepared to take risks. They now prefer to follow the template of previous hits, which can lead to pale imitations rather than “extending the danger and vision of theatre”. The problem is that costs have spiralled. In 1971, Prince staged Follies, a smash hit, for nearly $800,000, then the most expensive musical ever produced, he says. Today it would cost up to $20m, as $800,000 covers little more than “a one-set play with two characters”. The financial risks of backing such productions are stifling artistic risks. “There’s a temptation to copycat, but I don’t think it’s good for the future of the artform.” Classic productions such as Follies were “audacious” and “never designed to be primarily a commercial success”, he says. “Producers today are influenced by what they think audiences want, which is frequently ‘the same old thing’. That’s really what’s happened. “Audiences are better than that. They’re quite willing to go where they’ve never been before. But producers are not willing to take them there. That’s because of the cost. It becomes too much of a business and too little of an artform. We are deluged with limited-engagement productions, usually revivals, featuring huge stars. They guarantee paying back their investments but with limited profit potential. And revivals, though important historically, are not new work. They do not represent the now or the future of the theatre.” Back in the day, Prince’s investors took the original gamble of putting unlikely shows on Broadway that ended up making history. “We had a record of three successes before West Side Story, and our investors were willing to go with us. The same applied to Fiddler. Four or five successes later, we had such a good run of luck that my investors never asked any questions, never read a script, never wanted a read-through.” A last piece of advice from the Prince of Broadway? Theatre producers should not compete with cinema through special effects: “We’ve just had 31 years in London and 30 years on Broadway with Phantom [of the Opera]. It’s a very minimalist theatrical experience with no projections and no fancy technology. It’s just a hell of a good story using what theatre is best at – inviting the audience to create right along with the creators.” Ultimately, says Prince, live performance is about sparking imaginations: “That’s what’s exciting.” Winner of more Tony awards than anyone else, Hal Prince (pictured winning for Show Boat in 1995) has worked with the theatre greats, including Kander and Ebb, who wrote Cabaret, Bock and Harnick, writers of Fiddler on the Roof, and Stephen Sondheim, who wrote lyrics for West Side Story. In 1971 Prince staged Follies. At a cost of $800,000, it was then the most expensive musical ever produced. He is responsible for numerous stage hits, including Cabaret (which he produced and directed in 1966), Evita (director, 1979) and The Phantom of the Opera (director, 1986). Prince won a special Tony for lifetime achievement in theatre in 2006."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/06/brighton-huddersfield-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T15:40:30Z","webTitle":"Brighton & Hove Albion v Huddersfield Town: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/06/brighton-huddersfield-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/06/brighton-huddersfield-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Brighton & Hove Albion v Huddersfield Town: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"After appearing virtually safe after beating Arsenal, successive defeats have restored the element of doubt to Brighton.

That a foreign leader broke off from allegedly fiddling his election to publicly say so might be regarded as brass neck of the worst order – but accuracy matters. The one does not excuse the other. It was entirely right that the comment was withdrawn, and the MasterChef judge Gregg Wallace going on telly to clarify what he meant about the rendang sauce/chicken skin interaction belatedly went some way to de-escalating the diplomatic fallout with, among others, the Malaysian prime minister. I know what you’re thinking: how many dodgy foreign leaders are going to accuse the Brits of substance-related disinformation this year? Are these things cheaper in bulk? All I can tell you is that, while artisan greengrocer Gregg Wallace has vaguely conceded his cock-up, artisan foreign secretary Boris Johnson is still trying to style his out in the face of having needlessly handed Russia a propaganda coup. Having previously said that “the guy” at Porton Down had told him there was “no doubt” the novichok nerve agent used in the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, was made in Russia, the Foreign Office has had to offer a more nuanced version of the evidential trail. Clearly, Boris’s needless overstatement was a gift to troll tsar Putin, whose known modus operandi is to encourage and seed multiple doubts and conspiracy theories about any Russia-related misdeeds until the factual environment is more toxically polluted than one of the reactor ghost towns the Soviets forgot to admit to. Meanwhile, the Russian ambassador to the UN was channelling former KGB bleeding-heart Putin directly on Thursday, when he posed a plangent inquiry about the Skripal pets. “What happened to these animals? Why doesn’t anyone mention them?” he mentioned, stopping just shy of demanding Ace Ventura be seconded to the OPCW investigation. What happened, alas, has just emerged. The two guinea pigs were not victims of novichok, which would have made them a guesstimated 350,001st and 350,002nd of their species to succumb to a nerve agent, though probably the first pair in a domestic setting. Instead, the poor things were killed by thirst, having been sealed inside the Skripals’ house by investigators. The cat was in such a distressed state when a vet eventually gained entry that it was euthanised, reportedly at Porton Down. This is some way from a typical case of animal neglect, though for many of Britain’s 5 million armchair Hans Blixes, the pets’ fate will be inexcusable. It should certainly be more than enough for Labour’s Chris Williamson to take his Lord Hawski-Hawski act on Russian TV again. Don’t worry if you missed the Derby North MP’s sombre-suited explanation that the Skripal story was the British government’s “way of diverting attention from their own difficulties over Brexit and economic policy”. It’ll be played on a grateful loop across Russian state media for days – as a way of diverting attention from their own difficulties, funnily enough. Idiots gonna idiot. It’s just a shame that foreign secretaries won’t foreign secretary. You hear a lot about post-truth these days, but with each new sack-resistant balls-up, Boris Johnson moves closer to the category of post-shame. He’s a sort of market knock-off of Prince Philip – Le Shark Sportif of not really giving a toss. The foreign secretary who feels less shame and takes less grownup responsibility for himself than Gregg Wallace. Gregg Wallace! I mean, Gregg is the guy who “couldn’t get to the bottom” of one of his former wives’ claim that he was “needy”. “I find it all weird,” he mused. “I mean, she came up to the flat in London last week to change my sheets.” Once again it will be up to Theresa May and various Swat mandarins to change Boris’s bed after the latest shitting thereof. Obviously it would stay classified for decades, but perhaps Whitehall might undertake a time-and-motion study to evaluate precisely how much Foreign Office time is spent dealing with cock-ups by the foreign secretary. It is difficult to think of anyone more loftily dismissive of the central demands of their role, certainly since Hristo Stoichkov got the Celta Vigo job and used his unveiling to announce: “I do not believe in tactics.” His tenure … did not go well. It’s remarkable, incidentally, how often the foreign secretary is undone by language. For a man who wears his vast vocabulary so heavily, Boris struggles for lexical precision when it actually matters. He can lavish who knows how much time coming up with the mot juste for Jeremy Corbyn – “mugwump” – and then produce it like he’s James effing Joyce in every news interview for a 24-hour period. But he can’t expend quite so much care when discussing the evidential basis for the deployment of a nerve agent in an attempted assassination on UK soil. But on he goes. The Kremlin has duly picked up his slopfest and run with it – yet as Britain’s most shameless cynic, Boris hopes “the world will see through this shameless cynicism”. Oh dear. All we need now is Michael Gove to tell Britain to have some respect for the experts and we’ve got the full set. We are living through a political reboot of The Sorcerer’s Apprentice. Politicians who stoked distrust of expertise are now desperate for people to take the official word for things. The “ultra-patriotic” provisional wing of the leave campaign openly backs the Kremlin over the British government. And a whole lot of senior continuity remainers who are bemoaning it all have conveniently forgotten their own role in the intelligence misrepresentation that led up to Britain’s involvement in the Iraq war. It’s as if two generations of political chickens have come home to roost at once, and no one in charge knows what to do with them all. Rendang, perhaps. But are they even trusted to know how? • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/06/david-lammy-kids-are-getting-killed-where-is-the-prime-minister-where-is-sadiq-khan","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T16:25:20Z","webTitle":"David Lammy: ‘Kids are getting killed.

Where is the prime minister? Where is Sadiq Khan?’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"David Lammy is one of those politicians whose public profile has never correlated with his position in his party, or converted into frontbench power, and this sort of maverick celebrity operator tends to attract suspicion. Elected to represent Tottenham 18 years ago, the 46-year-old has at various key moments – the Grenfell fire, the London riots – distinguished himself in the public’s affection by seizing individual ownership of the agenda. To some, particularly in Westminster, this highly personalised brand of political identity is opportunistic self-promotion, artfully disguised as heroism. To me, his politics look sincere and principled, I’ve just never been entirely sure what they are. He used to joke: “I’m not Blair, I’m not Brown, I’m just black.” And he has successfully eluded all association with any ideological faction with such dexterity that he can sometimes look a bit slippery, as if his public persona is contingent on whatever strategy he has devised to please his audience. We meet in the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham on Thursday, to discuss the violent crime surge that has cost 51 lives in London this year. More than half of the victims have been young – in their 20s and younger – and poor. I am not expecting much more than for Lammy to offer carefully calibrated, bland reassurances. It takes less than five minutes to see how wrong I am. Lammy woke up on Tuesday to a text informing him that Tanesha Melbourne-Blake, a 17-year-old girl, had been gunned down in a drive-by shooting in his constituency. This time, he decided, he would not let the murder go unnoticed. “To be honest,” he says, “I was shocked that four weeks ago, when a moped and pillion passenger gunned down a young man standing outside the cinema in Wood Green, that there was not more national attention on that shooting.” How does he explain the apparent indifference? “Because he was black.” He delivers this with such force, his words ring out across the cafe. “Because he was black,” he repeats. “And I think we’ve got to ask ourselves, do black lives matter?” For the next hour, Lammy barely draws breath. Only twice does he pause to consider the impact of what he is about to say. Even in private, I have never heard a politician hold forth with such utter disregard for his or her audience. The first thing Lammy wants us to understand is the blameless ease with which a child who goes home to an empty council estate flat because his mum can’t afford childcare while she’s at work, can become a gang member. All it takes is a gift of new trainers, he says, for which in return the child is soon asked to carry a little package round the corner, and before long, the 12-year-old is earning more in one week than his parents make in a year. The white middle-class market for cocaine is booming, Lammy says, citing reports by Interpol and Europol, and he has seen for himself how easy it is to service because dealers in Tottenham have shown him. “People are ordering drugs on WhatsApp, Snapchat. It’s easy.” One young constituent was caught selling cocaine in Aberdeen: dealers in London now operate what are known as “county lines”, supplying cocaine to every region of the country. Do middle-class customers safe in neighbourhoods far away from Tottenham’s turf wars have blood on their hands? For a moment he pauses. “I think they have got to make the connection between their drug use and what is happening with that drug. But actually,” he goes on impatiently, “there are much bigger questions. It’s bigger than just making people feel guilty. There are big public policy questions about what to do about this, but there is no major public discourse about what we’re going to do. Most people think the war on drugs has not worked – but nothing has replaced it. There is some debate about decriminalisation, particularly of marijuana, and it is happening in some parts of the world, but it’s not reached our shores yet. This is not currently being discussed in the mainstream.” Surely, then, I say, this is the time for the political courage to stand up and admit the “war on drugs” has failed? Far from protecting us, our drug laws have delivered an £11bn cocaine industry into the hands of teenagers, putting all of us in danger. “Yes,” he agrees. “Yes. I think it is.” The heavy flatness of his tone suggests he finds no pleasure in concluding that prohibition has been a terrible mistake. Does culpability therefore rest, ultimately, with the legislators responsible for passing and perpetuating those laws? “Yes. That’s right. I think that is basically right.” Looking suddenly anxious, he adds: “Look, all I’m saying is that there is no debate at all going on in this country about it.” He could start one himself, I suggest. A Christian ex-barrister, born to inner-city, working-class Guyanese immigrants, his credibility confers an authority that spans council estates and the Commons, and makes him an ideal candidate to introduce a radical rethink. I’m not expecting the suggestion to fly him into a rage, so am a bit taken aback when his arms begin to swoop like an angry swan and his voice rises to a shout. “Look, why have I got to start everything? No, I mean it. Why have I got to fucking start everything?” He is furious. “You know, I’m here in this constituency, it’s bloody tough. Why is there a political vacuum? Where is the prime minister? Where is the home secretary? Where is Sadiq Khan? There’s a riot, everyone’s on holiday? David? Kids get killed? David? “So I have to start every debate. I have to be in every discussion. It’s very frustrating. I want other people to step up to leadership. I can’t do this all on my own. Quite rightly, folk on the street are pretty pissed off, they’re really frustrated with politicians, they want action. I hear: ‘David, can you do this? ‘David, can you do that?’ I’m trying, but I can’t.” He sighs. “I find it slightly odd that I am asked to be the urban guru. I haven’t got a budget. I’m a legislator, but it’s hard to legislate when my party’s out of power. I can convene and knock heads together, I have some influence and can speak to the media. So I’m doing what I can do. But I have no pocket of cash.” Earlier that morning, Lammy, had broadcast his bewilderment on Radio 4’s Today programme that neither the home secretary nor the mayor had taken the trouble to phone him, when four of his constituents had been murdered. Unsurprisingly, both offices get in touch before the end of the day, but why it took them so long perplexes Lammy. “Sadiq and I have a good relationship,” he says, but the only reason he can think of to explain why Khan didn’t call is also his greatest fear: “I think it’s that we’ve come to normalise it. We think of gun and knife crime among teenagers as normal. And it is not.” To Lammy, the rise in London murders feels ominously different to previous surges of violence. “I am more worried about this spike because the profile of the people getting caught up in it is younger. The callousness of shooting into a crowd outside a cinema, shooting at young women, the normalisation – never mind the ramping up by social media – all of that makes me alarmed and worried. I am pretty confident that we’re not going to get over this problem unless there is a proper political consensus. This is not going to self-correct.” What does Lammy say to people who hold inadequate or dysfunctional parents entirely to blame? His face screws up in disgust. “If any of my children picked up a knife or a gun, I would be horrified. I would feel I had failed. But you know, I’ve got resources and means to pay for stuff when my wife and I are at work, and to keep my kids busy. The middle classes use boarding schools and all sorts of clubs, and can bus their kids from X to Y. They have got cars. Their children aren’t having to navigate spaces on their own. So I’m just saying, of course it comes back to parents and moral choices. Of course it takes Mum and Dad, but it also takes a village. And it has to take you paying your taxes to – ”. He falters, on the verge of breaking down. “I’m getting emotional because I am tired,” he says, but looks wholly unembarrassed. “It has to take you paying your taxes to pay for youth services, to pay for support for the more vulnerable in society. There is no way you can expect that single mother to do it all on her own.” If he had to identify the single biggest cause of the violence, would it be austerity? Six seconds of silence fall, before he replies unhappily: “I don’t want to be the cliched Labour politician who says that it is all down to cuts. I really don’t want to be that. But I think we have to be clear: neighbourhood policing has vanished. It’s gone. Then if you also take out 40% from the local authority and you cut youth services, you do effectively leave communities to their own devices.” Does he agree with Met police commissioner Cressida Dick that social media also plays a major part? “I think it’s a big influence,” he nods. “Some of this comes back to pride, ego, respect. I see the way in which slights turn into: ‘I’m going to go and kill you.’ But the truth is,” he adds, that “we are living in a world in which presidents of countries are living in this way. Why do we think that’s not going to affect young people, who are vulnerable and suggestible, to take that to a different conclusion? That’s what’s going on, yes.” I’m puzzled by Lammy’s failure, under four successive Labour leaders, to secure his position on the frontbenches, so ask if he can explain it. With a pointed stare, “No,” he says flatly. “Go and ask the white men who run my party. That’s all I’m going to say.” I say that sounds like an eloquent answer. “Go and ask them. Go and ask them,” he says testily. “Don’t come to me and ask me why I haven’t been chosen. Ask them about who they’ve chosen.” Lammy nominated Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership election, so I ask if this was because he wanted Corbyn to become leader. “No. I nominated him because I’m his friend.” Why he isn’t a key player in Corbyn’s inner circle seems confusing, but when I say this, he looks cross. “You know what? You know what? I’m so bored of tribal politics. That’s part of the problem.” His voice rising, he repeats: “I’m so bored of it. I’m not a tribalist. That’s not what turns me on. So if I don’t present sufficiently as part of the clique, then so be it. I am very happy influencing change in the way I’m influencing change. I have long given up crawling up political backsides in order to float to the top.” We’re winding up, about to say goodbye, when I remember one last question. Lammy tweeted a eulogy of unequivocal praise for Winnie Mandela, after her death this week, and I wondered – in view of the violence in Tottenham – if he was at all worried that it might be read as a tacit message that violence is a forgivable, perhaps even legitimate, response to racial oppression. He stares at me in silence for around eight seconds, and his eyes begin to redden and well. “I tweeted about Winnie Mandela,” he begins, his voice cracking, “because I remember being 13 or 14, growing up in this constituency” – the voice falters again – “with Margaret Thatcher doing deals with Botha, and not pursuing sanctions. Riots, Nelson Mandela in prison.” Tears begin streaming down his cheeks. “And she was our hero.” He pauses to steady his voice. “No one is perfect, and I have not had to put up with the humiliations, the tortures, the nightmare of your husband being in prison for 27 years. She has died, and I know enough South Africans to know that for them, Winnie Mandela is a hero. And I stand with them. “I’m not going to be cowed by the rampant racism, the organised racism, that comes from parts of the alt-right.” His voice rises as his anger swells. “That seeks to put down every single tweet I make. I’m standing with Winnie. And I don’t give a damn. It’s as simple as that. I’m not running in the opposite direction. That’s why I tweeted. This is where I’m from.” He bangs the table. “I grew up just a few roads away. This is where I’m from. I speak for the people I represent. And we are proud of Winnie Mandela – faults and all. We look around at our national politicians, we do not see national politicians who are without fault.

Chinese officials said on Friday they would “definitely fight back firmly” should the US persist in using “protectionism”, in a warning issued hours after President Trump unexpectedly suggested imposing extra trade tariffs on goods shipped from China to the US – on top of the $50bn worth of tariffs announced last month. On Saturday, China’s state media warned that US protectionism would end in defeat and that the only option now was to hit America so hard it would “remember the pain”. “If the US says that it will pay any price, it must be firmly attacked,” China’s official Xinhua news agency said. Wall Street slumped again on Friday following a week of rising tensions between the two countries that has rattled financial markets and raised the prospect of disruption to world trade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 572 points at the close – a drop of 2.3% – in New York, as investors reacted to renewed hostilities and disappointing US jobs figures. Trump also hit out at the World Trade Organisation as he responded to China opening a challenge against the tariff plans at the WTO. Trump tweeted that China gets “tremendous perks and advantages” at the World Trade Organisation because it is considered a developing nation. “Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to US,” he said. Speaking to reporters at the White House, press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed concerns about a possible trade war. “The United States is responding to Chinese actions that have gone on for decades,” she said. “The Chinese have engaged in unfair and illegal trade practices for many years and this is simply a response to that.” Sanders also brushed off concerns about the falling stock market, insisting “the actions of the president have strengthen our economy” and pointing to his legislation to lower taxes. Although hope remains for averting a full-blown trade war, analysts at Oxford Economics said failure to avoid a clash would trigger a “pronounced” slowdown for the world economy by knocking 0.5% off worldwide growth. The British consultancy said under that scenario GDP would increase by about 2.5% next year instead of the previously forecast rate of 3%. That would equate to as much as $617bn being lost from world economic growth. For the world’s two largest economies, the price tag would be around 1% of GDP growth, said Oxford Economics, worth about $154bn to the US and $132bn to China. Late on Thursday, Trump instructed the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the agency responsible for developing and recommending trade policy, to consider imposing an extra $100bn of import tariffs on Chinese goods arriving in the US. They would come on top of $50bn that have already been announced. Should they come to pass, the cumulative effect would be to impose heavy taxes on almost a third of total US imports from the Asian country. Meanwhile, if China was to put forward a like-for-like response, the price tag would be as much as 0.3% in lost economic growth for both countries as a consequence. Such an escalation in the tit-for-tat dispute would significantly raise the stakes from a more manageable 0.1% hit to GDP for both countries forecast by some economists. According to UBS, the initial list of tariffs put forward by the Trump White House on more than 1,300 goods would have a near-negligible effect on US inflation. Although certain sectors would be affected, the aggregate impact for the country as a whole would be small. About a fifth of the goods on the $50bn list, which ranges from televisions to guns and ammunition, have minimal trade values. Meanwhile, more important goods such as mobile phones and toys were omitted from the list. Both countries have so far shown no inclination of backing down, with each ratcheting up the pressure on the other to respond. After the US unveiled details of its initial $50bn of tariffs, China responded by saying it would impose levies worth the same amount, albeit covering fewer goods of higher value – such as soyabeans and aircraft. Trump labelled the response from Beijing as an “unfair retaliation” at a time when the US has had problems with China allegedly stealing the intellectual property of American companies looking to do business there. But if China did try to match the president’s latest threats for as much as $150bn in tariffs on Chinese goods, it would need to cover more than the total value of US exports to the country. Other options could be for Beijing to halt the purchase of US bonds, or a move to disrupt supply chains essential for US firms, according to analysts. Mark Cliffe of ING Bank said: “The signal is clear: China will not be pushed into concessions, and is willing to accept some economic pain in what Beijing may ultimately see as a political dispute.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/21/hair-cutting-learned-skill","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"Any idiot can learn to braid hair – cutting it is a skill | Bim Adewunmi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/21/hair-cutting-learned-skill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/21/hair-cutting-learned-skill","fields":{"headline":"Any idiot can learn to braid hair – cutting it is a skill","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I have always been an astute assessor of my skills.

Telling banks and insurers they would need to provide more information about the risks they might face from climate change, Mark Carney said failure to do so would have damaging effects for financial stability. He said the finance industry could be forced into making rapid adjustments if they did not gradually expose where their climate change risks might lie, which he said could trigger steep losses. The governor warned of a “climate Minsky moment”, referring to the work of the economist Hyman Minsky, whose analysis was used to show how banks overreached themselves before the 2008 financial crisis. “Given the uncertainties around climate, not everyone will agree on the timing or scale of the adjustments required … [but] the right information allows sceptics and evangelists alike to back their convictions with their capital,” Carney said. Speaking at a summit of central bank governors in Amsterdam, Carney said there were growing opportunities for firms to finance the transition to a low carbon economy. He said new technology investments and long-term infrastructure projects would need to be financed at roughly quadruple the current rate. His intervention comes as Threadneedle Street ramps up its assessment of how well insurers are identifying, measuring and mitigating weather-related risks this year.

But that is what is on offer this month when Shearsmith presents his favourite silent film to an audience in a Birmingham town hall, before a much-anticipated League of Gentlemen reunion tour of Britain in August and September. Häxan, or The Witch, is a Swedish chiller from 1922. Its grainy images have fed Shearsmith’s nightmares since he saw it as a teenager late one night at home. “I must have watched it on telly at around 13,” he said. “It is genuinely unsettling and startling because the effects are really good.” Shearsmith, 48, has just returned from starring on Broadway in Martin McDonagh’s hit play Hangmen, and he will narrate a live translation of Häxan on 17 April when it is screened as part of Birmingham’s Flatpack Festival of Film. “It is written and directed by Benjamin Christensen, and the first 15 minutes are quite a convincing filmed lecture. Then we travel back to the 14th century and suddenly you are in this extraordinary reproduction of a witch’s hovel, with these two old ladies who are making a potion to try to seduce a monk in a nearby monastery,” said Shearsmith. “There are little sketches with the witch in action and it culminates in a meeting with the devil, played by Christensen himself.” A contemporary Danish review denounced “the satanic perverted cruelty that blazes out of it; the cruelty we all know stalks the ages like an evil, shaggy beast. The chimera of mankind.” Strong stuff perhaps, but meat and drink to the man who played League of Gentlemen grotesque villain Papa Lazarou. It is Shearsmith’s love of creating a crawling sense of dread that is also fuelling his writing sessions with Steve Pemberton as they prepare for the League of Gentlemen tour, nearly 20 years after the first series. It will take them, along with fellow League members Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson, to the O2 (“It’s like we are the Who!”). Shearsmith’s first memory of Häxan is now mixed with his general affection for Halloween as a child, growing up in Kingston upon Hull. The arrival of the annual fair in early October, he remembers, stoked up the excitement. “I went along with my mum and dad and there were these creepy old ghost trains from the 50s. There was even a whiff of Christmas to come as well, because there would be a Santa with a collecting bucket.” He now relishes, he admits, the way Halloween has become a bigger British festival. “Mark wouldn’t like it, I expect. He’d think it too Americanised. But I watch Häxan every year at Halloween and try to keep the spirit alive all year round.” Shearsmith’s “obsession” with witches was also sparked by his boyhood collection of books about horror. “They often had that famous woodcut of the witchfinder Matthew Hopkins, with the speech bubbles coming out of the demons. It always fascinated me. You can find evil peeping out of anywhere. Out of a cat or an owl, or a misplaced dog walking in at the wrong time.” The second series of BBC Two’s Inside No 9, co-written by Shearsmith, featured one episode, starring David Warner, that closely reflected his interest in the “absurdity and the cruelty of the witch trials”. “It was very much in keeping with Häxan. Steve is not as obsessed with witches as I am, but he was happy to go along with it for once.” The audience for Häxan will be treated to moments of humour as well as horror, Shearsmith promises. “There are some funny moments. I will do a wry take on the way the translation comes across.” Yet his real appreciation of Christensen runs deep. “Häxan has everything. It feels authentically old, it has the devil himself and there is also talk of Dante’s hell at the beginning, with a strange old machine that shows flames burning away and people with pitchforks or being boiled in oil. The professorial tone slightly blindsides you for the real witches and demons to come.” Shearsmith picks out an alarming torture sequence in which an innocent old woman accused of witchcraft starts to “shop all her friends”. “So from one witch, they suddenly have an epidemic.” The best horror films, the actor argues, surprise you. “Don’t Look Now, for example, you would not even deem as horror,” he says, referring to Nicolas Roeg’s 1973 thriller. “It is a study in grief, and the ending is so shocking. If it is about something real, then horror will stay with you. The episodes of Inside No 9 that people really seem to remember are the ones that tap into an unexpected emotion, like The 12 Days of Christine with Sheridan Smith.” Shearsmith and Pemberton write the blackly comedic Inside No 9 – now commissioned for a rare fifth series – after long conversations about “the most judicious way of telling a story in the least amount of scenes”. Shearsmith says he thinks of himself as one half of a writing team. “It is a means to an end for me. I don’t want to write for other people. We are both fans of our own thing.” And what is that thing? A series of “disposable little black jokes”, according to Shearsmith, although he also hopes the episodes stand up to repeat viewing. “They are each crafted because we want to make telly that makes you sit up and be attentive. I know people don’t always want comedy to do that. But you can’t let ours just wash over you. We have set the bar high because we care, and that makes it hard to keep doing it. Especially as we are hyper-aware of the danger of repeating ourselves.” In spite of enjoying chances to act in straight dramas, Reece Shearsmith confesses that, rather like Häxan’s creator, he finds telling his own grim stories the most fun. “To be honest, it is never better than when we are doing our own thing,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2018/apr/09/our-territory-our-life-struggle-mining-ecuador","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T15:20:46Z","webTitle":"‘Our territory is our life’: one struggle against mining in Ecuador","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2018/apr/09/our-territory-our-life-struggle-mining-ecuador","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2018/apr/09/our-territory-our-life-struggle-mining-ecuador","fields":{"headline":"‘Our territory is our life’: one struggle against mining in Ecuador","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three A’I Cofan men were staring down at a pit of rocks, dead foliage and filthy water where two gold-panners were working. Beyond was a sluice and hoses running down to the rushing, green waters of the River Aguarico. To the right, there was mud, more rocks, more equipment, a makeshift tent and camp. Behind, to the left, a Hyundai excavator and a track running downriver. No more than two weeks before, no track had existed and all this had been primary forest. Now that was gone. Only an area about 110 x 50 metres, you might say, but this is how gold rushes start. Down below, several other A’I Cofan men - most wearing tunics, kerchiefs and life-jackets after a rocky canoe ride - were standing with one of the miners. He said his name was “Joselito” and he wore a yellow hardhat and pique shirt suggesting he was from the nearest village, Puerto Libre. Minutes before, the miners had been pumping water through the sluice and the excavator had been filling in the pit, but all that stopped with the arrival of the A’I Cofan - most immediately concerned if the miners were using mercury and the potentially catastrophic impacts on their village, Sinangoe, less than an hour downriver. Joselito told the Guardian and others standing there that wasn’t the case. No mercury. “Eight years in prison [if you do that],” he said at least twice. The new mining site is in a concession awarded to one Celso Amable Ureno Quezada in January 2018, according to the Ministry of Mines, in Sucumbíos province in a stunning part of the Ecuadorian Amazon. Joselito claimed it was his first day working there and he didn’t know who the concession belonged to, although he identified one of the others, a woman he called Alejandra Cortes, as the “boss.” Asked if the concession had obtained its licence from the Ministry of Environment, as is required by Ecuadorian law, Joselito almost laughed and said he didn’t know anything about that. The miners had been spotted and filmed by drone the previous day, but Sinangoe’s president, Mario Criollo, had been warned they might soon be there when earlier in the week he had visited operations on a large beach slightly downriver, purportedly within the same concession. Accompanied by representatives from the Defensoría del Pueblo and government water agency SENAGUA, Criollo saw the same excavator and noticed a track recently cleared through the forest along the riverbank. According to Criollo, he had been told the plan is for the track - or rather, a road - to run all the way up to the northernmost tip of the concession towards the confluence of the River Cofanes and River Chingual, where form the River Aguarico. Prior to that, in late February, Criollo had visited the same beach with a representative of the Sucumbíos province’s public prosecutors’ office, environmental police, other A’I Cofan and two NGOs supporting Sinangoe: the indigenous-run Alianza Ceibo, based in Sucumbíos, and the international Amazon Frontlines. The prosecutors’ office had been informed that allegedly the miners were operating illegally, without a licence, just outside the concession, and impacting the Cayambe Coca National Park. No arrests were made. Criollo is shocked at how quickly the miners are moving. “We did a reccy two months ago and there was nothing like this there then,” he told the Guardian. “In two months they’ve made major advances. Maybe in four years they’d clear the entire riverbank. We don’t want it to get to that. That’s why we’re monitoring what’s happening.” Criollo seems most concerned about the potential impacts on the River Aguarico. A major tributary of the River Napo, which in turn is a major tributary of the River Amazon, it is a crucial source of water for the A’I Cofan in Sinangoe - not to mention 1000s of other people even further downriver. Another concern is the colonisation that a concession and road might encourage, making it easier for miners and others to cross to the other side of the river to the national park and Sinangoe’s own land. Criollo emphasises that his community doesn’t want to take control of the concession area, although he acknowledges that it is considered to be ancestral Cofan territory. Sinangoe already has an agreement dating from 1998 to use 13,700 hectares within the park - but no legal title - and in total it claims land rights over more than 55,000 hectares stretching westwards. “Our interest in [the concession upriver from Sinangoe] isn’t about obtaining more land,” Criollo says. “It’s not that we want to cut that forest down ourselves, or mine for gold, or exploit oil. It’s just that we don’t want the water to be contaminated.” Concern about the water is echoed by Nixon Narvaez, a 20 year old A’I Cofan man receiving communications training from the Alianza Ceibo who photographed the recent visit to the new site. He calls what they found “a little horrific”, saying the riverbank is “literally” being destroyed and the river risks being contaminated. “We live along the banks of the river,” Narvaez told the Guardian. “It is fundamental to our lives. We drink the water, we bathe in it, we fish. Maybe the fish are being contaminated and our health will be endangered. It’d be better if the concession was cancelled.” Similar concerns are expressed by Alex Lucitante, an A’I Cofan man with the Alianza Ceibo. “The River Aguarico is a source of life,” he told the Guardian. “As indigenous peoples, we rely on it for our families’ subsistence. It has already been difficult enough following the contamination caused by oil companies [downriver], which was never cleaned up. But now, with this mining, it would be a kind of double hit - a very serious risk.” Back in Sinangoe, on the day the A’I Cofan returned from the new mining site, a Ministry of Environment park guard and two scientists paid a surprise visit to discuss a proposed “conservation corridor” in the region. According to a map given to Criollo, this would stretch across a huge swathe of northern Ecuador from the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve to the Cofan Bermejo Ecological Reserve on the border with Colombia, and would include the north of Sinangoe and the national park. Neither scientist said he was previously aware of the mining concession or operations upriver. Milton Tirado, a botanist, told the Guardian he had been contracted by Spanish company INYPSA to develop the corridor proposal for the Ministry of Environment, but is financed by the German government bank KfW. He says he is “totally” concerned because “the mining would affect our project’s objectives to establish conservation corridors.” The concession upriver from Sinangoe, named Puerto Libre, is actually just one of four concessions bordering the community and national park that have been awarded in recent months - two in January, one in December 2017, one in August 2017. In addition, there are another six concessions along the River Chingual. While the A’I Cofan are already extremely concerned about Puerto Libre, the potential cumulative impacts of all 10 concessions are unimaginable. According to Alex Lucitante, the A’I Cofan federation Nacionalidad Originaria A’I Kofan del Ecuador (NOA’IKE) is “extremely concerned” about the concessions. He told the Guardian that some of them run for up to 25 years and they will impact not only Sinangoe but other parts of A’I Cofan ancestral territory, as well as other indigenous peoples downriver. “I’m not just speaking as an A’I Cofan leader, but thinking of the other indigenous nationalities living along the Aguarico,” he says. These newest concessions bordering Sinangoe have appeared despite recent pledges by Ecuador’s president Lenín Moreno that no new mining concessions would be awarded. In December 2017 he was reported to have told indigenous federation CONAIE and other indigenous leaders after 1,000s of people marched to the capital Quito that there would be “no more mining concessions in Ecuador”, and then in February he was reported to make similar comments during a visit to the Morona Santiago province. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), he said that mining had “severely” contaminated the country’s rivers, that he had previously promised “not one concession more”, that the government had backtracked on awarding 2,000 new concessions, that some new concessions had been awarded anyway, and that he had asked the Minister of Mines to resign. “I had to, unfortunately, tell the Minister that my promise must be met and [therefore] he had to go home,” AFP quoted Moreno saying. The new concessions upriver from Sinangoe - large-scale, supposedly legal, but possibly involving mercury - have come after years of small-scale, illegal miners and others invading the community, and within less than a year of the A’I Cofan initiating a series of concerted efforts to repel them. The first of these efforts has been to conduct systematic monitoring with mapping and GPS, drones, camera traps - three of which have since been stolen - and conventional film and photography. The results of the monitoring have been startling, although not particularly surprising: dozens of miners using sluices, dredges and other equipment entering Sinangoe, along with hunters, loggers and fishermen. Some fishermen have used dynamite, while others have half-dammed one river to stun fish with a toxic plant known as barbasco. At least six shot-gun traps have been found - intended for peccary and other wild game but equally fatal if one of the A’I Cofan walked into them - and on at least four occasions metal cables have been found strung across the river. Who are the miners? Criollo and others say some are “colonos” from Puerto Libre, some from elsewhere in Ecuador, others Colombians. Some people from the community itself mine too, but it is limited and only involves panning. In addition to the monitoring, Sinangoe has formed a “guardia indigena” of almost 20 people and promulgated its own law, as is arguably its right under Ecuador’s Constitution, international law and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This happened after just three months monitoring, once the A’I Cofan realised how many people were invading. The law, dated May 2017, prohibits outsiders from conducting “any kind of mining activity with pan, sluice, winch, dredge and/or other equipment”, from “any kind of fishing using unconventional methods such as barbasco, poison, dynamite, water pistols, nets and/or other equipment”, and from “any kind of hunting using traps, shotguns, dogs and/or other unconventional methods.” Local authorities soon became aware of the law, reportedly leading to a “drastic increase” in threats made to Criollo and other community members. When the number of invaders continued to remain high, the A’I Cofan held a public event on 14 September in order to further spread awareness of the law. The event was broadcast live on Radio Sucumbíos and attended by the provincial governor and representatives of the public prosecutors’ office, Defensoría del Pueblo, Ministry of Mines, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Interior, other A’I Cofan communities and other indigenous leaders. “Our message is very clear,” Criollo said in a press release at the time. “We want our neighbours to respect us and our territory. For many years we have witnessed invaders exploiting the resources in our ancestral territory without our consent. Today we are saying, “No more.”” That press release quoted one of the few female members of Sinangoe’s guardia, Lisbeth Narvaez. “Our territory is our life,” she said. “This new process of territorial defence is historic, legitimate and crucial to ensure the protection of our rights and to maintain the integrity of our ancestral lands. We call on all communities of A’I Cofan nationality and other nationalities in the Ecuadorian Amazon to support this process and fight for the defence of their territories.” To date, the law appears to have had some impact. Although a report by Sinangoe in September stated that the number of miners remained high and some of the same people were repeatedly entering, the situation is reported to have improved since the public event. Nixon Narvaez puts that down to the establishment of the guardia too, whose members are responsible for enforcing the law. “Before the law there was a lot of people entering,” he says. “Since then, things have quieted down a little.” The irony that the A’I Cofan themselves have had to make such efforts - even though their land is in a supposedly protected national park established in 1979, almost 40 years ago - is not lost on the community. According to the park’s Management Plan, it is the most important water reserve in northern Ecuador, supplying Quito with “almost all” its water, and it is home to the country’s third biggest volcano, “extraordinary” biodiversity, the stunning 160m-high San Rafael waterfall and a “great number of species that are endemic or new to science that aren’t protected in any other part of the world.” The website of the Ministry of Environment, which runs the park, dubs it “the national park of water.” But among the A’I Cofan in Sinangoe frustration with the Ministry clearly runs deep. Community members argue that the park was established without consulting them, and the Ministry takes no serious measures to protect the part where they live. This is despite the fact that the Management Plan, dating from almost 10 years ago, acknowledges the park’s “great mining potential” and the potential pressure on the area as a result. Last November the Ministry of Environment, together with various other state institutions, did pay a rare visit to Sinangoe. A Ministry report acknowledges that evidence of mining was found and several commitments to the community were made, but the trip itself was cut short and various institutions were slow to report back to the A’I Cofan - further fuelling their frustration. “We’ve called the Ministry many times, but they don’t do anything,” Criollo told the Guardian. He wasn’t just talking about mining. “For example, when we’ve seen a fisherman using dynamite.” Nixon Narvaez puts it another way: the Ministry and park are regulated by a “ley de afuera” - laws promulgated in Quito. “They don’t have any value here,” he says. “The Ministry comes but doesn’t do anything. They don’t enter. They’ve never said to us, “Let’s go, guys [into the park]!” The sudden appearance of the miners in the concession upriver from Sinangoe has come at a particularly crucial moment for mining in Ecuador. In February it was the subject of one of seven questions in a national referendum, with 68% of Ecuadorians voting against mining in protected and certain other areas. In March over 1,000 people marched to Quito to mark World Water Day and raise awareness of the dangers posed by the industry, and female indigenous leaders met president Moreno to request an end to all operations in their territories. A collective of organisations and individuals, “Caminantes”, has emerged calling for all concessions to be annulled. On 16 April a march is planned in the north of the country, with members of Sinangoe due to participate. Luisana Aguilar, from the Comision Ecumenica de Derechos Humanos (CEDHU), told the Guardian that the Caminantes have adopted their position after “10 years of no dialogue and the violent imposition” of concessions and mines. “Some initial achievements have already been made: putting the issue on the political agenda, getting a question about mining into the referendum, the offer to award no new concessions, the Minister’s dismissal and the backtracking on some concessions [in the process of being established],” Aguilar says. “We believe that this is the moment when Ecuador must make a decision: either take a step back, annul the concessions and build a post-extractivist economy, or continue along the same lines and pursue profit at the expense of mega-biodiversity, indigenous territories and campesino communities.” Yet at the same time approximately 15% of the country is included in mining concessions and despite the recent decision to backtrack on some new ones, a further 170,000 hectares were awarded between December 2017 and February, mostly to Australian, Canadian, Chilean and Chinese companies, according to the Coordinadora Ecuatoriana de Organizaciones para la Defensa del Ambiente y la Naturaleza (CEDENMA). Last week Quito hosted an international mining conference, “Ecuador minero por buen camino”, where the acting Minister of Mines said that $4.5 billion is expected to be invested over the next few years in mining projects already under construction, and exports and other revenue streams will generate a further $5 billion. “Our national policy is defined and looks to attract and encourage private, national and foreign investment which will be productive and socially and environmentally responsible, and generate decent employment,” the Minister, Rebeca Illescas, was reported to say. “About 5,000 jobs have already been directly created and it is calculated that the strategic projects [San Carlos Panantza, Rio Blanco, Loma Larga, Mirador and Fruta del Norte, all towards the south of the country] will generate roughly 25,000 jobs directly and indirectly through to 2021.” Meanwhile, in the La Merced de Buenos Aires parish in Imbabura province, slightly to the north-west of Sinangoe, a much-publicised gold rush has been taking place. The Ministry of Mines issued a statement last week estimating there are more than 3,000 people mining illegally in that region, saying it is committed to “combatting and eradicating illegal mining” and that it has detained over 130 people. Joselito, upriver from Sinangoe, had mentioned the Buenos Aires gold rush when recently confronted by the A’I Cofan. He estimated there are 5,000 people there and appeared to claim mercury was being used, unlike at his site along the River Aguarico. But was he telling the truth? Earlier this year Amazon Frontlines’s Nicolas Mainville, a French-Canadian biologist specialising in mercury contamination in the Amazon, recorded the president of Puerto Libre’s small-scale miners’ association saying that some operators - distinct from his association - have been using mercury on the River Aguarico. Mainville believes that many other people in the region would agree with that, and he has taken soil and water samples from the large beach just downriver from the new site where the same excavator and sluice had previously been operating. “I really don’t know and I sincerely hope they aren’t, but everybody we’ve talked to says yes,” says Mainville, who piloted the drone over the new site. “Because economically it just makes little sense to have all that machinery - the excavator and the sluice - and all those people and not use mercury. Because if you don’t use mercury, you just use sight. You have to sift through everything. It’s incredibly inefficient at that scale. With that sluice, and with mercury, all the gold would be sticking. Everyone I’ve spoken to says, “Of course they’ve been using mercury.”” The A’I Cofan in Sinangoe aren’t sure either. But both Narvaez and Criollo appear aware of the potentially devastating consequences and are waiting for the samples results. The community has requested that the Ministry of Environment take samples too, but nothing has yet been done. “We don’t know, but if they’re using mercury it could be extremely dangerous,” says Alex Lucitante, from the Alianza Ceibo. “We understand what it is, what it can cause, what harm it can do. It’s very toxic. That’s what concerns us the most. That’s mainly why we’re rising up and fighting.” According to the World Health Organisation, mercury is one of the world’s “top ten chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern” and is “particularly hazardous” when used in artisanal and small-scale gold-mining. In late 2016 Ecuador ratified the UN Minamata Convention on Mercury in which it commits, among other things, to reducing or eliminating mercury use in such mining.

Instead, he experienced the USSR primarily as a series of texts that landed on his desk each day. In Stalin’s World: Dictating the Soviet Order, Sarah Davies and James Harris reconstruct his claustrophobic, insular reality through a close study of his archive, shining a spotlight on the daily business of running a massive totalitarian state. It paints a portrait of the dictator as monstrous, paper-shuffling super-bureaucrat. RJB Bosworth takes a very different approach in Mussolini’s Italy. Via an astonishing accumulation of detail, he immerses the reader in a reconstruction of daily life under the fascist dictatorship. The results are surprising: I did not know that a quarter of Italy’s Jewish population were members of the National Fascist Party by the 1930s, nor that Topolino (Mickey Mouse) was regarded as a corrupting influence on Italian youth. And yet Mussolini’s own children read comics starring the American rodent; even in Il Duce’s own household, his political experiment was a failure. Stalin’s World is very dense and Mussolini’s Italy is very long – common characteristics of books about dictatorships. Simon Leys’ Chinese Shadows has just over 200 elegantly written pages, and yet cuts to the heart of Mao’s Cultural Revolution with precision. Leys exposed the destructive evil of Mao’s regime at a time when “useful idiots” ranging from Jean-Paul Sartre to Shirley MacLaine were singing its praises in the west. His narrative fuses insights from his own travels in China with profound but lightly worn erudition. One moment Leys is discussing Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse‑tung, the next he is reaching back to its 14th‑century precursor, the Ming Ta kao. Latin America has endured many tyrants, spawning the genre of the dictator novel. Of all the celebrated examples of the form, I am most fascinated by Augusto Roa Bastos’s I, the Supreme. The 1974 novel provides a fictionalised account of the 19th- century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco, AKA Dr Francia, AKA “the Supreme”, who ruled the nation between 1814 and 1840. The Paraguayan author’s interest in the Supreme was not purely historical; Bastos wrote the novel while Paraguay was suffering under another dictator, Alfredo Stroessner Matiauda. However, the book is no simple allegory, it is also a profound meditation on power and language. And now for something completely different: Riad Sattouf’s The Arab of the Future. We know personality cults are strange, but that strangeness looks different from the perspective of a child. Sattouf experienced both Gaddafi’s Libya and Hafez al-Assad’s Syria while still a small boy. Kids don’t spend a lot of time reflecting on totalitarianism, but they do form strong impressions. His simple depictions of living in an almost-abandoned building for expatriates in Libya, or of watching Assad praying on TV are the kind of banal micro-details that would lose their significance in written prose. Captured in the panels of a cartoon strip, however, they attain a luminous resonance that lingers long after you’ve finished the book. • Dictator Literature: A History of Despots Through Their Writing by Daniel Kalder is published by Oneworld in the UK and is available in the US as The Infernal Library: On Dictators, the Books They Wrote, and Other Catastrophes of Literacy (Henry Holt)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/06/lady-farrington-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T17:05:00Z","webTitle":"Lady Farrington of Ribbleton obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/06/lady-farrington-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/06/lady-farrington-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Lady Farrington of Ribbleton obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Josie Farrington, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, who has died of cancer aged 77, possessed the important defining characteristic that, above others, wins admiration across all the red leather benches in the House of Lords: she knew what she was talking about. When she was appointed to the upper house in 1994 she brought with her a lifetime’s hands-on experience of local government and her authority and expertise thus ensured that she was heard with considerable respect. Despite being a Labour whip for 15 years, a post not normally renowned as a means of making friends, she also had the unusual distinction of being universally popular. She was liked because she was knowledgeable, considerate and down to earth. She put in the hours herself and she was assiduous as a whip at ensuring that others did, too, and were there to vote when they were needed. She was a disciplinarian, but her personality meant that she could muster people in the lobbies without alienating them, a task at which she succeeded throughout the duration of the Blair and Brown governments. And she was famed for organising regular curry evenings for Labour members of the Lords. During the same period she also spoke for the government in the Lords on a variety of subjects at different times, including local government, Northern Ireland, the environment and women’s issues. Latterly, in opposition, she did not much care for making lengthy speeches but was on her feet in a flash to intervene at question time. Her last contribution, in November last year, shortly before her illness was diagnosed, was to point out that the government’s proclaimed aim of improving educational standards was hampered by the shortage of affordable housing, forcing many young families to live in temporary accommodation. She had gone into politics, initially as a town councillor in Preston, Lancashire, where she was an elected member from 1973 to 1976, because she was aware of those who lived in difficult social circumstances and, as a Labour party member, wanted to do what she could to help. In 1977 she was elected to Lancashire county council, and when her party took control in 1981, she chaired the education committee for 10 years. She also chaired the council for a year from 1992. In the meantime, she chaired the Labour group on the Association of County Councils (1987–94) and the policy committee of the ACC (1993–94). The Labour party mattered to her and she never forgot why she had joined. “It meant everything to her,” one of her close friends said. Despite her many achievements, however, she was never personally ambitious. Her political activities moved into Europe in 1989. She became president of the Council of Europe’s committee for culture, education and the media for five years and became closely involved in trying to help improve educational opportunities in Albania. She was the British winner of a European political award for women presented to her in 1994 in Vienna, and the same year she was appointed the UK’s representative on the EU’s committee of the regions and chaired the group responsible for education and training. This led to work with the new democracies in eastern Europe and she was an international observer at elections in the 1990s in Poland, Ukraine and Albania. One of her projects was setting up a local radio station in Croatia. Farrington made two attempts to become an MP, but was only prepared to seek selection in Lancashire, where she lived with her husband, Michael, and their three sons. She came closest in the general election in 1983 in West Lancashire, where she won 33% of the vote against the successful Conservative’s 46%, losing by just under 7,000 votes. She stood in the Ribble Valley byelection in 1991, where she came a distant third. Born Josephine Cayless in Loughborough, she was the eldest of six children of Ernest, a master plumber, and his wife, Dorothy, who had been a nurse. She went to Loughborough Girls’ high school and worked as an unqualified teacher. In 1960 she married Michael Farrington and in 1968 they moved to Lancashire, where he worked in education. He survives her along with their sons, Benjamin, Dominic and Daniel, and five grandchildren. • Josie Farrington, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, politician, born 29 June 1940; died 30 March 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/09/investing-jobs-women-gender-pay-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T06:59:51Z","webTitle":"The gender pay gap isn't the half of it: our economy runs on women's unpaid work | Sandi Toksvig","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/09/investing-jobs-women-gender-pay-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/09/investing-jobs-women-gender-pay-gap","fields":{"headline":"The gender pay gap isn't the half of it: our economy runs on women's unpaid work","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I recently delivered the annual Adam Smith lecture in Kirkcaldy, Fife. It was the first time a woman had been trusted to give this economics lecture all by herself. As a marvellous bagpiper led the way, it struck me that this might be my glass cliff moment. Because, let’s face it, I’m not an obvious choice for such a task. But with men now making up two-thirds of economics students, all but one of the Nobel prizewinners for economics having been a man and every single British chancellor of the exchequer somehow having been required to be a boy, then finding a woman might have been tricky. By happy coincidence, I chose as the subject of my lecture women’s exclusion from the formal economy. Or as I like to call it, our grossly undervalued domestic product (GUDP). Never, as it happens, has this been more relevant than now, as the full horror of the gender pay gap is revealed. I have so enjoyed watching the debate unfold. Highlights include accusing women of conflating pay discrimination with the gender pay gap – silly women! – though nobody benefits more from this apparent “confusion” than the companies evading legal action. Better still are those bemoaning the lack of explanatory data, while dogmatically concluding that the gender pay gap has nothing to do with discrimination in hiring or promotion decisions. And my absolute favourite – let’s not forget the pro-choicers. These are the three women on this planet whose privilege and adoration of unfettered capitalism leads them to infer that women simply choose to work for less, and guarantees them a slot on every talkshow “in the interest of balance”. But the pay gap isn’t the choice of women. It is both a cause and consequence of gender inequality. In many respects it is more important than pay discrimination because it shines a light on the deep structural inequalities in every part of our society and economy. On my way to the lecture, I stopped in at the Cottage Family Centre in Kirkcaldy. This wonderful community service was set up by a group of local parents in 1987 and provides a lifeline to poor families in the area. In 2016 its Christmas appeal provided food and presents to 300 children. By last year as many as 800 children and families needed its help. When they recently learned that they had lost one of their funding streams, the extraordinary women who work there offered to take a pay cut so that their community wouldn’t suffer. The Cottage is a stark reminder that poverty is gendered. Most of the people it serves are women and children who have been first in the line of fire for austerity. Because, as Sophie Walker, leader of the Women’s Equality party, has repeatedly pointed out, “while tax cuts are benefiting men, benefit cuts are harming women”. Research carried out by the House of Commons library in 2017 revealed that it is women who have borne 86% of the burden of austerity since 2010. The brilliant staff who work at the Cottage are overwhelmingly female, no doubt encouraged by an education system that says caring jobs are for women, and the scarcity of flexible working in other sectors. The relegation of women in our economy means that these sectors are always undervalued and lower-paid, despite growing demand. Successive governments have prioritised investment in physical infrastructure (jobs for the boys) while social infrastructure (nurses, for example) is still seen as an expense to be cut. I can always tell our economy is in trouble when I watch the news and see the chancellor of the day put on a hard hat and hi-vis vest to announce some big, butch building project. “We may be in financial hell but look at me handle a brick!” I hope it makes the guy from No 11 feel like he’s doing something, but the truth is it doesn’t even make economic sense. The Women’s Budget Group has shown that if you invest 2% of GDP in the care sector, you get double the number of jobs compared to the same investment in construction. According to Save the Children, 870,000 mothers would return to the workplace if they could afford childcare – reducing out-of-work benefits and increasing the tax base. In his autumn budget last year the chancellor announced another splurge in infrastructure spending to get Britain driving again: transport connectivity, upgrading motorways. On the whole it is men’s jobs that are seen as an investment. I’m not having a go at the right here. I pride myself on being an equal-opportunity blamer. Jeremy Corbyn also pledged a £500bn investment in infrastructure, manufacturing and new industries. Labour’s 2017 general election manifesto committed to nationalising pretty much everything except childcare and social care. They fail to see that the global inequality crisis is a gender inequality crisis. Our lives are still rigidly divided into economic and social, productive and reproductive, paid and unpaid. One half always has more value than the other. The result is that the redistribution of wealth in this country, and globally, is too often from the poorest women to the richest men. Eight men to be precise – contrary to popular belief, they don’t in fact work at the BBC. Eight white men now own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion people who make up the poorest half of the world’s population. And it is women who are disproportionately represented in the poorest half of humanity. Yet this situation doesn’t benefit your average man any more than it does the average woman. So if, like Adam Smith, you are a fan of self-interest then you should know that women’s equality is better for everyone. The fact is, more equal societies do better on just about every available metric: mental health, general health, crime rate, education and so on. Mr Smith, the father of modern economics, lived with his mother until she died. It was her invisible hand, her GUDP, that left him free to write his great works. I think it is now time to honour her contribution too. But, hey, what would I know? • Sandi Toksvig is a comedian, author and broadcaster.

He meant “inclusive”, “participatory” or “non-elitist”. But there is a phrase for that concept in French: it’s démocratie ascendante. There’s also one for English words in French: franglais. From “basket” and “chewing gum” to “blockbusters” and “bestsellers”, English words are common in my language. The film industry regularly “translates” English film titles using another English phrase, usually more transparent, to look “cool” (for instance, Silver Linings Playbook became Happiness Therapy). But to many French people, “bottom up” is more confusing: was Macron making a risqué joke? Was it “bottoms up” (or “cul sec” in French)? His words, coming only days after he had launched a grand plan to promote the French language, were heavily criticised. “This sentence devalues French-speaking democracy,” Bernard Pivot, a fervent defender of the French language, tweeted. On the Today programme on Friday, the French ambassador to the UN, François Delattre, defended Macron’s choice of words, declaring that although “bottom up” is not exactly proper French, “it’s like weekend, rugby, football, and so on”. He was right in the sense that in a typical conversation among friends, franglais is common: – Tu fais quoi ce weekend? (“What are you doing this weekend?”) – Je joue au foot. (“Playing football.”) – Cool! English words like weekend are permitted because there is no real equivalent (no one says fin de semaine) or because, like cool, they’re trendy (it’s cooler to say cool than to say sympa). But bottom up would never come up in a casual chat: it crosses the fine line between English words familiar from pop culture and those derived from management jargon, like brainstorming or updater. Macron has never hidden his love for franglais: his campaign’s volunteers were les helpers and many on la team présidentielle refer to him as le boss. And it is nice, for a change, to have a president who can pronounce English words correctly, unlike his predecessors François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Macron’s overuse of English, however, his desire for an économie disruptive and a start-up nation, flirts with caricature. Sure enough, “Bottom up” was quickly used against him: “strikes are the most bottom up way to be heard”, someone joked in support of the French public sector’s current strikes. “Decrees are very bottom up”, wrote another, criticising the government’s tendency to pass laws by decree, like the labour law reform last autumn. And it’s true his actions don’t always seem to reflect the “bottom up” rhetoric. In November, 100 members of his party, La République En Marche!, left because of a “lack of democracy”. The head of the En Marche! parliamentary group was elected by default, since he was the sole candidate. But to criticise Macron’s words, French people had to understand them first. Sure, to entrepreneurs and millennials it makes sense. But what about French people who don’t need English for work, or are simply older than the typical start-upper? I asked my family – teachers living in rural eastern France – if they understood the president. My father, 60, whose English is good because he regularly writes letters for Amnesty International, was the only one who immediately got it. My mother, 54, was confused. “Bottom up?!” she said. “I don’t know.” She goes to weekly English classes, but prepositions are tricky for beginners and expressions combining them with other words even more so. My grandfather, 86, struggled too: “‘Bottom’ is like the foot of a tree,” he said, “and ‘up’ is when it grows?” With context, and five minutes, he understood – but in a speech, he wouldn’t have done. In the end, the final say on the matter was had by my grandmother, 82: “English words in French, I hate them. I don’t understand and it pisses me off.” • Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in Britain"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/09/trade-war-fears-fail-to-dent-boom-in-ipos","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T05:01:49Z","webTitle":"Trade war fears fail to dent boom in IPOs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/09/trade-war-fears-fail-to-dent-boom-in-ipos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/09/trade-war-fears-fail-to-dent-boom-in-ipos","fields":{"headline":"Trade war fears fail to dent boom in IPOs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"European flotations have made a strong start to the year despite the current market uncertainty brought on by a possible trade war between the US and China, rising interest rates and the prospect of tougher regulation on tech firms. Across Europe, the first quarter of the year recorded 67 initial public offerings (IPOs) raising a total of €12.5bn (£10.8bn), up from 54 and €4.6bn in the same period in 2017, according to PWC’s latest survey of flotations. The UK lagged behind after a strong performance at the start of last year. The London Stock Exchange played host to 16 of the 67 first-quarter IPOs, raising £1.3bn. This was down from 20 flotations in the first three months of 2017, which raised £1.8bn. Lucy Tarleton, capital markets director at PwC, said: “The first quarter is typically a quieter quarter in terms of UK IPO activity, and last year it was boosted by a backlog of IPOs after a pause in activity following the EU referendum. “The outlook is promising and issuers continue to be attracted to the UK market with a number of crossborder IPOs set to launch in London.” Meanwhile the total European figures for the first quarter were down on a strong fourth quarter, when 116 companies joined the market and raised more than €16bn. Of the companies joining the UK market between January and March, nine were on the main list and seven on the junior Aim market. The five biggest companies were Energean Oil &amp; Gas, Jersey financial group JTC, financial adviser IntegraFin, Baillie Gifford US Growth Trust and JPMorgan Multi-Asset Trust. The financial sector dominated the listings, accounting for 72% of the proceeds raised. The best performers of the new UK arrivals were Aim-listed cyber security business GRC International, up 112% compared with the FTSE All Share index, and IntegraFin on the main market, up 33%. The worst were Aim-listed property company Onthemarket, down 32% and mining group Cradle Arc, 31% lower. AIQ Limited, a Cayman Island incorporated company set up to make e-commerce acquisitions, had its shares suspended after they rose sharply before it had even done any business. The biggest flotations across Europe were medical technology company Siemens Healthineers and Deutsche Bank’s asset manager DWS Group, which raised €3.7bn and €1.3bn, respectively. They both listed on Deutsche Borse, making it the top exchange by value during the period.

I optimistically believed this would change in time, as we got on so well, and shared interests and values. Life was fun together, and 30 years later, it still is – apart from the area of sex. She initially convinced me her reduced interest in sex was because we were not married. Once we were, it was because she feared becoming pregnant. When we had two children, she was anxious about them hearing us. Last year, they left home and my wife said, “Perhaps I’ll die first and you can spend the rest of your life with someone who loves shagging.” She understands sex is important to me, so we make love once a month. She always has an orgasm, and enjoys it once she gets going, but it’s as if there’s a hurdle to overcome. Monthly isn’t enough for my libido, so once a week she brings me to orgasm manually. I masturbate, too, but stay away from pornography; if I start, I am easily addicted and feel sad and empty afterwards. We have talked about separating, but I have no interest in anyone else, and nor does she. Her lack of engagement with me is not a choice; she feels as driven not to want sex as I am to want it and I don’t blame her for this. We get on too well together to split, and the emotional damage we’d cause our children – and ourselves – would not be worth it. We are both fit, attractive individuals: running keeps my libido dampened, and my wife is often mistaken for a woman in her 30s, so I live in hope that one day she will enjoy sex more, and be keen to make love more often. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life.

He has also completed the 10-hour Frankfurt Ironman triathlon, the New York Marathon and he took on the Sables marathon in Morocco, 255km through the desert with a 10 kilo rucksack on his back. That competitiveness has also been core to his coaching, just as it was when he was a player: hyperactive, aggressive and talented, too. At the end of his playing career he coached Barcelona B, then Roma and then Celta, where the first thing he did was have scaffolding erected at the club’s training ground from which he watched the sessions. A technical observation centre, they called it. At Barcelona he was forced to adapt, not least to Messi – but his personality remained. He was often accused of not defending Barcelona’s “identity”, not being enough of a purist. But he did speed them up, increase fitness and impose a tough seriousness. With three up front, they were quicker to counter, and a bit more direct – but they played some superb football at times, too. There were moments of tension. Xavi had to intervene to improve relations with Messi and, while Luis Enrique was often funnier and even more playful than some wanted to admit, his public humour was often sarcastic. The media never warmed to him, nor he to them. He had little time for the “other” things that go with management. He wanted to compete, not be anyone’s friend. With players, he maintained distance – and when he went few lamented his departure, despite him winning three cups, two leagues and a European Cup in three years. Sid Lowe •Luis Enrique is available and eager to return to management, and had always appeared Conte’s successor in waiting – though his wage demands may prove to be a stumbling block. His favoured backroom staff, Robert Moreno, Rafel Pol and Joaquín Valdes, would also have to be bought out of the final year of their contracts at Celta Vigo. Dominic Fifield Massimiliano Allegri “Max” Allegri has successfully replaced Antonio Conte once already. He was appointed at Juventus after Conte left in 2014. His predecessor had won three straight titles but Allegri bettered that by winning three straight doubles and also took Juve much further in Europe, twice reaching the Champions League final. He built on Conte’s foundations by evolving Juve’s style, making them more flexible in formation and more varied in attack. His tactical know-how was acclaimed even before his feats at Juve – he was voted Italy’s manager of the year while at Cagliari in 2009 – and it remains a forte, as he demonstrated by making in-match changes that helped Juve eliminate Tottenham from this season’s Champions League. His man-management style is different to Conte’s. Although he is equally meticulous, he is not so intense, speaking less about going to war. But he can still make cold decisions. He fell out with Andrea Pirlo at Milan in 2011, largely because he believed Pirlo’s best days were in the past. The midfielder made that seem a misjudgment by leaving and winning the league with Conte’s Juve. While Allegri did not win the title again with Milan, he did wring fine performances from young players including Mario Balotelli. And when he hooked up with Pirlo again at Juve in 2014, the pair made up and won the double together. Paul Doyle •The Italian was considered by Chelsea at length in 2016 so the background checks have already been compiled. He has expressed a desire to work abroad, but is contracted to 2020 and apparently desperate to claim a European Cup with Juve. That seems improbable this term, so he would need convincing that the time is right. DF Leonardo Jardim Born to Portuguese parents in the Venezuelan city of Barcelona, Jardim has worked his way up from obscurity to become one of the most admired managers in Europe. He never played professionally but began coaching in his early 20s with youth teams, women’s teams and a handball team, before being made assistant at non-league AS Camacha at the age of 27. He made his name by leading a couple of small Portuguese sides to promotions from the lower leagues before taking Braga to third in the Portuguese top flight in 2012. That earned him a move to Olympiakos, where he was sacked after seven months despite being 10 points clear at the top. A defensive style was blamed but there was also talk of a dispute with the club’s president. He returned to Portugal and took charge of Sporting, where he again demonstrated his key qualities: tactical versatility and an aptitude for cultivating youth. Those skills have been to the fore at Monaco, his employer since 2014. Initially criticised in France as too cautious, he revamped his approach for 2016-17 and turned Monaco into one of the most swashbuckling teams in Europe, beating PSG to the title and reaching the Champions League semi-finals while getting the best out of young players (including Tiémoué Bakayoko) and senior stars such as Radamel Falcao. He is 43 now. In 2012 he said he would stop at 45 “to enjoy the fruit of my labours” – but last year he revised that to “50 at the most”. PD •Chelsea will have been impressed by the attacking verve of Jardim’s Monaco over the last two years, as well as his ability to develop a vibrant, youthful side. He is young, affordable, unlikely to rock the boat too violently – the board would find that prospect appealing – and may be ready for a new challenge.

But of course it has. We’re in our 40s now; both older, a bit fatter (well, me, certainly), a bit more jaded. Those heady days of our 20s are well and truly behind us. Gone are the days of no responsibility – and even this lunch date had to be planned well in advance. We’ve had two children each, you’ve had two wives – both of whom I still felt a pang of jealously towards, even though officially you were never mine to begin with. Keeping in touch has been easier since Facebook has allowed me a window into your life. I’ve seen the wedding pictures, seen the children, seen your happiness – happiness with a woman who wasn’t me. It hasn’t always been the easiest thing, despite our mutually agreeable arrangement. Do millennials still have “friends with benefits”? Those friends with whom you can enjoy the excitement of sex and the beauty of friendship without the anguish of missed phone calls and the risk of being dumped? We’ve had years of this ever-so-sophisticated arrangement where we would regularly congratulate ourselves on avoiding the complications of relationships, feelings, love even. But I do love you. I loved you when we started our arrangement. I loved you when you used to bring home girlfriends and I and our other housemate would put things in her shoes (yes, immature, I know). I loved you when you left for another city to work and I cried for days. I loved you even when you danced at my wedding. And I loved you when I heard about your wedding. I once told someone about our relationship, and they asked how long we’d been together. I remember the look on her face when I said we’d never been together, never been on a date, never sent each other Valentine’s cards. That I had, however, done things with you I’d never done with my husband. Experts say that, if you’re lucky, you fall in love only three times in your life. I broke the rules by allowing you to be one of them. You weren’t meant to be about that. You were supposed to be a delicious anecdote at a dinner party, a giggle with girlfriends, a drunken, “Do you remember when…” You weren’t supposed to be the one that got away. • We will pay £25 for every letter we publish.

Lula remained holed up inside the headquarters of a steelworkers union in metropolitan Sao Paulo, surrounded by hundreds of fervent supporters, creating a standoff expected to stretch into the weekend. Talks between Lula’s aides and federal police to arrange his surrender were ongoing on Friday evening, according to two people familiar with the matter. One of the sources, who requested anonymity, said he would not be taken into custody before Saturday. Workers Party leader Gleisi Hoffmann said Lula would take part in a Saturday morning mass at the union headquarters to commemorate the birthday of his late wife Marisa. Hoffmann denied reports that he was negotiating his surrender. Federal police in Sao Paulo declined to say if they would attempt to forcibly take the former president into custody, a move that could trigger intense clashes with his supporters. The arrest warrant, ordered on Thursday evening by Sergio Moro, who leads Brazil’s mammoth Car Wash investigation, stipulated Lula must hand himself in by 5pm local time to federal police in the southern city of Curitiba, though it is also understood he can hand himself in at the São Paulo branch. Lula’s defence team issued a note saying they had filed a request to the UN human rights committee requesting interim measures to block the arrest warrant, alleging bias and the violation of the right to presumption of innocence. They said Lula’s case had been judged far quicker than any other in the Car Wash investigation. The once wildly popular president leads opinion polls for Brazil’s election in October and maintains the conviction is designed to keep him off the ballot. Lula’s detractors celebrated the decision at the supreme court as a victory against corruption and impunity, while his supporters condemned it as an attack on Brazil’s democracy. The night before the decision, a Brazilian general appeared to threaten the supreme court on Twitter, which shook many in a country that had a military dictatorship for more than 20 years. Lula left office in 2010 with record high approval ratings of more than 80%, having presided over a growing economy fed by a commodities boom, and implemented social policies that lifted millions of people out of poverty.

Not Bruce Springsteen, the Boss, but James Comey, the former boss of the FBI, who is preparing to launch a coast-to-coast tour to promote his new book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership, which progressives hope will provide new ammunition in their campaign against Trump. Springsteen – currently in the middle of an extended run playing week in, week out in a small Broadway theatre – may be about to be eclipsed by the man who has sold out New York’s Town Hall, five blocks south, even though Comey is no liberal hero to those who blame him for Hillary Clinton’s election defeat. Springsteen is known for turning up unannounced during solo shows by band members. Comey seems less likely to warm up for his tour with an impromptu appearance onstage at a thinktank event by fired colleagues such as Andrew McCabe, but you never know. Age Springsteen: 68 Comey: 57 Born Springsteen: Long Branch, New Jersey Comey: Yonkers, New York Height Springsteen: 5ft 10in Comey: 6ft 8in Top ticket price this month Springsteen: $5,000 on Stubhub to see the Boss at New York’s Walter Kerr theatre on 10 April Comey: $1,000 at Chicago’s Harris theater on 20 April Views on Trump Springsteen: Well, you know, the republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it, it’s a tragedy for our democracy … The ideas he’s moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas – white nationalism and the alt-right movement. The outrageous things that he’s done – not immediately disavowing David Duke [former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan]? These are things that are obviously beyond the pale for any previous political candidate. Comey: I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document. Career lows Springsteen: His 1992 soft rock albums Human Touch and Lucky Town, written after his marriage to Patty Scialfa, were seen as boringly contented. “I got a new suit of clothes, a pretty red rose / And a woman I can call my friend,” Springsteen sang cheerfully on Better Days. “I tried it [writing happy songs] in the early 90s and it didn’t work,” he said later. “The public didn’t like it.” Comey: He bounced between being a hate figure for the left and the right in the US during the 2016 election, when he oversaw the FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server, closed it, reopened it, and then closed it again. “It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election,” he said later. Career highs Springsteen: Superstardom in the 1980s with Born in the USA was followed by a period of retrenchment; he returned to the public eye in the 2000s with his 9/11-inspired album The Rising and has capped his career so far with a well-received autobiography and his extremely lucrative Broadway residency, currently extended until December. Comey: The former FBI chief’s testimony before Congress last year saw Washington grind to a halt to watch him give evidence. “In LA, you’ve got the Grammys and the Oscars,” one woman told the Guardian at a bar showing the hearing. “Here we don’t have those big events – but we have this.” Comey’s vivid testimony was praised for shedding light on Trump’s alleged attempts to block the investigation into his fired adviser Michael Flynn and the president’s alleged demands for loyalty from the then FBI chief. What they said about … law enforcement Springsteen: License, registration, I ain’t got none But I got a clear conscience ’bout the things that I done Mister state trooper, please don’t stop me … – State Trooper, 1982 Comey: In times of turbulence, the American people should see the FBI as a rock of competence, honesty, and independence. What makes leaving the FBI hard is the nature and quality of its people, who together make it that rock for America. – Letter to FBI after being fired, 2017 … loyalty Comey: Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said: ‘I need loyalty.’ I replied: ‘You will always get honesty from me.’ He paused and then said: ‘That’s what I want, honest loyalty.’ I paused, and then said: ‘You will get that from me.’ – Statement to the Senate intelligence committee, 2017 Springsteen: The road is dark And it’s a thin, thin line But I want you to know I’ll walk it for you anytime – Tougher Than The Rest, 1987 … being fired Springsteen: I had a job, I had a girl I had something going, mister, in this world I got laid off down at the lumber yard Our love went bad, times got hard – Downbound Train, 1984 Comey: It’s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. I was fired in some way to change, or the endeavor was to change, the way the Russia investigation was being conducted. That is a very big deal. – Testimony to the Senate intelligence committee, 2017 … sex Comey: On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as ‘a cloud’ that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia … He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn’t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren’t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. – Statement to the Senate intelligence committee, 2017 Springsteen: Sometimes it’s like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet And a freight train running through the middle of my head Only you can cool my desire I’m on fire – I’m on Fire, 1984"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/06/leicester-newcastle-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T14:56:46Z","webTitle":"Leicester City v Newcastle United: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/06/leicester-newcastle-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/06/leicester-newcastle-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Leicester City v Newcastle United: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Newcastle will arrive in confident mood after climbing to 12th in the table on the back of a fine run of form that has seen them lose only twice in the league since the turn of the year.

Perhaps the easiest method of thwarting them would be for millions of energy customers to switch their accounts away from the big six and other suppliers of shale gas, and towards the smaller, often local energy companies who only supply gas from renewable sources and unfracked gas. There are a number of such companies in the Bristol area, for example, and they are easily identifiable on their websites as they tend to trumpet their green credentials, whereas the firms trafficking shale gas do not mention the source of their gas. The green companies also tend to be cheaper for the consumer. Given the drilling companies’ current problems with governmental checks on their finances, local authorities blocking them and local mass protests, the prospect of a significant desertion of account holders might be the final straw in deterring them from pursuing drilling in the UK. Howard Hardman Bristol • Cuadrilla reports “signs” of a “sizeable quantity of shale gas” in Lancashire and claims its tests indicate that each of the four wells for which it has planning permission could “extract enough gas to power 5,000 homes for 30 years”. Cuadrilla CEO Francis Egan further claims the drilling is “a major milestone towards getting Lancashire gas flowing into Lancashire homes”. Given that there are over 650,000 homes in the county, that means the four wells together might provide about a year’s worth of gas for each one – not much of a return for a sizeable intrusion of the Lancashire environment. Austen Lynch Garstang, Lancashire • Your article on the Swansea energy scheme (Tidal lagoon jobs at risk after delay to funding agreement, 3 April) quoted business secretary Greg Clark’s January letter to the Welsh first minister, describing tidal lagoons as “an untried technology with high capital costs and significant uncertainties”. The world’s first tidal power station was in France, opened in 1966, paid for itself in 20 years, and is still producing enough to power 130,000 houses.

But it is growing, and one West Country agricultural entrepreneur is the latest backer of an idea that has been embraced by more than 300 British companies. Guy Singh-Watson is handing more than three-quarters of his Riverford Organic Farmers business to its 650 employees as part of plans to create a structure where the staff will have a say in the firm’s future. Singh-Watson started Riverford, an organic vegetable box service, by growing produce in a Devonshire field he rented from his brother. He now presides over a business that has a £60m turnover and distributes nearly 50,000 boxes of produce a week, and says he wants to protect the Riverford brand from venture capitalist investors who do not understand the business. “I’m on a mission to show that a better way of doing business is commercially possible – and desirable,” says Singh-Watson, tall and dapper in his boho farmer kit of colourful jumbo cord and cashmere, as he strides around a broccoli field that is still recovering from last month’s snow and ice. “I don’t think you get most of what staff can offer by motivating them just with money. All the research tells us that’s rubbish. With a lot of planning and work, we can achieve a lot more.” Staff will not have to buy shares under the employee ownership plan; their 76% stake will be held in a trust overseen by a board that will be involved in running Riverford alongside a staff council. Workers will share about 10% of annual profits, as they have since the 1990s, and a loan from ethical bank Triodos will let the business pay £6m over four years to Singh-Watson, who turns 58 this month. The business is worth more than £20m, and Singh-Watson, who added the Singh to his name in 2014 after his second marriage, could have walked away with a much bigger pile if he had entertained an offer from one of the many City types seeking a slice of the fast-growing food delivery market. Such investors are helping fuel the rise of schemes such as Farmdrop and Hello Fresh, which have moved into a field Riverford has ploughed for more than 20 years. Singh-Watson set the company up in 1986 as experiment in growing organic vegetables on the family farm. He sold to supermarkets at first, then in 1993 started using an old Citroën to deliver the produce to about 30 friends. Today, the business has moved from the original family site to five farms – in Devon, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, North Yorkshire and France. It delivers about 50,000 veg boxes a week, supplied by its own farms and a network of about 40 others. It also has a fledgling recipe box service – with ingredients delivered ready to prepare a meal – a restaurant at its headquarters in Buckfastleigh, Devon, and a gastropub in London. Riverford posted a 9% rise in sales to £56.7m for the year to May 2017, but profits fell by nearly 17% to £590,000 as the company invested in a more sophisticated packing system. Singh-Watson first thought about handing ownership to staff more than a decade ago, but sales of organic vegetables were hit after the financial crash, just as the company was beset by problems with its website. The plan was put on hold as Riverford got to grips with being “an internet retailer, not a bunch of straw-chewing farmers”. But Singh-Watson says he has had no problem resisting the lure of a big cheque. “What would I do with it? Would it make me happier? I’m pretty confident it wouldn’t, and it would leave the company with a lot of debt.” He plans to invest his payout from the deal in a compost-making business and to pay off the mortgage on a new farm where he wants to experiment with permaculture and forest-garden agriculture. Singh-Watson has long made it clear that he will not be handing over the cash as an inheritance – he has four children from his first marriage and a stepchild from his second – a decision with which he insists they seem “pretty happy”. He is keen to preserve the legacy of a business that puts fair treatment of staff and suppliers at its heart. Unlike many supermarkets, Riverford cuts long-term deals with farmers and works with them to get as much of the crop as possible on to punters’ plates. “This is my mausoleum, my folly on the hill. It’s what I was put on the planet for,” Singh-Watson says. Similar motivations have driven more than 300 British firms to move to employee ownership, from Arup architects to John Lewis, with recent converts including the Sawday’s holiday guides group and ethical beauty brand Lush. The Employee Ownership Association says its membership is growing by 10% a year as business founders, particularly in companies with an ethical or community focus, look for a way to preserve their legacy. “Growth is driven by businesses which have a definite set of values not wanting to sell to the highest bidder and walk away,” says Deb Oxley, the association’s chief executive. She says the process also allows business owners to make a more gradual exit than financial or trade buyers might allow. A long list, pinned up on the canteen wall at Riverford, of the things Singh-Watson is responsible for makes it clear that will remain very much involved. After years of gutsy self-determination and experimental business ideas, it could be tricky for the keen surfer and sailor to let go of the tiller. But Singh-Watson insists he is stepping back. Does he worry, though, that he is cashing out and handing more responsibility to the staff just at the point where Riverford is facing the challenges of Brexit and a raft of well-financed competitors? Singh-Watson admits it is “quite irritating that a lot of people are stealing our clothes and being propped up by City money”. But he adds that many of these businesses are chasing growth to satisfy the financiers while finding it hard to make money. And that is the trap he wants Riverford to avoid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/live/2018/apr/09/big-in-japan","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T08:25:41Z","webTitle":"Big in Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/live/2018/apr/09/big-in-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/live/2018/apr/09/big-in-japan","fields":{"headline":"Big in Japan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A million cities in one When I first visited in 2010 I was told by a salaryman in a bathhouse that “Tokyo is a million cities”.

Over the years, I’ve been introduced to some wonderful Japanese chefs, all of whose restaurants are worth a visit in their own right. So, I decided to ask them to reveal their favourite places to eat, drink or shop. Sybil Kapoor Where to stay Traditional ryokan are few and far between in Tokyo, which makes them a luxury. Here you’ll find cosy futons, neat tatami mats, gracious service and a tea set laid out on the low wooden table awaiting your arrival. There are also two steaming hot baths, one made of cedar that looks out over the garden and the other ceramic, shaped like a bowl – a long soak is a Japanese experience not to be missed.

Not quite dead. She wasn’t breathing or responding. She was lying on her hall floor, cold and still, but there was a tiny twitch in her jaw. It was barely perceptible, but it was something. I waited outside with police officers who wouldn’t let me near her, then we followed an ambulance to A&amp;E. The doctors told me she was hypothermic and they were trying to warm her up; when her body reached a normal temperature, they would try to get her heart to start. They tried, but it wasn’t working. They let me hold her hand while they tried for the last time. And then she died. She was 39. Jenny was beautiful. She was tall and slender with big gorgeous eyes and silky hair. When we were children we spent a lot of time laughing uncontrollably together over anything that came our way and, often, at the absurdity of our situation. As children who were beaten and abused by a violent father and neglected by an alcoholic mother, who when drunk encouraged his rages and when sober ignored them, humour helped us. It’s what bonded us as adults, too. You don’t get out from that kind of childhood unscathed. I was luckier. I have a home, a family, love, work, friendships. Jenny worked all her life, always in the voluntary sector. She bought her flat alone, she supported herself, she worked hard. But she struggled. The darkness inside her, the lack of self-love, the self-belief beaten out of her by those two people who were supposed to hold her close, got her in the end. She left work, got into debt, stopped eating, drank too much. She went so far inside herself I found it hard to reach her; other people found it impossible. The coroner’s verdict was accidental death, but if I’d written the death certificate I’d have recorded it as murder: our parents, her past, catching up with her and killing her in the end. But hard as her death was to bear, I couldn’t have known there was worse to come. We had been estranged from our parents for many years. We knew my father had died but, at the time of Jenny’s death, I had no idea about my mother. Years earlier, I had written to tell her she had a grandchild. Twice. I received no reply. Now I wrote to tell her that her daughter had died. Again, I expected no reply but I did receive one from a cousin, Alan, who had been placed in legal guardianship of my mother, who was now living in a care home and had dementia. He considered it better not to tell her of Jenny’s death, as it would upset her. Alan and I exchanged emails and phone calls, and met up. I had buried Jenny but, as she had not left a will, I had no legal right to wind up her estate. I couldn’t sell her flat, or dispose of her few belongings, or settle her many debts. Alan helped me get permission from the estate to do those things. For a short while it seemed as though I’d found a new family. Suddenly, I had new cousins. As well as Alan, others wrote to me and Alan’s father is still in contact. But it became clear that, as my mother had outlived her daughter, Jenny’s estate would go to her. Meanwhile, my father, in a last act of malice, had left their estate to Alan and the other cousins, strangers to me and Jenny. I told Alan about our family history, and that it would have horrified Jenny that what little she had should go to her mother – and then to these strangers rather than to me or, more importantly, to my daughter, Hazel, whom she dearly loved and was loved by in return. He agreed and said he couldn’t imagine the other cousins would think it right that they should profit from Jenny’s death. My mother died in 2016. I wrote to my cousins, explaining our past, telling them who Jenny was, who she loved, and asking for assurances that they would not claim Jenny’s estate – that they would exclude it from my mother’s. I didn’t receive a single reply, only demands from their solicitors that I hurry up and hand over Jenny’s money. I hired my own solicitors to write to the cousins on my behalf, asking that they sign a deed of variation, to exclude Jenny’s estate from that of our mother’s. I made no claim on my parents’ estate. Again I received no reply, only chilly letters from solicitors asking for updates about Jenny’s estate. These responses felt like slaps in the face, of a piece with the violence Jenny and I had endured as children. Of course, people argue that you should be able to do what you like with your money. But Britain is odd in this respect: in other countries, parents are expected to provide for their children’s wellbeing in their wills. I didn’t want money, I wanted justice. In particular, I wanted to ensure my sister’s estate didn’t go to strangers. But, as counsel coldly if clear-headedly pointed out, I had no leverage. I received an offer from the cousins’ solicitors. It proposed adding up the values of both my mother’s and Jenny’s estates, and dividing the total between the cousins and me. It read like cold arithmetic, ignoring the fact that I wanted my cousins to do the right thing. In the end, I decided to accept the offer. As a result, I received a portion of my mother’s estate, which included some of the money Jenny left at her death. Both sides incurred legal bills, and Jenny’s flat sold for far less than the market value because it had a short lease. It turned out that the extra bounty they had counted on added just a few thousand pounds to their haul. At the end of the summer, there was a strange twist to the tale. I received an unexpected letter. Alan wrote after a long silence, apologising for being out of touch because, as he put it, “the situation of trying to reach an agreement over your mum’s estate had become quite exasperating”. Then came the kicker: “My opinion about Jenny’s estate has never changed and due to this I am enclosing a cheque that I believe covers the portion of Jenny’s estate I have inherited.” I hadn’t expected this. I had been baffled and hurt by his unexplained silence and assumed it had its own sickening eloquence. I was glad to be wrong. I wrote back thanking Alan: “It makes me feel slightly better about the horror of the last couple of years that one member of the family can do the right thing and behave with decency, and I appreciate that.” I never had any expectations of an inheritance from my parents. They weren’t rich and, besides that, they had gone for decades without making the slightest attempt to contact their two children, despite knowing where we lived. I was terrified of my father until the day he died; I wasn’t waiting for a payday. I would have liked a mother who’d support me through pregnancy and work, and a dad who’d champion my studies or help me move house, or tell me I was beautiful, but that ship sailed long before they died. What has left my daughter with a sense, not of joy in a newfound family, but of profound disgust, is the greed and callousness of the cousins who saw her aunt’s death as an opportunity to squeeze more money from a family they barely knew. So I have a responsibility to show Hazel that there is another way of being a family. There’s her mum and dad, obviously. And her dad’s family. But there are also her friends, and our friends. Blood isn’t enough. It doesn’t guarantee kindness or decency or a good heart. She’s learned too young a lesson I learned at a similar age – that a family can be a very cold, hard place in which to grow up.

Presiding over it all was the “Crafty Cockney”, Eric Bristow, world champion five times between 1980 and 1986 and a character whose gaudy charisma was central to the sport’s colonisation of the post-pub TV schedules. Bristow, who has died of a heart attack at the age of 60, was supremely confident, flash but intensely professional, and though there were plenty of talented rivals such as Jocky Wilson and John Lowe, at his best he was unbeatable. When he won his third world title, in 1984, the commentator Sid Waddell, renowned for his flights of verbal fancy, declared, “When Alexander of Macedonia was 33, he cried salt tears because there were no more worlds to conquer. Bristow’s only 27.” While his delivery was slightly camp, little finger daintily crooked, there was an abrasive edge to Bristow’s wide-boy persona. He loved to wind up opponents with frowns and mocking gestures and he developed what was often a love-hate relationship with the crowds. During one big match in 1982 he came under what a darts magazine called “the most sustained barrage of jeering witnessed at a darts match”. Each volley of abuse was followed by a treble 20. He acquired his Crafty Cockney nickname after visiting an English-style pub of that name in Santa Monica, California, and his first world title soon followed. As well as the darts circuit at home in the UK there were foreign tours, including a trip to the Falklands to entertain the troops. He revelled in his cheeky man-of-the-people image. When he was appointed MBE in 1989 he accidentally broke protocol by turning his back on the Queen as he retreated. Remembering royal etiquette, he wheeled round and said, “Sorry, darling.” She burst out laughing, he reported. He was born in Hackney, north London, in 1957, the only child of George Bristow, a plasterer, and Pamela, a telephonist, and had a happy childhood in Stoke Newington. George was a sports lover who exposed his son to golf, snooker and pool before buying a dartboard when Eric was 11. Bristow passed his 11-plus and attended Hackney Downs grammar school. Though he was good at mathematics – handy for calculating check-outs – he was not a model pupil and left at 14, later admitting to criminal activity such as joy-riding and burglary. Darts soon took over, and he was playing for a local team by the age of 14. Within a year he was making more in prize money than the £12 a week from his job as a proofreader in the City – “I was earning £120 a weekend,” he recalled – and he gave up work to concentrate on darts. He threw for England just before his 18th birthday and won his first world title in 1980. But his career stalled towards the end of the decade when he began to suffer from dartitis, a condition similar to the yips in golf: at the critical moment, the player is unable to release the dart and follow through. He was afflicted for eight years, and although he briefly regained his No 1 world ranking he had been replaced at the summit of the sport by Phil “the Power” Taylor, whose own rise owed much to Bristow. During his time out of the game, Bristow had mentored and coached Taylor, sponsoring him to the tune of £10,000. Taylor would go on to win 16 world titles, and Bristow later joked, “I ended up creating a monster.” In 1990 the monster beat his creator in the world championship final. In 1993 Bristow was one of the leaders of a 16-man breakaway that saw the sport split in two, but his last big occasion on the oche was an epic world championship semi-final defeat to Taylor in 1997. He finally retired from competition in 2007, devoting himself to exhibition matches and roadshows, and in 2012 he finished fourth in the jungle on I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. In 2008 he published an autobiography, The Crafty Cockney, but his career as an acerbic and often controversial pundit was derailed in 2016 when he was sacked by Sky after tweeting insensitively about the sexual abuse scandal in football. For several years from the late 70s Bristow was in a relationship with Maureen Flowers, at that time the UK’s top women’s darts player. Then in 1989 he married Jane, with whom he had two children, Louise and James. They divorced in 2005 and he was latterly in a relationship with Becky Gadd, whom he had met at a roadshow. She survives him along with his children. • Eric Bristow, darts player, born 25 April 1957; died 5 April 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/07/guido-fawkes-a-cross-between-a-comic-and-a-propaganda-machine","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T05:00:52Z","webTitle":"Guido Fawkes: a cross between a comic and a propaganda machine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/07/guido-fawkes-a-cross-between-a-comic-and-a-propaganda-machine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/07/guido-fawkes-a-cross-between-a-comic-and-a-propaganda-machine","fields":{"headline":"Guido Fawkes: a cross between a comic and a propaganda machine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When Guido Fawkes, the online scandal sheet, celebrated its 10th anniversary at a swanky cocktail party and dinner in Westminster four years ago, the prime minister sent a video message apologising for being unable to attend, and half the cabinet were on the guest list. The website has an unapologetically two-faced approach to the establishment it claims to disdain. It is comfortably embedded in its fleshpots while shovelling steaming piles of ordure on its members. This week, Guido was first to report on Jeremy Corbyn’s seder dinner with the left-wing Jewish group Jewdas. The site’s detractors accuse it of misrepresenting left-wing Jewish groups in the row over antisemitism, but as Boris Johnson, then London mayor, put it at that 10th anniversary party, Guido has long been the dung on the rosebush of politics. Once, in the early days back in 2004 when the website, a kind of knock-off of the pioneering Popbitch gossip site, had barely 100 hits a week, the person behind Guido Fawkes was a closely guarded secret. But Paul Staines, now in his early 50s, has become familiar in TV studios and last year he claimed nearly a million hits a week on the various Guido sites. Staines, a former Hong Kong trader, is now editor-in-chief of an outfit with a seven-section website covering tech and media as well as politics. He swaggers along what ought to be the tricky line between feeding off politicians and biting them, often with a drink in hand. Five years ago he told the Guardian: “I still hate politicians. My contempt for them is undiminished.” The politicians know this, but they appear to nervous of crossing him. “We cringe and simper around Guido,” Johnson said at the anniversary celebration, “in the pathetic delusion that we may thereby encourage him to be merciful to us.” Guido’s originator does not hate all politicians equally. He is a committed Brexiter: remainers get a particular beating on the Euro Guido pages, where their referendum predictions are vigilantly policed (the same treatment is not applied to Brexit promises). And though Staines insists anything stupid or hypocritical is fair game, he appears to find politicians on the left disproportionately worthy of his opprobrium. But then it is no secret that his politics are right wing, free market, Thatcherite. At university in Hull in the 1980s he was a member of the Federation of Conservative Students, an organisation so right-wing that it was disbanded by Mrs Thatcher. “I never wore a ‘Hang Mandela’ badge, but I hung out with people who did …” he once said. Later he worked for close Thatcher fixers like David Hart, and he reminisces about Africa and AK-47s like a character from late LeCarre. His breakthrough was to see early on just how the alcohol-fuelled gossip and backbiting of Westminster that makes and breaks individual careers could be translated to, and magnified by, the digital blogosphere. He recognised how the world of the political gang, of in and out, of foolishness and deceit and political manipulation and retribution could have been purposely designed to provide rolling content for the voracious appetite of a news website. What he created was a cross between a comic and a propaganda machine. Its common denominator is to belittle politicians, and anyone else (currently the Observer’s Carole Cadwalladr for her award-winning expose on Cambridge Analytica) with whom he disagrees. The website is no stranger to the law courts, and Staines has boasted that he likes a good vendetta. But from time to time the procession of gossip, recycled tweets and leaks from the special advisers and bag carriers who provide the daily bread and butter for the site is interrupted with a serious story. Staines claims the scalp of the former Lib Dem MP for Portsmouth, Michael Hancock, who stood down after it emerged that he had had an inappropriate relationship with a constituent. The site also demolished the career of Damian McBride, who it discovered was planning to smear senior Tories, and had a leading part in the destruction of Chris Huhne, another LibDem MP, over the speeding offence that ultimately forced his resignation and ended his marriage. The website sets stories running. It rarely does the hard slog of hunting them down. For example, it heard well sourced reports about bullying by MPs of staff, but it appears never to have tried to build up the kind of case that could prevent injustices being perpetuated. Instead it chucks a rock of innuendo into the pool and moves on, always hungry for a new way of entertaining its readers, while confirming their prejudices. Staines might one day be a footnote in the history of democracy, but his purpose has never been to promote its long-term health. • This article was corrected on 7, 9 and 11 April 2018. Chris Huhne was involved in a speeding offence, not a drink-driving one, as stated in an earlier version. That version also mistakenly said a Guido Fawkes contributor belonged to the Westminster lobby. A subsequent revision named the contributor as Alex Wickham and wrongly described him as a member of the press gallery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/06/actions-will-speak-louder-than-words-on-the-gender-pay-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T15:38:27Z","webTitle":"Actions will speak louder than words on the gender pay gap | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/06/actions-will-speak-louder-than-words-on-the-gender-pay-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/06/actions-will-speak-louder-than-words-on-the-gender-pay-gap","fields":{"headline":"Actions will speak louder than words on the gender pay gap","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Amelia Gentleman (Angry about the pay gap, 3 April) was helpful in separating out the various reasons for unequal pay, together with ideas for women to tackle the problem. But where is the advice to employers that unequal pay is often the result of unequal opportunities; and where is the recognition that they, employers, also have a part to play in providing solutions? Many jobs advertised as full-time could be done by part-timers or as job shares. There are easy-to-find organisations out there with experience in advising about this. Where are the talent spotters, identifying women in their companies with the capacity to learn and do more, enabling them to move into the higher-paid male-dominated areas. And let’s not forget the responsibility of government. Years after these issues were first raised, we still have too few girls choosing Stem subjects, a well understood avenue to well-paid employment. Childcare? Often affordable for parents of one child, out of reach for more than one. Hence the exodus of women from decently paid full-time jobs with prospects into part-time work, almost always at the bottom of the pay and opportunities ladder. Exposure of the gender pay gap is of course helpful, but only actions and commitment to solutions will start to solve the problem. Margaret Prosser Labour, House of Lords • The figures so far are fairly crude and open to a degree of interpretation (as some people will not be included in the calculations), but the pattern is clear. Most companies report a pay disparity in favour of men, and the construction and finance sectors seem to be the worst offenders. The real reason for the pay gap is not necessarily that women are getting paid less for the same work as men, but more likely that they are not getting into the higher-paid positions. And if companies want to reduce their gender pay gap, this is the area that would make a difference. It will be interesting to see what happens next. The reasons given by companies for their pay gap suggests a tendency to make excuses rather than accept that there is an imbalance which they could do anything about. The obligation to report is an annual one, so we will need to wait another year to see if progress is being made. Amy Richardson Associate solicitor, Coffin Mew, Brighton • Theresa May’s gender pay gap data, however imperfect, does shed a little light. For all their criticism of Gary Lineker’s pay, the Guardian (11.3%), Associated Newspapers (19.6%), Times Newspapers (14.3%), Express Newspapers (17%), Channel 4 Television (28.6%), and ITV (18%) all have larger average pay gaps than the BBC (10.7%). BT (-0.7%), where women earn a little more on average than men, is an example to the likes of HSBC (59%) and Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust (32.1%). Perhaps the Labour party (2.5%) could press Theresa for even more information next time. Philip Kerridge Bodmin, Cornwall • Reading Boswell’s life of Dr Johnson, I came upon the following entry on 11 April 1773. “I put a question to him upon a fact in common life, which he could not answer, nor have I found any one else who could. What is the reason that women servants, though obliged to be at the expense of purchasing their own clothes, have much lower wages than men servants, to whom a great proportion of that article is furnished, and when in fact our female house servants work much harder than the male?” What answer would Boswell get today? Jim Baillie Sale, Cheshire • Danny Dorling rhetorically asks (Letters, 3 April) whether the Oxford Diocesan School Trust is paying part-timers less per hour than full timers, and if that is the explanation for their large gender pay gap. The answer is obviously yes, something we should expect the professor of human geography at Oxford to know. The gender pay gap being reported currently is the total, unadjusted, one; of all men and women in work and it’s around 18%. The pay gap, unadjusted for any other factor, among full-timers only is 9.6% by the same ONS figures. That part-timers get lower pay per hour is thus the explanation for some half of that gender pay gap currently being reported, isn’t it? Across the entire economy, it will be higher in those fields and organisations which employ more than the average proportion of part-timers. This is such a well known fact that even those in their ivory towers should grasp it. Tim Worstall Senior fellow, Adam Smith Institute • While Theresa May is probably happy to contribute to the anger about the pay-gap issue, it is a welcome distraction for her: a blue herring (Men paid more at 80% of firms, 5 April). The real battle over women’s pay should focus on the gap at the bottom end, where millions of workers are paid less than a living wage or even below the legal minimum wage, and most of them are women. The government could take two easy steps now to improve matters for working women: first, make firms obey the minimum wage law or, better yet, ensure that all employees get paid a real living wage, giving them enough to live on without benefits. If companies were made to pay decent wages, the Tory austerity agenda could be shelved, and millions of lives would be improved; it really is that simple. David Reed London • I was buying something and couldn’t decide between two purchases. I decided to look at each company’s gender pay gap and choose the one that paid women the fairest. If other women consult the pay gap before deciding where to spend their money, we could perhaps move this thing along a bit more speedily. Let’s start a “spend where it’s fair” movement. Janet Graves Mellor, Cheshire • So after championing the just about managing, Theresa May has now adopted the gender pay gap as her cause du jour – what could possibly go wrong? R Schuhle Pontefract, West Yorkshire • While not wishing to deny a gender pay gap, it should be noted that gender gap reporting is on gross income per hour, before the effect of tax and benefits. So, for instance, men pay about twice as much income tax as women (£60bn against £30bn), whereas, because some women earn less (and are more likely to head a single-parent family), some women will gain through the benefit system. For instance (based on an online calculator), a single parent working 20 hours a week at £10 an hour with one child under 16 will have their take home pay almost doubled (from £8,000 to £16,000). The effect of using gross pay instead of income net of tax and benefits therefore seriously overstates the headline gender pay gap figure. Michael McGuffie Wellington, Somerset • Your editorial on the gender pay gap (5 April) claims that “exploitation ... is what this is about”, and implies that it reveals “a workplace that denigrates its female staff”. Both these statements go beyond the evidence and distort the real problem. As you rightly say, the survey raises “questions about the obstacles to advancement through male-dominated hierarchies”, as well as “the broader problem with pay ratios”. Of course management should aim to encourage and promote women wherever possible, and overall excessive pay differentials are a central problem for government. But it has been the case that many women prefer jobs aimed at looking after individual people, rather than committing their energy to playing “the organisation game”. This tendency has been observable both in choosing careers and in accepting promotion into administrative posts – and even in the public sector, where the objective is, in some general sense, the public interest. This is only a marginal tendency, with huge numbers of exceptions, and it may well be gradually shifting as a result of cultural change among both women and men – but so long as it remains, some continuing gap will be neither “exploitative” nor “denigrating”. Such dogmatic language merely antagonises employers, who feel misunderstood and defensive.

I’m a computer scientist and I was doing presentations in the office but, after lunch, I decided to go home early. Then I felt my first contraction. My husband Richard and I stayed at home until my contractions were five minutes apart – we didn’t realise that, because this was my second birth, we weren’t supposed to wait. We don’t have a car so, when it was time, we ordered an Uber to take us to the hospital. We had to wait 20 painful minutes for the Uber to finish its previous trip and arrive. I was having contractions the whole time and Richard was tracking the car – it was frustrating, to say the least. The taxi finally arrived and Richard, our two-year-old son, Sebastian, and I all piled in. Five minutes later, my body started to push by itself. I was trying to hold it back, but the labour had begun. The taxi driver, Priesh, was amazingly calm and collected. He was telling me all about his wife’s birthing experiences, and advising me on how I should breathe. There was traffic on the road and, although I was pretty out of it, I knew we weren’t going to make it to the hospital. We decided to pull up outside a medical centre that, luckily, happened to be en route. As soon as the taxi stopped, my husband ran to get help. Sebastian began to cry: he could see I was in pain. Richard returned seconds later with three doctors and a wheelchair, but by the time they arrived the baby was already crowning and I couldn’t be moved. The next moment, I felt I had to push again, and the baby started coming out. The doctor helped me take off my trousers, and seconds later little Michael was born, right there in the front seat of the Toyota Prius. Everything happened so rapidly. The only thing between me and the car seat was a maternity pad. Straight away, the doctors took me inside, where they cut the umbilical cord and called an ambulance. It was a clear October day in Manchester – with no rain for a change – but the air was slightly cool and Michael’s body temperature began to drop. To keep him warm while we waited for the paramedics, I put him under my T-shirt – there were no blankets. About 10 minutes after the birth, while I was still in the medical centre and we were waiting for the ambulance, my husband scrubbed down the taxi. Luckily, Priesh had wipe-clean leather seats – he even managed to pick up other customers later that day. I was 36 weeks and six days pregnant when Michael was born, meaning he was technically premature by one day. When he came out, he hadn’t cried much, so when the paramedics arrived, they decided to call another ambulance. They took Richard, Sebastian and the baby in one, so they could open up Michael’s airways; I had blood loss, and went in the other ambulance on my own. As we left the medical centre, the people in the waiting room applauded us. Uber gave Priesh some money to deep-clean the cab, and later they reimbursed us the fee for the trip and sent presents for the baby. I had left my clothes in the car, and the next day Priesh turned up with them, all washed, plus some gifts for the baby. Bless him – I’m pretty sure Richard gave him a five-star rating. Everybody was so kind – the driver, the doctors, the paramedics – I can’t thank them enough. When I compare this birth to my first one, I actually think it was more bearable. The labour in the Uber was honestly more pleasant, and easier. My first birth took two and a half days – this one was over and done with in two and a half hours. Our family and friends were shocked when we told them the story. The whole experience was intense at some points, of course, but I’m just so happy that everything ended so well. Thank God there were no complications. Would I call an ambulance instead of an Uber next time? Probably, but I do think that this way it’s a nice story to remember. I’m glad it happened as it did. • As told to Ellie Harrison. Do you have an experience to share?

Demographic changes, controversy over the council’s performance, and the cumulative impact of eight years of funding cuts mean Labour believes it has its best chance in more than a decade of winning control here. Even before the election campaign got under way, an internecine battle within the Conservative group saw one deselected councillor resign in March, losing the Tories overall control. “Barnet has been moving towards Labour now for quite a while. We have been campaigning almost non-stop for eight, 10 years. It’s hard work,” says the leader of Barnet’s Labour group, Barry Rawlings. But on a Monday evening last month, Rawlings and many of his local colleagues, including Jewish councillors, joined the protest in Parliament Square against their own party’s botched handling of antisemitism. With Golders Green, Finchley and Mill Hill, all of which have thriving Jewish populations, in their patch, local councillors here are acutely conscious of the issues. Ten of the 63 candidates they are standing in May are Jewish, including a rabbi. Barnet Labour has been at the forefront of efforts to tighten up the party’s rules on hate speech. “It does sometimes come up on the doorstep,” Rawlings says. “We’ve got good relations locally but I won’t pretend the national picture’s helped us. On the other hand, we’ve made it clear where we stand, and asked them to put their trust in us – whatever faith they are.” Last Friday, in the spring sunshine, Rawlings and a group of Labour colleagues were out knocking on the doors of an estate of well-kept semis in the swing ward of Hale, sandwiched between the A1 and M1. If Labour could take those two seats, and the political makeup of the rest of the borough remained unchanged, it would seize control of the council, which has been in Tory hands since 2002. Rachel Barker, a sparky 25-year-old Labour candidate, hands a householder a leaflet describing the Conservatives as “Heartless Nationally, Hopeless Locally”, and listens to his concerns about potholes, policing and antisocial behaviour. Chatting afterwards, she says Labour’s handling of antisemitism comes up occasionally with voters, but insists hopefully that they are sophisticated enough not to punish the party’s councillors for it. “People around here are quite aware of the difference between national and local,” she says. This great wedge of north London, extending from lively Cricklewood in the south, to the golf courses and garden centres of Chipping Barnet and Mill Hill, where the capital segues into Hertfordshire, is gradually shifting in character. Adam Langleben, the Labour councillor for West Hendon, points to last year’s general election result in Chipping Barnet as a sign of the changing times. The seat had been Tory-held since it was created in 1974, but Theresa Villiers held it by just 353 votes. Party activists are now working hard to find those local Labour voters and turn them out on 3 May. “There are wards where Labour had never knocked on a door, where we now believe we can win,” Langleben says. “It looks like it’s Islington, Camden people – young families – who are moving out there.” He adds: “Barnet’s always been a place where you settle down, you have a family and you move in. The difference between now and 40 years ago when my parents moved up here is that people are bringing their politics with them. “It used to be that you moved to Barnet, you bought your three-bed semi, and became a Tory – and that’s that. But something has changed in the last 10 years. I think it’s the housing crisis, but something has changed the mindset of younger people.” Langleben’s own patch includes the vast West Hendon estate, alongside the Welsh Harp reservoir, where a fiercely contested regeneration scheme has dragged out over more than a decade. The 680 low-rise council homes on the site are being demolished and replaced with up to 2,000 new-build properties, the vast majority of which will be privately owned and well out of the reach of existing residents. Only those with long-term, secure tenancies – which the council long ago stopped granting – will be rehoused here. Langleben helped represent local residents at the two inquiries into the project. “It’s taken up a lot of time – and it’s a scandal,” he says. He works for the Jewish Leadership Council, which jointly organised the Parliament Square protest, and is clearly exasperated about the way his party has handled accusations of antisemitism – not least against former mayor of London Ken Livingstone. But as Langleben strides through the estate, where the remaining council properties are dwarfed by towering new blocks branded “Hendon Waterside”, whose hoardings promise a gym and a concierge, it is clear he would much rather be discussing Barnet council’s record. And there is plenty for the opposition to get their teeth into, from library cuts, to children’s services judged by Ofsted to show “a legacy of widespread poor practice and ongoing systemic failures”. Tory Barnet has been the trailblazer for public sector outsourcing. In 2012, the council signed a pair of all-encompassing 10-year contracts with services giant Capita that saw a swath of basic local services contracted out, in a model dubbed easyCouncil. Labour says the project has failed to deliver promised savings, undermined accountability and allowed public services to deteriorate. Another local candidate, Sara Conway, who is Jewish and standing in nearby Burnt Oak, says: “It may not be something you could change overnight, but to me the politics of that have taken Barnet into a dreadful place. It has failed; it has not delivered anything it was meant to at all.” A volunteer at a local youth charity, she says Labour’s approach would be the opposite of the Conservatives’ laissez-faire attitude. “We would be proactive. You need to be driving things. You can’t just sit back and let it happen, particularly in a borough that is quite disjointed, that doesn’t really have a strong borough identity. You need something to bring things together.” As campaigning begins in earnest, Richard Cornelius, the leader of Barnet council, insists he and his colleagues will not be exploiting Labour’s discomfort in strongly Jewish wards. “It’s not something I want to campaign on,” he said. “We have got a good record as a council, we need to be positive about the future, not focus on our opponents’ disarray.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/uk-rows-back-on-plans-to-promote-gay-rights-at-commonwealth-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"UK rows back on plans to promote gay rights at Commonwealth summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/uk-rows-back-on-plans-to-promote-gay-rights-at-commonwealth-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/uk-rows-back-on-plans-to-promote-gay-rights-at-commonwealth-summit","fields":{"headline":"UK rows back on plans to promote gay rights at Commonwealth summit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain has been accused of “caving in” to pressure from the governments of Commonwealth states which criminalise homosexuality after doubts emerged over a planned UK effort to promote gay rights at the bloc’s upcoming summit in London. A guide on international best practice on sexual orientation and gender identity had been due to be published by the Government Equalities Office on 16 April, the opening day of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm). The summit “presents an opportunity to engage with Commonwealth member states and continue the UK’s special responsibility to advance equality across the Commonwealth for people with minority sexual orientations and gender identities,” according to details of a tender seeking a supplier for the guide. However, as the summit approaches, the government has been unable to confirm whether or not the guide would be published in time, saying only that it would come out “in due course”. The issue of LGBT rights remains a sensitive topic within the Commonwealth while some 37 of its 53 nations still outlaw homosexuality. The Labour MP Chris Bryant expressed concern about whether the initiative would go ahead. “It as if the government is now soft pedalling on the issue of LGBT rights. It might be the case now that they would prefer to publish this at a later date when no one will really notice,” he said. The bloc was described as a “bastion of homophobia” by the veteran human rights campaigner, Peter Tatchell, who said that the government appeared to have downgraded what was supposed to be a new report and gone back on a promise to publish on 16 April to coincide with the Commonwealth summit. “This sends a very negative signal to the more than 100 million LGBT+ people who suffer criminalisation, discrimination and violence in 70% of Commonwealth countries,” he said. “It looks like Theresa May and Boris Johnson have caved in to pressure from homophobic member states to not highlight LGBT+ rights during the summit. Appeasing homophobes is despicable.” During the summit, Tatchell and other campaigners are planning a picket of the Commonwealth secretariat’s headquarters at Marlborough in London on 19 April when they will be joined by LGBT delegates from various countries. Rights activists suspect that the government is eager not to offend other Commonwealth states as it seeks to use the first Chogm meeting since Britain voted to leave the EU to foster new trading relationships. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has spoken of how the summit is a chance to “redefine the trading relationship of the Commonwealth” and “re-invigorate” Britain’s links with other member states as Brexit talks continue. However, leaders at Commonwealth summits have tended to avoid significant discussions of LGBT rights. Nine of the member states that criminalise homosexuality have life imprisonment as the punishment while more are accused of failing to protect LGBT people against discrimination and hate crime. In February, the British overseas territory of Bermuda also became the first jurisdiction in the world to legalise and then repeal same-sex marriage, in what critics have called an unprecedented rollback of civil rights by the British territory. Pressed by Bryant as to why the move had been approved by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, the junior Foreign Office minister, Harriett Baldwin, said the government was “obviously disappointed” but felt it had no choice after legislation was decided by the island’s elected government. The best practice guide, which the UK government has been seeking to develop, is envisaged as an aid for elected officials and policymakers in Commonwealth states, according to details of the tender document. It insisted that there has been progress on rights in some parts of the Commonwealth, listing the examples of Nauru, Seychelles and Mozambique decriminalising same-sex acts in recent years. “But positive achievements go beyond decriminalisation of same-sex acts and a number of countries have laws protecting against discrimination in employment, allow organisations working on these issues to register, and/or have other inclusive policies. Celebrating and sharing these positive steps is vital in order to ensure this progress continues.” It added that there was currently a gap in the literature available when it comes to sharing up-to-date best practice examples of how Commonwealth member states are protecting and supporting citizens with a minority sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics. These included examples of how some states had reformed their penal code and developed policy to address bullying and hate crime related to sexuality and gender."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/10/epas-war-with-california-proves-america-needs-a-carbon-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-10T10:00:25Z","webTitle":"EPA’s war with California proves America needs a carbon tax | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/10/epas-war-with-california-proves-america-needs-a-carbon-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/10/epas-war-with-california-proves-america-needs-a-carbon-tax","fields":{"headline":"EPA’s war with California proves America needs a carbon tax","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week, Trump’s EPA announced that it will repeal the vehicle fuel efficiency standards set under the Obama administration and replace them with weaker requirements. EPA also threatened to revoke California’s ability under the Clean Air Act to impose its own greenhouse gas standards. If they do so, California’s attorney general will sue the EPA. This lawsuit would be tied up in court for years, and in the meantime California’s more stringent standards would remain in place. Those standards have been adopted by 12 other states, which along with California account for one-third of new car sales in America. Weaker federal fuel efficiency standards wouldn’t much help the US auto industry if they don’t apply to one-third of domestic sales. The Obama administration set the stricter fuel efficiency standards after the federal government was forced to bail out the auto industry. Struck by the 2008 global recession and a spike in fuel prices, US auto manufacturers, whose fleets were less fuel efficient than foreign competitors, were in dire financial straits. The auto industry thus accepted the federal bailout and didn’t fight the higher fuel efficiency standards – until Donald Trump came into office. California also agreed to the new federal standards in 2008, and now wants to use its Clean Air Act authorization to keep them. The auto industry has argued that low gasoline prices are the problem, but that’s not a problem they want to solve. In fact, US automakers are in the process of repeating the same mistakes that led to the industry collapse a decade ago: American gasoline is too cheap Other than Russia, no developed country has gasoline prices nearly as cheap as America’s. Australia’s are closest at 35% more expensive than American gasoline. Canada’s are 46% more expensive, and European petrol is about twice the American price. Automakers are complaining that they can’t meet the stricter fuel efficiency standards because those low fuel prices are causing more Americans to buy gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs. The problem isn’t technological – every major auto company offers a range of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and/or fully electric vehicles, but these account for just 3% of new car sales in America today. It’s also important to note that American fuel prices are artificially low because they don’t reflect the associated costs of climate change damages. This is known as the ‘social cost of carbon’ – the costs taxpayers incur to pay for the added damages from climate-intensified hurricanes, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and so on. Economists call these costs ‘externalities’ because they’re not reflected in the market price of fossil fuels. Putting a price on this sort of pollution is ‘Econ 101’, and 95% of economists support either a carbon pollution price or standards like these fuel efficiency rules. The solution could not be clearer, but it’s not a solution most Americans want to hear – gasoline prices should be higher. A carbon tax would be a win-win solution Automakers admit that consumer demand for gas guzzlers is the problem. Conservatives claim to be worried about the ballooning national debt (despite having passed a trillion-dollar tax cut). Environmentalists and scientists want to cut carbon pollution. Donald Trump claims to be worried about America’s crumbling infrastructure. The stricter standards would save $1.7 trillion on fuel by 2025; buying inefficient cars would cost Americans money. Implementing a carbon pollution tax could solve all of these problems. It would raise fuel prices, thus increasing consumer demand for fuel efficient cars, allowing the automakers to easily meet the more stringent standards. Having fuel-efficient fleets would also protect US automakers the next time gasoline prices spike and demand for economic cars rises, as it did in 2008. By reducing fuel consumption, a carbon tax would reduce American carbon pollution, thus helping tackle climate change. It would generate tremendous revenue that could be used in a variety of ways like reducing the deficit, cutting other taxes, or funding infrastructure projects. Or, to blunt the financial impact of higher fuel prices on Americans’ finances, the revenue could be partially or entirely returned to taxpayers, which would spur economic growth. In short, it’s the sort of policy that everyone looking out for America’s long-term best interests should support. Unfortunately, the key power players in this story don’t. Automakers tried to make a deal with the devil and got burned Automakers don’t lobby for a carbon tax because their most profitable models are inefficient trucks and SUVs. As an industry group spokesman told the LA Times, Manufacturers need to sell vehicles that customers need and want today to fund the technological shifts and electrification and automation expected in the future That’s a charitable way of saying that automakers want to maximize their near-term profits by continuing to sell lots of gas guzzlers. So, they instead hired a group to submit a climate denial report to the EPA and asked Administrator Scott Pruitt to negotiate a weaker, compromise standard with California. The New York Times reports that talks are quietly ongoing behind the scenes, but thus far Pruitt’s comments have not been encouraging. In fact, the EPA Notice repealing the standard didn’t even mention climate change or public health – the primary factors underpinning these fuel efficiency standards. Instead, Pruitt simply scrapped the federal standard and threatened to go nuclear by revoking California’s ability to set its own standards, and California responded by threatening to take EPA to court. The automakers are not pleased. But it’s their own fault for relying on an EPA administrator who they know is a fossil fuel industry puppet and an ideologue, rather than advocating for a win-win carbon tax that would have hurt their short-term profits but given the industry long-term certainty and stability. Instead, they’ll likely have to deal with the uncertainty of an ongoing court case and requirements to meet two different standards. As California Air Resources Board Chairman Mary Nichols said last year, I want to turn to the industry representatives who are here and say, ‘what were you thinking when you threw yourselves on the mercy of the Trump administration to solve your problems?’ In public statements, auto and oil companies support a carbon tax. General Motors, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, and BP are even founding members of the Climate Leadership Council – a group led by Republican Party elder statesmen but also supported by Stephen Hawking, Steven Chu, and The Nature Conservancy, whose goal is to implement a revenue-neutral carbon tax. However, when similar legislation is actually introduced in Congress, the auto and oil industries refuse to throw their support behind it, and Republican lawmakers inevitably kill it. In this case, the auto industry tried to bypass the problem while maintaining the short-term profits associated by selling polluting gas guzzlers. Instead they got burned – they’ll still have to meet California’s stricter standards despite the relatively low demand for economic vehicles due to artificially cheap fuel prices. And we’ll continue to wait for enough Republican lawmakers to get on board with a win-win carbon tax."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/08/captain-america-patrick-reed-masters","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T23:18:32Z","webTitle":"Patrick Reed: a Masters champion unlikely to win a popularity contest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/08/captain-america-patrick-reed-masters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/08/captain-america-patrick-reed-masters","fields":{"headline":"Patrick Reed: a Masters champion unlikely to win a popularity contest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"After the third round, Patrick Reed was in the interview room at Augusta National, talking journalists through his day. He had just scored 67, which made him the first person in eight years to shoot in the 60s for all the first three rounds of the Masters. He was asked about pressure, his iron play, the Ryder Cup. Then came this: “Patrick, it doesn’t take much to do a quick Twitter search to find a lot of people rooting against you. Why do you think that is? Why are there fans that don’t embrace you?” The question hung there in the air, while the temperature dropped a notch. Reed managed a wry smile before he replied: “I don’t know. Why don’t you ask them? I mean, I have no idea, and honestly I don’t really care what people say on Twitter or what they say if they are cheering for me or not cheering for me. I’m out here to do my job, and that’s to play golf.” The Masters isn’t a popularity contest, after all. Which is a good thing for him. There weren’t many cheering for him on Sunday. Certainly not so many as were pulling for Rory McIlroy or Jordan Spieth or Rickie Fowler. Reed studied at Augusta State, and his parents live in city, but he is hardly a home favourite. Until now, Reed has been best known for the way he plays in the Ryder Cup, where he goes by the nickname Captain America. Spieth, who played with Reed on the last two teams, and pushed him so hard here on Sunday, says that for Reed the Ryder Cup isn’t about winning so much as “about sticking the knife in”. Back when Reed played the singles at Gleneagles, he made a birdie putt on the 7th then put a finger to his lips to shush the crowd. He enjoyed the moment so much that he had the image of it put in silhouette on his belt buckle. That was just pantomime stuff compared to the rest of his rap sheet. In 2014, Reed was caught on mic saying, “Nice fucking three-putt, you fucking faggot”, to himself after he missed a putt at a WGC event in Shanghai. Reed apologised for it, and seemed genuinely sorry. But he never regretted the other set of headline-making comments he made that year, when he described himself as “one of the top five players in the world”. He was 23 at the time, and hadn’t even played in a major. The following year, ESPN asked 103 tour golfers which of their fellow pros they’d be least likely help out in a fight. Reed came second. Spieth tells another story from the Ryder Cup. Reed was trash-talking to a vice-captain, Tiger Woods. “Don’t worry, Patrick, you only need 74 more wins and 14 more majors,” Woods told him. “You don’t really hear Tiger talk about everything he’s dropped,” said Spieth, “but he used it there, because he was just like: ‘Screw this guy. I’m using this right now. Who is this guy?’” Still Reed’s hardly the only brash young golfer on tour, and after four years his fellow pros have got used his style. It’s when you get a little deeper into the weeds that everything becomes more complicated. There have always been rumours about Reed’s time at the University of Georgia, before he transferred to Augusta State. Reed’s always said that he left UGA because of two drinking offences. But in his book Slaying The Tiger, author Shane Ryan wrote that Reed had also been accused of cheating by his team-mates at UGA. Ryan alleged that Reed’s team-mates had caught him trying to play a ball that wasn’t his during a qualifying tournament, after he’d hit his own into the rough. Ryan also alleged that Reed’s team-mates suspected him of stealing from the locker room. Reed denied both accusations, and produced a sworn statement from his old UGA head coach Chris Haack, who said he was “not aware of any allegation of cheating or theft” against Reed while he was at UGA. But then Haack’s assistant, Jason Payne, had another version. “The story that has been reported by Shane Ryan is an accurate account of his college career at UGA‚” said Payne, “including the suspicions held by his former team-mates.” On top of that, there’s the messy relationship between Reed and his family which couldn’t help but bubble up this week given his parents live in Augusta but weren’t at the course. No one really knows what goes on inside another family, but the Reeds’ situation has spilled out into the open. His wife reportedly had her in-laws escorted off the course when they turned up to support him at the US Open in 2014. And back in 2016, Reed’s sister described him as a “selfish, horrible stranger” in a Facebook post defending her parents. “If you don’t believe in yourself,” Reed once said, “no one else is going to.” Which is true. But if you do, it doesn’t necessarily follow that they will too. Even if you are the Masters champion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/08/patrick-reed-wins-masters-2018-augusta","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T23:10:31Z","webTitle":"Patrick Reed wins Masters after holding off challenges from Fowler and Spieth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/08/patrick-reed-wins-masters-2018-augusta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/08/patrick-reed-wins-masters-2018-augusta","fields":{"headline":"Patrick Reed wins Masters after holding off challenges from Fowler and Spieth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What Patrick Reed lacks in widespread support should now be offset by widespread respect. The scale of Reed’s achievement here, in winning his first major championship, is illustrated by who and what he had to withstand. There were occasional, understandable wobbles but Reed ultimately held firm to prevail by a shot; 69, 66, 67, 71 and 15 under par sealed Green Jacket delivery by one from Rickie Fowler. It seemed remarkable in context that Reed’s previous Masters record included two missed cuts, a share of 49th and a tie for 22nd. Now, an individual once kicked out of a Georgia college has been afforded the last laugh. Others scoffed when Reed proclaimed himself a top-five player. He won’t achieve that ranking position with this win but such details are unlikely to bother Reed now. He is deservedly the Masters champion. The identities of Reed’s biggest threats was the main fourth-round surprise. The Texan started Sunday believing he would have to see off a former Ryder Cup rival. Instead, US team-mates threw the strongest punches. Jordan Spieth began the final day nine shots adrift of the lead. What subsequently transpired came within the realms of the finest closing round in Augusta history. Spieth briefly tied Reed’s lead; the cracking of a tree branch at the last halted the 2015 champion’s charge. Spieth’s 64 and minus 13 total proved in vain. “All in all it was a great day,” said a magnanimous Spieth. “I was nine back, going out I knew I needed significant help no matter how well I played.” Fowler was next to emerge from the pack, with a birdie at the last meaning Reed had no margin for error. Reed feared he had pulled a drive which found the left side of the fairway. A mid iron into two-putt range followed, as did typical celebration. Given what expectancy had come before, the denouement felt like an anticlimax; which is credit to Reed’s steeliness under the most intense of pressure. Fowler is worthy of credit for making sure he was outside the scoring hut to congratulate the champion. “I left it all out there, I made him earn it,” said Fowler. Rory McIlroy’s bid to complete a grand slam will have to wait for at least another 51 weeks. Just when he needed it most, McIlroy’s putter was to prove colder than a December morning in Siberia. His Sunday shortcomings can be linked only to that scenario, with confidence visibly draining from a player who was so in control of his emotions for 54 holes. The Northern Irishman missed from 4ft for an eagle at the 2nd in what was a jarring indicator of woes to come. McIlroy didn’t recover confidence or touch on the greens thereafter; his 74 meant nine under plus a share of fifth with Henrik Stenson, Bubba Watson and Cameron Smith. The 28-year-old McIlroy cut a disconsolate figure when walking from the 72nd green. This one will sting. Jon Rahm earned fourth at 11 under, with the Spaniard’s visible annoyance at that scenario telling in respect of competitive instinct. A major win appears close for Rahm. Paul Casey, who started day four in the nether regions of the scoring table, briefly flirted with history. The Englishman was nine under par through 15 holes; raising the prospect of equalling the Masters record score of 63. As often transpires in these scenarios, a jab was delivered by reality. Casey bogeyed each of his last two holes for a 65 and aggregate of five under. “That was fun, wasn’t it?” said Casey. “Birdie, birdie, eagle on Amen Corner, I’m going to remember that for a long time. “I’m obviously disappointed. I got out of position horribly on 17 and 18 which was kind of reminiscent of how I played this week. I haven’t been very good until that streak today. But to shoot 65 today, it would have been hard to turn that down. And it was fun; I know 63 is the course record, 62 is the lowest ever in a major. So I was aware. Not particularly nervous, just kind of having a good time and obviously didn’t do it, but it was fun.” As this major hurtled towards its end, the fevered anticipation attached to Tiger Woods’s involvement felt like an eternity ago. Woods had set a Sunday target of returning to even par on aggregate having started at plus four. He did precisely that before an untimely bogey at the last, with a 69 most notable for a stunning Woods eagle at the 15th. In recognition of that, Woods will take home some crystal goblets as opposed to the Green Jacket, which was never really a viable target. The 42-year-old, typically, was vague on where and when he will next appear in a tournament environment. “Generally after this tournament I put away the clubs for a while,” Woods said. “I usually take three to four weeks off – throughout my entire career – and usually the clubs are put in the closet and I just kind of get away for a while. The run-up to this event is pretty hard and pretty gruelling. I pushed myself pretty hard to get ready. “So I’ll take a little time off, get back in the gym and start working on my body again. I’ll get it in good shape and get back at it. “It’s disappointing that I didn’t hit the ball well enough this week. But to be just out here competing again, if you had said that last year at this particular time I would have said you’re crazy. I had a hard time just sitting or walking back then. So now to be able to play and compete and hit the ball the way I did, that’s quite a big change from last year.” Twelve months ago, Reed didn’t even feature on Masters weekend having signed for rounds of 76 and 77.

The preventing sexual violence initiative, founded by the former British foreign secretary William Hague alongside Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, promised to increase support for victims and help to end the culture of impunity that has allowed transgressors to go unpunished. As part of the initiative, a team of 74 experts was assembled, including lawyers and psychologists, that could be sent promptly to conflict-hit areas to help with evidence gathering and support survivors. At an international development committee session last month, MPs questioned Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt about the size of the team. The Department for International Development had told the committee that the expert group was cut to 38 or 39 individuals in 2015 – even though the government said the following year, in response to a Lords report on sexual violence in conflict, that the group consisted of 74 people. Burt said he did not know the specifics relating to the team’s size or why varying figures had been given. The Foreign Office has since confirmed to the Guardian that the team was shrunk to 38 people to make it more streamlined, and that the figures given in 2016 were supplied in error. Funding for the Hague-Jolie initiative and related work on gender issues was also cut by 10% last year. Madeleine Rees, secretary general of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, expressed alarm over cuts to the scheme and warned that the initiative is losing direction. “It needs to get back to focusing on documentation [of sexual violence] – done in the correct way – and looking at how and in what ways we should be focusing on prevention,” she said. Britain has been criticised for failing to deploy experts quickly in response to the widespread rape of Rohingya women and girls. Two experts were sent to Bangladesh in November to visit refugee camps to which the Rohingya, a persecuted and stateless Muslim minority, had fled following violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. The experts spent seven days in Bangladesh, where they were tasked with assessing sexual and gender-based violence affecting the Rohingya community and recommending humanitarian action to be taken by the UK. The report and recommendations have not yet been published. The Foreign Office is understood to have promised that an executive summary will be made available soon. David Mepham, UK director of Human Rights Watch, said the Rohingya crisis is “a critical litmus test” of Britain’s commitment to the initiative. “The widespread rape of Rohingya women and girls in Myanmar is just the kind of situation that the preventing sexual violence initiative was set up to address. Yet the British and wider international response has not matched the scale, gravity and urgency of the crisis,” said Mepham. “Six months after the horrific abuses began, many of those who were raped and gang raped – and left injured and profoundly traumatised – are still not receiving basic health or psychosocial support. Nor is there yet any agreed process to bring at least some of the perpetrators of these egregious crimes to justice.” Since August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya have fled from Rakhine state in Myanmar to Bangladesh. Thousands of people have been killed, while research by Human Rights Watch suggests that widespread sexual violence has been committed against Rohingya by Myanmar’s military. A UN fact-finding mission, as well as the national human rights commission of Bangladesh, are documenting human rights abuses, including sexual violence. An independent criminal lawyer with the Hague-Jolie initiative’s team of experts, who wished to remain anonymous, warned that a rush to investigate cases could prove detrimental without the right systems and support in place. “There needs to be some big picture thinking,” the lawyer said. “Taking the statements too early could hinder a successful prosecution because if they are inconsistent with any subsequent statement taken by an investigator of a particular court, they could undermine that witness’s credibility. “If you’re documenting for legal purposes you must have an interpreter that speaks the same, and not just a similar language, and interpreters have got to be trained to take this type of testimony,” she added. There is little privacy in the camps for survivors who want to be interviewed, as well as a shortage of translators to accurately record testimonies. The Department for International Development said it is providing a range of assistance to Rohingya refugees, including psychological support for women affected by the conflict, sexual and reproductive health clinics, and other specialist services.The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said Britain is leading the international response to the Rohingya crisis: “In February this year I travelled to Cox’s Bazaar to see for myself the horrendous conditions the Rohingya people are having to endure. I will continue to place the rights and freedom of women and girls at the heart of everything the foreign office Foreign Office does, including our response to the terrible crisis in Burma and Bangladesh.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/08/ander-herrera-manchester-united-denies-spitting-manchester-city-crest","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T22:09:50Z","webTitle":"Manchester United’s Ander Herrera denies spitting on Manchester City crest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/08/ander-herrera-manchester-united-denies-spitting-manchester-city-crest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/08/ander-herrera-manchester-united-denies-spitting-manchester-city-crest","fields":{"headline":"Ander Herrera denies intentionally spitting on Manchester City crest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ander Herrera has denied spitting intentionally on the Manchester City crest as the midfielder left the pitch at half-time during the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.

The firm said affected users would receive a detailed message on their news feeds. The majority of those whose information was shared with the data analytics firm – about 70 million – are in the US. More than 1 million people in each of the UK, Philippines and Indonesia may also have had their personal information harvested as well as 310,000 Australian Facebook users. All 2.2 billion Facebook users will receive a notice titled “Protecting Your Information” with a link to see what apps they use and what information has been shared with those apps. They will be able to shut off apps individually or turn off third-party access. It comes after the Observer revealed that Cambridge Analytica, which worked with Donald Trump’s election team, acquired millions of profiles of US citizens and used the data to build a software program to predict and influence voters. Facebook discovered the information had been harvested in late 2015 but failed to alert users at the time. The information was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by the Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica. Hundreds of thousands of users were paid a fee to take a personality test and consented to have their data collected. The app also harvested information about the participants’ friends. Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who is expected to testify before Congress this week, acknowledged that he made a “huge mistake” in failing to take a broad enough view of the company’s responsibilities. Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie previously estimated that more than 50 million people were compromised by the personality test. In an interview aired on Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press, Wylie said the true number could be even higher than 87 million. He said: “I know that Facebook is now starting to take steps to rectify that and start to find out who had access to it and where it could have gone, but ultimately it’s not watertight to say that, you know, we can ensure that all the data is gone forever.” Last month, he told the Observer: “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.” Zuckerberg said Facebook came up with the 87 million figure by calculating the maximum number of friends that users could have had while Kogan’s app was compiling data. Cambridge Analytica insisted last week that it had information for only 30 million Facebook users."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/13/marielle-franco-fiancee-rio-brazil-monica-benicio","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T10:09:16Z","webTitle":"'I'm waiting for her to come back': Marielle Franco's fiancee on life a month after Rio councillor's murder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/marielle-franco-fiancee-rio-brazil-monica-benicio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/13/marielle-franco-fiancee-rio-brazil-monica-benicio","fields":{"headline":"'I'm waiting for her to come back': Marielle Franco's fiancee on life a month after Rio councillor's murder","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It has been a month since the late-night knock at Mônica Benício’s door: a friend arriving to announce the love of her life was not coming home. “I ran at her shouting: ‘Where’s Marielle? Where’s Marielle?’” the 32-year-old architect recalled. “I screamed and I shouted. I smashed part of the house … None of it seemed real … It was like I was having a nightmare and would wake up at any moment. But as more and more friends arrived it became more and more real. More concrete. More desperate.” Less than two miles away, Marielle Franco, a 38-year-old activist and rising political star known for defending Rio’s black, LGBT and favela communities, lay slumped on the backseat of a white Chevrolet having been shot in the head four times as she returned from a debate in downtown Rio. Benício pummeled her friend with questions: “Was it an attempted robbery? Are they taking her to the doctor’s? Can they help her?” “No,” came the reply. “She was dead and there wasn’t … anything to be done.” Weeks after the murder of the Rio councillor and her driver, Anderson Gomes, her partner perched on a sofa in their home in north Rio and sobs as she relived the events of 14 March. Next year – after a 14-year, on-off romance – the couple were to marry. Symbols of the couple’s shared passion for activism and the arts pepper the airy lounge: murals of Frida Kahlo and Angela Davis; records by politically charged composers such as Chico Buarque and Mercedes Sosa and contemporary black artists like Marina Iris and her group ÉPreta; a portrait of Florestan Fernandes, a Brazilian sociologist who rose from poverty to write seminal works on race and democracy – issues central to Franco’s mission. Franco’s killing has sparked an outpouring of reverence and revolt. Brazilian newspapers are filled with stories about her life; demonstrators have swarmed on to the streets to chant: “Marielle presente!” – Rio’s answer to “Je suis Charlie!” “There are two Marielles: the one we are all out on the streets shouting is alive and the Marielle who is my companion and who I still haven’t managed to mourn,” said Benício. “I still haven’t accepted this has happened.” At dawn on Saturday supporters will mark one month since Franco’s murder by decorating public squares with balloons, flowers and banners. Yet Franco’s killers, who many suspect belong to the increasingly powerful paramilitary groups that control swaths of Rio, have yet to be caught. Authorities claim progress is being made but have said little about the state of their inquiry. “We are advancing, but under strict secrecy,” said Homero Freitas Filho, a public prosecutor on a taskforce pursuing the killers. Franco’s murder has punctuated a dismal chapter in the contemporary history of this spectacular but troubled beach city. Almost a decade ago, the then president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who last week began a prison sentence for a disputed corruption conviction, wept with joy after Rio was chosen to host the 2016 Olympics. Since then, however, Brazil’s “Marvellous City” has tumbled into a whirlpool of overlapping crises – economic, political and security – from which it is struggling to emerge before October elections. “I knew this [city] government wouldn’t end well but I never imagined it would end so badly,” said Marcelo Freixo, a crusading MP from the leftist Socialism and Liberty party who was Franco’s political mentor and friend. “The government is coming to an end with the former governor under arrest; the former president of the legislative assembly under arrest; the other president of the legislative assembly under arrest; the leader of the government under arrest; and the current governor waiting to be arrested. This is a very serious metastasis and has a real impact in people’s lives. There is no government.” Grappling with a growing sense of crisis, many cariocas, as Rio’s residents are known, say they want out. Two recent polls found more than 70% would leave if they could because of the rising violence. Benício, who met Franco in the colossal Maré favela where both women were raised, recalled teasing her about the wisdom of diving into this morass of political “filth”. But she said the seemingly endless reports of bloodshed and sleaze had fired up Franco, not discouraged her. Franco was convinced Brazilian politics needed renewal: more black faces, more female faces, more LGBT faces, more favela faces, and – with Brazil mired in what some call the biggest corruption scandal in history – more honest faces. In 2016, after years of grassroots activism, she ran for office with the slogan “I am because we are”. Freixo, Franco’s boss since 2007, said he was thrilled by his protege’s move: “The world is crying out for Marielles.” Rio agreed, electing Franco with nearly 47,000 votes – the fifth-highest number received by a city councillor. At her swearing in on 1 January 2017 the young, black, gay, female, favela-born politician vowed to “oxygenate” Rio’s stale political scene. Not everybody seems to have welcomed Franco’s triumph. Friends and relatives are convinced she was the victim of a political assassination, a theory authorities say they are aggressively pursuing. “I don’t question at all that it was a political crime,” said Benício. “She was our only black female councillor – a black, lesbian woman from the favelas occupying a position of power that’s predominantly reserved for the white men who make up this ‘Brazilian elite’.” Freixo, who has long lived under armed guard because of his fight against Rio’s mafia, agreed. “The only thing I don’t know is what politics lay behind it; who ordered it; what the motivation was and what the message was.” He admitted police faced a devilishly complex investigation. “We know this case won’t be solved with the speed … our anguish demands. But I think it will be solved.” Determined to keep Franco’s cause alive, Benício has thrown herself into public activism, addressing politicians in Brasília and taking to the stage with Lula and Katy Perry in Rio. She said her first task, however, was simply surviving. For a fortnight after the crime, Benício said, she was unable to consume solid food. “Eating meant accepting I would have to go on.” Benício said she clung to the memory of her final moments with Franco after a rare lunch together at her office. “I gave her a quick kiss, got into the lift – and the last image I have,” she said, pausing to compose herself, “is of her stood there in the door, smiling and waving goodbye, and the lift door closing.” The next time she set eyes on her partner was through a small glass window in Franco’s redwood coffin. “It didn’t look like her … Her face was a little swollen but there was nothing grotesque or morbid. It’s just that I couldn’t see my woman in that face … So I still can’t believe it.” “I’m waiting for her to come back,” Benício admitted, her voice trembling. “Any time now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/08/augusta-course-distance-design","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T19:23:26Z","webTitle":"Augusta’s desire to keep its distance may spark a lengthy dispute | Ewan Murray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/08/augusta-course-distance-design","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/08/augusta-course-distance-design","fields":{"headline":"Augusta’s desire to keep its distance may spark a lengthy dispute","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lost in the understandable focus that fell upon Augusta National’s decision to host a women’s amateur event, as revealed this week, was an early broadside from Fred Ridley, the club’s new chairman. Matters of distance have become a hot topic in golf, to the point where leading lights in the sport – the R&amp;A, USGA, PGA of America, European and PGA Tours – held talks at the home of the Masters. Ridley made it perfectly clear his club is uncomfortable with continual modifications as necessary to prevent the modern professional from overpowering historically great courses. Augusta National’s aspiration is commonly misunderstood. In reality, those presiding over the Masters want players to use the same club on the same hole as was the case decades ago. Basic mathematics illustrate professionals of this era will overshoot the 18th hole at Augusta with a perfect drive and five-iron; unless continual lengthening takes place. While possible here due to finance and availability of land, elsewhere such a scenario is not feasible. “We do have an open dialogue,” Ridley said. “Our focus initially is on our golf course. We are intent on making sure that we maintain the design philosophy that Mr Jones and Alister MacKenzie devised. And with the shot values that they thought were important, we have done what we felt was appropriate through the years to maintain that philosophy and that design. “There’s a great quote from Bobby Jones dealing specifically with the 13th hole, which has been lengthened over time. He said that the decision to go for the green in two should be a momentous one. I would have to say that our observations of these great players hitting middle and even short irons into that hole is not a momentous decision. And so we think there is an issue, not only there, but in the game generally, that needs to be addressed. The ultimate decision is going to be, I’m confident, a collective one. It’s going to be one where all of the stakeholders sit down and come to some agreement.” Ridley may be overly optimistic. The PGA and European Tours are known to be against a situation where their members are constrained in respect of how far they can hit the ball. They regard the blasting of 350-yard drives as excellent entertainment. Jay Monahan, the head of the PGA Tour, quickly downplayed a report from the R&amp;A and USGA earlier this year that cited distance concerns. Monahan pointed to fitness and the physical build of golfers as pertinent. He added: “It is interesting to note that since 2003, the average age of a Tour member has gone down, and the average height has gone up. “Having carefully reviewed the data, we do not believe the trends indicate a significant or abnormal increase in distance since 2003 or from 2016 to 2017.” This leaves the R&amp;A and USGA, the rule makers, in an invidious position. They have to be seen to preserve the sustainability of the game while not antagonising the tours that now represent multimillion‑pound enterprises. Those involved in this big business, where the best players have never had it so good financially, are entitled to ask why on earth golf would want to make seismic equipment alterations. Martin Slumbers, the R&amp;A chief executive, has entered territory his predecessor, Peter Dawson, would not by highlighting driving distances as problematic. Slumbers said recently: “I think hitting distance is very important to focus in on; that it’s not just about the ball, it’s about the hitting distance, and this balance between how much skill and how much technology is available. There’s no doubt in my mind that the technology has made this quite a difficult game and just a little bit easier, and at a time when we want more people to play the game, I think that’s a good thing. But we do also think that golf is a game of skill and should be reflective of skill. “Our 2002 joint statement of principles [with the USGA] put a line in the sand, or purported to put a line in the sand. I think our view is when you start to look at the data now that we have probably crossed that line in the sand and that a serious discussion is needed on where we go. And it is a multifaceted matter. It’s extremely complex.” It is. With so many groups in apparently different but polarised positions, the matter of bifurcation rises in prominence. Via that, professionals could operate with completely different equipment standards to amateurs. Not only would that be horrendously complicated, it would take away one of golf’s great selling points against other sports whereby mid-handicap players can operate under the same parameters as the world No 1. No definitive agreement was forthcoming at the Augusta meeting. It may be a considerable time before consensus is even close."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/09/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-weekend-action","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T06:21:48Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/09/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-weekend-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/09/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-weekend-action","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1) Welbeck goes through his whole repertoire Danny Welbeck stayed true to form by mixing the sublime with the ridiculous during Arsenal’s 3-2 victory over Southampton, producing a contender for miss of the season moments before nodding in the winner. The striker’s header was his second goal of the afternoon and proof, perhaps, that he is getting back to his best after an injury‑ravaged season. “Danny Welbeck is getting sharper,” Arsène Wenger said. “I am pleased for him. I have seen him behave when it was really hard. He had every reason to feel sorry for himself and feel the mountain was too big to climb – right knee, left knee. It is the most difficult test for any sports person.” Welbeck remains an infuriating player. He is a handful when he is fit and confident, yet he is capable of glaring misses. He never hides, though, and this was a reminder of his value to Wenger. Jacob Steinberg • Match report: Arsenal 3-2 Southampton 2) Zaha’s taste for battle could prove key in fight for survival Crystal Palace need him fit, firing and perhaps fiery too. Wilfried Zaha seemingly gets his kicks playing on the edge, bouncing off challenges and thriving just as it looks as though it is not going to be his day. The 25-year-old enjoyed kerfuffles with Lewis Cook and Simon Francis before scoring what looked like the winner at the Vitality Stadium, on a day when he was handed the responsibility of spearheading the Palace attack. “The fact is, if you’re playing against Wilf Zaha you can never relax,” said his manager, Roy Hodgson. “You’ve always got to be worried and he was a constant menace. If I’d taken him off the field there’d have been a collective sigh of relief from the Bournemouth defence.” Palace have a kind-looking run-in, with home games against Brighton, Leicester and West Brom, during which Zaha will need to come to the fore. Ben Fisher • Match report: Bournemouth 2-2 Crystal Palace 3) Brighton must overcome anxiety as final straight looms After a season in which they have often proven so redoubtable it was odd to see Brighton so racked with nerves against Huddersfield. Clearances were sliced and passes underhit, and that is before you take into account Shane Duffy’s awful backpass for Huddersfield’s equaliser. On chances created Brighton still deserved to win, and comfortably. David Wagner seemed pleased with the way his team controlled possession in the second half, but they created little. Chris Hughton, meanwhile, took a question about his team’s obvious anxiety and turned it into an answer about pressing high. But Hughton’s deflection is likely less a sign of weakness than an effort to contain any outbreak of the collywobbles. These two teams now face very similar run-ins in a bid to stay up. It will be interesting to see whose approach fares better. Paul MacInnes • Match report: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 1-1 Huddersfield Town 4) Arnautovic lays old reputation to rest with tireless shift Marko Arnautovic is a reformed maverick. For most of his time in England he has been perceived as a lazy and erratic wide forward, albeit an obviously talented one. Under David Moyes he has been reinvented and at Stamford Bridge he embraced the misery of playing up front on his own. The former England striker Andy Cole this week described being a lone striker as the “graveyard shift”. In the past Arnautovic might have turned his nose up; instead he rolled his sleeves up and worked like a beast. He had no worthwhile support until the introduction of Javier Hernández – and Arnautovic instantly made the equaliser with a superb cutback that allowed Hernández to demonstrate his finishing expertise. Arnautovic nearly won a penaltynear the end but for a good challenge by N’Golo Kanté after a brilliant solo run, and in stoppage time he was back in his own area blocking crosses. The maverick has turned into a talisman. Rob Smyth • Match report: Chelsea 1-1 West Ham United • Barney Ronay: Ray Wilkins given fond farewell on day for goodbyes 5) Klopp trials new-look midfield ahead of City showdown While there were some unfamiliar faces in Liverpool’s starting XI, the midfield was a rarity, featuring solely regulars. Yet this was not normal. Gini Wijnaldum had Jordan Henderson’s usual berth at the base while the captain operated further forward. It is an experiment first adopted in pre‑season and revived with some haste because with Henderson suspended and Emre Can a doubt, the Dutchman may have to anchor the midfield against Manchester City in the Champions League. “That was obviously the plan to use the chance and it was good,” said Jürgen Klopp. “Gini is a brilliant player for an attacking wide midfielder. He is creative, he is good with the ball, he has good vision and he can jump to the roof.” It is a very Kloppian strategy, to use a box-to-box midfielder as the holding player. It reflects his brand of front‑foot football, but Liverpool and Wijnaldum may be on the back foot against City. Richard Jolly • Match report: Everton 0-0 Liverpool • Richard Jolly: numbers game fails to add up for Allardyce and Everton 6) Benítez’s brilliance should provide an object lesson to Ashley After seeing his Newcastle team practically secure their Premier League survival – and, indeed, move into the top half of the table – by winning at Leicester on Saturday, Rafael Benítez described himself as a PE teacher who is happy to have young pupils who are eager to learn. His players should be grateful for such masterful tutoring. Appointing Benítez is one of the smartest moves Mike Ashley has made as the club’s owner. Driving him away would be among the most risky. Ashley shrewdly banked on Benítez staying loyal to the club this season but must know that the Spaniard will not tolerate the limited ambitions for very long. And more clubs, surely, will try to lure the Spaniard away considering the fine job he has done with such limited resources. Sooner rather than later Ashley must either sell Newcastle, give the manager more funding, or lose a key asset. Paul Doyle • Match report: Leicester City 1-2 Newcastle United 7) Guardiola’s risky team selection could yet be vindicated Pep Guardiola may be questioned about fielding Raheem Sterling as centre-forward against Manchester United. But should he be? The manager had an eye on the Champions League quarter-final second leg against Liverpool on Tuesday and so decided to leave Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus on the bench. In came Sterling, with 21 goals this season, and he showed a striker’s instinct for moving into goalscoring positions at least twice in the first half. But he snatched at the chances and spurned the opportunity to kill off United. Given that City have the Liverpool game and a near-unassailable lead in the league, Guardiola’s decision to save Jesus and Agüero for Tuesday was correct. The hope, though, will be that Sterling’s confidence is not dented. To ensure it is not, the forward might be best advised to avoid replays of Guardiola’s furious disappointment at each of his misses.

The January signing from Galatasaray hit the ground running and his excellent display against Tottenham was right in character. Ndiaye drove Stoke on from midfield, offering several exhilarating reminders that the art of the tackle is not yet dead. One dynamic interception and pass led to a break from which Mame Biram Diouf, a Senegal team-mate, should have laid on a second equaliser. “He’s an absolute diamond of a guy, a great pro, and he’s been absolutely brilliant,” Paul Lambert said. “He has only been here more or less the time I’ve been here but he’s been outstanding.” Along with Xherdan Shaqiri and Joe Allen, Ndiaye is one of the few Stoke players who should be playing top-flight football next season no matter what. Nick Ames • Match report: Stoke City 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur 9) European adventure now firmly in Burnley’s sights Burnley playing European football conjures images of pounds, shillings, pence, and Pathé News. Turf Moor last welcomed competitive European opposition in 1967, when a 2-1 Eintracht Frankfurt victory ended their Inter‑Cities Fairs Cup hopes at the quarter‑final stage. A third season of continental adventure – Burnley reached the quarter-finals of the 1960-61 European Cup – is within touching distance. Their 2-1 victory at Watford maintained a grip on seventh place they have held for all but one week of 2018. That should be enough to reach the Europa League next season, with Manchester City winning the League Cup and Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals. How Sean Dyche might choose to prioritise the extra fixtures next season is, though, a consideration to dampen the romance. John Brewin • Match report: Watford 1-2 Burnley 10) Foster the remainer may find himself in minority Ben Foster has pledged his future to West Bromwich Albion next season irrespective of their likely relegation, but the question is how many of his team‑mates will do the same. “I’ll be here. I’ve got no interest in trying to move clubs,” said Foster, who has spent the past seven seasons at Albion. “I’m very settled and I’m sure there are quite a few others who would love to stay and help us get back to the Premier League.” Although the long-serving pair of Chris Brunt and Craig Dawson appear likely candidates to remain at the Hawthorns, Kieran Gibbs, Jonny Evans, Salomón Rondón and Jay Rodriguez are all expected to attract interest from Premier League clubs and question marks also hang over the future of so many other players. It will, in short, be quite a rebuilding job for the manager who is appointed to try to guide them back at the first attempt.

The tweets were in the timeline of Massimo Pinto, candidate for the Paston ward and a leading pro-Brexit campaigner in the area. The tweets, which date back to 2012 and 2013, are highly sexually explicit as well as misogynistic. One tweet also includes the hashtag “Peterborough #PlacesToNeverEverVisit”. The embarrassment comes as Ukip struggles to survive as a political force. Last month it lost a costly legal dispute and was left with over £100,000 of costs that threatened its solvency. Last week it announced that it had raised the funds through one-off donations from members. It also claimed to have collected £300,000 in a membership fundraising drive. In another cost-saving exercise, acting party leader Gerard Batten will stay on for at least a year to avoid the expense of a leadership contest. Batten is the fifth acting or elected Ukip leader since the Brexit referendum in 2016. In many parts of England in next month’s local elections, Ukip is understood to be running only a shadow campaign, contesting few of the approximately 4,000 seats. According to the Conservative election expert Robert Hayward, Ukip is hardly represented in some of the parts of England where it performed strongly ahead of the referendum. “In Sunderland, Hyndburn, Nuneaton and Fareham they are fielding either no candidates or one or two. In each of the authorities named, they fielded either a full slate of candidates in 2014 or virtually a full slate,” said Hayward. However, in Peterborough, Ukip has 13 candidates standing for 18 of the city council wards. More recently on Pinto’s account – which he has now locked – are pictures of the Ukip candidate at the start of the referendum campaign in 2016 with then Conservative MP Stewart Jackson. Ukip said they would look into the tweets. “The lad is deeply ashamed and embarrassed,” said a spokesman. “He can’t remember doing it, but he doesn’t claim he didn’t. It’s deeply unedifying and unpleasant, there’s no question about that, but it was six years ago. He’s terribly embarrassed and ashamed, as rightly he should be.” Pinto was vetted by the party before being approved as a candidate. The Ukip spokesman claimed Pinto had also passed Conservative vetting processes. Nominations for the elections closed on Friday and technically it is now impossible for a candidate to withdraw."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/08/exeter-gloucester-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T17:43:33Z","webTitle":"Jack Nowell caps return with two tries to help Exeter dismantle Gloucester","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/08/exeter-gloucester-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/08/exeter-gloucester-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jack Nowell caps return with two tries to help Exeter dismantle Gloucester","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Way back on the opening night of the season, Exeter began the defence of their Premiership title with a narrow injury-time defeat against Gloucester at Kingsholm. Those who took it as a sign the Chiefs might not hit the same lofty heights this season have been proved spectacularly wrong and here was yet more evidence of a team who feel they have more peaks to conquer. An eight-point cushion at the top of the table with only three games left has secured their place in the play-offs and, barring a dramatic twist, Rob Baxter’s side are now within touching distance of finishing top of the regular season log for the first time. Two tries for Jack Nowell off the bench in his first game back after a six-week absence with an ankle injury sustained during an England training session merely emphasised the depth of their options. This contest was over by half-time with Exeter 22-3 ahead in front of the watching England head coach, Eddie Jones, and the Rugby Football Union’s chief executive, Steve Brown. Jones will have been reassured to see Nowell back in try-scoring form and quietly encouraged by the energy of a clutch of other candidates to tour South Africa in June. Henry Slade, Alec Hepburn, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Sam Skinner, Sam Simmonds and Don Armand all look bright-eyed and full of running as the domestic season enters the final straight. “We can still go up another few gears, I think,” said Exeter’s head coach Ali Hepher, delighted with his players’ second-half energy after a physically sapping first 40 minutes. If this one-sided game was no classic in isolation, a chastened Gloucester were left in no doubt about the West Country’s current pecking order. More ominously still, the pitches are drying out and the less starry names on the Chiefs team sheet are improving by the week. Many of the club’s best days this season have featured the consistently impressive Skinner in the second row and there are few more mobile, busier looseheads in the country than Hepburn, the man of the match. The 25-year-old is now a capped international prop but he pops up so regularly at first receiver he could almost be wearing a double digit number on his back. The shaggy-haired forward can also do the less glamorous hard yards and duly burrowed his way over for his side’s first try after 18 minutes. Exeter might already have been ahead had Lachie Turner and Don Armand not failed to convert a straightforward two-on-one opportunity but it was apparent from early on that the visitors were in for a long afternoon. Virtually every time Slade touched the ball he looked a threat and the centre’s left-footed nudge to within five metres of the left corner also evoked memories of the Chiefs’ famous semi-final win against Saracens last season. Up soared Skinner to claim the lineout and over went Sam Simmonds, the same try scorer as 12 months ago. If it helped that Gloucester, after a bright start, made too many errors and struggled to get on the right side of the referee, the Chiefs are also reliably good at extracting maximum reward in the opposing 22. With Ruan Ackermann in the sin-bin just before half-time for slowing down Exeter ruck ball with a boot, Hepburn was once again swift to react, his pass giving Olly Woodburn the space to pierce the stretched visiting cover. “Alec can make passes normal props wouldn’t,” Hepher said. “He’s a hell of an asset to have in your side.” Gloucester’s head coach, Johan Ackermann, had also feared the worst from the early stages – “I felt after the first five minutes it wasn’t our day” – and his team’s chances of European qualification, let alone making the top four, now hinge on victories in their remaining two home games, against Harlequins and Bath, before they head to Saracens on the last weekend. A try against the run of play immediately after half-time from the replacement Calum Braley did yield some consolation but their heavy defensive workload caught up with them in the end. Nowell was the chief beneficiary, popping up in the 58th minute to secure the Chiefs a bonus point and then wriggling improbably out of a tackle – “there’s not many people in the country who can do that,” said Hepher – to cruise away for his second five minutes later. By the time Gareth Steenson collected a loose ball to score Exeter’s sixth try, Gloucester’s opening-night triumph had long since been avenged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/08/chelsea-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T17:47:40Z","webTitle":"Javier Hernández dents Chelsea’s top-four hopes as West Ham spy safety","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/08/chelsea-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/08/chelsea-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Javier Hernández dents Chelsea’s top-four hopes as West Ham spy safety","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The life of Ray Wilkins had been celebrated with gusto in this arena prior to kick-off, his death marked with the banners in the stands and flowers and a vintage No 8 shirt placed on the assistant manager’s seat in the home dugout. Both sets of fans had warmed to glimpses of the former Chelsea midfielder turned coach in action, clips that spanned eras beamed out over the big screens at either end of the ground, with West Ham’s support bellowing out their own admiration in unison. The tributes were heartfelt and fitting. So it was to the 2016-17 champions’ exasperation that their side could not then produce the victory that would have so thrilled Wilkins from his seat just in front of the pressbox. The season-ticket holder would have rejoiced in some of his favourites’ attacking play, particularly when they were dominant through a one-sided opening period, and might have enjoyed the frantic intensity of the last quarter-hour once the visitors had plucked parity from nowhere. But, in reality, he would have cursed the fact Chelsea’s campaign is petering out in frustration. This draw left Antonio Conte’s side 10 points off Tottenham with only six games still to play and there was a smattering of boos at the final whistle. Chelsea have won only three league games this calendar year, their prospects of qualifying for the Champions League fading with each hiccup, and the head coach bemoaning the same inadequacies. Profligacy means the gap to fourth widened. “We must be realistic: if we are not able to win this type of game, we are talking about what?” the Italian grumbled. “You must win this game if you want to reach a target, the Champions League. Because the other teams are clinical, they are ready to suffer and win the game. At the end of the season, we’ll have struggled a lot. This game describes our whole season.” That summed it up. There were hints of brilliance, not least in the zest of Chelsea’s early approach play, which had threatened to sweep aside West Ham, but it was not only Joe Hart’s brilliance that kept the scoreline decent. The home side’s front three seemed to feed off N’Golo Kanté’s energy through the centre, the Frenchman a frenzy of interceptions and short passes, cajoling Cesc Fàbregas into action at his side. Willian and Eden Hazard were a blur of movement ahead of them and, when they clicked, that combination sliced through their opponents almost at will. Some of their more intricate play took the breath away, summed up when Fàbregas slid a pass from deep to prompt a rat-a-tat exchange at pace between Hazard and Álvaro Morata, with the Belgian smartly liberating Willian. Only Hart’s sharp save with his outstretched left leg denied the Brazilian as he bore down on goal. It was a fine intervention – the first of many from England’s current third choice – so to ship a goal from Hazard’s resultant corner, played short, seemed horribly careless on the visitors’ part. Victor Moses’ centre was looped towards the far post and nodded down far too easily by Morata, in amid grounded opponents. César Azpilicueta duly flicked up and away from a dozy Marko Arnautovic, dangling a leg weakly, with the Spaniard able to poke the loose ball into the far corner from five yards out. West Ham’s defenders had rather stumbled into the concession, concentration lapsing while they marvelled at Hart’s original save. “It was a really poxy goal to concede,” David Moyes offered. Yet, crucially, the visitors survived everything flung at them thereafter. Willian and Moses fired wide. Morata, with goals in his previous two games, was twice rightly flagged offside as he poked home – a reflection perhaps of anxiety as much as eagerness – with the script increasingly predictable. Arnautovic had fluffed the visitors’ best first-half opportunity, from Arthur Masuaku’s delicious diagonal, but the Austrian would make his presence felt before the end. Mark Noble launched an optimistic pass into the penalty area 17 minutes from time, with Gary Cahill’s header indecisive, neither a pass to a team-mate nor a clearance, with Arnautovic quick to the loose ball to pull back a centre. There loitered Javier Hernández, a regular scorer as a substitute against these opponents, to fizz a shot inside Thibaut Courtois’s post with his first touch of the contest. Everything in what time remained was frenetic, from Hart’s fine stops to deny Marcos Alonso and Olivier Giroud, to Kanté’s timely challenge on Arnautovic, bustling free of the home side’s backline. “Any player other than Kanté wouldn’t have caught up with Marko but I’d rather talk about how well the team kept at it,” Moyes said. “That level of form will be good for Joe, too. We played against a really slick Chelsea team, particularly in the first half, so I’m not disappointed with a draw.” His team are now six points clear of the bottom three and can sense safety. For Chelsea, the frustration merely mounts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/08/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-la-liga-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T17:17:32Z","webTitle":"Griezmann earns Atlético a draw after Ronaldo scores for Real Madrid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/08/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-la-liga-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/08/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-la-liga-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Griezmann earns Atlético a draw after Ronaldo scores for Real Madrid","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Neither of us can compete to win the league,” the Atlético Madrid president, Enrique Cerezo, said. If it was true before the game when he said it, it is even more true after it. A 1-1 draw, secured with goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Antoine Griezmann, leaves Atlético 11 points behind Barcelona at the top of the table. It also leaves them four points clear of Real Madrid with seven matches remaining. They have now been here five years in a row without losing in the league; this has become a real rivalry and this was a competitive derby, despite the suggestion that it would be “decaffeinated”. The result suited Atlético more, and it was the home side that sought the victory at the end, a superb save from Jan Oblak denying Sergio Ramos in the 90th minute. They did not want a draw, although that its importance was relative was perhaps revealed when Ronaldo was withdrawn after an hour. Both these sides almost certainly have European semi-finals ahead of them. What they do not have is a title race any more – but then they have known that for some time. The game was only 80 seconds in when Gareth Bale let the ball run through his legs and raced away from Diego Godín out on the right touchline, and while the move ultimately came to nothing, it did come as a warning. Real Madrid began on the front foot, the corner count climbing rapidly, Stefan Savic standing in the way of a series of shots and crosses that started with Marcelo just three minutes later. Soon after, Marco Asensio’s shot hit Godín, and then Toni Kroos tumbled in the area, under a challenge from Juanfran. The shout was loud, but the referee wagged his finger. Real had possession and Atlético were ill at ease, although the game did begin to open up and suddenly, on the half-hour, Diego Costa was in on the right side, his shot struck hard and low at the near post, where Keylor Navas pushed it wide. Savic shot over and five minutes from the break Vitolo was away, wide space ahead of him beyond the defence only for the flag to be raised – despite the fact that he had set off from well inside his own half. Bale headed left from his starting point in the centre. From there, he clipped a lovely ball with the outside of the boot to Lucas Vázquez before a triple chance came – one shot blocked, one thundering off the bar, from Marcelo, and the third pushed away superbly by Oblak. Dani Carvajal had hit it. Oblak is not easily beaten but nor is he unbeatable. Eight minutes into the second half, Bale delivered a long, looping cross from the left. Lucas appeared to misjudge it, the ball dropping just behind him where Ronaldo was waiting and as it fell he volleyed it into the far corner. Atlético’s response was swift. Saúl drew a save from Navas and then Griezmann slipped the ball into the area for Vitolo. Navas was out to him but the rebound came to Griezmann to score. Atlético were level and might have led too, when Navas denied Koke from close range with a superb save. Atlético found ways through Madrid now, Griezmann’s shot blocked, Savic’s effort just wide. Ronaldo departed after but Real pressed, Marcelo at the heart of most of it, even if Atlético carried a threat still and Griezmann’s ball for Ángel Correa rolled across the face of goal. As the clock ticked down, Real piled into the area, where Bale turned but was snuffed out, Kroos shot over and, after an outrageous touch from Marcelo, Vázquez went down earning only a yellow card for diving. With 10 seconds left, Real won a free-kick. Ramos stood over it, him again – the man whose 93rd minute goal had denied Atlético the European Cup. Not this time, though. His curling shot was heading for the top corner but Oblak flew and pushed it away. From the corner, Ramos came steaming in one more time but he would not score this time either, his header flying over. Neither of these teams will win the league and neither of them won the derby."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/08/police-cuts-likely-contributed-to-rise-in-violent-leaked-report-reveals","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T23:00:15Z","webTitle":"Police cuts ‘likely contributed’ to rise in violent crime, leaked report reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/08/police-cuts-likely-contributed-to-rise-in-violent-leaked-report-reveals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/08/police-cuts-likely-contributed-to-rise-in-violent-leaked-report-reveals","fields":{"headline":"Police cuts ‘likely contributed’ to rise in violent crime, leaked report reveals","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Government cuts to the police “may have encouraged” violent offenders and have “likely contributed” to a rise in serious violent crime, leaked Home Office documents have revealed. The documents cast doubt on claims by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, on Sunday that cuts to the police were not to blame for rising violence. The Home Office said it would not comment on leaked documents. Rudd will on Monday launch a strategy aimed at tackling serious violent crime, which officials and ministers have been working on for months. The launch comes after a week of shooting and stabbing deaths pushed the homicide rate in London to more than 50 lives lost this year. The home secretary believes the strategy will mark a change in the approach to tackling serious violence, placing an equal emphasis on prevention and diverting youngsters from violence, as well as on strong law enforcement. But the row over funding for the police threatens to overshadow the government’s new anti-violence strategy. Since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 police budgets have been cut, and officer numbers have fallen by more than 20,000. Labour and the police have claimed funding reductions have jeopardised public safety. Home Office statistics show the number of police officers fell from 143,734 in March 2010 to 123,142 in March 2017. Figures released in November showed a 20% annual rise in gun, knife and serious violent crime across England and Wales, even as the crime survey estimated there had been a 9% overall drop in crime. The Home Office said “traditional crime” nationwide had dropped by almost 40% since 2010. As part of the preparations for the new strategy, which will include tougher powers to seize acid from people who cannot provide a reason for carrying it, and a crackdown on so-called zombie knives, officials in February prepared a document on the factors behind the rise in violent crime, marked as “official – sensitive”. The document is entitled Serious violence; latest evidence on the drivers. A section on police resources says: “Since 2012/3, weighted crime demand on the police has risen, largely due to growth in recorded sex offences. At the same time officers’ numbers have fallen by 5% since 2014. “So resources dedicated to serious violence have come under pressure and charge rates have dropped. This may have encouraged offenders. “[It is] unlikely to be the factor that triggered the shift in serious violence, but may be an underlying driver that has allowed the rise to continue.” A highlighted box emphasises that point: “Not the main driver but has likely contributed.” Another section, entitled Implications for strategy, says: “The implications are challenging. There is good evidence that increasing resources dedicated to targeting hot-spots and prolific offenders can be effective, but there are several competing demands for any additional resource.” The document also says that it was unlikely that “lack of deterrence” was the catalyst for the rise in serious violence. “Forces with the biggest falls in police numbers are not seeing the biggest rises in serious violence.” Writing before the launch of her strategy to counter violence, Rudd said in a Sunday Telegraph article: “While I understand that police are facing emerging threats and new pressures – leading us to increase total investment in policing – the evidence does not bear out claims that resources are to blame for rising violence. “In the early [90s], when serious violent crimes were at their highest, police numbers were rising. In 2008, when knife crime was far greater than the lows we saw in 2013-14, police numbers were close to the highest we’d seen in decades.” Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: “The government’s own analysis seems to suggest that cuts to police officer numbers have had an effect in encouraging violent offences. If true this blows apart the Tories’ repeated claims that their cuts have had no effect.” Labour has long believed that Conservative cuts to police budgets and the consequent fall in officer numbers is a vulnerability for the government. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will announce he is to preside over a roundtable of police officers, violent crime victims and experts as he launches his party’s local election campaign and will say: “Over the last eight years the Conservative government has decimated local services, the core services that are an essential part of holding our communities together. “You simply cannot maintain community cohesion when you slash funding to the police service and cut the number of officers on our streets by 21,000.” Launching the raft of plans aimed at reversing rising violent crime, Rudd will say: “This strategy represents a real step-change in the way we think about and respond to these personal tragedies, these gruesome violent crimes which dominate the front pages of our newspapers with seemingly depressing regularity. “A crucial part of our approach will be focusing on and investing more in prevention and early intervention. “We need to engage with our young people early and to provide the incentives and credible alternatives that will prevent them from being drawn into crime in the first place.” Rudd will not follow the example of initiatives in Scotland, which treated rising violence as a “public health” issue, but borrow some of what was learnt from it. The research underpinning the strategy found that half the rise in robbery, knife and gun crime can be explained by improvements in police recording. The strategy identifies rising crack cocaine use as a “key driver” behind rising violence, and also for fuelling urban crime gangs moving into rural areas to sell drugs, known as “county lines”. Between 2014-15 and 2016-17, killings where either the victim or suspect were involved in using or dealing illegal drugs increased from 50% to 57%, according to Home Office figures. In addition, there has been a 14% rise people seeking treatment for crack cocaine between 2015/16 and 2016/17. More pressure will be put on social media companies to take down content glamorising or celebrating violence or perpetuating gang feuds, but there are no plans for legislation. The new serious violence strategy will not involve ministers reversing their position on stop and search, contrary to some reports, officials said. The spate of shooting and stabbing deaths in London last week, abated over the weekend, with no more reported. Police chiefs ordered 300 extra officers on to the streets, but that is at best a short-term measure. The Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, has warned her force will struggle with the additional cuts it has to make, as police numbers across the capital are predicted to fall to 28,000 if funding is further squeezed. She spoke in October of the need to find hundreds of millions of pounds worth of savings on top of the £600m of cuts the Met had already made: “I find it incredible that anybody would think that over the next four or five years we should lose that much extra out of our budget.” In his last speech as incumbent in February 2017, Dick’s predecessor Sir Bernard (now Lord) Hogan-Howe said financial pressures put the police under pressure and “there are some warning lights flashing”. Neil Basu, the head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, warned in a Guardian interview in November that national security was being endangered by cuts to local policing, which amount to a potential disaster in the fight to stop terrorism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/09/young-people-cheated-skills-jobs-brexit-education","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T05:00:51Z","webTitle":"Young people are being cheated of the skills needed to get good jobs | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/09/young-people-cheated-skills-jobs-brexit-education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/09/young-people-cheated-skills-jobs-brexit-education","fields":{"headline":"Young people are being cheated of the skills needed to get good jobs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This week marks a year since the launch of an apprenticeship levy on large employers – a good plan to urge them to claim the money back for training. But the sorry result so far has been a catastrophic drop in apprentice numbers in England, with 59% fewer starting in the quarter to November. The Open University found that businesses paid £1.39bn into the levy but drew down just £108m for training, because they wrote off the levy as just another tax. Some employers reject the new higher standards for apprenticeships that were introduced with the levy. They have been unwilling to create quality apprenticeships that must last at least a year, with a day a week for training courses. What companies had previously badged “apprenticeships” were often low-quality internal training of older staff. Research by the Resolution Foundation found that fewer than half of the trainees even knew they were apprentices. The shortage of construction skills is the worst ever recorded, with the Construction Industry Training Board reporting a 31,600 shortfall of new skilled workers a year. Without them, there is no hope of building the government’s target of 300,000 new homes. Plenty want to learn those skills, which would lead to well-paid jobs. Yet a rising number of young people – more than 203,400 last year – are taking useless, “dead end” construction courses that leave them with no NVQ and no job. Only 10% are real apprenticeships attached to work: the rest are classroom-only courses offering no recognised qualification, with no employer willing to take them on. If this cheating of young trainees happened to university students, imagine the political outrage. Look at the scandal involving Learndirect, which is at risk of closure when its contracts with the Department for Education end in July, having been terminated last August after the publication of a damning Ofsted report that rated it “inadequate”. More than half of its apprentice trainees due to finish their course last year failed to achieve their qualification. Yet this former state-run service, privatised by the Cameron government, had £631m state funding since 2011. Gordon Marsden, Labour’s long-serving shadow skills minister, points to other private training companies that have gone bust, leaving trainees with student loan company debts and nothing else – John Frank Training, Focus Training and Edudo among them. A world of difference divides young people on the university route from all the rest. No one put it more pithily than Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, describing how even he had struggled in his search for apprenticeship choices for his non-academic son. “It is staggeringly hard even to find the right opportunities,” he said, referring to the ease of Ucas compared with the impenetrable thickets of training options. Everyone salutes gold-standard apprenticeships: more apply for each place at Rolls-Royce, Siemens or British Aerospace than for those at Oxbridge. Higher apprenticeships that offer degrees and earning while you learn, without building up astronomic debt, look a prime option, but they are vanishingly rare. And skills minister Anne Milton told the Commons education committee there is now “middle-class capture” of the few top schemes. The government has set a target of 3 million apprenticeships by 2020. Even Milton can’t say where this magical number was plucked from, but in order to reach it, any old course, however useless – such as the three-month, low-quality retail courses that don’t lead to jobs – will be rebadged as an apprenticeship. At least now the minimum standard has been raised. Theresa May has announced a review of post-school education but the fear is that it springs less from vocational concern than a search for eye-catching alternatives to Jeremy Corbyn’s free tuition fees that stole her majority. She can’t outbid him, but lower interest rates or lower fees for cheaper university courses is where votes will be won, even though top-quality training is the real economic imperative. As Johnson says: “It is our failure to get enough young people into high-quality, job-based training at 18 that creates our skills shortages, low wages and productivity problems.” Brexit turbo-charges the need for German-style technical education when the door slams shut on importing the skills we lack. If Brexiteers’ anti-migrant rhetoric had any useful purpose, it should have created a sense of national emergency towards skills training for school-leavers. And if you are looking for multiple causes of the upsurge in knife crime, start with the abysmal flatlining numbers of 16- to 24-year-olds not in education, employment or training; there are still 600,000 of them. You have to doubt the good faith of a government that has made further education bear the brunt of cuts and cut adult education, including courses teaching English as a second language, which is vital for getting migrants into jobs, especially women, by 60%. No government that causes a 10% drop in trainee nurses by abolishing bursaries can be serious about skill shortages. Policy is made by graduates at Westminster and Whitehall who know nothing but the A-level and degree route they and their children took. Given her back story, Angela Rayner might radically change priorities if she took over at education: there were strong rumours that this FE–educated politician opposed Labour committing £11bn for free tuition fees for middle-class students. But in all parties, the political demands of the university classes win out. For decades, all governments have claimed good intentions, but they have only reorganised vocational acronyms and myriad confusing qualifications, without resources or genuine political effort. New T-levels for technical courses are supposed to start next year with the high ambition of “parity of esteem” with A-levels, but again they are underprepared and underfunded. Everyone knows it, everyone admits it, snobbery is endemic. May herself identified social class as the problem: this is about “other people’s children”, she said last month, promising to make Britain a “great meritocracy”. But since her first prime ministerial speech, she has been as good at naming “burning injustices” as she has been bad at solving them. It needs a revolution in political attitudes to focus the next decade on the other half of school-leavers. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist • This article was amended on 12 April 2018 to clarify two points.

Dozens of people in the remaining rebel-held suburbs of Damascus were suffocated by Saturday’s chemical attack on the Douma district. This is not the first time this has happened. Since the use of sarin at Khan al-Assal in 2013 there have been dozens of chemical attacks by the regime. These deliberate attacks on civilians show callous contempt for humanity and disregard for the laws of war. Official Syrian claims that the latest killings have been fabricated are beneath contempt. Yet Bashar al-Assad has again used chemical weapons for two reasons that shame others, as well as him. First, he has done it because he has the means and the will. Second, he has done it because he knows he can get away with it. His crimes are his own. But they have been made possible, among other things, by the failure of any effective legal, diplomatic and military sanctions. Some may ask why, since the slow throttling of Damascus’s eastern Ghouta suburbs seems to be approaching a grisly climax, the government feels any need to breach one of the oldest taboos in warfare once more. To answer that adequately it is necessary to delve into the darkest places of the psychology of a regime that celebrates the overwhelming use of force, the need to terrorise civilians and the right to punish opponents indiscriminately as a weapon of policy. It should come as no surprise, though, not least in the light of the Skripal poisoning, that Russia bears a major share of responsibility. The Syrian air force was able to bomb Douma because Russia controls western Syria’s airspace. Russian advisers are present at the airbases from which Syrian missions fly. The Russians may not be closely involved in individual Syrian decisions. But they provide active military and diplomatic cover for the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons. Russia’s implacable veto at the United Nations over any effective countermeasures has provided a green light to the Assad regime to kill its own children. Yet American policy is scarcely more defensible, either in general or in the specific case of Saturday’s attack. In the wake of Iraq, US policy was indecisive under Barack Obama. It is now downright chaotic under Donald Trump. A year ago, after a chemical attack by the Syrian government killed dozens of people in Khan Sheikhun, Mr Trump sprayed 59 cruise missiles on the airbase from which the attack missions had been flown. Since then, US policy on Syria has repeatedly flip-flopped, especially towards the Kurds. In January, the then secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, pledged that US forces would remain in Syria well after any defeat of so-called Islamic State. A week ago Mr Trump countermanded that, saying “it’s time” to bring US troops home. A day later he changed again, saying the troops would stay for months. It would hardly have been surprising if the Assad regime sensed an opportunity. On Sunday Mr Trump threatened that Mr Assad would pay a “big price”. But the truth is that the US is increasingly marginalised. The imminent fall of eastern Ghouta will not mark the end of the Syrian conflict. It is more likely to mark a new phase. With Damascus more secure, and Isis quiescent at least temporarily, the country will be effectively divided in three. The Assad regime is sponsored by Iran and Russia; the Kurds are still under the uncertain protection of the US; an area north of Aleppo is Turkish-controlled. This is hardly more stable than when the anti-Assad revolt began in 2011. Without an unlikely diplomatic solution, the tragic deaths in Douma are unlikely to be the last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/08/cecil-taylor-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T15:54:41Z","webTitle":"Cecil Taylor obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/08/cecil-taylor-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/08/cecil-taylor-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Cecil Taylor obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The maverick African-American jazz pianist and poet Cecil Taylor, who has died aged 89, gave an impression of constant motion and restless speed. He fused a virtuosic classical technique and an improvisational jazz one in a frenzy of fingerwork augmented by pounding fists and elbows, blurring quicksilver sequences of notes into firestorms of sound. An elfin figure with dreadlocks flying, darting, crouching and twisting like the ballet dancers with whom he had a lifelong affinity, he moved with impulsive speed onstage or off. Verbally, he unleashed streams of disparate thought splicing philosophy – he read Schopenhauer at his mother’s suggestion as a child – politics, poetry, anecdote and in-the-moment observation. For much of his career, Taylor remained an uncategorisable one-off both personally and artistically. There always seemed to be too much crowding into his consciousness to process in one lifetime, but witnessing him endlessly wrestling with it was the source of his immense charisma in the left-field world of experimental contemporary music and free jazz. Though the childhood classical-piano prodigy was initially hailed as a promising newcomer, for his remarkable 1956 album debut, Jazz Advance, and widely noted appearances at New York’s Five Spot club and at the 1957 Newport jazz festival, Taylor’s growing experimentalism was mostly rejected by commercial promoters for the first two decades of his career. In 1962 he even faced the frustrating contradiction of becoming Down Beat magazine’s New Star in its piano category at a time when he was out of work, and had been forced to disband his quartet with the saxophonist Archie Shepp. But Taylor nonetheless found ways to make music with some of the most creative descendants and developers of the 1940s bebop revolution of Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk. The saxophonists Albert Ayler, Steve Lacy, Sam Rivers and Shepp, bassists Henry Grimes and Alan Silva, and the drummers Sunny Murray and Andrew Cyrille were participants in the pianist’s informal circle in the 60s – players of a stylistically looser post-bebop generation, receptive and technically adaptable enough to thrive in Taylor’s tumultuous soundworld. By the early 70s, however (helped by growing fame in Europe), he was getting busy enough to transcend the economy of welfare subsistence and dishwashing jobs he had depended on for 15 years or more. Taylor briefly worked as a college teacher (though he was too imperiously dismissive of less mercurial minds than his to be an educator), won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973, toured in Europe and Japan, performed at Jimmy Carter’s White House in 1978, composed for the ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1979 and was enthusiastically embraced by Europe’s burgeoning free-jazz movement in the following decade. When he received a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award in 1990, and a generous MacArthur Foundation grant in 1991, Taylor began to experience something like financial security for a life obsessively devoted to bringing experimental music-making out of the shadows, and surviving as an enduring beacon for adventurous performance artists all over the world. Born in Long Island City, Queens, in New York, Cecil was raised in nearby Corona, the only child of Percy Taylor, a chef, and his second wife, Almeida (nee Ragland), a multilingual former actor and dancer, and a jazz-devoted amateur pianist. She regretted her son’s disinclination to become a lawyer or a doctor, but encouraged his interest in jazz and the piano. He was devastated by her death when he was only 14, and told me in 1988 that he believed he had developed intestinal ulcers as a teenager because he thought her disappointment when he played hookey from school had killed her. In the early 50s, he studied classical piano at the New York College of Music in Manhattan and then at the New England Conservatory in Boston, where he also immersed himself in the composing methods of Stravinsky, Bartók and Elliott Carter. He started visiting jazz clubs, becoming intrigued by the piano methods of Duke Ellington, Bud Powell, the sophisticated but overlooked Cool School pianist Dick Twardzik, Dave Brubeck (for the density of his chords), Monk, and the earthy, blues-rooted Horace Silver. Taylor made the Jazz Advance album for the Transition label with a band including Lacy and the jazz/classical bassist Buell Neidlinger, who was to become a lifelong collaborator. It became one of the most acclaimed recording debuts in jazz, for Taylor’s radical but sympathetic development of blues and ballad forms, and imaginative stretching of Monk’s already radical rhythmic approach. Indicating in his own compositions that he was moving beyond jazz’s traditional song-form structures and melodies, he recorded a session reprising the rugged hard-bop style with John Coltrane in 1958, and confirmed his growing ingenuity and jagged melodic conception in his contributions to the 1961 Gil Evans and Johnny Carisi session, Into the Hot. The following year, and into 1963, Taylor’s trio with Jimmy Lyons and Sunny Murray played a long tour of Scandinavia. Their performances from Cafe Montmartre in Copenhagen have become legendary episodes of early free jazz, even if the recordings’ audio qualities left something to be desired. In 1964, Taylor became firmly associated with the vanguard of contemporary jazz, joining the cooperative Jazz Composers Guild and later with the Jazz Composers Orchestra that included Carla Bley and Michael Mantler. But it was the album Unit Structures (1966) that showed just how far Taylor had distanced himself from the jazz mainstream, and developed a language that only he and a handful of alert and skilful partners could share. Some of the music was written, but not in conventional notation, and much of it was improvised within Taylor’s loose guidelines. Interlocking sequences of musical cells, sometimes predominantly melodic, sometimes percussive, now replaced chord sequences, or narratives reflecting the shapes of songs. As well as in versions of his Cecil Taylor Unit album, the pianist also went on to perform widely as an unaccompanied soloist – documented on such diverse recordings as the Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! (1980) and For Olim (1986). Taylor’s solo shows were often extraordinary episodes in which he would duck and dance around the piano as well as thunderously (and sometimes lyrically) play it, and intently recite anything from observations on Aztec culture to zoology and aesthetics. It was a personal performance art through which Taylor sought to connect his polymathic self-education, knowledge of jazz and European classical music, and the African-American traditions of dance and communal celebration. He also fruitfully came to favour the duo form as an improviser – with the great bebop drums pioneer Max Roach, with free-music innovators and performance artists including the Amsterdam-based cellist Tristan Honsinger, British percussionist Tony Oxley, and Japanese dancer Min Tanaka, among many. His fellow artists’ gratitude for his liberating influence on techniques and conceptions in free jazz, improvised music and exploratory composition found its most generous expression at a month-long festival devoted to him in East and West Berlin in 1988, released as the multidisc FMP set Cecil Taylor in Berlin ’88. In 1991 he told the New York Times, in the context of queries about his sexuality, that gay was a three-letter word that did not come near defining the complexity of his humanity. Into the 21st century, Taylor lived as quietly and alone in his Brooklyn house in later years as a firebrand like him could, but sustained his piano virtuosity into his 80s, continuing sporadically to play clubs, concerts and museum spaces. He won Japan’s half-million-dollar Kyoto Prize in November 2013 for his contribution to the “cultural, and spiritual betterment of mankind”, but was allegedly defrauded out of much of it by a purported friend who had accompanied him to Kyoto to collect it – a disaster that probably brought Taylor bigger headlines than his work had ever done. In 2015 he performed a haunting tribute to Ornette Coleman at the latter’s funeral and the following year played with Oxley and Tanaka at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, as part of an exhibition and residency in his honour. The New Yorker critic Alex Ross called Taylor “one of the greatest, most unswervingly original, most incorrigibly sublime figures in the recent history of music” - and “incorrigibly sublime” neatly nails the power of this unique figure. Taylor’s was an art with all its own terrifying and inspirational beauty, fuelled by perceptions of life and art over which he plainly had no choice. • Cecil Percival Taylor, jazz pianist and poet, born 25 March 1929; died 5 April 2018 This article was corrected on 9 April 2018. The cellist Tristan Honsinger was born in the US. He is better described as Amsterdam-based rather than Dutch, as the piece originally said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/08/chelsea-west-ham-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T17:24:12Z","webTitle":"Chelsea 1-1 West Ham: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/08/chelsea-west-ham-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/08/chelsea-west-ham-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea 1-1 West Ham: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Chelsea are booed off, which is a bit harsh. They played pretty well and should have won, but Joe Hart made three excellent saves and the substitute Javier Hernandez scored an emphatic equaliser. West Ham are now six points clear of the relegation places, and should have more than enough to stay in this division. Thanks for your company, bye! Peep peep! That’s a terrific result for West Ham. 90+4 min Fabregas’s corner bounces across the box to Pedro, whose shot endangers low-flying aircraft in Stamford Bridge region. 90+4 min Arnautovic wins a corner for West Ham, who make a balls of an attempt to waste time. Chelsea’s break and Pedro’s shot deflects wide for a corner at the other end. 90+2 min Cahill heads straight at Hart, who saves comfortably. Joe Hart has had an excellent day. 90+2 min Willian’s cross is put behind for a corner by the heroic Arnautovic. Evra heads the corner clear. 90 min There will be five minutes of added time. 88 min Giroud’s towering header bounces up towards the far corner and is pushed onto the post by Joe Hart! It wasn’t quite as good as the earlier stop from Alonso but it was still high-class goalkeeping. 86 min Arnautovic almost wins it for West Ham! He flicked the ball one side of Azpilicueta and ran round the other before surging into the area. He was about to shoot when Kante appeared from the side to make a wonderful tackle. Arnautovic wanted a penalty but the referee wasn’t interested. Chelsea broke and Hazard’s low shot from a right angle was pushed away by Hart. Edit: I was wrong, it should have been a penalty to West Ham. Kante actually went through Arnautovic to win the ball, though that was only apparent after a few replays. 84 min A West Ham change: Josh Cullen replaces Joao Mario. 80 min This is pulsating stuff now, with both teams trying to win it. 79 min: Great save from Hart! Alonso turned on the edge of the area and hit a sizzling rising drive with almost no backlift. Hart flew to his right and fingertipped it over the bar. That was a brilliant stop. 78 min Arnautovic, who has been outstanding in the last 15 minutes, skins Rudiger and hits a cross that deflects wide off Cahill. 78 min And Olivier Giroud replaces Alvaro Morata. 78 min Chelsea make a change, with Pedro replacing Victor Moses. 76 min “The moronry of fantasy football teams is in a class of its own, I think,” says Charles Antaki. “We presume to be knowledgeable not only about form, fitness and statistical probability, but also on the tactical shrewdness of playing the various odds-enhancing jokers at just the right time, and so on and so forth. And were we but to know it, the leaderboard is composed either of very clever 13-year olds who can actually manage all of that, or of complete jammy beggars who get lucky every week. But I have Azpilicueta, hooray!” Yep. It’s a lamentable mess. Grown men and women panting furiously until they find out WHO GOT THE EFFING ASSIST. I hate myself for doing it, but I hated myself beforehand so it’s a no-lose no-lose really. And I’ve got Arnautovic, so. 75 min “Fritz Lung,” suggests Bjoern Treugut. 74 min The chance came from a mistake by Cahill, who headed a long ball across his own area. Arnautovic cut the ball back on the turn, and Hernandez finished like the expert he is. A goalscorer comes on as substitute and scores a goal straight away. It’s a brilliant finish from Hernandez, smacked low past Courtois from a really clever cutback by Arnautovic. 70 min Javier Hernandez, who scored some big goals against Chelsea in his time at Manchester United, replaces the disappointing Edmilson Fernandes. 69 min After a mistake from Masuaku, Moses sweeps a left-footed curler just wide of the far post. Good effort. 68 min A terrific cross from Moses is well cleared by the noggin of Ogbonna. 67 min We know 1-0 is a dangerous lead - almost as dangerous as 2-0, the most dangerous lead in christendom - but there is no real sense that West Ham are going to score. I’m surprised they haven’t brought Javier Hernandez on. Maybe goals are overrated. 65 min “You called Azpilicueta’s goal ‘Andrex-soft’,” says John. “It made me wonder if there’s a product placement bonus to be had from MBM-writing..?” What the Diesel L-QUAD Leather Biker Jacket are you talking about? 64 min “Kidney Poitier,” suggests Martin Utley. 63 min Cresswell is unable to continue. He’s replaced by Chelsea fan favourite Patrice Evra. 61 min Arnautovic really needs help. He’s playing Chelsea on his own. It’s a shame West Ham don’t have a proven goalscorer on the bench. 60 min “Film director anatomy?” says Dom. “How about Stanley Cuteprick? Or is that just homoerotica?” I don’t know about homoerotica, but it’s a heck of an unlikely typo. 59 min For the second time today, Morata has a goal disallowed for offside. This one came from Willian’s low cross, and... replays show it was again the right decision. Daft bugger, he’s in my fantasy team. (Yes, I have become a Fantasy Football Moron.) 58 min Cresswell is going to try to run it off, though at the moment it’s more of a hobble. 56 min Cresswell is in a lot of pain after landing awkwardly. The physio is on the field manipulating his ankle. 55 min Willian’s outswinging corner is headed over at the near post by Morata. That was a decent chance. 53 min West Ham started the match fairly well but it has been hopelessly one-sided since Chelsea took the lead. 51 min Another chance for Chelsea. Alonso’s low cross flashes past Willian in front of goal and is retrieved by Morata, who tees up Moses. He spanks the ball into orbit from the edge of the box. 48 min “Ian Copestake’s 36th-minute mentioning of ‘Brain de Palma’ made me wonder how many other celebrated directors might be typoed into a lesson in human biology,” says Mac Millings. “Venereal Herzog? Peter Jacksie? Alfred Itchcock?” 47 min A decent effort from Arnautovic, whose low shot from 20 yards is comfortably saved by the plunging Courtois. 47 min Willian misses an excellent chance, poking wide of the far post from 10 yards after a nice dragback from Hazard. 46 min Noble is booked for pulling Hazard back. 46 min Peep peep! West Ham begin the second half. Half-time reading Peep peep! That was an increasingly comfortable half for Chelsea, who played some classy stuff and then took the lead through a pathetic goal from Cesar Azpilicueta. West Ham look pretty toothless. See you in 10 minutes for the second half! 45 min “I don’t think there’s another manager quite like David Moyes,” says Joe Harvey. “Can’t think of another manager where the teams, when they’re good, look like they’re winning in spite of him, and when they’re bad, completely look like they’re ignoring every word he says. How frustrating it must be to be a West Ham fan to hire someone so synonymous with long, slow, demoralizing failure.” Don’t take this the wrong way, but have you forgotten his 11 years at Everton? 44 min West Ham have offered the square root of bugger all in attack. Arnautovic is far too isolated. 42 min There’s been some lovely link play between Hazard and Morata - reminiscent of Yorke and Cole in their angles, movement and use of the dummy. 40 min “In a non-Rooney response to Benjamin Park, if I may, I was far from expecting entertainment (after all I am not an entitled child), but I was not expecting such an assault of non-achievement on every level,” says Ian Copestake. “There was not a single element of satisfaction to be gained other than my need to watch it being ended by the ref’s whistle.” ‘An assault of non-achievement’ is a glorious phase, and one I will be stealing at the precise moment you read this. 38 min The original chance for Willian - which ultimately led to the goal - came from some beautiful quick passing between Fabregas, Morata and Hazard. When they play at pace they can be scintillating. Hart makes a brilliant save from Willian - but then Chelsea score from the corner. It’s an Andrex-soft goal, with West Ham’s defenders half asleep as Azpilicueta pokes a volley into the net from five yards. 36 min “Chelsea’s dominance brings to mind an observation made by the film critic Pauline Kael about the horror oeuvre of Brain de Palma,” says Ian Copestake with a formidably straight face. “In the end you want the tension to be broken by someone being killed/a goal being scored.” 35 min Arnautovic is getting no real support. Edmilson Fernandes is having a beast and Joao Mario has been peripheral. 34 min “Anybody who actually expected Everton v Liverpool to be exciting deserves the corresponding torture,” says Benjamin Park, who is great at parties. 33 min Whenever Chelsea quicken their pace of play they create something. Next stop, rocket science. 31 min A short corner is worked to Willian, who shapes a fine curling shot just wide of the near post. I think Hart had it covered, mind. 29 min Beautiful play from Chelsea. Hazard plays a one-two with Fabregas on the left side of the box and stabs a first-time cross towards the near post with the outside of his right foot. Morata improvises superbly to flick the ball behind his standing leg and just wide of the far post. 27 min Possession watch: Chelsea 63-37 West Ham. 26 min So much for my prediction of 4-2. 24 min Morata has a goal disallowed for offside. It was beautifully worked with Hazard but Morata made his run too early and was definitely offside. 22 min “Having delayed watching Everton v Liverpool till a matter of hours ago,” says Ian Copestake, “I feel my own bud has already been well and truly trimmed.” The video of that match will soon be used as an instrument of torture. 21 min Willian, who does look quite sharp, makes space for a left-footed shot that deflects wide off Cresswell. Azpilicueta heads the corner over at the near post, a half chance at best. 19 min West Ham are having a good share of this game, and will be encouraged by the fact that Chelsea are not exactly full of pizazz. 17 min “Dear Friend,” writes Hydroponic. “Are you looking for hydroponic bud trimmers? We are Chinese Factory producing all kinds of bud trimmers. With more than 10 years experience, our bud trimmer style is the most complete in China, no one could compete with us. We sell over 12 thousand pcs of bud trimmer each year!” 16 min A truly disgusting square pass from Fernandes goes straight to Willian, who zig-zags into the box and hits a low cross that is desperately cleared by a combination of Hart and Ogbonna. 14 min Masuaku drives a terrific pass over the top for Arnautovic, who controls the ball on the run and hits a shot that deflects behind off Cahill. As Andy Hinchcliffe says on commentary, perhaps Arnautovic should have taken that first time on the volley. By controlling it, he gave Cahill the chance to make the block. 13 min So who will/should be Chelsea’s manager next season? 11 min After a slow start, West Ham are looking more confident in possession. 8 min Chelsea have lost five of their last seven league games, their worst run since Jose Mourinho went rogue in 2015-16. 7 min Arnautovic seems okay for the time being, and almost gets on the end of Masuaku’s low cross. It’s kicked behind for a corner, which comes to nothing. 4 min Hazard scoots towards the area, moves the ball away from Ogbonna and whips a low shot from 20 yards that flashes fractionally wide of the far post. That was so close. 4 min Marko Arnautovic, who scored the winner against Chelsea earlier in the season, is struggling. It might be a hamstring problem. 3 min Hazard’s dummy allows the ball to run to WIllian, whose 20-yard shot is blocked. It’s been a lively start from Chelsea. 1 min Alvaro Morata gets the match under way. Chelsea are kicking from right to left, if you like to imagine these things in the televisual style. After a heartfelt minute’s applause in memory of Ray Wilkins, it’s time for the match to start. Prediction: Chelsea 4-2 West Ham It has finished Arsenal 3-2 Southampton, so West Ham still have a five-point cushion from the relegation places. Chelsea are now only two points ahead of Arsenal, though they have this match in hand. Good news for West Ham Arsenal have taken a 3-2 lead against Southampton through a sly foul from Jack Wilshere. And here’s one of his greatest goals, a comically nonchalant lob against Belgium at the European Championships. Here’s Ray speaking for the nation after England were robbed in Rotterdam in 1993 (NB: contains adult language) What were you doing when you were 18? Yep, me too. At the same age, Ray Wilkins was captain of Chelsea. Chelsea were Ray Wilkins’ boyhood club - and his adulthood club too. This is their first match since his death, and the club have set up a special area where fans can leave their tributes. Chelsea (3-4-2-1) Courtois; Azpilicueta, Rudiger, Cahill; Moses, Kante Fabregas, Alonso; Willian, Hazard; Morata. Substitutes: Caballero, Christensen, Emerson, Drinkwater, Bakayoko, Pedro, Giroud. West Ham (3-4-2-1) Hart; Rice, Ogbonna, Cresswell; Zabaleta, Kouyate, Noble, Masuaku; Fernandes, Joao Mario; Arnautovic. Substitutes: Adrian, Evra, Pask, Cullen, Diangana, Hugill, Hernandez. Referee Kevin Friend. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Glen Johnson derby from Stamford Bridge. It’s been a difficult season for Chelsea and West Ham, two clubs who seem addicted to discontent. Both could do with a result today, Chelsea in particular. They probably need to win their last seven games to have any chance of qualifying for the Champions League. West Ham should be safe, but it’s unwise to assume too much in what has been a logic-defying relegation battle. A draw today would be an excellent result, though they also have the chance to do the double over Chelsea for the first time since 2002-03. They were relegated that season, so I’m not quite sure what point I’m trying to make. Let’s move on.

City led 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday through goals by Vincent Kompany and Ilkay Gündogan. Yet after the break City crumbled as two Paul Pogba strikes and Chris Smalling’s 69th-minute winner ensured Guardiola’s team failed to win and thus missed a chance to claim the title. City were also shaky in the 3-0 defeat at Liverpool in the Champions League first leg last Wednesday and Guardiola is conscious that their aim to progress to the semi-finals has been made more difficult after the scars of the past week. If Liverpool score once City would need five goals to knock out Jürgen Klopp’s side. Asked if the memory of City’s collapse on Saturday could affect players’ minds if they were to go two ahead again, Guardiola said: “It’s difficult – difficult for our mood not winning and, yeah, that can happen. But maybe we will improve for the future regarding this – and realise that sometimes it is not enough what you’ve done [and need to do more] to win. “In the first half against United we tried to do what we’ve done all season but maybe it’s not enough to win at Champions League level or the Premier League. If that’s so I will have to recognise that I’m not good enough or the way we want to play is not able to do that. But I don’t think so because of what we’ve done this season – in the first half [against United], even in moments in the second half, I have to be happy. But when you play against Liverpool or in Europe when you have that momentum you have to close the door. And we didn’t close it against United.” Guardiola admitted concern at not being able to ensure his teams can maintain focus. “I thought many times about that. I’ve dropped a lot of Champions League games in the space of 10 or 15 minutes,” he said, offering an example of when he was Bayern Munich manager for a Champions League semi-final first leg in May 2015. “We were playing Barcelona and after 77 minutes it was 0-0, then after 90 minutes – 3-0. This has happened many times – maybe it’s my fault. I have to think about it.” Last year City allowed a 5-3 last‑16 first-leg lead over Monaco slip to a 6-6 aggregate defeat after the away leg and so were eliminated on away goals. Yet Guardiola did strike a defiant note. “When you dominate and create chances you are closer to winning games and this season showed that. But it’s impossible when opponents arrive four times and score three goals [like United] – there is no system that can stop that, so it is so complicated.” At Anfield the City manager dropped Raheem Sterling to play an extra midfielder in Gündogan. Against United he left Gabriel Jesus and Sergio Agüero on the bench, so started with no recognised No 9. Asked if those selections had been two errors, Guardiola said: “The first half [going two ahead] was a mistake? OK, we lost, I’m not right, you are right.” Sterling had missed several chances before the interval, and Guardiola said: “But he was there [for them]. We could be better but we could be worse. “Always when you don’t win you will have made mistakes but the first half was good. The second was not. But we played three days ago, our physicality was lower than United’s. Maybe the second half was a bit influenced by that. But football is a results business and the result was not good. I would like to correct that, to improve these kind of situations. “We kept going but when you have two one-against-ones [Sterling] and the Gündogan chance then if we go to 3-0, 4-0 the game is over. But at 2-0 the game is never over, especially in this league. Football at this level is about the [penalty] boxes. Real Madrid and Barcelona are always successful because they have players up front who, when they have half-chances, score two goals. To score goals is the most difficult thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/08/a-daft-waste-of-time-labour-pours-scorn-on-new-centrist-party","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T13:02:30Z","webTitle":"'A daft waste of time': Labour pours scorn on new centrist party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/08/a-daft-waste-of-time-labour-pours-scorn-on-new-centrist-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/08/a-daft-waste-of-time-labour-pours-scorn-on-new-centrist-party","fields":{"headline":"'A daft waste of time': Labour pours scorn on new centrist party","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Senior figures in the Labour party including John McDonnell have poured scorn on plans for a new centrist political party that is said to have secured £50m from financial backers, including the multimillionaire founder of LoveFilm. The movement, spearheaded by the former Labour donor Simon Franks and revealed by the Observer, has been secretly under development for more than a year and involves entrepreneurs, philanthropists and benefactors keen to break the Westminster mould. There has been persistent speculation about the potential for a new party as Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership has taken Labour to the left, while the Conservatives’ approach to Brexit has alienated some on that party’s modernising wing. The Liberal Democrats have so far failed to take advantage of the polarisation. But the plans for a new centrist party were dismissed by Labour shadow cabinet members, with the shadow chancellor tweeting: “That’s a novel idea. A party of the rich, by the rich, for the rich. A party for the few not the many.” The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: “For goodness sake, what a daft waste of time. Anyone putting money into this nonsense would be better off investing in our campaign to restore and rebuild our NHS.” Jon Trickett tweeted: “A new political party with £50m in the kitty, no members, no rule book, no ideology. Perhaps with support from sections of the British Establishment. A plaything for the rich? Let’s focus on the task in hand: building a social movement which will change our country for good.” Other Labour MPs also reacted with disdain. The MP for Norwich South, Clive Lewis, describing the new movement as an “establishment reboot job” for a “failed ideology”. Manchester Central’s Lucy Powell said: “Sounds like a bad idea, over-hyped.” The plan was even criticised by the arch-Blairite Lord Adonis, who was among those who formed the Social Democratic party in 1981. He said: “Labour and the Labour movement is the only means to defeat Brexit and bring about a radical reforming government. Believe me, I was a founder member of the SDP: it failed and we can’t fail this time, the stakes for the country are too high”. The movement, the latest in a line of new centrist parties but the only one to have such substantial financial backing, is understood to have been drawn up by a group frustrated by the tribal nature of politics, the polarisation caused by Brexit and the standard of political leadership on all sides. It appears to have a centre-left policy platform that borrows ideas from both left and right, including asking the rich to pay a fairer share of tax and better funding for the NHS, as well as ideas on wealth creation and tighter immigration controls. Franks, a philanthropist and businessman, has set up a company, Project One Movement for the UK, which is likely to be the vehicle for the enterprise. It is unclear whether the project will concentrate on funding community activism or becoming a formal political party. Senior figures from business and charity are understood to be involved, as well as former supporters of the main parties, including a number of former Tory donors. However, it is not yet trying to convince MPs to defect. The project appears to be the most significant attempt yet to challenge the main parties, joining a field including the anti-Brexit party Renew and grassroots activists’ party Advance. However, Britain’s electoral system and the reluctance of existing politicians to make the jump make it difficult to succeed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/09/saints-demons-afl-little-kilda-melbourne","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T02:00:46Z","webTitle":"Differences between Saints and Demons as they emerge from darkness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/09/saints-demons-afl-little-kilda-melbourne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/09/saints-demons-afl-little-kilda-melbourne","fields":{"headline":"Stark differences between Saints and Demons as they try to emerge from bleakness","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For all their effort in the first half, in the end, St Kilda were depleted and didn’t even have the energy for grief. As the owners of the league’s second-longest premiership drought and a mythology painted in the darkest of colours, you suspect the 19,000 fans who turned up weren’t a lot different. After three quarters, all the Saints had to show for 41 entries into their forward 50 was a miserable 4.12 – their goal-kicking a reflection of a night (a month) where they butchered the ball. Nowhere is this evident more than when their midfielders are kicking the ball into their forward line. It is little wonder the St Kilda forwards are so low on confidence ... or have none at all. There were moments on Saturday night when Paddy McCartin looked as if he feared that an AFL official might make their way into the three-quarter time huddle and whisper, discreetly in his ear, that there had been a terrible mistake and he must leave the ground. I think it was Faulkner who said that when you strike a match in the dark, it is not to see better, but to see how much darkness there is around. Anyway, when your light is the performance of a 22-year-old, second-game rookie ruckman from New Zealand, it’s pretty dark - and it might get darker yet. In the next month, St Kilda meet Geelong at Kardinia Park, the GWS Giants, Hawthorn in Tasmania and Melbourne. It was only last year when Melbourne and St Kilda were considered the two teams outside the top eight most likely to enjoy finals success. Neither side was as good as advertised in 2017, although Melbourne missing finals by half of one per cent following a performance entirely lacking any awareness of consequence was nothing if not on brand. But there is something a little different about these Demons, and part of that is the re-emergence of ruckman Max Gawn. In his News Corp column last month, Gawn wrote that he was caught and overtaken by virtually every ruckman in the competition (an honour he likely shared with his North Melbourne opponent, Todd Goldstein). But on the weekend, he was caught by nobody. “That’s up there with one of the best games I’ve seen him play,” said Melbourne coach Simon Goodwin of Gawn, who finished the day with 50 hit-outs and 23 centre-clearances as the Demons broke a 17-game losing streak against North. Melbourne had not beaten North since 2006, the last year the Demons played finals. And the form of Jesse Hogan, alongside Christians Petracca and Salem, suggest that hoodoo might be on its way to being broken. Hogan is a brute of a forward who, unlike his contemporaries at St Kilda, can impose his will on a game. In 2012, Hogan was named the All-Australian under-18 centre half back, while he was not yet old enough to be eligible for the draft. Taken from the Latin for “portent” prodigy, for centuries, had been equated with monster, and that is what Hogan is fast becoming if he is not there already. His work rate has lifted (to the point you could argue that his best work now is done outside the 50 – he was credited with five inside 50s on Saturday) and the poor body language that plagued his early years has gone. Petracca, who a month after turning 22 extended his contract with Melbourne through to 2020, is also an alloy of endurance and power. Only those who cannot stomach excellence unless it is diluted with fallibility would find him hard to admire. But it may be the early form of Salem that is pleasing Melbourne the most. The kid who knocked himself out by dropping a brick on his own head during Melbourne’s now infamous boot camp has struggled to find the continuity to realise the skill and composure that saw him selected by the Demons in the first round of the 2013 draft. Salem, who has played just 49 games and is now in his fifth season for the Demons, said earlier this year that he has already noticed a major difference in how he’s been able to prepare his body for a full season. Karl Newell, a kinesiologist at Penn State, said: “Consciousness gets in the way. If a pianist starts worrying where his fingers go while he’s playing, it will change the performance.” You suspect the opposite is true with Salem and his hamstring. If he can start playing without concerns about having to grab for it, we may soon see him realise his potential. Potential may be seen as a throwaway word for a club whose premiership drought extends beyond that of even St Kilda’s, and to break a 12-year, 17-game losing streak may look inconsequential alongside 54 years without a premiership. But a bleakness has been lifted, and with co-captain Jack Viney and 6ft 4in swingman Tom McDonald still to return, things are not as dark for the Melbourne Football Club as they were before."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/08/leicester-claude-puel-squad-unrest","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T21:29:40Z","webTitle":"Leicester mood sours as Claude Puel’s methods come under increased scrutiny","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/08/leicester-claude-puel-squad-unrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/08/leicester-claude-puel-squad-unrest","fields":{"headline":"Leicester mood sours as Claude Puel’s methods come under increased scrutiny","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Claude Puel’s managerial style is coming under scrutiny at Leicester City, where there is growing unease within the dressing room about his approach on the training ground and in particular the regular changing of the team. In a situation that has parallels with some of the difficulties that the Frenchman faced during his time in charge of Southampton last season, Puel appears to have a job on his hands to galvanise a Leicester squad that is becoming sceptical of his methods. There is no suggestion that Puel, who was appointed in October to replace Craig Shakespeare, is under pressure at boardroom level and it is possible that Leicester could still finish the season in seventh place and qualify for the Europa League. Yet those hopes are fading in the wake of a disappointing 2-1 home defeat against Newcastle on Saturday, which means Leicester have picked up only three points from their last four league games at the King Power Stadium, and other matters are starting to surface. It is understood that the unrest among the players in relation to the manager runs deeper than results and centres on concerns about the tempo and intensity of the training sessions as well as his team selection. Puel has named the same side only twice in the Premier League since taking over and has made 22 changes across the last seven top‑flight matches alone. While some of those decisions have been enforced because of injuries and suspensions, others have left players bemused and wondering what the thinking is behind them, partly because of an alleged lack of communication. Puel said after the Newcastle game that Leicester had “wasted a big opportunity” and admitted he shoulders the blame for the team starting games slowly.“I am the first one responsible because I am the manager,” he said. “It is my responsibility to give them the good mentality, the good tempo, the good motivation to start stronger in our games. In the two last games it’s not enough. Our aggressiveness, our desire, our tempo in the play was poor and we have to improve all these aspects.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/08/crowd-descends-on-labour-hq-to-protest-over-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T17:30:54Z","webTitle":"Crowd descends on Labour HQ to protest over antisemitism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/08/crowd-descends-on-labour-hq-to-protest-over-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/08/crowd-descends-on-labour-hq-to-protest-over-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Crowd descends on Labour HQ to protest over antisemitism","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hundreds of protesters have gathered outside Labour’s headquarters in London to campaign against antisemitism in the party. A crowd waving union flags and placards converged on the party HQ in Westminster on Sunday for a demonstration organised by the Campaign Against AntiSemitism. Messages on placards read “zero tolerance for antisemitism”, “Labour hold Corbyn to account” and “antisemitism is racism”. There were some shouts of “racist” and “shame”, and jeering when the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was mentioned by speakers at the rally. There were also boos for the Momentum leader, Jon Lansman, and for Christine Shawcroft, the former NEC member who resigned last month after backing a party member accused of antisemitism. The actor Maureen Lipman said she was attending the protest “as a disenfranchised socialist”. She said: “[Corbyn] is standing with elements who are against everything that we stand for: hardworking, decent Jewish people of whom I am incredibly proud.” A Labour party spokesman said: “As Jeremy Corbyn has strongly stated, Labour is committed to challenging and campaigning against antisemitism in all its forms. He has asked the new general secretary to make stamping it out her number one priority.” Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary, was the latest MP to be embroiled in the row after being named as a member of a Facebook group where offensive content was posted. It was reported that Gwynne was listed as a member of the Labour Supporters page on Facebook, where posts last week included one that said: “Jews will pay seven times more for their sins – Islam will unite the religious world.” Gwynne said: “I was added to this Facebook group without my knowledge or permission. I do not support the posts and I abhor antisemitism. It has absolutely no place in the Labour party or in society. End of.” Margaret Beckett, the former foreign secretary, has said that Labour needed to address antisemitism. She told BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend: “I don’t think anybody really now disputes that there are problems within the Labour party – of course I would dispute hotly that they are worse than anywhere else or than other political parties – but that doesn’t alter the fact that we have this problem and we must deal with it.” Beckett said some on the left who were guilty of antisemitism claimed they were being persecuted for their political beliefs. She added: “There is no doubt that there are people who are guilty of antisemitic actions and words and so on, who are pretending that it is only because they are really just good little leftwingers. I think that’s disgraceful and it brings them – but unfortunately other people around them – into disrepute and it’s incredibly unfair.” Corbyn said the Labour party had been too slow in dealing with cases of antisemitism and he apologised for the hurt it had caused."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/08/chief-icc-lawyer-calls-for-end-to-violence-along-gaza-border","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T17:38:48Z","webTitle":"Chief ICC lawyer calls for end to violence along Gaza border","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/chief-icc-lawyer-calls-for-end-to-violence-along-gaza-border","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/08/chief-icc-lawyer-calls-for-end-to-violence-along-gaza-border","fields":{"headline":"Chief ICC lawyer calls for end to violence along Gaza border","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court has called for an end to violence in Gaza after hundreds of mourners attended the funeral of a Palestinian journalist shot beside Israel’s security fence. Yasser Murtaja, a 31-year-old photographer, was wearing a clearly marked press vest as he reported on a mass demonstration along the Gaza border, in Khuzaa, on 6 April when he was shot. The area was engulfed in thick black smoke from tyres that had been set on fire. Murtaja was one of about 30 Palestinians killed by Israeli gunfire over the past 10 days along the border. As many as 491 people were wounded in last Friday’s protest against the founding of the Israeli state in 1948. Mass rallies are due to continue until 15 May. In a strongly worded statement, Fatou Bensouda, a lawyer from Gambia and the ICC’s chief prosecutor, based in The Hague, cautioned both sides about the “deteriorating situation”. She said: “Since 30 March 2018 at least 27 Palestinians have been reportedly killed by the Israeli defence forces, with over 1,000 more injured, many as a result of shootings using live ammunition and rubber bullets. “Violence against civilians, in a situation such as the one prevailing in Gaza, could constitute crimes under the Rome statute of the [ICC], as could the use of civilian presence for the purpose of shielding military activities.” The prosecutor’s office is conducting a preliminary examination of the situation in Palestine. “My office will continue to closely watch the situation and will record any instance of incitement or resort to unlawful force,” added Bensouda. Murtaja, who died overnight, was buried on Saturday. Colleagues said he was not affiliated with Hamas or any militant group. For his funeral his body was draped in a Palestinian flag. His flak jacket, emblazoned with the word “press”, was placed on him as he was carried through the streets of Gaza. The drone he had used for shooting aerial footage hovered above to film his funeral. Friends denied he had been using it when he was shot on Friday. On Sunday the Israeli defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, claimed there were “no innocent people” in the Hamas-run enclave. “Everyone’s connected to Hamas, everyone gets a salary from Hamas, and all the activists trying to challenge us and breach the border are Hamas military-wing activists,” he told Israel’s public radio. “We know that in many instances Hamas has used journalists and the media and the Red Crescent and ambulances to carry out terror activities. Whoever flies a drone over [Israeli] forces, over our soldiers – we won’t take any chances.” Two weeks ago Murtaja posted a drone photo of Gaza’s seaport at sunset on his Facebook page with the caption: “I wished I could take this photo from the sky, not from land. My name is Yasser Murtaja, I am 30 years old. I live in Gaza City. I have never travelled.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/09/romelu-lukaku-manchester-united-city-myth-cristiano-ronaldo","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T09:00:54Z","webTitle":"Romelu Lukaku is not alone: myth of the ‘big-game bottler’ is rife | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/09/romelu-lukaku-manchester-united-city-myth-cristiano-ronaldo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/09/romelu-lukaku-manchester-united-city-myth-cristiano-ronaldo","fields":{"headline":"Romelu Lukaku is not alone: myth of the ‘big-game bottler’ is rife","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It was a shot heard around the world. First Cristiano Ronaldo leapt, twisted and arched his back, as if performing the Fosbury flop. Then came the crack of boot on ball, lace on leather, delirium and endless dissection. But while Ronaldo’s stunning bicycle kick against Juventus took the breath away, watching him deliver in the Champions League – and again in the Madrid derby on Sunday – came as no surprise. Nowadays he follows the line from Ecclesiastes to the letter: What has been done before will be done again. It was also Ronaldo who came to mind during the rollicking Manchester derby on Saturday, as City were running United ragged and Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku were again being berated for failing to impose themselves. Because people used to say the same about Ronaldo, too: big‑game bottler; flat‑track bully; unable to dominate important games. And while Pogba provided the perfect riposte, suddenly reverting to the omnipotent marauder of his Juve days after half-time, Lukaku remained a lumbering and largely peripheral figure in United’s comeback. He left the Etihad Stadium having failed to muster a shot on target, with the fewest touches (23) and the lowest pass completion percentage (53%) of any starter. Frankly, he was awful. Critics also noted that while Lukaku has scored 31 goals in 49 appearances for club and country this season, only one of those has come in his nine Premier League matches against the big six. All in all, Lukaku is shaping up to be a textbook example of a flat-track bully. Except I am no longer sure such a concept exists. We all instinctively know, of course, that scoring against better teams is harder for everyone. However, when Omar Chaudhuri, the head of football intelligence at 21st Club, analysed 15 years of Premier League scoring data, he found the differences were stark. The average forward scored 0.24 non-penalty goals per 90 minutes against sides finishing in the top six in a given season – pretty much one every four games – compared with 0.37 goals against everyone else. In other words, strikers typically score at a 35% lower rate in “big matches” – whether they are good or bad, supreme or indifferent. Sergio Agüero is a typical case study. While the City striker averages better than a goal every two games against top-six sides excluding penalties (0.52 non‑penalty goals per 90) – better than any striker in the Premier League over the past 15 years – this is 33% lower than his rate against weaker teams (0.78 NP goals per 90). At the moment Lukaku is a minor outlier – his scoring rate is 52% lower in big matches, worse than any other striker who has scored 80 Premier League goals since 2003. But Chaudhuri insists that United fans should not be overly concerned. His data shows there is a very strong positive correlation between goals in “big matches” and “other matches”, so it is not unreasonable to suspect that Lukaku’s cold streak will eventually correct itself. And Lukaku has done it in big games. During his first two full seasons in England he scored eight goals against teams that finished in the top six – and at a higher rate than in “non-big” games. If you need further convincing that variance matters look at Ronaldo’s early record at United. During his first four years in England, he scored just seven goals in 39 big matches (ie, against a top-six Premier League team or Champions League knockout match). And while he was a winger not a centre-forward, a narrative swiftly took hold: that he underperformed in big games. That perception has taken a long time to shake – despite winning the Champions League four times, finishing top scorer in the competition on six occasions and claiming the Ballon d’Or five times. Yet according to Chaudhuri, while Ronaldo slightly underperformed in his early years, from 2010 to 2013 he actually scored at a higher rate in big matches (against top-four La Liga sides and Champions League knockout games). Look at the figures: nine in 11 big games in 2010‑11, 11 in 12 a year later, and 10 in nine in 2012‑13. And then, unsurprising, he reverted to less superhuman levels. In fact, as Chaudhuri notes, labelling players based on their performances in big games makes for a great study in confirmation bias. Ronaldo has scored vital goals, so whenever he does he is labelled a “big‑game player” – ignoring the fact he has managed only one non-penalty goal in his last five against Barcelona. Lukaku is the opposite; when he does not score in a big match he is targeted – ignoring the fact he provided a goal and assist against Chelsea, or an assist against Liverpool. Perhaps there are broader lessons for clubs, too. Managers often try to scout players based on how they play in big matches or against their own team. But this, inevitably, can lead to clubs drawing overarching conclusions. In fact, as Chaudhuri points out, smart teams might be able to exploit this inefficiency – as players who underperform in big matches might be undervalued, because coaches think they don’t have the mentality to step up. It is an accusation that will no longer be directed at Pogba after Saturday. As Mourinho astutely put it: “Of course, two goals in a big match, one stays in the memory of the people.” Lukaku, meanwhile, can only hope that Mourinho alters his defensive tactics in big games – and, perhaps, for a bit of luck, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/08/bundesliga-bayern-munich-jupp-heynckes-champions","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T12:20:40Z","webTitle":"Jupp Heynckes’s return makes Bayern into slick champions once again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/08/bundesliga-bayern-munich-jupp-heynckes-champions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/08/bundesliga-bayern-munich-jupp-heynckes-champions","fields":{"headline":"Jupp Heynckes’s return makes Bayern into slick champions once again","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For Bayern Munich, Mia san Mia – the Bavarian dialect and the club’s motto, a slogan for their unerring unity – became Mia san Meister, commonplace these days, after they racked up their sixth successive Bundesliga title. The cries of campeones, that could be heard from inside a throbbing away dressing room at the Augsburg Arena and the conga, led by Juan Bernat and Rafinha, that snaked around the pitch, in front of those delirious supporters cherishing another domestic crown, are the fruits of another season that, for a club defined by trophies, is only just starting. In-house, however, celebrations were purposely low-key. The players embraced, enjoyed a post-match (non-alcoholic) beer, according to Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, or two, but, generally, this was a brief kind of bliss, more so a nod to having scribbled a tick in the box. Yes, they boogied to Billie Jean and Stayin’ Alive and they clearly enjoyed the occasion, cradling a championship shield made of cardboard, without prolonging the party. For Bayern and Jupp Heynckes, the 72-year-old manager who is expected to call it quits – again – in the summer, it is still possible to replicate the incredible treble they managed five years ago. It is no surprise then that Bild billed Heynckes, who has won 19 of 22 league matches this season, as the Vater des Erfolgs (the father of success) and Kicker described him as Der Baumeister, the master architect, a man who, to use its analogy, “made a stuttering Ferrari slick again”. If Bayern can sweep aside Sevilla, they will reach the semi-finals of the Champions League on Wednesday, and possibly the DFB-Pokal final the week after. As proved by the pre-cursor to sealing the title, that 6-0 demolition job against Borussia Dortmund, Bayern are, as many feared, champions in their own stratosphere. Hence why, this week, Uli Hoeness scoffed at the idea of introducing play-offs in a bid to make the division more exciting, less predictable. In some quarters, Bayern’s 28th German championship is regarded as ein Armutszeugnis, a damning indictment of the state of the Bundesliga. As Franck Ribery, who clinched his eighth title on his 35th birthday put it, by winning the league they have merely achieved their first objective this season. “The joy was already there,” Thomas Müller said, adamant he and his team-mates are determined to celebrate, “but only in May.” The over-arching aim, underwritten by Bayern’s staff and players is to become des Dauerchampions, perennial winners. Ribery and Arjen Robben – at the club for nine and 10 years respectively – are expected to earn new contracts, the chief executive Rummenigge all but confirmed amid the celebrations. “What we have experienced over the past six years is a dream,” Rummenigge, who said he would enjoy a celebratory cigar at home, enthused. “Jupp has done a phenomenal job. And yet the merry-go-round continues, we still want more [trophies] this year. After an indifferent start to this campaign under Carlo Ancelotti, crushed by Paris-Saint Germain in Europe and trailing Dortmund by five points in the league, Bayern have prospered after a return to the customary-cool manner in which they dispatch teams, even when pegged back, as they were on Saturday afternoon. As Süddeutsche Zeitung painted it, the route here was “first bumpy, but then darn commanding”. But that comical own goal by Niklas Süle was never going to prove a party-pooper, for this Bayern team are scarcely spooked, rarely rattled. Post-match, Rummenigge cited the squad’s confidence – “they are not arrogant”– as well as their professionalism, while there was a classy touch by Heynckes, saluting his predecessor, Carlo Ancelotti. “He is not only an outstanding coach but also an outstanding person,” Heynckes said, before Ancelotti returned the niceties. In six months, Bayern’s tried and tested formula, almost a back-to-basics approach has unequivocally paid off. Previously on their way out, Ribery and Robben, whose current contracts expire in June, have relished the responsibility of being entrusted to do damage in the future, alongside Sandro Wagner, who has five goals in five starts since arriving from Hoffenheim in January. In central midfield, Javi Martínez has flourished defensively and, slightly further forward, Arturo Vidal has too, adding goals to his game. At the back, Heynckes has strengthened the centre-back partnership between Mats Hummels and Jérôme Boateng, re-established as one of the meanest pairings around in recent weeks. In goal, Heynckes has had to rely on the previously derided Sven Ulreich – having been unable to call upon Manuel Neuer, who returned to training this week – and even the 37-year-old, already once retired (does that sound familiar?) Tom Starke. For the reserves, and those who did not feature in Augsburg, including Robert Lewandowski and Thiago Alcântara, there was a training session at 10am on Sunday, and on Monday the total focus returns to entertaining Sevilla. “We’ll find an opportunity to celebrate later and do it hard,” Heynckes, whose eyes were wet as he stood, soaking up the supporters’ joy at full-time, said. For Sule, Sebastian Rudy and the again impressive James Rodríguez, this was a maiden title they will never forget. As the away fans incessantly chanted “Jupp, Jupp, Jupp, Jupp” from the stands in Augsburg at the final whistle, it was even harder to fathom a amusing pre-match anecdote, courtesy of Heynckes himself, who excitedly returned to the top table to speak to journalists after finishing his press conference. “I got into the lift this morning in my hotel, and on the fifth floor an old couple got in with three suitcases,” Heynckes said on Friday, of an encounter with American tourists. “It was quite cramped inside. He was quiet but she was friendly and said ‘good morning’, so I said ‘good morning’ back. I was holding a Bayern Munich bag so she asked: ‘Oh, are you a Bayern Munich fan?’ “I said: ‘Yes, sure’.” Talking points • There is still life in der Dino yet. Hamburg clinched their first win in 132 days, a 3-2 victory over Schalke thanks to the Hunt-Hammer, as Bild put it, the striker Aaron Hunt six minutes from time. Their hopes of celebrating their 100th birthday in the Bundesliga are almost extinct, but the smallest glimmer of hope remains. “It was important we showed we are still here,” Hunt said. • With the World Cup on the horizon, Hans-Joachim Watzke’s untimely thoughts on Mario Götze could go one of two ways. “Somehow, he’s missing something,” Dortmund’s managing director said of the Germany midfielder’s form, adding that his move to Bayern hindered his progress. • Just like his brother, Thorgan Hazard can turn a game on its head. He scored two late goals – his 10th and 11th of the season – to keep Borussia Mönchengladbach’s hopes of playing in Europe next season alive. • Bruno Labbadia is off the mark, he has his first win as Wolfsburg manager. Daniel Didavi scored twice as die Wölfe took a huge step towards safety with a 2-0 win at Freiburg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/09/manchester-to-mark-a-year-since-arena-attack-with-singalong","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T23:01:42Z","webTitle":"Manchester to mark a year since arena attack with singalong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/manchester-to-mark-a-year-since-arena-attack-with-singalong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/manchester-to-mark-a-year-since-arena-attack-with-singalong","fields":{"headline":"Manchester to mark a year since arena attack with singalong","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester council has called for choirs across the city to come together for a singalong to mark the passing of one year since the arena bombing. The Manchester Together – With One Voice event will be held on 22 May in Albert Square, a year to the day since Salman Abedi killed 22 people and himself when he detonated a bomb at an Ariana Grande concert. Events planned to mark the date include a civic memorial service held at Manchester Cathedral, attended by a congregation including the families of those who died or were injured, and members of the emergency services. The service will also be screened at York Minster, Liverpool’s Metropolitan Cathedral and Glasgow Cathedral. The One Voice event will culminate in a communal singalong from 8.30pm to 9pm, which will be broadcast live on BBC Radio Manchester. Choirs and singing groups have until 30 April to register to take part. The event was inspired by a moment following the bombing when a crowd taking part in a minute’s silence spontaneously started singing the Oasis song Don’t Look Back in Anger. Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council, said: “Music is in Manchester’s soul and it is only fitting that it should play a central part in marking what will be an emotional anniversary. We saw in the aftermath of the 22 May attack how spontaneous song captured the city’s spirit, its solidarity and refusal to give in to hatred. “Coming together in song will once again demonstrate that remarkable sense of togetherness and we invite choirs who can help lead us in raising our voices to get in touch. It is a fitting way for us to honour those who went full of joy to a music concert but never came back, or saw their lives changed forever.” Leese quoted a poem by Manchester poet Tony Walsh, This is the Place, which was read at a public vigil after the bombing: “We keep fighting back with Greater Manchester spirit. Northern grit, northern wit in Greater Manchester’s lyrics.” Plans for a permanent memorial to the victims remain under discussion, but the council is planning a “Trees of Hope trail”, which will allow people to leave messages on trees placed around the city in the days before the anniversary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/08/commonwealth-games-gymnastics-gold-max-whitlock-georgia-mae-fenton","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T12:23:07Z","webTitle":"Max Whitlock falters as Georgia-Mae Fenton takes gymnastics gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/08/commonwealth-games-gymnastics-gold-max-whitlock-georgia-mae-fenton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/08/commonwealth-games-gymnastics-gold-max-whitlock-georgia-mae-fenton","fields":{"headline":"Max Whitlock falters as Georgia-Mae Fenton takes gymnastics gold","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Georgia-Mae Fenton took a risk by not buying her mum a birthday present in the hope a Commonwealth title would be an acceptable substitute. Her gamble paid off as she won gymnastics gold to take back to Kent as a belated gift for Lisa, which will surely mean more than a pot plant or a box of chocolates. “It’s my mum’s birthday and I was like: ‘What can I get her as a present?’ and I thought: ‘Let’s just do my bar routine really good,’” Fenton said, “She’s not come out here but she’ll be watching from home. My mum was the one who introduced me to gymnastics because I was doing cartwheels all the time at home and she took me somewhere I could do it safely, so I want to say thank you to her.” The England women’s team is missing many of its star names, with Claudia Fragapane, Ellie Downie and Amy Tinkler all absent through injury, but Fenton rose to the challenge, making it two English golds in 10 minutes by producing a polished routine on the uneven bars to win with 14.600. The 17-year-old’s victory and Courtney Tulloch’s gold on the rings restored glory to the English gymnastics team after Max Whitlock suffered two shocks in the space of an hour. The double Olympic champion was reminded how it feels not to win, first on the floor, where a ragged routine resulted in him finishing sixth and, more surprisingly, on the pommel horse, his favourite apparatus, where he had to settle for silver. Alongside building an enviable medal collection, Whitlock often talks of wanting to leave a legacy in the sport through increased success for young British gymnasts but he perhaps did not bargain on being usurped by one of them so soon. Specifically Rhys McClenaghan, an 18-year-old from Northern Ireland, who, as a nine‑year‑old, watched Whitlock compete at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi – and on Sunday beat him to gold on the pommel horse. “Obviously, Max is one of the best gymnasts that has lived,” McClenaghan said. “I remember watching him as a kid and to be competing against him now is incredible but I’m up there with him now and I’ve overtaken him.” He later tweeted: “Coming for that world title next, Max.” The teenager’s confidence is admirable but Whitlock insisted he would use defeat on the Gold Coast as motivation for the European championships in Glasgow and world championships in Qatar later this year. “I will learn a lot and get a lot of fire back in me,” Whitlock said. “It may be what I needed to really push me to make sure this doesn’t happen again. I look up to Usain Bolt and Mo Farah because they are legends. To retain a title is much harder than chasing one, there is a lot more pressure.” “It’s one of those things. We’re human and mistakes happen. I knew I was going to get a low score because I did a repetition move and the deduction was going to be big.” Tulloch, 22, qualified top and was first out in the rings final. His score of 14.833 was not surpassed as he won his second gold medal of the week to add to the team title. He also offered words of consolation to Whitlock. “It’s one of the best routines I’ve ever done,” he said. “I got silver last year at the Euros and to come away with two gold medals is fantastic. Max is an amazing role model. Today he made a few mistakes but he will bounce back. You can’t write off Max.” Miller breaks British hammer record Nick Miller had double the reason to celebrate his Commonwealth gold by becoming the first Briton to launch the hammer more than 80m, a mark that also surpassed the best his coach, a former international thrower, ever managed. The 24-year-old, who won silver in Glasgow four years ago, broke his own British record with a throw of 80.26m at the Carrara Stadium on the opening afternoon of athletics on the Gold Coast. He broke the Games record, which had been 77.53m set by Stuart Rendell in Melbourne in 2006, and now has bragging rights over his Swedish coach Tore Gustafsson, who once threw 80.14m. “I thought I could throw 80m, it is the distance every hammer thrower wants to make,” Miller said. “The best part is that I beat my coach. We joked for years that I’d throw over his best and when 80.26m came up, it was one up on him.” Meanwhile, the basketball arena played host to a proposal when the England forward Jamell Anderson asked Georgia Jones, who plays for the women’s team, to marry him. Both sides had earlier triumphed, with the women’s team beating Mozambique and the men annihilating Cameroon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/08/paul-pogba-highlights-if-only-feeling-despite-performance-of-season-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T13:04:24Z","webTitle":"Paul Pogba highlights ‘if only’ feeling despite his performance of season | Jamie Jackson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/08/paul-pogba-highlights-if-only-feeling-despite-performance-of-season-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/08/paul-pogba-highlights-if-only-feeling-despite-performance-of-season-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Paul Pogba highlights ‘if only’ feeling despite his performance of season","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Is Paul Pogba on the verge of greatness or will Saturday’s barnstorming shredding of Manchester City prove the falsest of dawns? After the Frenchman’s finest display for Manchester United drove José Mourinho’s side to a memorable 3-2 derby win, Pogba declared himself partly “disappointed”. The 25-year-old had just thwarted City’s bid to secure the title before a feverish Etihad Stadium with a memorable second-half performance. It dragged United from 2-0 down at the break, teetering on the brink of a humiliation, to victory. Yet United had been hapless before the interval and Pogba a passenger. Here was an occasion for United’s star midfielder to show why £89m was invested in him. For him to boss a game that really mattered. Instead, balls bounced off his shins, passes found no one and Pogba was a boy against City’s men throughout the opening 45 minutes. Afterwards he acknowledged United’s abysmal first half, saying: “I feel very happy [about victory] but there is one side of me that is disappointed, too, because with a performance like we had in the second half, if we had done this all season, I think we would be fighting for the title with City or we’d be just in front of them.” His analysis had a glaring omission: Pogba failed to apply it to himself. “Disappointing”, “below par”, “average” are three unwanted adjectives that have characterised Pogba’s season for United. If only he had played all season as he did for those 45 minutes on Saturday, who knows how much closer United might be to City. Instead, Pogba’s duff form caused unrest between him and Mourinho, and led to the manager dropping him in February for a Premier League win over Huddersfield Town and the Champions League defeat by Sevilla in March. Mourinho is a sharp observer of any footballer’s form and attitude and despite the club-record price tag was cold-eyed enough to exclude Pogba. The frustration was double because of the potential the Frenchman possesses. Factor in zero goals in any competition for United since a 4-1 win over Newcastle United on 18 November and Pep Guardiola’s pre-derby revelation that Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola, had offered him in the winter window, and the player’s future at United beyond the summer appeared in the balance. The sense was compounded by that awful first half. Pogba’s problem is that when misfiring he appears to amble around, apparently not caring. In the second half all of this felt bunkum. Suddenly Pogba was Roy Keane-esque, driving United forward, berating team-mates, a true force of nature who bent the match to his will. His first goal was pure desire, as he latched on to an Ander Herrera chest-down to beat Ederson. This was on 53 minutes. Ninety seconds later Pogba had a second, a header of some beauty, as he hung in the air before flicking the ball past the helpless Ederson again. What Pogba had done was playground stuff. He had become the dominant lad in the schoolyard who, at will, turns it on and wins a match single-handedly. Chris Smalling grabbed a memorable 69th-minute winner because of the unstoppable momentum Pogba had created for United. The question is: can Pogba draw on this supreme performance and ensure he turns it on week in, week out? His team-mates queued up to implore him to prove he can. Herrera said: “Paul can be the best in the world. I have already told him that he can be the best in the world and [the City performance] can be the first step to achieve that because he is fantastic, and I think he needed a day like today. As well as the two goals, I thought he played fantastic.” Nemanja Matic added: “With his personality Paul can [drive us on]. He needs to be our main player because when he plays in that position he needs to resolve the games and he needs to take responsibilities. Don’t forget he had some injuries this season and that he had three months out, and it is not easy to come back after that. “People expect a lot from you when you play for United. We know this is normal but he is still young and can improve and [against City] he showed character and personality, and if you saw him in the last 10 minutes he fought a lot for the team and I hope he will continue like this.” So, too, will Mourinho, who was correct to drop Pogba, if Saturday is the true benchmark of what the Frenchman can do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/08/matthew-glaetzer-cycling-australian-golden-haul-commonwealth-games-gold-coast","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T15:23:08Z","webTitle":"Glaetzer bounces back to lead Australian golden haul on day four","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/08/matthew-glaetzer-cycling-australian-golden-haul-commonwealth-games-gold-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/08/matthew-glaetzer-cycling-australian-golden-haul-commonwealth-games-gold-coast","fields":{"headline":"Glaetzer bounces back to lead Australian golden haul on day four","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"From the depths of despair to the elation of atonement – what a difference a day has made for cyclist Matthew Glaetzer who has ridden the full wave of emotions on a night where Australia dominated at the Anna Meares Velodrome. A firm favourite for the men’s sprint on Saturday, Glaetzer notched a Games record time during the heat, only to be eliminated by an opponent Glaetzer admitted to have underestimated. “It’s just hard, it’s a nightmare unfolding,” said Glaetzer. “I tried to get through with minimum effort.” With just five riders having taken to the boards on Sunday in the men’s 1000m time trial it became apparent very quickly that only the utmost effort would be enough as New Zealand’s Ed Dawkins posted a blistering time of 59.928 – averaging over 60km/hr to lay down a strong marker of intent . Eighteen riders took to the track; 18 riders failed to come close. But then came the last to try, Glaetzer. Less than a minute’s delight for a vociferous home crowd as he crossed in a time of 59.340, but pure relief for the South Australian. “It was a big day today to bounce back after a shocking day yesterday,” said Glaetzer, “it’s really good to come back and prove to yourself, and get one up for Australia because I don’t think I performed yesterday.” He was in good company on the boards on Sunday as the irrepressible Stephanie Morton claimed her third gold of the Games in the women’s keirin ahead of compatriot Kaarle McCullough, with Amy Cure also grabbing gold in an epic women’s 10km scratch race, after excellent support from team-mates Annette Edmondson and Ashlee Ankudinoff. It was a golden evening once again in the pool, as in the space of mere minutes Australia notched two clean sweeps, with Cate Campbell and Mitch Larkin continuing their stunning meets. In a blanket finish it was Larkin who touched out fellow Australians Ben Treffers and Zac Incerti in the men’s 50m backstroke to complete a personal 50m/100m double, with Campbell looking visibly more relaxed in every swim as she held off the fast-finishing Holly Barratt and Madeline Groves in the women’s 50m butterfly to earn a remarkable six medals for the host nation in the pool in as many minutes. The men’s 4x200m freestyle relay smashed another Games record en route to gold, as they recorded a time of 7.05.97 ahead of England and Scotland. Such was the depth in the Australian squad the fastest split of the night went to 17-year-old local boy Elijah Winnington, who himself had only made the team by 0.01 during the morning’s swim-off. In the men’s SM8 200m individual medley final, double amputee Jesse Aungles received one of the cheers of the night as he held off friend and countryman Blake Cochrane in a race that confirmed the popular enjoyment of both swimming and para-swimming events being merged at these Games. “It was absolutely incredible,” said Aungles, “especially with the crowd behind you and my mate Blake beside me. I’m lost for words.” A fifth gold on the night was claimed in another remarkable performance, as Lakeisha Patterson raced up a category in the S9 100m freestyle final to edge England’s Alice Tai and fellow Australian Ellie Cole. Australia didn’t have it all their own way earlier on however as Kylie Masse led a Canadian one-two finish in the women’s 200m backstroke final ahead of world champion Emily Seebohm, with the 22-year-old and compatriot Taylor Ruck winning the gold and silver medals, respectively. Masse, who also ousted Seebohm by a fingernail in the 100m event on Saturday, set a new Games record of 2.05.98 seconds to seal the gold with Ruck, aged 17, picking up her sixth medal of these Games. In a blockbuster men’s 100m freestyle final there was another upset as Scotland’s aptly named Duncan Scott ran down his more fancied opponents over the second 50m to snatch gold. The 20-year-old was sixth at the turn for home but chased down a tiring Chad le Clos and just held off the Olympic champion Kyle Chalmers to the wall to touch in 48.02, with his two more heralded opponents tied for second in 48.15. Nearly 30 medals were claimed by the host nation over an eventful day that started with walkers Dale Bird-Smith and Jenny Montag winning their respective 20km events. Bird-Smith produced a stunning burst in the final few hundred metres to claim Australia’s first athletics medal of the Games, with the Rio Olympics bronze medallist finishing just four seconds ahead of England’s Tom Bosworth. There was drama in the women’s race after Australian Claire Tallent was disqualified about two kilometres from the finish and just after she had reeled in youngster Montag. “That’s not the way I wanted to win the gold medal with a close teammate being relegated to the sidelines, but you can’t let it affect your focus,” Montag said. “Claire will come back.” Elsewhere, Australian Dane Sampson won gold in the men’s 10m air rifle final after setting a new Games record score of 245.0, Matty Denny grabbed silver in the men’s hammer, Erin Cleaver and Taylor Doyle claiming silver and bronze in the women’s T38 long jump, and Emily Whitehead and Georgia Godwin picked up bronzes in the women’s vault and uneven bars respectively. Australia now move to a commanding position on the medal tally with 31 gold, 25 silver and 28 bronze with England second with 19 gold and Canada third with seven."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/17/dawit-l-petros-best-photograph-trawler-shipwrecked-japanese-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T05:00:20Z","webTitle":"Dawit L Petros's best photograph: a shipwrecked Japanese trawler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/17/dawit-l-petros-best-photograph-trawler-shipwrecked-japanese-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/17/dawit-l-petros-best-photograph-trawler-shipwrecked-japanese-africa","fields":{"headline":"Dawit L Petros's best photograph: a shipwrecked Japanese trawler","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I came across this ship in 2014, a few months into a long, slow journey I was making from Nigeria to Italy. It was a Japanese fishing trawler, and it had washed up on the shores of Nouakchott, on the west coast of Africa, having developed engine trouble. It was almost sunset – the cinematic hour. The sky was warm and the scene was just so inviting. But I knew this golden moment was transitory, as I had been coming to the wreck again and again at different times, noticing how the light changed with each visit, and how many other people were visiting it. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do with it. The shot became part of my project, called The Act of Recovery. I was looking at the complex narrative of migration, across Africa and Europe. We are used to seeing shipwrecks on the shores of Europe, as overcrowded vessels transporting African migrants north get washed up like carcasses. But this shot seemed to invert that notion. Here was an outlier, one that had travelled the other way, heading south. It wasn’t yet another displaced African body. That made it feel powerful. There are ship graveyards not far from this spot. I had seen photographs of them by the Tunisian artist Zineb Sedira. When I first encountered this ship, I thought about her shots, which are all about the repurposing of western waste. But unlike Sedira’s graveyard ships, this vessel had not been stripped and looted. It was still functional. All its elements, including the radar, were still in place. I used a documentary style but, as with all the images in the project, it did involve a certain amount of staging. I had seen children climbing on the ship for a better look, while adults stood back, observing from a distance. I didn’t want to dictate the scene too heavily, so I just turned up with a group of people who hadn’t been told what to wear and let them approach the ship. Their clothes reflect all the colours you tend to see at that time of day. My friend Mohammed – on the far left – wore a blue fabric that seems to extend the sea. I spent the first part of my project travelling through the continent with 10 African artists, film-makers and photographers, all crammed into a Ford Econoline van. Travelling by road across Africa is quite difficult. Some countries are more easily reached from outside the continent, as opposed to within. This journey was much more than a traditional road trip, though. We did public presentations and ran workshops wherever we stopped. I got to know local film-makers and would screen their work alongside my own at outdoor cinemas for anyone to see. As we travelled further north, I thought a lot about the Mediterranean Sea. It ought to be a means of exchange, but for many it has become an impenetrable boundary. Dawit L Petros’s CV Born: Asmara, Eritrea, 1972. Studied: History and art in Montreal, Boston and New York.

At the resort’s hotel, tourists sip German beer and enjoy the scenery, but the tranquil setting belies a horrific past: until 1991, the sprawling compound was known as Colonia Dignidad, and was home to a religious sect led by a convicted paedophile and former Nazi. During the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, the enclave was also used as a clandestine torture site where about 300 people were interrogated and tortured by the Dina (National Intelligence Directorate) secret police. Between 1973 and 1978, at least 100 people are believed to have been murdered at the site and their bodies destroyed. Now a new hunt is under way to find a grave believed to contain the remains of some of those who were “disappeared” at Colonia Dignidad. Relatives still fighting for answers hope that fresh excavations may reveal forensic science evidence – and grant them a degree of closure. “Finding this grave is the last hope for the families of the disappeared. The search must continue for as long as it takes to find it,” said Winfried Hempel, a lawyer representing the victims of human rights abuses perpetrated at the enclave. Colonia Dignidad was founded in 1961 by Paul Schäfer, a former medic in the Nazi-era German army who fled Germany in 1959 after being charged with child abuse. Surrounded by watchtowers and electrified fences and patrolled by armed men and guard dogs, the community was populated by about 300 Germans, and cut off from the rest of Chile. Schäfer – who died in a prison hospital in 2010 – was accused of running a cult-like community where he systematically abused young children. According to prosecutors, he also allowed Pinochet’s agents to torture political prisoners in a maze of stonewalled tunnels beneath the enclave. In 1978, the Dina chief, Manuel Contreras – hoping to destroy evidence of human rights abuses – ordered the exhumation and disposal of all the executed prisoners’ remains. According to Chile’s national commission for truth and reconciliation, 40 corpses may have been dug up at Colonia Dignidad, before being chemically burned and their ashes tossed into the river Perquilauquén, which runs to the south of the 37,000-acre compound. But recently, a former member of the colony – who at the time was in charge of the heavy machinery used to exhume the bodies – testified that one grave had been left intact. The victims of Colonia Dignidad were not all Chileans: in 1985, Boris Weisfeiler, a nationalised US citizen born in the Soviet Union, vanished while trekking a few miles from the enclave. According to witnesses, local police detained and beat him before taking him to the colony where he disappeared. “After 33 years of agonising search to find my brother, I still hold hope that they find his remains,” said Boris’s sister, Olga Weisfeiler, who lives in Boston, Massachusetts. Eight retired police and military officers were eventually indicted over Weisfeiler’s abduction in 2012, but four years later, a judge applied the statute of limitations and closed the case. “I have given up on getting answers from the Chilean government as to what happened to him,” she said. “At present, it seems both the Chilean government and its judicial system are complicit in stalling the judicial process and in avoiding taking responsibility for my brother’s tragic death.” In October, the search for the truth of Villa Baviera gained new impetus when Judge Mario Carroza ordered a new search of the site, but the recent election of billionaire businessman Sebastián Piñera as president has raised fears that there is little political appetite for a full reckoning. After more than a decade on the run, Schäfer was arrested in 2005 and sentenced to 20 years in jail for sexually abusing and torturing children at the colony. Today, Villa Baviera is run by Anna Schnellenkamp, daughter of one of Paul Schäfer’s right-hand men, Kurt Schnellenkamp, who died in 2017 after serving a five-year prison sentence for enabling Schäfer’s abuse. The colony survives on income from a poultry farm, which produces 30,000 eggs a day, and tourism: there is a manmade-lake with pedal boats, a restaurant serving venison, sauerkraut and other German dishes, and a small museum that makes no mention of the disappeared. Relatives of the disappeared say that the site of mass murder should not be a leisure centre; they have called for Villa Baviera to be closed and replaced with a memorial. “It is not possible that a place where serious violations of human rights such as torture, murders and disappearances should function as a tourist destination,” said Margarita Romero, president of the Association of Memory and Human Rights. “Imagine a hotel built in a concentration camp in Europe – it would never be permitted.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-worboys-parole-case-verdict-on-a-system","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T17:27:16Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Worboys parole case: verdict on a system | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-worboys-parole-case-verdict-on-a-system","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-worboys-parole-case-verdict-on-a-system","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Worboys parole case: verdict on a system","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On Wednesday the high court ruled that the jailed serial sex attacker John Worboys must face a new Parole Board hearing on his application for release on licence.

The Parole Board chair, Nick Hardwick, has been forced to resign after the court quashed its panel’s earlier ruling on Worboys. Mr Hardwick is being made a scapegoat for the wider system. It was that system that let the women victims down, not Mr Hardwick. The justice secretary David Gauke’s insistence on forcing him out is shabby. Each should accept a due share of the blame. Worboys was jailed in 2009 after he was found guilty of 19 offences against 12 women, including rape and sexual assault. For years after his conviction he showed no contrition. But in late 2017, a Parole Board hearing decided he could be released on licence. This followed what the high court called the rapist’s “deftness in impression management” and his “limited” acknowledgment of his offending in his application. Police believe that Worboys committed crimes against 105 women before being caught. It is clearly in the victims’ interest, and in that of the public, that a less limited and unmanaged account of Worboys’ qualifications for release should now take place. The importance of the court’s ruling goes beyond one high-profile case with what the court called “many exceptional features”. Three of its findings strike at the heart of the current parole system. The court said the board should have carried out more extensive inquiries, that it should consider appointing a judge to chair the panel, and that the Parole Board should be more open about its decisions, for which no reasons are currently given. Reforms such as these have often been discussed, but not acted upon. With the court now insisting on them, a wider rethinking and restructuring of parole is portended, which Mr Hardwick would have been an ideal person to oversee. Yet the rulings do not affect parole alone. They have implications for decisions to prosecute, for sentencing, and for prisons management too. A major part of the problem is that, over the years, parole has metastasised from an administrative process that was essentially about prisoner management into one that is, in effect, a resentencing of the prisoner. When parole was introduced in the 1960s, it was an independent system to control prison behaviour and numbers, in which the prospect of early release was an incentive to inmates on determinate sentences to comply and rehabilitate themselves. With the extension of indeterminate sentences in the 1990s, hearings inescapably took on an even graver responsibility; parole is now a quasi-judicial process. Indeterminate sentences have now been ended (except for life prisoners), but those serving them remain in jail. The Parole Board’s workload has grown exponentially, with a large backlog of cases; around 3,000, said Mr Gauke this week. The high court ruling also throws down a spending gauntlet. Since 2011, justice ministry spending has been cut by 13%, with a further 11% cut by 2020. Staff numbers are down by 25%. Each of the reforms implied in the court ruling has spending implications. With crime rising, police numbers at a 20-year low, prisons increasingly crowded and more prisoners serving longer sentences, the scope for radical improvement is extremely constrained unless cuts are reversed. This week’s ruling provides justice for Worboys’ victims, but it also highlights a wider crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/29/nicolas-sarkozy-to-face-trial-for-corruption-and-influence-peddling","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T17:17:51Z","webTitle":"Nicolas Sarkozy to face trial for corruption and influence peddling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/29/nicolas-sarkozy-to-face-trial-for-corruption-and-influence-peddling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/29/nicolas-sarkozy-to-face-trial-for-corruption-and-influence-peddling","fields":{"headline":"Nicolas Sarkozy to face trial for corruption and influence peddling","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been sent to trial for corruption and influence peddling. The case centres over attampts Sarkozy allegedly made to contact a senior judge who was investigating claims that his 2007 presidential campaign was illegally funded. Sarkozy is alleged to have promised the judge a comfortable promotion in return for information about the fraud inquiry. The judge and Sarkozy’s lawyer, Thierry Herzog, have also been ordered to stand trial on the same charges. All three have denied any wrongdoing; the former leader’s lawyers announced he would appeal against the decision to send the case to court. This new legal setback came days after Sarkozy was formally put under investigation over claims he took €50m (£44m) from the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi in illegal donations for his successful 2007 presidential campaign, which he also denied. He went on prime time television to denounce the allegations as “crazy, monstrous”. In this latest case, Sarkozy is accused of contacting Gilbert Azibert, then a senior judge in France’s highest court, the court of cassation, in 2014 – two years after he left office – via his lawyer Thierry Herzog in order to obtain information about an investigation being carried out about his 2007 campaign funding. In this instance, Sarkozy had been accused of taking envelopes of cash in illegal donations from the late Liliane Bettencourt, heiress to the L’Oréal fortune. Sarkozy who used the alias Paul Bismuth, he allegedly offered to use his contacts to get the judge a prestigious job in the principality of Monaco in exchange for information on the case. The calls were wiretapped by police. In earlier hearings, Sarkozy and his lawyers had hoped this and other tapes of private conversations between the former president and Herzog, would be deemed illegal and inadmissible in court leading to the case being thrown out. However, in March 2016, the court ruled investigators had not broken any law by using phone taps. Initially, fraud investigators had been looking into the Gaddafi campaign funding case in 2012 when they put taps on several phones belonging to Sarkozy and Herzog. The recorded conversations led to an entirely new investigation. The L’Oréal funding case, known as the Bettencourt Affair, was later dropped, but the tapes led to new charges for corruption and influence peddling. After an official investigation was opened in July 2014, judges decided Sarkozy, Herzog and Azibert should stand trial in May 2015, but the case has been repeatedly delayed by the defence’s appeals. Sarkozy also faces criminal proceedings over claims that he fraudulently hid expenses for his failed 2012 re-election bid after expenditure on the campaign exceeded the legal limits, in what is known as the Bygmalion Affair. Prosecutors have recommended he be sent for trial on these allegations. Sarkozy has strenuously denied all accusations made against him the cases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/30/football-pfa-team-of-year-manchester-city-liam-rosenior","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T09:00:17Z","webTitle":"Six of the best from Manchester City dominate my PFA team of the year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/30/football-pfa-team-of-year-manchester-city-liam-rosenior","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/30/football-pfa-team-of-year-manchester-city-liam-rosenior","fields":{"headline":"Six of the best from Manchester City dominate my PFA team of the year","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The rattle of cutlery and cups has not been the only noise in the canteens at Premier League clubs over the last few days as players have been debating who to vote for in the PFA player of the year, young player of the year and team of the year awards. Being recognised by your peers is the ultimate accolade, mostly because it’s from those whom you’ve competed against week in, week out and that is why we take it so seriously. In keeping with this, I have decided to share my selections with you (and them!), though I am sure you will have your own opinion on who should be in there. Goalkeeper: David de Gea (Manchester United) In terms of shot-stopping and the ability to make match-defining saves De Gea will go down as one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League era – if not the best. He makes incredible stops look easy and at crucial moments in huge games. Manchester City’s Ederson – because of his ability to build play – was close to getting inbut, if I had to choose one goalkeeper in the top flight to win a game with, De Gea is the man. I love his temperament as well. The ability to spread confidence and calm through his back four should not be under-appreciated. Right-back: Kyle Walker (Manchester City) Walker’s consistency, athleticism, pace and ability to go forward mean there has not been a better right-back this season. When City paid £50m-plus for him last summer eyebrows were raised, which was interesting because the role of a modern-day full-back is becoming more vital. His outstanding form for Spurs has gone to another level at City and, judging by his performances for England as a centre-back, he will be a vital cog in Gareth Southgate’s World Cup plans. Centre-back: Nicolás Otamendi (Manchester City) Otamendi’s performances are, for me, the symbol of City’s improvement under Pep Guardiola this season. His calmness in possession – building from the back – and the improvement in his defensive play, especially in covering and taking up good positions, have made him the standout centre-half. Centre-back: Davinson Sánchez (Tottenham) A surprise inclusion for some maybe but every time I have seen him he has impressed me with his incredible speed, his confidence to take possession from the back and his positioning, which is scary for a 21-year-old. Another outstanding purchase by Spurs and, if he keeps performing and improving at the rate he has this year, he will go on to be one of the outstanding centre-halves in world football. Left-back: Marcos Alonso (Chelsea) Even though employed as a wing-back, Alonso’s ability to defend well, his stamina to cover long distances while being comfortable in possession and his penchant for important goals made him the standout player in this position. Even in his team’s period of poor form Alonso produced consistent performances, something so important in a defender’s make-up. Right midfield: Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) When Liverpool signed him from Roma I was excited to see how his power, pace and ability to beat players in one-on-ones would fit into Jürgen Klopp’s high-tempo philosophy but no one could have predicted the impact he has had. He has an amazing goalscoring record from his position and the rare ability to run at full speed in complete control of the ball. Signing of the season, no doubt. Central midfield: Fernandinho (Manchester City) I have written before about the importance of the defensive midfielder who gives positional balance to a team and enables the more creative players to do their job with the security of knowing they are safe to play creatively. Nemanja Matic and N’Golo Kanté are other outstanding players in this position but this season Fernandinho has been incredible, not getting the recognition that others in his team have but being a huge part in City’s superb season. Central midfield: Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City) This guy has been nothing short of incredible. His ability not only to create goals with outstanding assists but also to dictate the tempo for his side has been at a level I have not seen in the top flight for many years. If City are to add the Champions League trophy to the inevitable Premier League, he will be the one player that Guardiola will need at his best. Left midfield: Leroy Sané (Manchester City) This was a straight toss-up between Sané and Raheem Sterling – both of whom have been on fire – and I have gone with the former who, despite being tall, has a natural gift of gliding past players, scoring goals and creating assists. What also impresses me is the intelligence of his runs without the ball, something that most wide players incorporate into their games at a much later age. In full flow he is breathtaking. Striker: Harry Kane (Tottenham) Guaranteed goals on a consistent basis. But goals are only one part of his game. Can play on the shoulder of defenders or drop deep and link with his team-mates, and his temperament and professionalism make him a leader of a young Tottenham team. What a player, a complete striker. Striker: Sergio Agüero (Manchester City) At the start of the season Agüero was challenged by the performances of Gabriel Jesus. Since then he has shown his character by coming back into the side, being a focal point of City’s pressing game and doing what he does best: scoring goals. His explosive power and clever movement make him a world-class striker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/30/miami-open-miami-dophins-stadium-hard-rock-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T08:00:15Z","webTitle":"Why is the Miami Open moving to a 65,000-capacity NFL stadium?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/30/miami-open-miami-dophins-stadium-hard-rock-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/30/miami-open-miami-dophins-stadium-hard-rock-tennis","fields":{"headline":"Why is the Miami Open moving to a 65,000-capacity NFL stadium?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When the last ball is hit at the Miami Open in Key Biscayne this weekend, tennis sentimentalists will shed a tear. For the past 32 years Crandon Park has hosted a tournament once heralded as the ‘fifth slam’, a moniker which has weakened along with the decay of a venue badly in need of an update it will never get. Instead, with upgrades blocked by legal wranglings and environmental concerns, the tournament will move north to the recently renovated Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins. “We opposed [upgrading the site] because of the commercialisation of a privately dedicated public park which was given for public park purposes only,” Bruce Matheson, whose family have owned large parts of Key Biscayne since 1908, told the Guardian. “The agreement was that only one permanent stadium would be built.” But will playing tennis in a 65,000 capacity NFL stadium be strange? Particularly when the current largest tennis venue in the world, the 23,000-seater Arthur Ashe Stadium, is often criticised for its lack of atmosphere. “I am really sad to see [the Miami Open leave Crandon Park],” says Caroline Wozniacki, the Australian Open champion who owns an apartment in the city. “It would have been amazing if it would’ve stayed and expanded. In my head having been to the football stadium, I have a hard time seeing how everything will work out, how it’s going to feel as cozy and special as it does here.” The main stadium at Crandon Park may have been aging but it was known for the way local Latino fans could create an intense atmosphere. The Argentinians in particular have flocked to this tournament and raised the roof for Juan Martin del Potro over the past 12 days. That may be difficult to do in a much larger venue. It’s perhaps too early to tell but at Hard Rock Stadium there’s no history, no romance and no real feel that you’re in Miami other than the realization that you’re driving down Dan Marino Boulevard. Meanwhile, the scenic daily route into Key Biscayne is awash with palm trees and blue waters while Hard Rock Stadium has a freeway. You really could be anywhere in the US. For some though, the move is an opportunity to live out their childhood dreams. “It’s going to be like a day in the life of an NFL player,” enthused US world No11 Jack Sock, a huge Kansas City Chiefs fan. “I am excited to go there, see the locker rooms.” Not that the stands of Hard Rock Stadium will be heaving with fans. Only around 14,000 of the 65,000 capacity will be in use with large drapes masking a sea of empty seats. A massive temporary, three-sided stand will be erected on the field to bring spectators closer to the action thus leaving one side of the arena totally unused. The infrastructure for a new Grandstand court, with much needed gym facilities, will also be built along with new hospitality areas. Fans will be able to keep up with the action thanks to huge screens erected outside the main stadium. The computer renderings of the site look impressive – as do plans for landscaping in the area to give the tournament more of a tennis feel. Many people who work inside tennis are skeptical about the plans. Nevertheless, the $60m upgrade will allow the Miami Open to compete with Indian Wells, the tournament owned by tech billionaire Larry Ellison that has become the mythical extra major Miami used to be thanks to huge investment in the infrastructure (the main 16,000 stadium in the California desert is the second biggest outdoor tennis arena in the world). “Both are great tournaments but the permanent structures in Indian Wells make a difference,” added another source. That could be about to change. Dolphins owner and tennis fan Stephen Ross, along with Serena Williams who is a part owner of the NFL team and has been a sounding board during the whole process, was rolled out at an official announcement two weeks ago. The billionaire gleefully spoke of a glittering future for a tournament which has aged badly. There will be a total of 30 courts at the new site – for practice and tournament play – including the main stadium (Key Biscayne has 18), more space and crucially, more chance of keeping the players happy. There are also vastly superior catering options. The ability to host sponsors in plush, luxury suites which generate huge amounts of cash during the NFL season are also, predictably, attractive reasons for the switch. “Stephen Ross is helping to progress the sport,” James Blake, the former world no4 who is the Miami Open’s new tournament director, told the Guardian. “A lot of the top players have been kept in the loop. They need to be happy and we need to make sure we don’t miss anything. The courts, facilities, the food , the locker rooms.” It’s sure be glitzy, loud and lively – IMG will dig deep into their musical and entertainments contacts to reinforce what they call the ‘festivalisation’ of the event – even if the lack of palm trees and the constant noise emanating from the Florida Turnpike will take away the Floridian experience which made picturesque Key Biscayne such a favourite with fans and players alike. Wozniacki may not be alone in her caution about changing a beloved tournament but change, even if it does obliterate sentimentality, seems to be the only way ahead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/06/cost-living-deborah-levy-review-feminist-manifesto-divorced-simone-beauvoir","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T06:30:25Z","webTitle":"The Cost of Living by Deborah Levy review –  a memoir and feminist manifesto","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/06/cost-living-deborah-levy-review-feminist-manifesto-divorced-simone-beauvoir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/06/cost-living-deborah-levy-review-feminist-manifesto-divorced-simone-beauvoir","fields":{"headline":"The Cost of Living by Deborah Levy review –  a memoir and feminist manifesto","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There’s a wonderful moment in a series of wonderful moments in this second instalment of Deborah Levy’s “living memoir”. It’s a “sad Tuesday” and she is being told off by a neighbour in the block of flats into which she has recently moved with her daughters following divorce from their father. This is supposed to be a fresh start for Levy, a liberation from the contortions of a family life that has become too difficult to sustain alongside her work as a writer. But now here comes a new kind of cultural policing, imposed not by a man but by another woman, who is part of what Levy calls the “societal” system. With her sharp little teeth, rictus smile and high sweet voice, the woman is dripping gentle venom about Levy’s habit of parking her bike in the front car park, her resistance to ordering her shopping online like everyone else, not to mention the fact that she appears so “busy busy busy all the time”. As the teeth get pointier, Levy’s necklace, the one she always wears even when swimming, breaks and the large pearls bounce across the entrance hall floor. She is unstrung, undone in this place where she was supposed to be aiming for a “new composition”. A good 30 years after someone clever and optimistic (no one is quite sure who) first announced that we had landed safely on the shores of “post-feminism”, it’s clear that being both a creative and reproductive woman is as tricky as it’s ever been. As with Freud’s return of the repressed, those angers and desires, the consequence of botched compromise and thankless sacrifice, have come bubbling up, all the more potent for being choked for so long. Into this molten moment some of our finest writers including Rachel Cusk, Maggie Nelson and, indeed, Levy have poured their blistering experiences of the psychic and emotional cost of being a wife and mother in the 21st century. Levy’s oblique and elliptical prose, on magnificent show in her Booker shortlisted novels Swimming Home and Hot Milk, does not lend itself to a route march through chronological time and external circumstance. Instead, what Levy gives us is an account of her internal world, a shape-shifting space where past and present coexist, where buildings are not so much bricks and mortar as extended metaphors and where identity is in a radical flux of unravelling and remaking. All the same, Levy’s prose is not so slippery that it can’t serve up the basics. At the age of 50 and after decades of what sound like the usual patterns of north London family-making, she finds herself cast adrift from her marriage and, crucially, without any desire to swim back. We’re not given names or details, but that is not so much a matter of tact as irrelevance, since the story Levy tells, she insists, does not belong to her alone. It is the story of every woman throughout history who has expended her love and labour on making a home that turns out to serve the needs of everyone except herself. Not that getting free is exactly easy. Indeed, as Levy’s wry title suggests, choosing not to be married to society costs a lot. Her comfortable family home has been exchanged for a flat where the heating often doesn’t work and the lavatory often won’t flush. The communal parts – there are 100 flats in this huge block – are a hallucinatory tube that she dubs “the Corridors of Love”. This sounds promising, but Levy’s most rewarding experiences turn out to be with an electronic screwdriver that bites efficiently into spoiled old wood, and her new electric bike, which whizzes her home along the Holloway Road with the groceries. She pays for the screwdriver and the e-bike, not to mention the groceries and her daughters’ trainers, by taking teaching and writing jobs that, she hints, are not ones that she would otherwise choose. Into this present tense Levy inserts incidents that reveal the conditions that made her want to break away from the family racket in the first place. She tells us about a man she knows who can’t look at his wife, another who never remembers women’s names, and a downstairs neighbour who invites her in for a drink but whom she actually values for the loan of his power tools. Working further back, earlier encounters show her dealing with random men who take up too much space, time and air in cafes, on trains and in conversation, barging into her narrative as if it is their natural right. It is to counteract this sense of diminishment that she sets about expanding her own domain. A neighbour, the elderly widow of the poet Adrian Mitchell, offers Levy her garden shed as a writing hut. It is a provisional kind of liberation, though, shared with a fuming deep freeze and a gas heater that makes the place sweat. Still, in case there is any doubt about the allegories in play, Levy describes this particular Garden of Eden as having its own abundant apple tree (the fruit goes splat on the shed roof) and a loving gardener-god who tends to all living things (in fact a handsome out-of-work actor). As the biblical allusions suggest, Levy is never shy about elevating her personal drama to the realm of the immortals. Still, she remains picky about which mythologies she is willing to co-opt in the process. Penelope patiently waiting at home for Odysseus to return from his adventures definitely will not do. Instead, Levy prefers to tell us about the Medusa who dares to return the male gaze, transforming all those gawpers into stone. Then there are the Maenads, the raving female followers of Bacchus who remind her of her friend Sasha, a high-flying city woman who goes out to get blind drunk every Friday. In an extravagant gesture of refusal Sasha always ends up being sick over her short-skirted business suit and high heels, a fantasy uniform of female empowerment that could only have been dreamed up by a male boss. Femininity for Levy, then, is a kind of shoddy masquerade, an elaborate costuming of body and desire that she no longer has any interest in maintaining. There’s nothing new about this idea. You see it in early radical psychoanalytical circles before it disappeared as the 20th century unfolded, pushed off stage by more pressing anxieties about life and death. After the second world war, Simone de Beauvoir re-engaged with the idea of gender as performance, only to see the thread get lost again in the 1980s and 90s with the emergence of so-called “lipstick feminism”, a mode that positively relished the dressing-up side of things. Now, in The Cost of Living, Levy explicitly recuperates De Beauvoir’s position, not only by engaging closely with The Second Sex, but by going deeply into the philosopher’s personal struggles to reconcile sexual love with intellectual liberty. The result is a piece of work that is not so much a memoir as an eloquent manifesto for what Levy calls “a new way of living” in the post-familial world. • The Cost of Living is published by Hamish Hamiltion.

She is right to do so. I am someone to whom this has already happened and now exist, brain intact but body useless, isolated among very old people with dementia. But it does not end there, for the end of the Independent Living Fund means I now face further humiliation and loss of a real life. I am 63 and have cerebral palsy. This is something that happens at birth. It is incurable and only gets worse as you get older. I have spent my life in a wheelchair and was for a while an academic researcher, but contractures, weakness and pain mean I can no longer manage even simple tasks. But the DWP is questioning my rights to benefits. I have just finished its 40-page form. It was such a degrading process. I felt less than human at the end of it. The deadline for return was so tight, with supporting medical documents demanded, that I had to struggle with it for days as nobody at the nursing home where I live felt able to help. Is it really worth surviving this? I just don’t know. In recent dealings with DWP, I feel that we are back to the bad old days of the Poor Law and the notion of weeding out the “undeserving poor”, that I am not being asked to prove a reasonable entitlement to benefit but rather to demonstrate why I should not lose entitlement to it. Apart from being left with a sense of not being valued by society as a person with a disability, the sad consequence of this is that I now feel I have neither the capacity nor the compassion to help others. I feel completely without a voice and hope you will allow me one.

The prime minister said the UK would no longer be sending “vast amounts of money” to Brussels so there would inevitably be more cash available for spending priorities, including the NHS. In a tweet on Wednesday, the foreign secretary, a leading Vote Leave campaigner, said: “Fantastic news about NHS funding. The fruits of a strong economy and a Tory government. Stand by for Brexit dividend!!” His missive followed May’s pledge this week to bring forward a long-term funding plan for the NHS in response to growing concerns that key health services are being overwhelmed by rising demand. She faces mounting pressure from within Conservative ranks, led by Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, and Johnson for her to ditch the small spending rises the NHS has received since 2010 and commit many billions of pounds a year instead. May said: “Of course, when we leave the European Union we’re no longer going to be spending vast sums of money, year in and year out, sending that money to European Union. “So there will be money available here in the UK for us to spend on our priorities, priorities like the NHS and schools.” However, she refused to use the term “Brexit dividend” despite being specifically asked to in an interview with the BBC. “Look, there’s going to be money that otherwise we would have been sending to the European Union that we’re going to be able to spend on priorities in the UK,” she replied. May’s reluctance to describe the return of the UK’s £8bn annual net contribution to Brussels as a “dividend” suggests she has reservations about implying there would be a net gain from leaving the EU. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the wider economic impact of Brexit will weaken the public finances by around £15bn per year by the early 2020s, the equivalent of about 10% of the NHS budget. May, who backed remain, once again refused to say whether she had changed her mind about Brexit. “Some were predicting great problems if people voted for Brexit. I said the sky won’t fall in, but it will be different and it will be different. Now, what I’m charged with as prime minister is delivering on that Brexit vote,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/apr/08/our-man-in-havana-cuba-music-mojitos","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"Our man in Havana: music, mojitos and swearing in Spanish","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/08/our-man-in-havana-cuba-music-mojitos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/apr/08/our-man-in-havana-cuba-music-mojitos","fields":{"headline":"Our man in Havana: music, mojitos and swearing in Spanish","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The grand windows of Casa Almson are flung wide, the trade winds offering a gentle breeze off the Florida straits as the sun descends across Havana, and I am learning Spanish. “Anoche, yo fui en un nightclub de mala fama,” I say. WAAAAHK. “What the hell was that?” I retreat to English. “Was that a duck?” Alma, mi profesora, cocks her head and listens as the creature makes another complaint. WAAAAHK. “It’s a goose,” she decides. “They’re making a Santería ritual.” She is referring to the creole religion of Cuba. “Not good news for the goose then?” I ask, and she shakes her head. At Christmas, I packed in my job to write a book in Havana. If you say mid-life crisis, I’m flattered you think I’m so young. I rented an apartment on the sixth floor of a beautiful, if put-upon building in Centro Habana, the most frayed part of the Cuban capital. Part of the plan was to immerse myself in the city, and very quickly life on the streets was tugging at me. On the first day, a man leaning against a wall said: “Mi amigo, what are you looking for?” I wasn’t really sure where to start with a question like that, so I stopped and almost got run over by a 1952 Chrysler. Getting to the apartment requires taking a lift like the one that delivers Mickey Rourke to hell in the film Angel Heart. The operators, Juan and Miriam, take turns. They close the gate and up we trundle in the cage, passing washed-out windows, bare bulbs and gritty floors. Juan plays Bryan Adams at deafening volume, and Miriam is so hungry she hasn’t the strength to press the button, so we start giving her breakfast. Once inside, Casa Almson offers up high ceilings, elegant cornicing, slightly disreputable art and balconies on every side. It’s an elegant platform from which to look down on the city. I am joined by my pal Chris, who is finishing a book on the opioid crisis in the US, and we write in the mornings. Once in a while, Chris shouts and we rush to the balconies to watch ships steaming in – they glide past the Morro Castle and into Havana bay, sounding their sirens as they come. The house is not a refuge, though. The street comes up and in. There is the constant rumble of the 1950s cars, the shouts of hawkers selling everything from meat to peanuts to water. There are arguments, laughter and, of course, music. One afternoon, again during my Spanish lesson, a furious row breaks out next door, every word audible through the well of the building. “You know how the eskimos have 100 words for snow?” says mi profesora. “Well, we Cubans have 100 words for dick.” In the afternoons, I leave Chris to write, and go on adventures. Sometimes it is enough just to walk. It’s one of the few cities in the world where you can saunter up the middle of the road. The bici-taxis swerve round me, asking where I want to go as I watch people shout up to friends on the higher floors, who then lower baskets for their provisions. “You know why everyone walks in the centre of the road?” a friend tells me. “It’s because there is a real danger of falling masonry.” It is true, the city is falling to pieces, but another Cuban friend will say, “Don’t look at the buildings, look at the people.” It’s hard not to look at both. From the mad hubbub of Centro, I wander into Vedado, a beautiful old neighbourhood of villas. On the more elegant streets, ancient jaguey trees drip vines while their roots tear up the paving stones. Here it’s possible to see a little of the lives being led behind the 19th-century facades, where Habaneros battle with shortages and bureaucracy by gripping on to culture and, the occasional swearword apart, an immense good humour. At sunset I am back in Casa Almson learning Spanish, but sometimes mi profesora is away, and Chris and I go and sit on the wall of the Malecón, the road that edges the sea, or else find ourselves in the garden at the Nacional, the most august hotel in the city, drinking mojitos. Where once eating was a trial in Havana, now it’s all choice. Using a crib sheet provided by expat travel specialist Toby Brocklehurst, we go in search of the best Havana now offers, superb restaurants such as La Corte del Principe where the ceviche is world class, or else San Cristóbal, where Barack Obama took Michelle during their 2016 visit, and which is only a few yards from Casa Almson. And from there, as the city cools to night, La Fábrica de Arte calls. It is a cultural centre that has become a great nightspot. Created out of an old cooking oil factory by Afro-Cuban musician X Alfonso, it attracts anyone looking for a good time, and all disappear into the warren where in one place there’s an art gallery, another a live music stage, elsewhere a club, and lots of secret little rooms where hidden conversations take place. It’s usually the early hours before the city quietens. Beyond the shuttered windows of the house, there is the faintest whisper of music from a club or passing car. But the night the goose got it, the Santería initiates spilled on to the streets and began a singing competition, outdoing each other with their unaccompanied ballads, clearly enjoying their voices bouncing off the for once silent streets. For a while I laughed, but then I rolled over and put earplugs in. Sometimes one needs a break from full immersion.

Worcester’s fly-half, Jamie Shillcock, can be heard making a complaint of homophobic abuse by a Sale player, soon after a scuffle with Solomona in the 56th minute of the match, and the England wing will now face a disciplinary hearing next Thursday. Solomona faces a charge of “conduct prejudicial to the interests of the union or the game”, following what the RFU has described as “alleged verbal abuse”. Shillcock made the allegation to the referee, Andrew Jackson, and while he did not appear to identify the opponent in question, he explained: “He said it three times. He made a homophobic slur twice.” Jackson replied to Shillcock and the acting Sale captain, Jono Ross, that he did not hear any remarks but that any allegation would be dealt with after the match. Any ban may jeopardise Solomona’s hopes of being part of England’s tour of South Africa in June – not least after he was warned over his future conduct by Eddie Jones having been sent home in disgrace from a pre-season training camp following a late-night drinking session with Manu Tuilagi. Verbal abuse of an opponent about their religion, colour, sexual orientation, national or ethnic origin carries a ban of between six and 18 weeks. The nature of the charge, however, which falls under the RFU rule 5.12, means the disciplinary panel may use punitive measures outside those sanctions. “In the weekend’s Premiership match between Sale Sharks and Worcester Warriors, Solomona allegedly verbally abused a Worcester Warriors player,” read an RFU statement. “The incident occurred in the second half of the match.” In January the Toulon and France centre Mathieu Bastareaud was banned for three weeks – reduced from six in mitigation – for verbally abusing Benetton’s Sebastian Negri in a Champions Cup match. Bastareaud was picked up by television footage calling his opponent a “fucking faggot”. The Wasps flanker Sam Jones has confirmed his retirement at the age of 26 following a freak injury suffered when practising judo at an England camp in October 2016. Jones was wrestling with Maro Itoje when he suffered an ankle dislocation, a fracture of the fibula, rupture of the medial ligament and significant damage to ankle cartilage. Jones has undergone a series of operations since but on Thursday announced his decision on medical advice. It is understood that the RFU’s insurance policy – in conjunction with the Rugby Players’ Association and the Premiership – covers career-ending injuries such as these. An RFU statement read: “We are very saddened to hear of Sam’s retirement from the game and we wish him all the very best for the future.” Jones had yet to win a cap for England but had started last season in superb form and was earmarked as a future international having been part of the same age-group side as Joe Launchbury and Elliot Daly. The Wasps director of rugby, Dai Young, said: “It’s awful news. Sam’s situation has really hit me hard. When I came into the club we had a lot of retirements and injuries. We needed someone to step up and lead from the front and Sam Jones was that man. He was only a young man but was someone I could rely on – he’s been a rock for me throughout my tenure at Wasps. Jones added: “The injury was a complicated one and my rehab wasn’t progressing the way we wanted, with multiple setbacks along the way. I’ve therefore reluctantly had to listen to medical advice and retire from rugby. The decision was made for me, which was tough to hear. But I understand it is in my best interests.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/02/what-to-do-with-your-easter-leftovers","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"What to do with your Easter leftovers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/02/what-to-do-with-your-easter-leftovers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/02/what-to-do-with-your-easter-leftovers","fields":{"headline":"What to do with your Easter leftovers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With Easter over, our thoughts turn, somewhat more reliably than the weather, to summer – and, for some of us at least, the pressing need to shed some winter insulation. The task is not made any easier by chocolate bunnies breeding like ... well, rabbits. The only solution is to make a feast of the festive leftovers, then get back to the 5:2 diet or spin classes once consumed. The Easter joint is likely to be your most pressing problem. Cold roast lamb freezes well (be sure to strip it from the bone first) but is also the traditional base for shepherd’s pie. Simmer slowly with any leftover veg and gravy or a good lamb or beef stock, season with Worcestershire sauce and tomato puree or ketchup, then top with buttery mash and bake in a hot oven until golden. Cooked lamb is also lovely briefly fried in a hot pan until crisp and then served on top of hummus with pine nuts and a sprinkling of za’atar, and it is a good excuse to knock up a biryani, a sweet, nutty korma or a fiery rogan josh. A quick moussaka or a rich tomatoey ragu with lovely fat pappardelle will bring a welcome breath of southern sunshine to early April. Stale hot cross buns call for fruity bread and butter pudding, perhaps with chocolate custard made with the excess eggs; but if you want do something a bit different, break them into crumbs, toast them in a little butter until crisp, and then sprinkle on top of ice-cream or Greek yoghurt – or simply dunk in egg (chicken, not chocolate), sprinkle with sugar and fry up for breakfast. The surplus is most likely to be egg-shaped, though, and if you don’t want to find yourself handing out Mini Eggs to trick or treaters come Halloween, it is wise to melt down the stash now. Chocolate crispy cake is the classic choice, but tiffin, hot chocolate, mousse and brownies are all attractive options to make with kids, who might also enjoy smashing them into chunks to go in chocolate chip cookies. Alternatively, you could lie on the sofa and scoff it all in one sitting – it is amazing how tempting salad will seem afterwards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/30/mps-criticise-government-oversight-of-academy-school-finances","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T07:34:32Z","webTitle":"MPs criticise failure to tackle excessive salaries in academies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/30/mps-criticise-government-oversight-of-academy-school-finances","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/30/mps-criticise-government-oversight-of-academy-school-finances","fields":{"headline":"MPs criticise failure to tackle excessive salaries in academies","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government has come under fire over a series of shortcomings in its oversight of academies, including a failure to address excessive salaries paid to senior staff and inadequate rules governing related party business transactions involving £120m of public money. A hard-hitting report by MPs on the public accounts committee (PAC) said unjustifiably high salaries in academy trusts were depriving cash-strapped schools of vital funds for children’s education. Academy accounts for 2015/16 revealed more than 100 cases of executives being paid salaries in excess of £150,000. The committee went on to say it was alarmed that in two-thirds of cases where the government went on to challenge these salaries, the academy trusts were unable to provide satisfactory responses. The report, published on Friday, also calls for changes to the Department for Education’s (DfE) rules governing related party transactions which it says are weak and open to abuse. In such transactions academy trusts pay public money to individuals or businesses with whom they have a prior personal and often family connection. According to published accounts, in the year ending August 2016 40% of academy trusts engaged in related party transactions worth a total of £120m. The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), which oversees the finances of academies, requires any such transactions to be disclosed in the academy trust’s accounts. The report concluded: “The DfE’s rules around related party transactions are too weak to prevent abuse”, adding, “these arrangements between academy trusts and related parties should arise by exception, rather than with the current frequency”. In a climate of growing financial pressures on schools, the PAC accused the DfE of not doing enough to identify academy trusts at risk of financial difficulty and a lack of clarity around what happens to funds and assets when a multi-academy trust fails. Academies are state schools that are not under local authority control, but are run by private trusts. Launching the report, Meg Hillier, PAC chair, said: “More than two million pupils are taught by academies in England. The governance and financial management of these schools is fundamentally important to pupils’ educational outcomes and future life prospects. “The cost of failure where an academy chain runs several schools is hugely damaging for pupils and government needs a better grip of when chains are at risk of failure.” The committee said academy trusts were being handed large sums of public money and it was crucial they showed the highest standards of governance, accountability and financial management. Too often, however, they were falling short of these standards and the DfE was too slow to react. MPs welcomed the DfE’s publication of the first academies sector annual report as a step forward in improving transparency and accountability in academies but complained it was not published until nearly 14 months after the end of academies’ financial year. And they called on the DfE to urgently address concerns arising from the accounts, in particular inflated salaries among senior trust staff. “Excessive trustee salaries deprive the frontline of vital funds and it is alarming that, in two-thirds of cases where government has challenged individual trusts on pay exceeding £150,000, it has not been satisfied by the response,” said Hillier. “The DfE must assert its authority in this area as part of a more proactive strategy to safeguard pupils’ education and public money across the sector. That means identifying more quickly trusts at risk of financial difficulty, enabling it to intervene effectively.” Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said: “While most schools face brutal budget cuts, and teachers are experiencing real term pay cuts, this report confirms what we have long known; that some academy trusts appear to be using public money to pay excessive salaries.” She added: “We have long called for related party transactions to be banned, because of the scope for financial impropriety. Teachers, parents and pupils need real and meaningful oversight and democratic accountability, not the fractured and unstable landscape that the academy reforms have delivered.” A DfE spokesman said: “Thanks to the hard work of teachers and government reforms, academic standards In England have consistently risen since 2010, with 1.9 million more pupils in good or outstanding schools – and 450,000 of those pupils now study in a sponsored academy that was typically previously underperforming. “All academy trusts operate under a strict system of financial accountability and have to publish their audited accounts. To ensure all pupils get the excellent education they deserve we continue to scrutinise the system on an annual basis and take action where necessary, such as recently asking all trusts paying high salaries to justify them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/29/harry-kane-outside-chance-tottenham-hotspur-squad-chelsea-ankle-injury","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T21:43:00Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino believes Dele Alli needs to be helped, not booed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/29/harry-kane-outside-chance-tottenham-hotspur-squad-chelsea-ankle-injury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/29/harry-kane-outside-chance-tottenham-hotspur-squad-chelsea-ankle-injury","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino believes Dele Alli needs to be helped, not booed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino has urged supporters of rival Premier League clubs to get off Dele Alli’s back for the common good of the England team. The Tottenham manager has noted the treatment Alli has come in for at away stadiums – largely because of his reputation for diving – and he wants the critics to remember that the player is 21. Pochettino is preparing for Sunday’s visit to Chelsea and he reported there was the small possibility Harry Kane would return to his squad following ankle ligament damage. He added Alli was fit after the slight groin problem that held him back during the international break. Ali was under discussion after Gareth Southgate suggested he was not a certainty to start for England. Pochettino said he would always help Alli through difficult moments – sometimes by delivering home truths – but he also pleaded for less hostility towards him. “You can see every time that we play away from home, the fans focus on him and it’s a moment to stop and try to help because, for me, Dele would be such an important player for England, not only for Tottenham,” Pochettino said. “It’s not to give presents but, yes, to help him because he is a talent. “For every player there are tough moments and in those situations the most important thing from my side is to support Dele – but not be funny with him or nice. Sometimes you need to push him and be tough. Those situations are in my manager’s room and we have a lot of chats. It’s about trying to help a very talented player, an English player.” Pochettino believes there is no better 21-year-old in world football than Alli. “The problem is that in the last two seasons he was unbelievable,” Pochettino said. “Younger players always have ups and downs. This season the expectation was massive, maybe too high. “If you compare him with normal 21-year-olds – they are still living at home with their parents; they are still at university doing stupid things. Sometimes we expect too much and put too much pressure on 21-year-old players. Sometimes we forget and treat them like 40-year-old men. We need to be focused on Dele still being a kid. There’s a lot of pressure on his shoulders and he cannot always act how the people and the society expect.” Kane was injured at Bournemouth on 11 March and the expectation was that he would be out until mid-April. But the striker is ahead of schedule and, although it is more likely that he will feature on Saturday week at Stoke, Pochettino did not rule him out of the Chelsea game. “I cannot say no but I cannot say yes,” he said. “Maybe next weekend [he will return]. It’s not about his body, it’s about his brain. The most important muscle that he has is his brain. He’s so determined, so positive.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/05/my-best-shot-photograph-stan-douglas-flirts-races-vancouver","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"Stan Douglas's best photograph: flirts move in at the Vancouver races","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/05/my-best-shot-photograph-stan-douglas-flirts-races-vancouver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/05/my-best-shot-photograph-stan-douglas-flirts-races-vancouver","fields":{"headline":"Stan Douglas's best photograph: flirts move in at the Vancouver races","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I created this image of a 1955 scene at Vancouver’s Hastings Park racing track in 2008. It was one of three shots of different crowds I planned in the run up to a bigger commission about the city’s 1971 Gastown riot. The images form a series entitled Crowds and Riots – from workers being unionised in the 1930s to police in the 1970s corralling protesters, they deal with the creation of a particular group. The Hastings Racecourse crowd were emblematic of the postwar period, when the advent of consumerism provided a way of rebuilding the economy. It showed the newly created middle class: people who were making things being able to buy those things, a sort of perpetual motion machine for capitalism. My work had mostly focused on landscapes and locations – settings where there was no particular action, though the possibility of action was always there. I hadn’t really photographed people at all. The Gastown project was going to cost about half a million dollars, so I needed to make sure I knew what I was doing. The scene was supposed to be a sunny one, the kind of soft, even light you get in Vancouver. On the day of the shoot, though, it was raining, so we had to have a big tarp over the top of everybody, then do the lighting in such a way that some were in sunshine and others in shadow. Oddly, the other shot we did that day was a street protest scene on a rainy day – and the sun came out. We had to use large flags to block out the sunlight. A lot of the 30-odd crew members were on costume and makeup because we had to dress and do hairstyling on so many people: the 1950s were a time when men wore hats and suits when out in public. Also known as Terminal City, Vancouver is at the end of the line. If you’re trying to get away from something, it’s the last place you can go. There was a tiny black population in the 50s. My father had emigrated from Tobago to Canada to go to university. So I had one person I imagined would be a Caribbean immigrant, and another an American immigrant, each with different outfits based on where they came from. Hastings Park wasn’t too far from Chinatown, so there’s an Asian person there, too. We seated the performers on the kind of wooden benches they would have been sitting on and gave them exact facsimiles of the racing cards and magazines they would have bought. One performer rolled up theirs into a tube – we can’t see much of it, but that little trace tells the story of the whole. I began the shoot by telling the performers: “You’re rooting for your horses; watch the horses.” But because they were mostly extras, not actors, they didn’t do a great job. Then I noticed that what was happening between takes – the dynamics between individuals when they weren’t acting – was much more interesting. That was an important lesson for me about working with people: instead of asking them to pose, give them something to do. Exhibited, this photograph is about two metres wide. I had to shoot it in two parts – with several takes for each. It took about two and a half weeks of editing in Photoshop to make the final image. When a group like the one depicted here has a common purpose – watching the horses – they’re collectively doing one thing. But once that goal disappears – the race is over – they become individuals again. This image captured the moment when the group gave way to the individual. Some turn into themselves, others try to reach out and make contact with others. There’s the guy in the bottom left telling off-colour jokes, and the woman is clearly offended. There’s the man trying to pick up another woman in the foreground. The two guys who don’t have a prop looking over someone’s shoulder – it looks as if they’re looking at his racing form. I went on to develop ideas in this series further when I restaged images of the 2011 London riots in Hackney. Created in 2017, they depicted an altogether different group, created in a hugely different way to the passive consumerist collective of Hastings Park: the people who, after the 2008 recession, were left behind, and whose collective act of rebellion had no real aim other than to vent their rage. • Stan Douglas: DCTs and Scenes from the Blackout is at David Zwirner, New York, until 7 April.

Excuse my bitter laugh","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Did you read the recent speech by the president of the CBI, Paul Drechsler, who called on policymakers “to make education in England about more than results and rote learning and prioritise teaching that encourages thoughts, questions, creativity and teamworking”. Was this a shock? After all, it flies in the face of what we’ve been told. In January 2015 your schools minister, Nick Gibb, said that the government’s reforms, which emphasise the acquisition of knowledge, were what employers were demanding. I’ve seen this played out in the increasing amount of material my children have had to learn off by heart for tests. Primary school teachers right now will be “prioritising” the grammar, punctuation and spelling test [pdf], based on the false premise that every question in these tests has a right or wrong answer. The writing children have to do is dominated by requirements that it should include specific grammatical features, as fixed by the invisible priesthood that governs such things. I wonder what Drechsler would have said as I pored over homework on metals the other day, which involved learning some 20 pages of a textbook off by heart. As we were wading through the three ways of getting metal out of ore, I wondered if any of this had been connected to real things – like a chunk of rock with metal in it? Nope. No time for that. In case your first thought is that these matters are best decided at the court of Pisa (or any other international testing apparatus), Drechsler reported the Pisa chief, Andreas Schleicher, saying that English policymakers “are reacting to [his] test results in a different way to other nations. In other countries, policymakers are trying to improve performance by encouraging students to take responsibility for their own learning.” Excuse the bitter laugh. The effect of your party’s reforms is that “responsibility for their own learning” may well be interpreted as, say, logging on to faceless websites that are in effect little more than digital worksheets. Have you seen the nonsense dished up as secondary school modern language learning, where you click on lists of words to translate, ripped from context, without even their articles (eg le or la) and, even more absurdly, you have to click on them in what is an entirely arbitrary but “right” order, or you can’t proceed? Let me imagine your objection to Drechsler’s argument: data. Before your time, someone convinced your department that the more you test, the better education becomes. It seems to add up: teach, test, find out who needs help and give it to them; those schools where those who need help aren’t getting better are bad. Close them; reopen them; carry on. The fallacy is it assumes that all that is worthwhile can be tested and all that is tested is worthwhile. What really matters is the stuff that can be turned into data. The ease with which data can be collected determines what is taught. So primary English has to help children “infer” what’s going on in a text. They are only allowed to make one kind of inference. All other inferences are wrong; zero marks, including for fiction.

Staff who responded to the survey complained of leaks, mould, damp and even vermin; they described busy corridors packed too tightly for two-way traffic and teachers being knocked down as a result. Nearly half (48%) reported that numbers of pupils on the roll at their school had significantly increased in the past five years, with seven out of 10 (72%) saying class sizes had become larger as a result. To cope with the surge in pupil numbers caused by a population bulge, one in five (21%) said classrooms had been created in Portakabins or by carving out space in other areas of the school, and more than half (55%) complained there was inadequate room for staff and pupils to move around their classroom safely and for effective learning to take place. Asked to comment on the state of their schools, one teacher said: “The school was built in the 1950s as a temporary school and it wasn’t meant to last more than 20 to 25 years. It was supposed to get a new build from the government but it didn’t go through. It is riddled with asbestos and the roof badly leaks whenever it rains.” Another commented: “We have two old mobile classrooms. The heating often does not work and children sit in coats to learn. There are frequent problems with the toilets and drains. Numbers on roll are increasing and we cannot accommodate them.” And another: “Not enough space for pupils to sit and eat – have introduced outside catering kiosk so that they can stand and eat outside as well as inside. Massive litter problems. Vermin in outside spaces and inside some areas of buildings.” The survey was conducted by the NASUWT teachers’ union and published on Friday as its annual conference got under way in Birmingham. Of the 1,250 teachers who took part, more than a third (37%) said the quality of their school building was poor, compared with 36% who said adequate, 17% good and 9% very good. Some raised concerns about their schools’ spending priorities. While half said their school had made significant investments in the past five years, just under a third (29%) claimed the money had been invested on rebranding the school while just over one in five (22%) said it had been spent on hiring consultants. Chris Keates, the union’s general secretary, said the survey revealed a “disgraceful picture of schools in the 21st century”. “The impact of the government’s failure to plan adequately for the predicted increase in the number of school places is clear for all to see.” That failure, she added, was “compounded by those employers who rather than invest in the maintenance of their school buildings and improving the learning environment, have chosen instead to stockpile their funds in reserves or give priority to vanity projects which have little or no impact on educational outcomes”. A Department for Education statement said the government was investing £10bn to maintain, improve or rebuild school buildings between 2016 and 2021. “We have also created 825,000 places since 2010 and despite rising pupil numbers, the average class size has seen little change. In fact, the average primary class size is 27.” According to the Local Government Association, almost half (49%) of councils across the country are at risk of being unable to meet rising demand for secondary school places within the next five years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/29/australias-ball-tampering-scandal-delivers-bout-of-soul-searching","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T17:27:48Z","webTitle":"Australia's ball-tampering scandal delivers bout of soul-searching","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/29/australias-ball-tampering-scandal-delivers-bout-of-soul-searching","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/29/australias-ball-tampering-scandal-delivers-bout-of-soul-searching","fields":{"headline":"Australia's ball-tampering scandal delivers bout of soul-searching","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Australia was on Thursday confronting arguably the gravest sporting crisis in its history as cricket’s ball-tampering scandal hurtled on with an outpouring of tears, resignations and national soul searching. The team’s coach, Darren Lehmann, was red-eyed as he announced he was quitting following the public breakdown of its captain, Steve Smith, on live TV during a press conference so ashamedly apologetic it verged on uncomfortable. In January the same Australian team demolished England in an Ashes whitewash, the pinnacle of the international game. For several years they have celebrated a macho, win-at-all-costs culture which encouraged merciless ribbing of their opponents. But Smith looked a broken man as he stuttered and sobbed his way through an apology to the click of dozens of camera shutters. He choked on his words when considering the effect the scandal has had on his own parents and the children of a country which prizes sporting achievement above almost every other area of public life. “To all of my team-mates, to fans of cricket all over the world and to all Australians who are disappointed and angry. I’m deeply sorry,” he said, “I love the game of cricket, I love entertaining young kids, I love kids wanting to play the great game of cricket that I love. “If any good can come of this,” he added, “if there can be a lesson to others then I hope I can be a force for change. I know I’ll regret this for the rest of my life. I hope in time I can earn back respect and forgiveness.” Smith is among the more affable of an Australian team often regarded collectively as arrogant and boorish. He prefers spending time analysing cricket videos in his hotel room than partying when on tour. But over the past week he has been vilified, boarding a flight from Johannesburg flanked by several burly South African policemen and clearly affected by jeers of “cheat, cheat, cheat”, from onlookers. It was Sunday morning when the Australian public woke to news that their cricket team, which had previously enjoyed near-deity status, were embroiled in a cheating storm during a test match in South Africa. Talented 25-year-old batsman Cameron Bancroft had been reportedly coached by the famously divisive former captain David Warner how to use sandpaper to illegally rub the ball in pursuit of an advantageous reverse swing. Smith had turned a blind eye to the plan. It was caught on camera and has been replayed millions of times across the world in slow motion. Five days on and few figures in positions of power in Australia are yet to have their say. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said the cheating “beggars belief,” while former captain Michael Clarke said it was “like a bad dream”. During a remarkable five-minute address to the world’s media at Sydney airport, Smith appeared genuinely contrite and never more so that when reflecting on the affect the publicity has had on his dad Peter and mum Gillian. “To see the way my old man has been,” he said, pain etched on his face, “and my mum, it hurts. I just want to say I’m sorry for the pain I have brought to Australia and the fans and the public.” Peter stood behind his son throughout the press conference and placed a comforting hand on his back. Some questioned whether the intensity of the reaction had grown out of kilter with the crime. Lehmann has previously ordered his players to “headbutt” the line of what is acceptable on-field behaviour. He had performed a U-turn earlier in the week, promising his team would become the “nice guys” of world cricket under his watch but by Thursday, and after witnessing Smith’s distress, he concluded his position was untenable. Wiping tears from his bloodshot eyes, Lehmann said: “The feeling is that Australian cricket needs to move forward and this is the right thing to do. I really felt for Steve, as I saw him crying in front of the media. I had no prior knowledge of the [ball-tampering] incident and do not condone what happened, but good people can make mistakes.” David Warner has emerged as the primary instigator of the ball-tampering plot but has remained almost silent on the issue. He posted on Twitter that he would soon have his say. At the arrivals hall of Sydney airport he paused briefly with wife Candice, each of them cradling one of the couple’s two infant children. “My priority is getting these kids to bed,” he said as a video camera was thrust in his face, presumably appealing to the Australian public’s forgiving side. Warner has been given a 12-month ban by Cricket Australia and told he will never be assigned a leadership position again. Smith is also banned for a year while Bancroft will not represent his country for at least nine months. The damage to the reputation of the national team and Australian sport is unforeseeable but the financial implications are mounting. There was a mass exodus of sponsors of both the international team and individual players on Thursday. Fund manager Magellan Financial Group tore up a three-year team-naming rights deal, which was only seven months old and reported to be worth about A$20m (£11m). Commonwealth Bank, Australia’s biggest lender, said it was dropping Smith as an ambassador “in light of recent circumstances” and the 28-year-old, who had been captain since 2014, was also fired as a Weet-Bix brand ambassador."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/02/sex-for-rent-accommodation-rogue-landlords-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T05:59:02Z","webTitle":"Sex for rent … the rogue landlords who offer a ‘free’ room in return for ‘favours’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/02/sex-for-rent-accommodation-rogue-landlords-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/02/sex-for-rent-accommodation-rogue-landlords-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Sex for rent: the rogue landlords who offer free rooms in return for ‘favours’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"To the unaware, the true meaning of some of the phrases used on the ads for tenants could be missed. Rooms for rent are offered in exchange for “benefits” or “keeping me company”. Others are less subtle – “free accommodation in exchange for an erotic arrangement”. Renting rooms for sexual favours is seen as a growing menace by campaigners, and a byproduct of a housing crisis where young people are unable to find somewhere to live without spending exorbitant sums. The problem has become particularly marked in university towns, where young women are targeted by rogue landlords. But while then justice secretary David Lidington last year said such offers may breach the Sexual Offences Act, there is frustration that more is not being done. “Since last year, there has not been a single arrest, let alone a conviction, let alone anybody actually going to jail for it,” says Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove. Kyle has been campaigning on the issue and has consistently called for landlords who offer accommodation in exchange for sex to be prosecuted. Room for ‘favours’ The offending adverts typically offer free room or bed share in exchange for “intimacy”, “benefits” or “fwb” – friends with benefits. While many appear in London, room shares in exchange for sex are advertised around the country through sites such as Craigslist. “Free accommodation for attractive female (Central London)” reads one of a selection from Craigslist. “Maisonette share, very low cost, with Dominant strict gentleman S London”, says another posting. “Room available for homeless woman (North London/Essex)”, reads a further ad. One landlord claims to be a 35-year-old professional, “posting the ad to see if any lady would be interested in free accommodation in exchange for an erotic arrangement”. His ideal tenant would be “an attractive girl. Sex is, of course, what I’m proposing ... but look ... we have to like each other and have some chemistry.” A broken system Campaigners for fair housing have said the “sex for rent” ads have come about as a result of a dysfunctional housing market. “Some people are desperate for housing. Others have the power to exploit that,” says Kate Webb, head of policy at Shelter, the homeless charity. This was grimly illustrated in a survey carried out last year where people detailed their experiences. One woman told how a landlord wanted to have sex with her in return for keeping the rent down – while her six-year-old daughter was in the garden. “He was asked to leave. He did. Damp was never fixed. Asthmatic kid still needed hospital.” Another told of how she received a text from the landlord after a viewing saying she could have the flat for free if she performed some “very explicit sexual acts with him”, even though she is gay and had visited with her wife. Another woman, who was struggling to pay the rent one month, was thrown out when she refused to provide sex. Paul Noblet, head of public affairs at Centrepoint, says thousands of young people are taking desperate measures to get off the streets. He is calling on the government and police to enforce the law. “If the government is serious about ending the crisis of youth homelessness, it must build more genuinely affordable homes and provide sufficient funding for homelessness services.” The law The Ministry of Justice has previously said that offering accommodation in exchange for sex is inciting prostitution, an offence which can carry a sentence of up to seven years in jail. Katie Russell, of Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales, says the Sexual Offences Act defines sexual consent as when an individual “agrees by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice”. “Agreeing to have sex with someone under the pressure and fear of homelessness, or in exchange for the basic right to have somewhere to live, does not equate to agreeing by choice,” she says. “Any sexual activity without consent is a very serious sexual offence.” Prosecutions are difficult as many women, especially female rough sleepers or those trapped in abusive relationships, are unlikely to go to the police, but websites do have the power to act, says Webb. She welcomed last year’s statement from the Ministry of Justice to stop the crime becoming normalised. “It was important to state that this is not legal, it is not acceptable, to stop it from snowballing.” However, Kyle has become frustrated at the lack of prosecutions in the area. “We do not necessarily need new laws, I just want to see the existing ones applied. Advertising in this way is not against the law – only the actual transaction is. This makes prosecution difficult.” Some police are hesitant to commit large resources to the problem in cases which may not secure a conviction, he adds. The other victims While much of the attention is focused on women being exploited, vulnerable young men are also targeted. Men can fall to the bottom of the local authority housing list, as they are seen as less at risk than women, says Duncan Craig, chief executive of Survivors Manchester, which supports male survivors of sexual abuse and rape. “If you are sleeping on the streets and a stranger offers you a warm room, a comfortable bed and a shower, the temptation may be too great.” When contacted by the Observer, Craigslist did not respond to questions. A spokesperson for Gumtree, where the Observer found an ad that was subsequently made unavailable, says it has systems to block similar posts. “We do not tolerate these types of advert on Gumtree. We have a variety of measures in place to ensure they do not make it on to the platform, and work closely with law enforcement agencies to share information. “We have met with Peter Kyle to discuss this important issue and provide reassurance that Gumtree does – and will continue to – remain compliant with the law. We work hard to ensure Gumtree is a safe place to find tenants or a place to live,” it says. Kyle has welcomed the moves by Gumtree, which he describes as proactive in trying to resolve the problem. Craigslist, however, comes in for severe criticism. “It has not returned my calls, or responded to letters written on parliamentary paper ... I cannot stress [enough] how disgusted I am with them.” A number of the ads found by the Observer on Craigslist were subsequently removed, apparently after being flagged by users. What the ads say ‘I have a spare room for someone who likes to get naked at home. Send naked pic and details if interested.’ ‘I’m offering free temporary accommodation for nice, kind and tidy lady in exchange for cooking, cleaning, and keeping me company’ ‘Room for a female guest only. Temporary for two weeks and free if you are willing to do the cleaning etc.’ ‘Room for homeless woman. Rent free and food provided. Any race welcome.’ ‘Female of any age to share room. King-size bed. I don’t want payment. Just company. Nothing sexual unless we both want it.’ ‘A fresh start rent free. Local small business owner. Employment if wanted. Wanting a woman for long-term friendship.’ ‘Free accommodation and bills for a woman in exchange for house work and fb/fwb. House mate only home two to three days a week due to work. Please send picture and description.’ ‘I am looking for a female tenant … I would offer a suggestion of a different arrangement instead of money, but I am happy either way.’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/29/antonio-conte-chelsea-tottenham-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T16:02:09Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte spells out why Chelsea have to beat Tottenham in showdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/29/antonio-conte-chelsea-tottenham-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/29/antonio-conte-chelsea-tottenham-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte spells out why Chelsea have to beat Tottenham in showdown","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Antonio Conte has conceded Chelsea’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League may hinge on beating Tottenham on Sunday. Chelsea, who are fifth, five points adrift of Spurs with eight games to play, hope to extend the visitors’ wretched record at Stamford Bridge. Tottenham have not won there for 28 years. Conte is unsure whether Thibaut Courtois and Andreas Christensen, who withdrew from international duty with Belgium and Denmark respectively, will be available after suffering hamstring and groin problems. “This is an important game for us,” the Chelsea manager said. “Our target for this final [stretch] of the season is to take a place in the Champions League and reach the final of the FA Cup. If we win on Sunday we’ll go very close to Tottenham. Otherwise it will be difficult to take a place in the Champions League. “We are talking about a great team, a really good manager and a team with many talented players. I have great respect for Tottenham. In the last few years they grew a lot. Now they’re one of the best teams in England. But nothing is impossible.” Courtois and Christensen will be assessed, with Willy Caballero and Gary Cahill ready to play. David Luiz is ruled out with a knee problem and Ross Barkley, recovered from his latest hamstring problem, will play for the under-23s on Saturday. “We have two big problems – Courtois and Christensen – and we have to check if they are in the right physical condition to have good games,” Conte added. “Otherwise I have to make a different decision. One solution would be Cahill in the middle. We are talking about a great player and someone I trust, and it wouldn’t be the first time Cahill would play in this role. “With Barkley, we are talking about a player that is coming back from a bad injury, seven months without playing. We want to have patience with him and then to be sure before we bring him back to the first team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/mar/29/a-spotters-guide-to-the-royal-weddings-biggest-absolute-chancers","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T16:21:39Z","webTitle":"A spotters’ guide to the royal wedding’s biggest absolute chancers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/mar/29/a-spotters-guide-to-the-royal-weddings-biggest-absolute-chancers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/mar/29/a-spotters-guide-to-the-royal-weddings-biggest-absolute-chancers","fields":{"headline":"A spotters’ guide to the royal wedding’s biggest absolute chancers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ladies and gentlemen, we are officially T-minus about seven weeks. On 19 May, Ms Meghan Markle will marry Prince Harry, expunging all previous incidents of casual racism from the record. The event will take place at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, and none of their proper friends has the first clue it’s Cup Final day. That said, when the Archbishop of Canterbury asks if anyone knows any reason they should not be joined in matrimony, it is going to go to VAR for two minutes. Other than that, the day promises to be one of gaiety for the nation. Of course, there will always be stick-in-the-muds who cannot be even ironically amused by an event that they have – let’s face it – partially paid for. Returning home after William and Kate’s wedding, which I had been covering, I learned that my husband had not seen a single second of the day’s proceedings, having instead decided to watch The Sorrow and the Pity, a four-and-a-half hour documentary about Nazi collaboration in Vichy France. What can you say? Having failed to catch any of the ceremony, he was unable even to answer my inquiry as to whether there had been any crossover between the featured players in that searing 1969 work and the royal wedding guestlist. (You’d have thought at least a couple.) Anyhow, as veterans of such fixtures know, a royal wedding means many things. Glorious partworks, limited-edition bone china and the tantalising prospect of US broadcast contracts for some of the royal family’s most rococo ex-servants. Fear not, we will come to him more fully in a bit. Because it’s not just about Paul – it’s about the royal experts, the bookies, the rogue state dictators and so many more. In this spirit, Lost in Showbiz launches a glorious partwork of its own. Chancers of the Royal Wedding will celebrate some of the people for whom the event presents a fairly lunatic form of commercial opportunity. Many of us are chancers, of course – I myself am writing this article about it all, and I suspect it won’t be the last. I count myself as at least in the third or fourth circle of the chancer Inferno. In the ninth circle, we’ll place all the psychics telling us what Diana thinks about Meghan. And so to our chancers. Paul Burrell Well, there’s no show without Punch. At this time of year, Princess Diana’s former butler can reliably be found on a tour of the southern hemisphere reality formats, and has duly just completed a stint on I’m a Celebrity Australia. Without the wedding, Paul would have little to occupy himself, other than linking Liam Hemsworth with his role in series five of The Crown. With it, he has a very busy few weeks ahead. According to the Mail, Paul “has hinted he’s not expecting an invitation” to the wedding, much in the way I have hinted I am not expecting a call-up to Gareth Southgate’s World Cup squad. Paul explains that this is because Princes Harry and William have “moved on” from the time when he “belonged to their world”. In terms of the precise moment at which they “moved on”, I always feel it was probably when they discovered he’d stuffed large amounts of their mother’s dresses and personal possessions in his attic “for safekeeping”. As for the ensuing trolley dash – the tell-all books, the TV deals, the teasing of their mother’s innermost secrets - we may never be able to put our fingers on exactly why Paul no longer “belongs to their world”. But I am pleased to report he is contracted for a primetime Fox special entitled Meghan Markle: An American Princess, and the US will certainly want more in the lead-up to the day. The only question is that of his billing. I’m not sure Paul will find “former butler” to his liking any more. A year ago, he had to deny he was trying to flog a story about a gay orgy on the royal yacht, which his agent said he had told Diana about “when he worked with her”. If you enjoyed that “worked with”, as though the princess and her butler had been business partners, you may care to note that Paul has now upgraded their relationship even further. “She was my friend,” he told the Australian media this month, “and I loved her very much … Take away the fact she was a princess – just think of her as a woman, which is what I thought of her behind closed doors. … I feel I do have a responsibility to talk about my friend, because it may inspire other people.” Yup. It has certainly inspired me to update the succession rankings. Paul is formally moved to 14th in line to the throne, bumping down Peter Phillips’s daughter, Savannah. Let’s hear much more from him at his very earliest. Kim Jong-un Strange though it may seem, the current North Korean dictator’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, issued a set of commemorative stamps to mark the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, and the next year went on to release two further sets: one to commemorate Princess Di’s 21st birthday, and the other to mark the birth of Prince William. Might Kim Jong-un be as susceptible to philately, and consider a re-run for Harry and Meghan? Perhaps unlikely. Then again, issuing collectible stamps is a way of printing money, plus the move has the bonkers inscrutability Kim likes to cultivate. Pencil this one as “developing”. The psychics If we are to believe the psychics, Princess Diana spends much of her afterlife speaking to their good selves. And yet, if only they had more artful imaginations, their work would provide so much more merriment. Take John Edward, the one who was recently in the I’m a Celeb jungle with Burrell, and gave him a “psychic reading” in which he claimed to be speaking to Diana. Edward told Paul: “Your friend wants to tell you that the dream where she came to you in the royal blue dress was real.” Now let’s look at how the conversation should have gone. “Hang on – I’m getting someone … ooh, It’s Diana.” Gasp! What’s she saying? “She’s saying: ‘Paul, when you’ve finished taking away the tea things, can you whizz this jacket to the dry cleaners so I can wear it when my actual real friend Elton comes over later for dinner and a row.’” One who always delivers is Diana’s psychic healer, Simone Simmons, who we last heard from when Princess Di contacted her to explain she would have backed Brexit. During that conversation, Simone also claimed Di told her “the right person” was someone other than Meghan – so make of that what you will. I’ve a feeling in my waters that we’re due another intervention from Simone, but for now we have psychic twins Terry and Linda Jamison, who this week revealed Diana had told them she’d be at the wedding. The royal experts To give you a sense of scale, there are almost more royal experts in this country then there are minor royals on the continent. Most of them are journalists, meaning levels of intermarriage are thought to be similar. On the basis that we have to start somewhere, today’s featured expert is Ingrid Seward, editor of royal jazz-mag Majesty, whose title is believed to be a reference to its editor as opposed to its subject matter. “American manners are different than British manners,” Ingrid sweetly told the New York Post when the engagement was announced. “Meghan can’t walk down the street eating or chewing gum.” Anything else? “We hold our cutlery differently. It’s a whole different culture.” Majestic. And I know this tireless scourge of the non-U will have kicked herself afterwards for saying “cutlery” instead of “knives and forks”. We must hope Ingrid will emerge on the big day itself, if only to accept a few posies from wellwishers. The bookies Confusingly, royal weddings offer bookies media opportunities in the form of announcements that they have stopped taking bets on things. There is no piece of wedding arcana so obscure that they would not find themselves “forced” to suspend the market on it, or risk their entire business. This has already begun. According to Paddy Power, “our traders have been inundated” with people betting that Meghan’s wedding dress will be designed by house of Alexander McQueen, to the point that they have “stopped taking bets”. Please don’t be so unsporting as to inquire if they have honestly taken a lot of bets. Instead, just play along with the idea that betting shops were so deluged by gamblers shouting “I’ll have a monkey on Oscar de la Renta” that people were unable to use the fixed odds terminals in soul-sucking peace.

Police believe the crash happened at about 10.30pm on Tuesday, but the white Fiat 500 was spotted and reported by a passing motorist at 5am on Wednesday morning. Ella Alford and her friend Aimee Clayton, both 18, were pronounced dead at the scene. Hampshire constabulary said it was impossible to say whether the teenagers’ lives could have been saved if the crash had been reported earlier. The force appealed for information from other motorists on the road at the time of the incident, particularly anyone with a dashcam. Alford and Clayton were due to sit A-levels at Peter Symonds college in Winchester. Its principal, Stephen Carville, said: “We are deeply saddened to hear of the loss of two of our students. They both had such bright futures ahead of them. “We will be doing our very best to support our students. In time, we will talk to the students and parents about the best way we can celebrate the lives of these girls and find some way of creating a lasting memorial.” Pupils said the two had been close friends since secondary school, and that there were tears in class as the news spread. Floral tributes were left at the crash site by friends and classmates. One message, signed Alex, read: “Aimee, I want to thank you for the time we spent together. One of the most amazing, beautiful and loving friends.” The crash happened on the eastbound stretch of the A30, near Clayton’s home at Hook. Specialist investigators were picking through the wreckage on Thursday to try to determine the cause of the crash. Sgt Andy Noble of Hampshire police said on Thursday: “Our investigations have narrowed down the time of the collision and we believe it happened at about 10.35pm on Tuesday evening. “We had a great response from the public following our appeal yesterday for help … Now that we have a more precise time, I would urge anyone who was travelling along that road at around 10.35pm to contact us because they could have information that could assist our investigation.” On social media, local road users said it was a dangerous stretch where there had been many accidents, with speed limits rapidly changing from 50mph to 30mph."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/29/epa-climate-change-memo-downplay-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T17:03:17Z","webTitle":"EPA accused of urging staff to downplay climate change after memo leaks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/29/epa-climate-change-memo-downplay-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/29/epa-climate-change-memo-downplay-scientists","fields":{"headline":"EPA accused of urging staff to downplay climate change after memo leaks","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Scientists have accused the US Environmental Protection Agency of distributing misleading statements about climate change, following the leaking of an internal email advising agency staff to downplay the certainty of the science.

However, the email, obtained by HuffPost, also sets out ambiguous talking points favoured by Pruitt, such as: “Human activity impacts our changing climate in some manner. The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of that impact, and what to do about it, are subject to continuing debate and dialogue.” The email adds that “while there has been extensive research and a host of published reports on climate change, clear gaps remain including our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it”. Joel Scheraga, senior climate adaptation adviser to the agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, was one person to forward the email, which states Pruitt encourages an “open, transparent debate on climate science”. An EPA spokeswoman said the points were “developed by the office of public affairs. The agency’s work on climate adaptation continues under the leadership of Dr Scheraga.” Since becoming EPA head under Donald Trump, Pruitt has erroneously denied that carbon dioxide is a “primary contributor” to warming that has seen the Earth’s average temperature increase by about 1C (1.8F) over the past century. Pruitt has also said industrialization has warmed the planet “to a certain degree” but that “humans have most flourished during times of warming trends”. During his tenure, the EPA has removed information on its website about climate change, scrapped a climate adaptation program and advocated the need for “regulatory certainty” by loosening emissions regulations for vehicles and the fossil fuels industry. A televised “red team, blue team” debate between climate scientists and those who reject the science has also been mulled. Pruitt was a vocal supporter of Trump’s decision to remove the US from the Paris climate agreement and is busy dismantling the Obama administration’s clean power plan, which Pruitt fought in court when attorney general of Oklahoma. Scientists have pointed out that while the exact ramifications of climate change are yet to play out, the science behind it is well established and points directly to human culpability. A major report released by government scientists last year reiterated that humans are the “dominant” driver of global warming, with it being “highly likely” that the release of greenhouse gas emissions has caused more than half of all warming since 1951. The email forwarded by Scheraga is “literally true but carefully crafted to mislead”, according to Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. “There is uncertainty in climate science, but the uncertainty spans the range of climate change being somewhat serious to extremely serious,” he said. Dessler said any gaps on scientists’ understanding are not big enough to declare climate change a “non-problem”. He added: “And what we can do about it is quite clear: to stabilize the climate, we need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to near zero.” Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist and climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: “If confronting serious risks depended on first converting risks to certainties, no one would get flu shots, there would be no attempt to reduce stockpiles of nuclear weapons and businesses would fail at a high rate, having made no efforts to mitigate their risks. “Mr Pruitt is engaged in a disingenuous effort to stall measures to mitigate climate risk under the false pretext of concern about uncertainty.” The leak comes as it was revealed that Pruitt, already under fire over his use of first class air travel, lived last year in a Washington DC house co-owned by the wife of a leading energy lobbyist. Property records obtained by ABC News show that Pruitt lived in a townhouse partly owned by Vicki Hart, the wife of Steven Hart, chief executive of lobbying firm Williams and Jensen. Hart’s clients include the NRA and gas company Cheniere Energy. “Pruitt’s corruption knows no bounds and he should be fired immediately,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, one of a coalition of environment groups who have demanded Pruitt be removed from his position.

The system uses an app that can run on a £20 mobile phone to analyse sounds in the environment and issue a warning if it hears the telltale buzz as a mosquito swoops past. While the app can already tell when the insects are close, the next step is to make it good enough to identify different species from their audio signatures, and so tell malaria-carrying mosquitoes from less dangerous ones. “Hopefully this will save lives,” said the project’s Yunpeng Li, who works on machine learning at Oxford University. “If we can identify the species, we can tell people in areas where there is malaria that these mosquitoes are around and that they need to take care, to use bed nets and so on.” There are more than 3,000 species of mosquitoes in the world, but only about 50 of them, all belonging to the genus Anopheles, spread the malaria parasite at dangerous levels. Following a steep decline in global malaria cases since 2010, reduced investment means infections are on the rise again. In 2016 the disease claimed the lives of 445,000 people globally, with more than 90% in sub-Saharan Africa. To build the early warning system, the Oxford team recorded mosquitoes in the lab and gathered more audio signatures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an army research unit in Kenya and scientists working in the forests of Thailand. They then converted the audio signals into frequency features and trained an algorithm to learn the signature pattern created by mosquitoes in flight. Preliminary tests with inexpensive phones found that the app could detect the presence of mosquitoes from about 10cm away, depending on background noise. The system is likely to be most effective if the phone is placed in an area that is attractive to mosquitoes, such as next to a lamp. The whine of a mosquito varies as it grows, but Li believes the algorithm can learn the telltale audio signatures produced by different species. The pitch of a mosquito’s buzz depends on how fast it beats its wings – around 300 times per second is typical – but the tone is accompanied by higher-frequency harmonics. Features such as the wing size and shape feed into the overall sound the mosquito makes. To boost the accuracy of the early warning system, the researchers will now process 100 hours of recordings in the wild and in labs, including scores of mosquito whines. They are hoping the public will help with the task by listening to two-second audio clips and saying whether or not they can hear a buzzing sound. If they can, the clip will be fed into the algorithm, along with any details the scientists have on the species. Those wanting to take part on the Zooniverse website can train themselves first by listening to examples of mosquito whines. Ultimately, Li wants the app to do more than protect people against malaria-carrying mosquitoes. With the early warning system, researchers could build up real-time maps of mosquito populations, and scientists in the field could identify mosquitoes more easily. In areas where mosquitoes do not carry diseases, one way of collecting them for identification is to let them bite and then suck them into a trap. “It’s slow and very bloody,” said Li."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/29/iraq-war-poisoning-national-life-corbyn-brexit-britain-vietnam","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T17:46:14Z","webTitle":"Fifteen years on, the Iraq war is still poisoning our national life | Gary Younge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/29/iraq-war-poisoning-national-life-corbyn-brexit-britain-vietnam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/29/iraq-war-poisoning-national-life-corbyn-brexit-britain-vietnam","fields":{"headline":"Fifteen years on, the Iraq war is still poisoning our national life","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“You can tell a true war story by the way it never seems to end,” wrote Tim O’Brien in his novel about Vietnam, The Things They Carried. “Not then, not ever. In a true war story, if there’s a moral at all, it’s like the thread that makes the cloth. You can’t tease it out. You can’t extract the meaning without unravelling the deeper meaning.” For all the ways in which US politics remain unpredictable, the presence of the Vietnam war as an episodic inflection point remains constant. Only last week, after Donald Trump declared a ban on some transgender people serving in the military, it was pointed out that he avoided serving in Vietnam thanks to five deferments, the last for “bone spurs in his heels”. (When asked which heel a few years ago he couldn’t remember.) More than 40 years after the fall of Saigon, it continues to influence how Americans view politics at home. What has been true for Vietnam and America has become the case for Britain and Iraq. It is 15 years this month since Britain and the US invaded Iraq. The most important consequences of that war are, of course, in the place where it was fought, where it has left an estimated million people dead, destabilised a region, and spawned far more jihadist terror, including Isis, than it could ever have thwarted. The invasion’s legality and validity have been debated constantly, not least on these pages. But the legacy it bequeathed our political culture is less often acknowledged, even as it remains deep and enduring. Its most obvious impact has been its contribution to Labour’s current trajectory. Jeremy Corbyn’s stance on the war is a significant element of his appeal. When the largest march in British history took place against the war, he spoke from the podium. When he stood for leader he said it was illegal, that if elected he would apologise for it, and that if it were ever deemed a war crime, Tony Blair should go on trial. All his opponents who were MPs at the time voted for it; the one who wasn’t, Liz Kendall, voted against investigating it. It is also one of the reasons Corbyn’s parliamentary colleagues struggled to find a viable candidate to oppose him when they launched their coup. They were sufficiently aware of the popular mood to realise that they needed someone who wasn’t tainted by having voted for the war. That counted out most senior Labour parliamentarians with any ministerial experience. Owen Smith was championed, in part, because he hadn’t been an MP when the vote took place. But unlike Corbyn, his position on the war lacked clarity or consistency. During the leadership campaign he said he had been opposed to the war at the time; but in 2006 he said that at the time of the invasion he had thought it was part of a “noble, valuable, tradition”, and he didn’t know whether he would have voted against it. Iraq is also the primary and overriding reason why Blair could win three elections and yet now barely get a hearing in his own party, let alone beyond. Maintaining that he made the right decision and that the world is safer for it, he has opted to protect his legacy over restoring his credibility, and ended up sacrificing both. But the ramifications of Iraq go way beyond Labour, to a broader matter of trust between the public and the establishment. A year after the invasion, 60% said they had lost trust in ministers. Almost a decade after that, a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit argued Britain was “beset by a deep institutional crisis” with trust in government, parliament and politicians “at an all-time low”. The British Social Attitudes survey of 2013 concluded: “Those who govern Britain today have an uphill struggle to persuade the public that their hearts are in the right place.” Public trust waxes and wanes with the moment, and Iraq is not, of course, the sole prism through which these trends can be understood. There has been the financial crisis, austerity, MPs’ expenses, the NHS and phone hacking, to name but a few. And people forget that for most of the war’s first year, it was relatively popular. But as the situation deteriorated and no weapons of mass destruction were found, it contributed to a general sense of cynicism. Where politicians went in the public estimation, journalists followed. The willingness of so much of the media to uncritically accept the government’s case eroded confidence in journalism. When the government claimed Iraq could use weapons of mass destruction in 45 minutes, some acted less like journalists than stenographers: “45 minutes from attack” was the London Evening Standard front-page headline. “He’s got ’em let’s get him,” wrote the Sun. Liberal and left scepticism about the mainstream media over Iraq would later spread rightwards and find different targets and justifications – some more spurious than others. But if this was not the beginning of a popular wariness that we were being fed what is now termed “fake news”, then it was at least a step-change in that direction. Meanwhile, playing fast and loose with facts, misleading the public, producing dossiers full of lies, and ignoring or distorting expertise – all of which were central to the war effort – helped contribute to a culture in which experts are not valued, and facts are considered optional. When the political class wonders how our discourse has become so diminished, self-destructive and coarsened that the country is capable of rejecting the warnings of economists, presidents and specialists, they could do worse than start with the war that most of them supported. “I think Iraq is connected with Brexit,” Jeremy Greenstock, a former British ambassador to the UN, told Huffington Post a few months after the EU referendum. “The linkages can be traced from the protests over Iraq in 2003 to the vote in the June 2016 referendum to leave the EU: ‘The people up there in charge just do not seem to be taking our views into account.’” There are some who believe that this obsession with a decision made 15 years ago about a war in which combat operations ended nine years ago is perverse. This is deeply misguided. First, because many are still living with the consequences. Amnesia is the privilege of the powerful. The powerless do not have the luxury of moving on, because their nations have been flattened, economies ruined and sectarian divisions deepened and weaponised as a result of a war that was prosecuted in their name. Second, it was the greatest foreign policy error of a generation or more, in which most of the political class and the media class were entirely complicit. We cannot walk away – because it has changed who we are, and so wherever we go, this dark shadow follows us. • Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/29/ways-to-step-up-the-fight-against-global-antimicrobial-resistance","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T17:02:54Z","webTitle":"Ways to step up the fight against global antimicrobial resistance | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/29/ways-to-step-up-the-fight-against-global-antimicrobial-resistance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/29/ways-to-step-up-the-fight-against-global-antimicrobial-resistance","fields":{"headline":"Ways to step up the fight against global antimicrobial resistance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With drug-resistant infections now causing the deaths of half a million people a year, access to clean water and decent sanitation has never been more vital in the race to prevent a global antimicrobial resistance catastrophe. As Dame Sally Davies poignantly highlighted in your report (Experts issue new warning on overuse of antibiotics, 27 March), “the importance of clean water, sanitation and vaccination must not be forgotten to avoid infections occurring in the first place”. This point, alongside the critical role of hygiene, is absolutely key. This is already a global health emergency, with 844 million people lacking access to clean water and 2.3 billion without safe, private toilets. In developing nations almost 40% of healthcare facilities do not have a water supply, 19% do not provide adequate sanitation and 35% do not have soap and water to sustain good hygiene practices. Without these basics in place, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings becomes almost impossible. So it is no surprise that hospital-acquired infections are the third major driver of antimicrobial resistance globally. Diarrhoea, pneumonia and cholera are often preventable through basic improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene. When they strike, the pathogens that cause these infections are commonly treated with antibiotics, and are becoming increasingly resistant to available drugs. Antibiotic use to prevent diarrhoea could be cut by 60% in India, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil simply by improving people’s access to water and sanitation, and improving hygiene behaviours. Disease outbreaks are harder to control when sanitation is poor and there is no clean water. Yet progress on delivering water, sanitation and hygiene is too slow, and not sufficiently threaded throughout the efforts to tackle this looming antibiotic crisis. World decision-makers must acknowledge the pivotal role that water, sanitation and hygiene play in preventing infection and reducing the spread of resistant pathogens, before the next global health crisis hits. Investment in all three elements of water, sanitation and hygiene must be prioritised, and coordinated with other efforts to address the rise of antimicrobial resistance, globally, nationally and locally. As the old adage goes, prevention is better than cure. Never have those words been more true and more urgent. Margaret Batty Director of global policy and campaigns, WaterAid • Your report makes a strong case for concern about the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. But it ignores the elephant in the room – or rather, the pig and the chicken. The developed world still uses a lot more antibiotics than developing countries, and the vast majority of these are fed to animals on factory farms. Though not taking antibiotics for a sore throat can help extend the usefulness of current antibiotics, changing the way we produce meat is much more important. Plant-based meat from new cutting-edge companies like Beyond Meat and Moving Mountains is both delicious and sustainable, and doesn’t require any antibiotics. And clean meat – actual animal meat grown outside of the animal, with no antibiotics necessary – is rapidly approaching price competitiveness, thanks to the efforts of companies like Memphis Meats. Moving quickly to plant-based and clean meat is the best thing we can do to avoid pandemics of antibiotic-resistant superbugs.

A side who spawned Barry John, Phil Bennett and Carwyn James have long been known for their adventure and skill but, in a town that has produced tinplate for the past 71 years, success was also built on steel. The Welsh region, who have followed last season’s Pro 12 title by reaching the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup for the first time since 2007, have become a favourite with neutrals. They have a gung-ho attitude and handling skills evocative of a bygone era when the Welsh game was club-based and Llanelli were pre-eminent. The manner of the league success, winning away to Leinster in the semi-finals with a bedazzling display of off-loading, lines of running, support play and pace before running Munster into the ground in the Dublin final, led to the Scarlets coach, Wayne Pivac, and the attack coach, Stephen Jones, being tipped as successors to the current Wales management after next year’s World Cup. Jones made more than 300 appearances for Llanelli and the Scarlets in a career that included 104 caps for Wales and six for the Lions. He was the fly-half in the three semi-finals the club and the region have contested, in 2000 when they lost to Northampton in extra time, in 2002 when Leicester pipped them with a late penalty and in 2007 when the Tigers prevailed by 16 points. “I have special memories of Europe and special nights in Stradey (Park, Llanelli’s old ground),” said Jones before Friday’s quarter-final against La Rochelle at Parc-y-Scarlets, which sold out within 45 minutes of the 15,180 tickets going on sale. “It is wonderful to be involved in the knockout stage again, an experience which is special for players. It will be some occasion.” The Scarlets were within three minutes of going out at the group stage. They had lost their first two matches, at Toulon and at home to Bath, and were trailing Treviso in Llanelli by seven points in the third. Two quick tries, the second from the length of the field, kept them alive and they finished with a rousing victory at Bath before meeting the force of Toulon head on. “Our philosophy is to have a long attacking line and to move the ball,” Jones said. “We try to upskill every player here: you want your forwards to be comfortable in possession. It is a long process and you need to persevere. We lost our first three league matches last season but we were creating opportunities and, as the players became more comfortable with what we were trying to do, we started to take them. “La Rochelle have a massive pack and they will be slightly different from what we are used to. We beat Toulon here, a victory that summed up the character of the group. They put their bodies on the line in a huge defensive set at the end. It is a lot easier to get excited on the ball than putting your head where it hurts and defence sums up a team’s culture. Byron Hayward is doing a superb job as defence coach: to be the best, you need to be strong in the set pieces and defence as well as attack.” It will be the first time Parc-y-Scarlets has hosted a knock-out match in the Champions Cup. Llanelli made the quarter-finals in six of the first seven years of the tournament and did so again in 2004, the first year of regional rugby. After 2007 they failed to make it out of the group stage and between 2012 and the end of last season won six matches in 30. The arrival of Pivac from New Zealand and Jones from Wasps, the club where he finished his playing career and took his first steps in coaching, was transformative. “I learned a lot at Wasps, a top club, but had always intended to return home at some point,” Jones said. “I cringe when I think about some of my first training sessions: coaching is different from playing not only in the greater amount of time it takes up but in the way you need to keep evolving. “I was fortunate to play under some exceptional coaches like Graham Henry, Steve Hansen and Scott Johnson and have spoken to them all since I became a coach. At Llanelli we had Gareth Jenkins who tapped into the emotional side. I loved his attitude: he was someone who enjoyed what he did. I take inspiration from that.” Jones was Wales’s fly-half in the grand slam winning side of 2005, a year when they played with a fizz and verve thought to have gone flat in the European game. “It was a great time,” he said. “I want the players here to have the same enjoyment in what they do and to aspire to reach the top, as many of them have. The laws are constantly tinkered with which can affect tactics. You have to win but we want the game played in a certain way. We still have a way to go but after a tough few years for the Welsh regions, things are on the up. We want to make a big day for Parc y Scarlets the first of many.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/16/how-to-conquer-your-emails","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"How to conquer your emails","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/16/how-to-conquer-your-emails","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/16/how-to-conquer-your-emails","fields":{"headline":"How to conquer your emails","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘Inbox zero” is a mythical status that is merely another way for technology to reduce us to anxiety-riddled slaves to The Machine. It’s almost impossible to achieve, but it’s true that controlling your inbox (and not letting it control you) is the secret to productivity. If you’re freelance, you probably have several email addresses. Consolidate them into one inbox. I highly recommend an email address for shopping only. A different email address for work will save you weeks of deleting irrelevant messages. If you’ve had an email address since you were 12, as I have, it’s probably 90% spam hell. Don’t attempt the sisyphean task of unsubscribing from it all at once – just do a few at a time. One of the most effective things I’ve done is to create mailbox folders and use the VIP tool on my iPhone. I make certain individuals VIPs so their messages always sit at the top of my box. Any email from my accountants, for example, goes into a special folder that I prioritise. Another game-changer was to make three folders entitled Today, Week and Month, with the rules based on the date the email was sent. Every day I try to complete the Today box. If I miss it, every Sunday night I work through the Week box, and so on. This stops anxious thoughts such as: “Did I reply to that email, or did I just formulate the reply in my head?” If I am able to respond to an email immediately, I do. If I can’t because I need more information, or want to write on my laptop, I mark it as unread, so it isn’t forgotten. Many people have a habit of not replying to things they want to say no to, in the hope that the penny drops. Reply immediately.

So it was that both were in Saltaire, Yorkshire, at 10am the following Sunday – “a fine northern time of day for a brass band” – recording the song with the Black Dyke Mills Band. On the way back to London that night, the pair stopped at a pub in the village of Harrold, Bedfordshire, where McCartney sat at the pub piano to play a new song he’d written called Hey Jude. “There was never a long wait,” says Taylor, “between the musical will and the recorded deed.” First published in 1972, now with an excellent introductory essay by Jon Savage, Derek Taylor’s As Time Goes By was the first, and remains the sharpest, memoir written by one of the Beatles’ inner circle. Taylor had been press officer for the Beatles for less than a year in 1964, but that was when the role had mattered most, at the height of Beatlemania. Formerly a local newspaper man on the Wirral, he was tough and talented, dapper and witty, and seen as important enough that he was welcomed back into the fold when the group launched the Apple record label (and boutique, and film company, and electronics division) in 1968. The years in between were transformational for the Beatles, but hadn’t been uneventful for Taylor. He was persuaded to move to California with his family of six in 1965, and his Beatles connection, which he couldn’t shake, even after they split, meant he found work easily. He did press for the Beach Boys, just as Brian Wilson decided to retire from touring, shut himself away and produce Pet Sounds. He also worked with the Byrds, when they broke through – and peaked commercially – with Mr Tambourine Man in 1965, having to navigate the truculent band through a UK tour he described as “all the time, aggro and panic”. He notes wisely that while the Byrds were sneered at for tuning up on stage before playing, this was only “like any decent group in the 70s... the English then were not too patient or hip”. By 1967, Taylor was helping to set up the Monterey pop festival, which effectively launched the heavy rock era, and was taking on press for the Doors, Mamas and Papas, Buffalo Springfield and Captain Beefheart. He even tried to make a rock star out of Mae West, who revealed to him she had never made a cup of coffee in her life. It eventually proved too much and, facing burnout and an enormous tax bill (which the Beach Boys graciously covered), Taylor was ready to move back to Britain, where he oversaw the Apple press office and had to manage the Beatles’ messy demise for the media. Taylor was an elegant man, and an elegant writer, who knew when to deploy swearwords for maximum impact. Among the best chapters is one that describes a day in the life of the Apple office, which sounds relentless and miserable. In an attempt to make sense of the Apple circus, Taylor allows New York businessman Allen Klein to meet the Beatles – the mea culpa chapter 1969: Written Before It Was Too Late is heartbreaking, as Taylor admits his part in the Beatles’ breakup: “Workers sign in and out, the laughing is over... what have I done? Our Apple is all chewed up.” It’s easy with hindsight to think that Taylor had the easiest job in the world, working with such significant material, the absolute cream of 60s pop. Then again, it should be remembered that Pet Sounds was a commercial disaster in America and that its high reputation in Britain was partially managed by Taylor, who carefully gave copies to friends (the Beatles, the Stones) who might help its cause. When John Lennon is talking up a record as the greatest thing he’s ever heard, you’ve done a great press job. By the end of 1966, the Beach Boys even beat the Beatles to best group in Melody Maker’s readers’ poll. “I don’t know why,” Taylor says modestly, “they’d been around for years.” As Time Goes By works as an industry insider companion to Nik Cohn’s Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom, which saw the 60s’ pop explosion from a fan’s perspective. Both Taylor and Cohn started as journalists, but explain how the edges blurred – everyone involved in the scene was a fan, everyone had ideas, things moved forward fast on a diet of brandy breakfasts, boozy record launch lunches, acid-inspired shows and spliffs at home. The speed at which the Beatles and their contemporaries lived was unsustainable. “Did it happen, all of it, or was it a dream?” Taylor asks.

Having spent her 40-year career studying the human brain, she immediately knew just how bad this was. The neuroscientist was aware that the most likely explanation was a tumour in the area of her brain governing vision. Having twice overcome cancer – in the breast in 2009 and then melanoma three years later – the spread of the disease was already a frightening possibility. So when Lipska’s doctor called the following morning to report the results of an emergency MRI scan – three tumours in the brain, one of them bleeding, suggesting metastatic melanoma – she was undoubtedly devastated, but not completely surprised. The prognosis was “effectively a death sentence”. At her age, then 63, and with that number of tumours, she knew she could expect to have between four and seven months. Instead, three years later, Lipska remains the director of the Human Brain Collection at the National Institute of Mental Health in Maryland, is training for a summer triathlon and has written an account of her experiences. She hopes this will raise awareness of an aspect of her illness about which, even with her extensive professional experience, she knew very little. “The idea that I might lose my mind didn’t enter my thoughts and was never discussed,” she says. “All anyone focused on was that I might die.” Yet for two distressing months, after surgery and radiation and just as she began an immunotherapy clinical trial, Lipska slid into what she terms “insanity”, the tumours and swelling in the different areas of her brain triggering bewildering behaviour changes, lack of judgment, empathy and tolerance, and difficulty in relating to the world around her. For some time her family did not realise these changes were an indication of what was happening physically in her brain. “I wasn’t a completely different person, more a caricature of my worst traits,” says Lipska. “There was always a vague link to reality. It could be excused away.” When she summarily sacked a pest control worker, convinced of his intention to poison the household, alarm bells rang. Yet, reasoned those around Lipska, she was under a lot of stress, and of course the pest control chemicals were potentially toxic. Lipska herself had no awareness of her tenuous grip on reality. “I was sure that everyone around me was acting wrongly. I thought they were conspiring against me, being mean.” The irony, she points out, is that she needed a part of her brain that was affected – the frontal cortex – in order to comprehend the very fact of it being affected. When her brain was rescanned – her husband and adult children increasingly alarmed by her lack of empathy – 18 tumours were found. With the immunotherapy apparently initially unsuccessful, Lipska then began treatment with two drugs, trametinib and dabrafenib, newly available to patients with her type of melanoma. The “kitchen sink” of treatments began to work, shrinking the tumours. As Lipska’s ability to process emotions returned, the realisation of how unwell she had been was a difficult one. “The most awful thing was that I hurt the people I love. As I regained my sanity, started coming back to life, I saw that I had no insight into my behaviour, I couldn’t recall the emotions. I learned that I upset my grandsons, who I love like nobody else,” she says, recounting an incident in which she shouted at them. “I feel terrible guilt even now. For me and my family this was such a distressing part of my illness.” Yet for the doctors treating the disease that almost killed her, any resulting mental illness was – understandably, she accepts – not a priority. “The concern was the cancer, the treatment of the tumours. What happened to me mentally was almost dismissed. Even afterwards, oncologists were never curious about it.” As medical science advances, there are more survivors and medicine becomes ever more compartmentalised – “no one can specialise in everything” – but mental illness, she fears, risks being marginalised further. “I am a success story,” she adds, “a rare case. Not many survive my condition and are able to tell the tale afterwards. But if I had but lost my mind for ever, if the tumour had already ravaged the frontal cortex of my brain, if I had remained that monster and my family had had to live with that, would that be a success for me? I don’t know.” Lipska has dedicated her career to understanding the mechanisms of mental illness – focusing particularly on schizophrenia – and her own survival affords her a valuable new case study. “I hope that my insight into living in a world which makes no sense can help advocate for people who experience mental illness for all sorts of reasons,” she says. Most important, she states, is to build the understanding that mental illness is a disease of the brain and must be studied and treated as such, “just as coronary illness is a disease of the heart”. Notions of mental illness as different – “somehow involving blame” – still linger, she believes. “We are so far away from understanding how the brain functions. Understanding how it malfunctions is even further away. There is so much work to do.” At her most recent scan, in January, doctors discovered another small tumour. She has just completed a course of radiation. It was a “heartbreaking” discovery, but one she and her family hope is “just another bump on the road”. In June she is aiming to complete a half ironman triathlon with her family. As they did at the same event last summer, Lipska’s son will cycle, her son-in-law will run and she will swim with a guide. “It is an incredible, bonding experience, however slow I am now,” she laughs. Lipska’s illness has permanently changed her. She is blind in one eye, considerably weaker and she no longer fully trusts her mind. “My attitude to my brain and mental health has changed. I no longer feel invincible.” She is, she suspects, a “more feeling” scientist and a more tolerant person. When brains arrive at her lab, ready for research, Lipska and her team are simply given an age and a cause of death. “It could have been me. I look at them and I know each one holds so much personal history.” The Neuroscientist Who Lost Her Mind: A Memoir of Madness and Recovery by Barbara K Lipska is published by Bantam Press (£16.99)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/29/godolphin-charlie-appleby-epsom-derby-hopes-ghaiyyath-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T14:12:46Z","webTitle":"Godolphin and Charlie Appleby pin Derby hopes on Ghaiyyath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/29/godolphin-charlie-appleby-epsom-derby-hopes-ghaiyyath-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/29/godolphin-charlie-appleby-epsom-derby-hopes-ghaiyyath-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Godolphin and Charlie Appleby pin Derby hopes on Ghaiyyath","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"All eyes were on Aidan O’Brien during last year’s Flat season, as Ireland’s champion trainer chased and then passed Bobby Frankel’s record of 25 Group One wins in a season. So it was easy to miss the royal blue colours of the Godolphin operation enjoying their best campaign in years, with 18 Group Ones of their own around the globe, and Charlie Appleby seemed very confident in Dubai on Wednesday that the upward curve will continue. “Aidan O’Brien is the one that everyone’s trying to latch on to,” Appleby, who saddled four Group One winners on three continents last season, said. “But for ourselves, we’re very happy with the way that last year went. We built throughout the season and as we were going into this season, it was the biggest team of highly rated two-year-olds we’ve had for a long time. “They’ve wintered well and I feel we’ve got strength in depth throughout the whole team, in the older horses and the three-year-olds and also the two-year-olds we’re starting to get to grips with over the coming weeks and months. I’m confident we’re going to be very competitive this season.” The early part of Godolphin’s 2017 campaign was marked by internal bloodletting, as John Ferguson, the operation’s chief executive, was forced to quit after a rift with Saeed bin-Suroor, who also trains a big string in Newmarket, went public. This year the changes in personnel have happened already, with Joe Osborne, who took over from Ferguson, returning to his previous role with Godolphin in Ireland after barely six months in the job. Whether or not Osborne’s return to Ireland was linked to John Gosden’s increasing significance in the Godolphin operation is anyone’s guess. But it was Gosden who did the bidding when Sheikh Mohammed ended his long boycott of yearlings by stallions standing at John Magnier’s Coolmore stud at the major sales in the autumn, and Gosden who will train Gloam, a juvenile filly by Galileo out of the Breeders’ Cup winner Dank, who cost £4.2m at the Tattersalls sale in October. Their close neighbour’s increasing influence at Godolphin will surely increase pressure on Appleby and Suroor to get results, above all in the major classics in England, France and Ireland over the next two-and-a-half months. Wild Illusion, who gave Appleby his second consecutive success in the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac in October, is pencilled in for the 1,000 Guineas in either England or France but the keenest hopes in the stable must be for Ghaiyyath, who was an impressive winner of the Autumn Stakes at Ascot in October and is quoted at 25-1 to give Godolphin’s colours a long-awaited first success in the Derby in June. Both classic contenders spent the winter in Dubai and will return to Newmarket early next week. “The further Ghaiyyath goes, the further the improvement you’ll see,” Appleby said. “Whether we head straight to the 2,000 Guineas [at Newmarket] or whether we go down the Dante route [at York in mid-May], we’ll make that decision [once the horses are back in Newmarket]. They will ship out of here on Monday and Tuesday and when they get back, we’ll start to get to grips with them.” The form of Ghaiyyath’s win at Ascot will be tested at Newcastle on Friday when Purser (3.55), who finished nearly four-and-a-half lengths behind Appleby’s colt, lines up for the Listed Burradon Stakes. Gosden’s colt should prove up to the task, while on the All-Weather Finals day card at Lingfield, Goring (4.10) and Victory Bond (4.40) both go to post with big chances at current odds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/29/fifa-world-cup-no-british-referees-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T14:03:18Z","webTitle":"Fifa confirms no British referees will take part at Russia World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/29/fifa-world-cup-no-british-referees-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/29/fifa-world-cup-no-british-referees-2018","fields":{"headline":"Fifa confirms no British referees will take part at Russia World Cup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There will be no British referees at the 2018 World Cup in Russia for the first time in 80 years. Fifa has announced 99 referees and assistants for the tournament, with none from England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Mark Clattenburg was the only British referee named on Fifa’s long list of officials in summer 2016 but he forfeited his place when he left his job with the Premier League in February 2017 to move to Saudi Arabia. The FA attempted to replace Clattenburg but its request was rejected by Fifa. That means there will be no British officials taking part at the World Cup finals for the first time since 1938. Video assistant referees (VAR) will be chosen from the pool of officials at the tournament, with all selected to attend a two-week seminar at the Italian Football Association’s base in Coverciano next month. Europe will be represented by referees from Germany, Turkey, Russia, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Serbia, Italy, Slovenia and France, while there are six each from Africa, Asia, north and South America and two from Oceania. England’s Howard Webb was Britain’s sole representative at the World Cups in 2010 and 2014, taking charge of the final in 2010 between Spain and the Netherlands. In total three English referees have taken charge of the World Cup final – a tally that is equalled only by Italy. William Ling officiated West Germany’s surprise victory over Hungary in 1954 and Jack Taylor refereed West Germany’s 2-1 win over the Netherlands in 1974 before Webb oversaw Andrés Iniesta’s extra-time goal for Spain in South Africa. The Football Association and referees’ association PGMOL work together to put forward their choices for Fifa’s international list. The final decision is taken by the FA Referees’ Committee and they nominated Martin Atkinson, Stuart Attwell, Robert Madley, Michael Oliver, Craig Pawson, Anthony Taylor and Paul Tierney for 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"membership/live/2018/mar/31/weekend-reading-britains-brutal-slavery-history-and-a-french-escape","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"Weekend reading: paying the wrong people for slavery, and a French escape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/live/2018/mar/31/weekend-reading-britains-brutal-slavery-history-and-a-french-escape","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/live/2018/mar/31/weekend-reading-britains-brutal-slavery-history-and-a-french-escape","fields":{"headline":"Weekend reading: Britain's brutal slavery history and a French escape","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Slavery: When will Britain face up to its crimes against humanity After the abolition of slavery, Britain paid millions in compensation – but every penny of it went to slave owners, and nothing to those they enslaved.

Arthur, the South African who now heads up Pakistan, was sacked by Australia in 2013 in response to the homework-gate fiasco on their tour of India followed by David Warner’s punch on Joe Root in a Birmingham drinking establishment. Writing about the current situation in Australian cricket, which has led to three players receiving lengthy suspensions amid an outcry over the team’s general on-field behaviour, Arthur said: “Unfortunately, it was always going to end like this. Despite generational change, independent reviews and too many behavioural spotfires to list, Cricket Australia and the national team had demonstrated no real willingness or desire to improve the culture within their organisation from season to season. “That could lead to only one conclusion. An explosion. A deterioration of standards that would culminate in an incident so bad, so ugly, it would shame the leaders of the organisation into taking drastic action.” Arthur was replaced by Darren Lehmann, who despite being cleared of an involvement in the ball tampering has since called time on his tenure as coach. The 48-year-old was to be part of a “cultural review” into the side but this will now fall on a new man, with Justin Langer expected to be a frontrunner. How the Australia team go about their cricket from here, following an incendiary series with South Africa that has seen players on both sides embroiled in confrontation throughout, remains to be seen. Lehmann, before he quit, had held up New Zealand as the model for behaviour. Arthur admitted to faults of his own during a three-year reign but described Australia’s recent approach as “boorish and arrogant”, while condemning a propensity to dictate “the line” of acceptability to opponents at the same time. He added: “I’ve hated this talk about ‘the line’. What is ‘the line’? Who sets it? Who dictates how it is enforced? It is totally different culture to culture, yet the Australians believe they’re the ones who should be setting it? That it’s OK to intimidate a person from another country, another culture, during the day and be buddies with him afterwards? Nonsense. “The Aussies have played the victim when they deem the other team has overstepped the mark. And when they’ve been in the ascendancy and behaved badly, everything is OK because they have determined as much.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/30/the-it-dress-promote-brand-social-media-influencers-marketing","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T16:01:22Z","webTitle":"The It dress that shows how to promote brands and influence people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/30/the-it-dress-promote-brand-social-media-influencers-marketing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/30/the-it-dress-promote-brand-social-media-influencers-marketing","fields":{"headline":"The It dress that shows how to promote brands and influence people","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The dress of the summer isn’t by a famous high street brand, nor is it popular because it has been worn by a chart-topping singer or famous actor. The dress everyone wants to get their hands on is by the London-based label Kitri after an influential blogger shared it with her 344,000 Instagram followers. The £145 Gabriella dress – a green, belted shirt-style garment with a black and white flower print – has amassed ann 800-strong waiting list of 800 people after Charlotte Groeneveld posted a picture on Instagram mid-February as a part of a paid partnership between her and the one-year-old brand. When the dress became available to purchase on Kitri’s website a month later, almost 200 units sold out in 45 minutes. A new waiting list is now open. “We’ve worked with influencers before, but I don’t think that we’ve ever garnered this much attention with a dress,” says Kitri’s founder, Haeni Kim. Being a digital-first business allows it to reduce any price mark-up through wholesaling to retailers and eliminate the cost of a standalone store. Kitri retails between £45 for a T-shirt and £225 for a dress. The hype and subsequent sales of the Gabriella dress suggest that social-media influencers remain a major resource for brands to tap. Kitri is not alone in tapping into the world of influencers to profitable effect. Matchesfashion.com says its partnership with Leandra Medine Cohen (who has 626,000 followers) on its Shop With initiative produced a notably strong seller after she instagramed a photo of herself wearing a Toga coat. The post received 75,000 likes. Elsewhere, Danish brand Ganni attributes the sellout of its Banana T-shirt, which shifted 969 units within 10 weeks in 2016, to Instagram influencers such as Pernille Teisbaek (542,000 followers), Lucy Williams (322,000 followers) and Veronika Heilbrunner (158,000 followers) wearing it. Crucially, says Groeneveld, the secret to its success as a strategy is that it must feel authentic to work. “I’ve built a community of people who share similar style and like similar things, so in that sense it’s more likely that [my followers] agree with the things I believe we should buy, save, or toss, than from a random person they don’t have that relationship with. The personal relationship is all that matters and gives you all credibility.” Figures vary for paid partnerships and exact remuneration remains under wraps, but last year a study found 33% of marketers now allocate upwards of $500,000 to influencer marketing and brand partnerships, according to the trend forecasting firm WGSN. Another 2017 study, this time by the Influencer Marketing Hub, found 57% of marketers also have a standalone influencer budget. which, according to Sarah Owen of WGSN, “speaks volumes to the projected relevance this area will continue seeing”. She adds: “Forward-thinking brands are utilising micro-influencers for Instagram campaigns in order to promote their brand to a wider, yet more targeted audience.” Kitri is responsive. Its strategy of producing limited quantities of its designs also allows the label to generate additional drops in an agile manner when interest, just like that seen after Groeneveld’s post, picks up, without the risk of leftover stock. Kitri’s 10-person team is “working hard” to restock the Gabriella dress by the end of April or beginning of May, says Kim. “Influencers democratised aspiration,” says Owen. “Once considered a fleeting marketing tool, the influencer ecosystem has proved to be a longstanding, viable segment for brands seeking to convert likes to sales, all the while increasing brand recognition.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/01/newcastle-jets-v-melbourne-city-a-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T09:19:10Z","webTitle":"A-League: Newcastle Jets trounced at home by Melbourne City – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/01/newcastle-jets-v-melbourne-city-a-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/01/newcastle-jets-v-melbourne-city-a-league-live","fields":{"headline":"A-League: Newcastle Jets trounced at home by Melbourne City – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There were three goals, but it was not an exciting game. There were four yellow cards, but it was not a dirty game. I said at the start that a win was more important to City than the Jets as Newcastle are already guaranteed to finish second and City are battling with Victory to finish third. I also said that didn’t mean the Jets would take their foot off the gas. Well, I was half right. City did play with a single-minded resolve looking for a win, but Newcastle did indeed take their foot off the gas. There were three bookings in the first 40 minutes, but a great Bruno Fornaroli goal in the 42nd minute meant City were 1-0 up at half-time. After a very poor first half it seemed certain Newcastle would be better in the second, and they were, but it was very marginal. Goals from Dario Vidosic in the 53rd and 77th minutes put the result beyond doubt. Melbourne City have taken a major step towards finishing third on the ladder and Newcastle Jets have strolled through a game, reserving their energy for the finals. A well deserved win for the visitors, who moved up to third on the A-League ladder. 90+4 min: Last throw of the dice for the Jets, but O’Donovan was offside. 90+1 min: There are four minutes of added time. Also, the crowd was quite a bit bigger than I thought; there are 11,500 in the ground. Most of them will not be happy with the result about to be confirmed. 90 min: If City finish the season in third place they will be back in Newcastle in the finals. They will not be worried. 88 min: Snap shot from Fitzgerald, looking for glory in the dying moments of the match. But no joy for the sub. 86 min: Great free from Petratos, but Bouzanis makes a fine save, reaching it in the top right corner. 85 min: Another Brattan corner goes straight out from the left to the right. He is displeased that none of his colleagues rose up to head it in. But, frankly, it was too high even for big lad Delbridge. 82 min: Another substitution for City. Harrison Delbridge is on for Michael Jakobsen. 80 min: Great play from Luke Brattan led to a corner for City, but that just went straight back out the other side. Never mind, City are not going to lose now. This is going to be their second 3-0 win in a row. 77 min: That was a stunning kick from Vidosic, his second of the night. Newcastle Jets 0-3 Melbourne City. 74 min: Two substitutions as City wind the clock down. Vargas off, Champness on, and Fitzgerald replaces Fornaroli. 72 min: Rodriguez has brought some urgency to the field. His shot just now was well struck, but wide. 69 min: That rules him out for the game against Perth next weekend. I don’t think Georgievski will be too put out by that. Better to get it out of the way before the finals. Not that I’m suggesting he got booked on purpose. He’s not David Beckham. 68 min: The best thing you can say about the Jets’ performance so far is that maybe they’re saving themselves for the finals. They are certainly not making much of an effort today. 65 min: Nice pass from within the box by Rodriguez to Steven Ugarkovic, but his shot is no trouble to Bouzanis in the City goal. 62 min: Pato Rodriguez is on for Nick Cowburn. Hopefully he can gee up his Jets teammates a bit. Anything at all would be an improvement. 61 min: A better couple of minutes from Newcastle Jets there, or at least it was until Petratos hit a nothing ball far wide on the left. What was the point of that? Was it a very bad shot or a very bad pass? Either way, it was very bad. 59 min: Melbourne City are being very casual with the ball, as only a side who are 2-0 up and dominating possession can be. 56 min: I think the only question now is how many more goals City are going to score. Can they be the first team to keep a clean sheet against the Jets all season? Very likely. 53 min: I spoke too soon. Newcastle’s defenders just stood watching the ball as the cross came in for Vidosic. Newcastle 0-2 Melbourne City. 52 min: The Jets are showing a bit more pace and direction so far in the second half. Presumably Ernie Merrick had a few words with them at half-time. 50 min: Here is Fornaroli’s goal. What a great striker he is. 48 min: It seems the Jets are really missing Andrew Nabbout, who was snapped up by Urawa Red Diamonds less than a month ago. 46 min: Can Newcastle do better in the second half? They have to, they could not do much worse than their pedestrian first half. Newcastle has never quite set the world on fire musically (email if you disagree), but one band from there I really liked was Purplene. Fornaroli just loves scoring against the Jets. 45+2 min: Newcastle were very poor in the first half. They’ve made the finals, they can’t be usurped from second, Sydney are already premiers and the Jets look like they can’t be bothered. Their fans deserve better than this. 45 min: There will be two minutes of added time. Newcastle will just be hoping to not concede another in that 120 seconds. 42 min: Fornaroli scored as I was clicking save on the last post. City lead Jets 1-0 and they greatly deserve it. 41 min: Beautiful shot from Fornaroli, but no goal. 39 min: Vujica takes down Arzani on the edge of the box. Third yellow of the game. 36 min: Newcastle are playing like men looking forward to getting to the dressing room for a half-time rest. Come on lads, entertain us a bit. 34 min: Lots of space in the middle of the park, which just shows most of the action is taking place in the final thirds, mostly at Newcastle’s end. 31 min: The Jets have scored in every game so far this season, but City look far more like scoring any time soon this evening. 28 min: Fornaroli comes close again, with the ball bouncing around the box. After a mad scramble he could not keep his feet. City are definitely hungrier to win. 26 min: Fornaroli hits the side netting from the resulting free kick. 25 min: Topor-Stanley went right through Arzani on the edge of the box. 23 min: Arzani went in very hard on Jets’ keeper Jack Duncan. 21 min: Jamieson seems to think Ronald Vargas went down entirely of his own accord. He did not. Jamieson clearly fouled him. 19 min: Straight up to the other end and Bruno Fornaroli comes very close. Somehow, Newcastle get it out for a corner, which comes to nothing. 18 min: Long ball from Nikolai Topor-Stanley to O’Donovan. Good idea, but no joy. 17 min: Great free from Dimi Petratos, but Bouzanis is equal to it with a fine save. 15 min: Jamieson to Vidosic, looking for Fornaroli, but doesn’t find him. City are beginning to dominate. 13 min: Lovely play from City and Stefan Mauk really should have scored. Best chance of the game so far. 11 min: Dean Bouzanis was faffing about with a clearance and Roy O’Donovan almost got the ball off him. Very sloppy from the City keeper. 10 min: The ground is fairly sparsely populated. Maybe people are resting after eating too many easter eggs earlier. 8 min: Nice run from Riley McGree, but his shot was poor. He should have done better there. 6 min: Much better spell of possession from City just now, with 18-year-old Nathaniel Atkinson getting stuck in. 4 min: The Jets are dominating so far, with City taking a while to settle. 2 min: Some nice early play from the Jets, but O’Donovan shoots over. Maybe he’s rusty, but it was a tight angle. 1 min: Early touch for Irish man Roy O’Donovan, who is back from suspension after getting sent off a couple of weeks ago against Sydney FC. The temperature in McDonald Jones Stadium is in the mid-20s, which is far better than some of the scorchers we have seen in recent weeks. A win is more important to the visitors than the Jets, dare I say, with Newcastle already guaranteed to finish second on the ladder and City battling with their neighbours Melbourne Victory to finish third. Not that that means the Jets will take their foot off the gas. Emma Beckett wants to paint the town Jets. Good afternoon, the Jets v City game kicks off in about 18 minutes.

Cathay Pacific has reached the agreement with flight attendant unions. It also covers other uniformed staff. The Hong Kong-based carrier said: “Choice for our people is as important as for our passengers. “It is imperative that our customer-facing colleagues not only feel pride in wearing the Cathay Pacific and [regional airline] Cathay Dragon colours but that they also feel comfortable and empowered to carry out their duties to the best of their abilities.” This month flight attendant unions called on the airline to drop its skirts-only policy. Cathay’s uniform for female flight attendants includes a red skirt with two slits at the back, black stockings and black heels. “There’s sexual harassment, not only in the workplace but even in public transport, people trying to take pictures under their skirts,” said Pauline Mak, vice-chair of the Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Flight Attendants Association. “We’ve been encountering a lot of cases by our members … so I think this is one of the reasons why we tried to do something.” Others wanted the airline to catch up with the times. “The stereotype of the flight attendant is very old-style already: looking pretty, full makeup and wearing a skirt. It is a good time to have a revamp of our image,” Vera Wu Yee-mei, chair of the Cathay Pacific Flight Attendants Union, told Hong Kong media. The agreement came out of negotiations between union members and the company that concluded on Thursday. Mak said the option of trousers would be introduced at the next uniform refresh, which could take between three and five years. Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon will join the few airlines in Asia offering their female staff such an option. After two years of negotiations with unions, British Airways agreed in 2016 to let all of its crew wear trousers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/31/china-environment-census-reveals-50-rise-in-pollution-sources","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T01:50:01Z","webTitle":"China 'environment census' reveals 50% rise in pollution sources","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/31/china-environment-census-reveals-50-rise-in-pollution-sources","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/31/china-environment-census-reveals-50-rise-in-pollution-sources","fields":{"headline":"China 'environment census' reveals 50% rise in pollution sources","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"China’s environment ministry has said the number of sources of pollution in the country has increased by more than half in less than a decade. Releasing preliminary results of an ongoing “environmental census”, China’s ministry of ecology and environment said the number of sources of pollution in the country stands at about 9m, compared to 5.9m in its first census, in 2010. “The objectives and scope of the second census is different from those of the first one,” said Hong Yaxiong, head of the pollution survey at the ministry, Thursday. “But overall, there are more pollution sources.” The census did not say whether pollution had increased but declines in airborne pollution in major cities have been recorded in other studies. Hong said factories flouting emissions standards were the main problem. The ministry found 7.4m sources of industrial pollution, compared to a million in rural areas and 500,000 in urban locations. Five years ago, China declared a “war against pollution.” Since then, new coal plants have been barred from opening and existing ones have been ordered to cut emissions. Major cities restrict the number of cars allowed on the roads. This past winter, residents in Beijing were left without heat after their coal boilers were removed. As part of the campaign, officials this month expanded the powers of the country’s 10-year-old ministry of environmental protection to include water management, emissions reductions, agricultural pollution, and other duties previously managed by half a dozen other ministries. As part of its new remit, the ministry is holding a second environmental census, to be completed in 2019. It will look into industrial parks, as well as municipal and rural sources of pollution. “We will look into all kinds of pollution sources,” Hong said. China has made some important gains. Michael Greenstone, director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, analysed data from government air monitors collected between 2013 and 2017, and found that many of China’s densest cities have recorded major declines in air pollution. In Beijing, where several days of smog known as “the airpocalypse” of 2013 in part prompted China’s declaration of war, the concentration of fine particulates in the air fell 35%. “By winning this war, China is due to see dramatic improvements in the overall health of its people, including longer lifespans, if these improvements are sustained,” Greenstone said in a statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/06/its-not-perfect-but-implementing-murray-darling-plan-in-full-can-work","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T18:00:10Z","webTitle":"It's not perfect but implementing Murray-Darling plan in full can work | Jamie Pittock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/06/its-not-perfect-but-implementing-murray-darling-plan-in-full-can-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/06/its-not-perfect-but-implementing-murray-darling-plan-in-full-can-work","fields":{"headline":"It's not perfect but implementing Murray-Darling plan in full can work","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The latest proposal to cut 605bn litres of water from flowing down the Murray-Darling river system will test the nation’s faith in water reform. Transparency, accountability, trust: these have sadly gone missing from the nation’s plan for the health of the river system. Allegations of water theft, inequity for downstream communities and poor governance have all shaken the foundations of faith in the plan that state and federal governments agreed to in 2012. There is no perfect plan. But the Murray-Darling basin plan was agreed to by the federal parliament and only last year the prime minister secured a commitment from all state and territory governments to deliver the basin plan “on time and in full”. National water reform has and still can deliver substantial and sustained benefits for people and the nation’s river systems. The Murray-Darling basin plan is designed to recover 3,200bn litres of water per year to improve river health. This is not sufficient to restore all the elements that Australians value, like the Coorong wetland, nor does it address the looming threats from climate change to water availability and use. Despite this, the Wentworth Group supports the plan. If successful, it will be a historically significant step towards more sustainable industries, towns and the environment in the basin. Changing habits formed over more than a century is a daunting prospect. Yet the nation’s parliaments initially achieved just that – major changes in what has been decades of over-extraction of water. In recent years, however, the return of water to the river system has slowed to a trickle as pressure has been exerted on governments to unwind water recovery targets and halt the necessary purchases of water to sustain the river system. Only one-quarter of the 2,100bn litres of water recovered under the Water Act 2007 has been acquired since the basin plan was adopted in 2012. The cost of water has doubled as recovery programs now prioritise subsidising infrastructure rather than buying water rights. In February the Wentworth Group supported the Senate’s disallowance of an amendment to the basin plan that would have reduced water for the Darling river and downstream users by 70bn litres. With that reduction, only 41% of the target flow indicators for environmental health in the northern rivers would have been achieved. The Senate noted that reducing environmental water in the Darling river system would have rewarded the New South Wales government for its gross negligence in not managing water transparently and fairly in the basin. For example, the NSW government changed the Barwon-Darling water sharing plan rules to make it easier for irrigators to take water. The alleged rampant theft of water by some irrigators in NSW highlights the need for public interests in water to be protected through tougher laws, transparent access to information, and strong monitoring and compliance. State and federal governments are now proposing to reduce the return of water to the rivers by 605bn litres in an amendment to the basin plan that the Senate will consider in May. They propose to do this through 36 projects, costing $1.3bn, that would supposedly enable conservation of freshwater biodiversity with less water. Last year the Wentworth Group extensively evaluated the 36 proposed projects against 12 criteria adopted in the Water Act, the basin plan and inter-basin government meetings. Only one project clearly met all 12 criteria. One of the reasons was because the NSW government refused to release the business cases for its 11 projects. It is incomprehensible that the NSW government thinks the community would simply trust it, without releasing any information, with such massive public funding for projects that will make or break the basin plan. We do know the Murray-Darling basin authority had grave concerns with the quality of the states’ initial project proposals thanks to the Senate’s order for production of the authority’s assessment documents. Many of the problems with these projects can be fixed by locking funding and legislation for four crucial measures: Establishing flood easements and improving or relocating vulnerable infrastructure, as the Murray-Darling basin authority’s “constraints relaxation” strategy proposes. This will enable the limited environmental water to be released in pulses down the rivers to maximise environmental benefits by inundating the floodplain wetlands. Legislating for the recovery of the full 450bn litres per year promised by basin governments through water efficiency and related projects. Ensuring the projects for reduction of environmental water only proceed if they pass the 12 government-agreed criteria for effective projects. Ensuring the management rules behind the Murray-Darling basin authority’s water flow model are rigorously implemented (“prerequisite policy measures”) to prevent state governments shifting the goal posts to favour water consumption. Without the return of enough water, our rivers will be afflicted with more blue-green algae blooms, salinity levels will rise, more extensive areas of floodplain forests will die and internationally significant wetlands along the river Murray will be lost. Further, Indigenous communities, and pastoral and tourism industries will be badly affected. Without full transparency, the public can have no trust in water reform. We urge members of parliament to work together to implement the basin plan in full and on time by establishing effective flood easements, recovering 450bn litres through water efficiency and related projects, funding only the well-justified adjustment projects and properly implementing the agreed rules for managing the river system.

In an interview with the Examiner in Launceston, Martin says Tasmania will receive the windfall regardless, because he spent his first six weeks in Canberra “knocking on doors and spreading the word about Tassie”. Guardian Australia asked Martin’s spokesman what precisely had been agreed between the senator and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, during the recent flurry of backroom negotiations, and received the following response. “Cormann’s office and Senator Martin agree that $47.5m of funding is for key Tasmanian projects, $200m over four years for TFES ongoing funding, ongoing funding for TFES beyond 2019.” The TFES is the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme that provides financial assistance for the costs incurred by shippers of eligible non-bulk goods moved by sea between Tasmania and mainland Australia. Martin’s spokesman also provided a comment attributable to the senator. “From day one I came to Canberra to secure the best outcomes for Tasmania, and this is one of those wins”. Martin – who replaced Jacqui Lambie after her stint in the Senate was terminated due to the dual-citizenship imbroglio – also pointed to $100,000 “achieved for Tasmanian fruit growers for bio-security awareness [as] another one of those wins”. Guardian Australia asked whether it was Martin’s understanding that the financial agreements would be delivered by the government in the May budget regardless of the ultimate outcome of the company tax debate in the parliament, given that was what he told local media. Martin’s spokesman did not respond to the question. The government shelved the tax debate this week when it became clear it did not have the numbers to push it to a successful vote, because two crossbenchers, the South Australian Tim Storer, and the Victorian Derryn Hinch, were not yet over the line. Storer has made it clearer subsequently that he will not countenance the government’s proposal unless it is presented in the context of broader tax reform – which suggests it will be difficult for the Coalition to get the measure through. The government can’t break the current deadlock unless Storer falls over the line, or it persuades the two NXT senators, Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff, to reverse their opposition to the proposal. Since it would be unusual for the government to commit millions of dollars as a quid pro quo for a specific reform passing the Senate, and then pay up regardless of whether or not it achieved an outcome, Guardian Australia asked Cormann’s office whether this was, in fact, the agreement with Martin. No response has been provided over the past 24 hours. The government secured the support of the One Nation bloc of three senators in return for funding for a pilot program for 1,000 apprentices in private business, a deal reportedly worth $60m. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, indicated she was also lobbying the government to press ahead with proposed changes to the procedures before people become Australian citizens. Asked whether One Nation had an agreement from the government that their deal would proceed regardless of the ultimate outcome on the company tax debate, Hanson’s spokesman replied: “No.” The government is characterising this week’s setback as only temporary, arguing it will bring the package back during the budget session of parliament in May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/30/fbi-questions-ted-malloch-trump-campaign-figure-and-farage-ally","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T04:36:07Z","webTitle":"FBI questions Ted Malloch, Trump campaign figure and Farage ally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/30/fbi-questions-ted-malloch-trump-campaign-figure-and-farage-ally","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/30/fbi-questions-ted-malloch-trump-campaign-figure-and-farage-ally","fields":{"headline":"FBI questions Ted Malloch, Trump campaign figure and Farage ally","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A controversial London-based academic with close ties to Nigel Farage has been detained by the FBI upon arrival in the US and issued a subpoena to testify before Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Ted Malloch, an American touted last year as a possible candidate to serve as US ambassador to the EU, said he was interrogated by the FBI at Boston’s Logan airport on Wednesday following a flight from London and questioned about his involvement in the Trump campaign. In a statement sent to the Guardian, Malloch, who described himself as a policy wonk and defender of Trump, said the FBI also asked him about his relationship with Roger Stone, the Republican strategist, and whether he had ever visited the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has resided for nearly six years. In a detailed statement about the experience, which he described as bewildering and intimidating at times, Malloch said the federal agents who stopped him and separated him from his wife “seemed to know everything about me” and warned him that lying to the FBI was a felony. In the statement Malloch denied having any Russia contacts. Malloch said he had agreed with the special counsel’s office that he would appear before Mueller’s grand jury in Washington DC on 13 April. Malloch became a source of controversy in 2016 when he was floated in media reports as a possible US ambassador to the EU, following an aggressive campaign in which, according to several reports at the time, he promoted himself as a strong candidate. European officials, alarmed by the possible pick and his lack of diplomatic credentials, openly criticised Malloch, particularly after he compared the EU to the Soviet Union. Malloch’s campaign for the diplomatic post came to an end after a report in the Financial Times detailed several apparently misleading claims made in Malloch’s autobiography, including that he was a fellow at Wolfson and Pembroke colleges at Oxford, that he had once been called a “genius” by Margaret Thatcher, and that he was the “first” to coin the phrase “thought leadership”. Mueller’s probe into whether or not the Trump campaign received assistance from Russia during the 2016 election campaign is examining various issues, including Donald Trump’s business empire and its possible ties to Russia. The special counsel is also examining the 2016 release by Wikileaks of damaging emails that were stolen – allegedly by Russian hackers – from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Roger Stone, a strong champion of Trump, appeared to have some advance warning that Wikileaks had the emails before they were published, according to tweets he sent at the time. Stone, who has known Trump since the late 1980s, acknowledged having communications with Assange through an intermediary. He later claimed the middleman was a journalist named Randy Credico, but Credico vigorously denied the allegation. Malloch is ideologically close to Farage, the former Ukip leader who is also close to Trump and his former White House strategist Steve Bannon. Malloch has appeared on Farage’s radio show and the pair have been seen together in Brussels. News of Malloch’s detention by the FBI and subpoena was first reported by the far-right conspiracy theory website InfoWars after the controversial contributor Jerome Corsi said an alarmed Malloch had called him during the FBI interview. Malloch said in a statement on Thursday – after he was released – that his role on the Trump campaign was informal and unpaid, that he had only met with Stone on three occasions and never alone, and that he knew nothing about Wikileaks and had never visited the Ecuadorian embassy. He said the agents confiscated his mobile phone and told him it would be taken to Washington DC for a “full assessment”. “I was unfazed and very dubious about why they thought I knew anything,” he said. He also suggested in the statement that prosecutors could have read a not yet published book that alleged a conspiracy was underway to undermine Trump’s presidency, a book he said clearly troubled the “deep state”. “I did … find it objectionable to treat me the way they had, as I was entering my home country, where I am a citizen,” Malloch said. “They did not need to use such tactics or intimidation. I was a US patriot and would do anything and everything to assist the government and I had no information that I believed was relevant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/02/50-years-of-2001-a-space-odyssey-stanley-kubrick","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"50 years of 2001: A Space Odyssey – how Kubrick's sci-fi 'changed the very form of cinema'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/02/50-years-of-2001-a-space-odyssey-stanley-kubrick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/02/50-years-of-2001-a-space-odyssey-stanley-kubrick","fields":{"headline":"50 years of 2001: A Space Odyssey – how Kubrick's sci-fi 'changed the very form of cinema'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Wally Pfister, director, Transcendence; cinematographer, Inception 2001: A Space Odyssey affected my life in three different phases: my dad took me to see the film the year it opened at the Ziegfeld theatre in New York. I was a real space buff, partly because dad produced coverage of the space flights for ABC News. So I was totally blown away, and it became my favourite film for years; I made my own little Super-8 space movies with models on wires. Ten years later, in high school, I dropped acid to watch an anniversary screening. I’m sure we had a “deep” conversation afterwards. Then it was wonderfully influential as I got into film, and started appreciating it technically. It took 40 years for visual effects to catch up with what they did. When I met Christopher Nolan in 1998, I was really chuffed to find Kubrick was one of the things we had in common. I rewatched 2001 around the time we did Inception, and there are some similarities in the sets and the style. That last room where Pete Postlethwaite is dying is definitely reminiscent of the end of 2001 – there’s a little homage there. And 2001 was a huge influence on Transcendence – I was attracted to the script because of the parallels: AI, becoming a godlike being. And the question of whether this AI is good or evil, coming to the conclusion that it’s only as good as the person who inputted it. Claire Denis, director, High Life I saw 2001 on a giant screen in Paris, and I was blown away. You knew it took place in space, but I didn’t expect that kind of strange reflection on humanity. I wasn’t sure I understood this mysterious philosophising, the black monolith, all that. But I accepted all of it. It’s not possible to imitate a single thing from 2001 – it’s taboo, private territory. For one thing, to do the special effects you have to film models in a sort of choreography; modern special effects are very beautiful, but they don’t give the same physical impression. And space films are no longer voyages into the unknown – science has advanced a lot since then. My own thinking had to prevail when making my forthcoming science-fiction film High Life: it would be stupid to use 2001 as a departure point. They’re completely different: asking me about them is like asking whether I’d like to eat a sandwich or go on a trip to Australia. Jan Harlan, producer, The Shining; A.I. Artificial Intelligence Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubrick [who worked together on the film] shared the same spirit: agnostic, curious, very intelligent and in awe of the endlessness of the universe. If a film managed to build on what 2001 did, it’s A.I. Artificial Intelligence – it predicted the end of humanity. Stanley [Kubrick, Harlan’s brother-in-law] was convinced that we have no chance to survive in the long run, the way we behave – whether we exist for another 50 or 500 years doesn’t matter, it’s a short moment either way on the large scale of time. It is a dead serious message wrapped in a sweetener where robots survive their former masters. Does that mean HAL wins in the end? No, it’s a very different story merely born out of the same spirit. Douglas Trumbull, visual effects supervisor, 2001 I was excited working on it every day. With the space race happening at the same time, I felt like we were working on something really important. I don’t think it directly affected the moon landings, which happened the following year, but I meet scientists, engineers and astrophysicists almost every week who say they went into their line of work because they watched the film when they were young. It has profoundly affected that community to believe that certain things were going to be real and possible and spectacular. Especially regarding the possibility of contact with intelligent civilisations. John Gaeta, visual effects supervisor, The Matrix I could dot-connect where I am today back to being a young man watching 2001. Kubrick allowed Douglas Trumbull to explore and envision things by any means necessary. And that led to startling breakthroughs and a level of immersion we haven’t seen before. The Wachowskis [Lana and Lilly, sibling directors of The Matrix] acted very much for me like Kubrick acted with him. They told me to find the form that allows a concept to resonate, which led to Bullet Time. And now I’m at Magic Leap, working on augmented reality. HAL is really the first mass understanding that artificial intelligence could exist. The people building those interfaces use films like 2001 as guides and influences. The film is completely contemporary in its idea that AI could destroy us. We’re within five years of that moment now. Not necessarily in the exact context of that story, but in the context of AI overruling us on something important. The next step is what Spike Jonze was talking about in Her. 2001 was basically off by 20 years. Andrew Niccol, director, Gattaca The opening sequence of 2001 is the most immersive experience in cinema: completely spare of dialogue. I was sucked into the world as if I was in a black hole. I was watching 3D before there was 3D. It changed not only science fiction but also the very form of cinema. I love the grandeur, but I also love the attention to detail, like how the letters in the name HAL are only one removed in the alphabet from IBM. Niccol’s new film, Anon, is released on 11 May Peter Suschitzky, cinematographer, The Empire Strikes Back; Mars Attacks! Everyone in the London film-making community was tremendously excited by it. It was the first thing we talked about. I was amazed at its visual splendour. Most of the space shots mystified me and still do. And I don’t mind staying mystified. It’s more miraculous if you don’t know how it was done. But I was nonplussed by the hallucinogenic ending. I still feel he was trying to pull the wool over our eyes – he didn’t know how to end the film. But it became the benchmark. When I was called for an interview for the first Star Wars, I said straight away to George Lucas: “You don’t really want me, you want [2001 cinematographer] Geoffrey Unsworth.” He said, “He’s not available.” I later got the job on The Empire Strikes Back. It was so different in character to 2001, but the quality of Kubrick’s space shots was so high that inevitably they were in our minds. Did 2001 start a VFX arms race? I think so. Science-fiction films are always trying to outdo the last one visually now, to push the boundaries. There’s been nothing as outstanding in science-fiction cinema since 2001. I’ve seen Interstellar, but I’m having trouble recalling it. Blade Runner 2049 was beautifully designed, but quite frankly a bit tedious. David Braben, developer, Elite (videogame) In the later versions of Elite, we put in the tribute of having The Blue Danube when you used the docking computer – quite a bleepy version! As a child, I loved hard science-fiction, which is grounded in reality. 2001 was very rich because science wasn’t completely forgotten. Like the scene with Keir Dullea walking on the curved floor – the idea that things rotating produced gravity. And the shuttle in turn rotating to dock with the space station. I liked the way it showed those things in a matter-of-fact way. Amar Ediriwira, film curator, Boiler Room 2001 suggested an existential shift for music in sci-fi and beyond. Pairing the dawn of man sequence with the Nietzsche-inspired tone poem Also Sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss, and Johann Strauss’s 1866 Blue Danube waltz with the interstellar docking scene, was an utterly audacious, even vulgar, thing to do at the time. Both pieces have since become synonymous with space travel; the BBC, for instance, used Zarathustra as theme music for its TV coverage of the Apollo space missions. A bit like Pierre Schaeffer with musique concrète or Kool Herc with a turntable, Kubrick’s “fuck you” to traditional scoring recast music recordings as found objects, another tool for the auteur to fully exploit the interplay between moving image and sound. Recycling music to transcend its original form in the context of the “image” is integral to the works of Tarantino, for example, who regularly envisages cinematic moments around songs. The soundtrack as a significant cultural product can be traced right back to 2001."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/30/corbyn-interests-city-speculators-put-above-jobs-gkn-takeover","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T09:04:56Z","webTitle":"Corbyn: interests of City speculators put above jobs in GKN takeover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/30/corbyn-interests-city-speculators-put-above-jobs-gkn-takeover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/30/corbyn-interests-city-speculators-put-above-jobs-gkn-takeover","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn: interests of City speculators put above jobs in GKN takeover","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of putting the profits of speculators before the interests of staff at one of Britain’s oldest engineering firms, which is the object of a hostile takeover deal that has been labelled an “abuse of capitalism”. On Thursday, shareholders in GKN, which made cannonballs for the Battle of Waterloo and Spitfires for the second world war, voted to accept an £8.1bn offer from Melrose, a firm that specialises in turning around failing companies and selling them on at a profit, and which has been labelled an “asset stripper”. Some of GKN’s shareholders had bought into the company only a few days before backing the takeover, prompting the Labour leader to call them speculators looking to make fast cash out of the deal. “The Tories have put the interests of City speculators over people’s jobs. Labour would have stopped the takeover of GKN and, in government, we’ll make our economy work for the many, not the few,” Corbyn said. Referring to the front page of Friday’s Daily Mail, which called the deal an “abuse of capitalism”, he added: “You know things are bad when the Daily Mail calls out a rigged economic system.” There were calls for the government to block the deal on national security grounds because of GKN’s status as a defence contractor, including from Labour’s Rebecca Long-Bailey, who wrote to Greg Clark, the business secretary she shadows, on Friday. “This deal from its inception in January of this year has raised issues of national security. These have been recognised across political parties, by trade unions and other commentators,” she wrote, in a letter seen by the Guardian. “Among the concerns are the fact that defence contracts are long term and are undermined by the short-term business model pursued by Melrose, the potential breakup of the business and the loss of jobs and skills.” She added: “The history of GKN has been intertwined with our own industrial and military history … The takeover puts at risk the firm and its proud heritage. It not only endangers our national defence but our industrial strategy too.” On Friday morning, Clark acknowledged he had a statutory duty under the Enterprise Act 2002 to consider the national security implications of the deal, but refused to pre-empt the deliberations. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the assessment needed to be carried out “properly and thoroughly”. Addressing concerns that the takeover had been waved through by speculators, Clark said: “Those shareholders that bought their shares very recently of course bought them from other shareholders that chose not in effect to back the continuing management.” Later on Friday, Corbyn issued a further call to the government to halt the takeover: “This is about people’s jobs, national security and our whole industrial strategy.” He said Clark should “step in and act in the national interest”. Clark said the government’s approach, as set out in its industrial strategy, was non-protectionist. He said ministers would not “pick winners as was done in the past and subsidise or protect them”, saying the government would instead seek to “ensure that our business environment is one in which there is competition, in which no incumbent is immune from the challenge of being kept efficient and strategically focused”. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, was the business secretary when Kraft took over Cadbury in 2010 and, at the time, called for a change in the law to prevent hedge funds and other short-term investors influencing takeovers. On Friday, he said: “We need to move to a system with two classes of shareholders so that short-term holding for speculation cannot be given the same weight in making judgments about the long-term future of a company.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/30/jonny-bairstow-keeps-england-afloat-after-day-one-of-second-test-in-new-zealand","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T07:24:11Z","webTitle":"Jonny Bairstow keeps England afloat on day one of second Test in New Zealand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/30/jonny-bairstow-keeps-england-afloat-after-day-one-of-second-test-in-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/30/jonny-bairstow-keeps-england-afloat-after-day-one-of-second-test-in-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"Jonny Bairstow keeps England afloat on day one of second Test in New Zealand","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As the tampering saga begins to recede – or is this just a little lull? – it is no longer possible to hide the fact that England’s Test team is undergoing a good old-fashioned crisis, stemming from a lack of runs, rather than integrity, among their batsmen. Fortunately for Joe Root his all-rounders came good in the final session at the Hagley Oval to keep England afloat. In this case it was Jonny Bairstow, who steered England to a total approaching respectability with an excellent, unbeaten 97. His chief ally was Mark Wood, who we can elevate to all-rounder status for a while, after he hit a vibrant 52, his best score in Test cricket. We know about Bairstow’s refined belligerence down the order but there were times in their partnership when the quality of Wood’s strokeplay made it hard to distinguish them. This pair added 95 together in 18 overs, an alliance that papered over another alarming batting performance. It may be that some of the batsmen are mentally numb, others may be rusty, but on a sublime day for cricket it became all too evident that England possess only three batsmen in their top seven capable of suggesting any kind of permanence at the moment, even on a perfectly benign surface. Beyond Root, Ben Stokes and Bairstow there is currently a quartet who seem as fragile and fleeting as a rainbow but not so pleasing on the eye – with the possible exception of James Vince when cover driving. Sadly that quartet now includes Alastair Cook, who was defeated by Trent Boult once again. The autumnal sun beamed down from a cloudless sky. The locals claimed their spots on grassy banks still damp with dew when Kane Williamson won the toss. Following the pattern of the four previous Tests here he opted to bowl despite the overhead conditions. England had made three changes from Auckland, with Vince, Wood and Jack Leach, who was making his debut, replacing Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes and Craig Overton. By recent England standards this constituted a radical overhaul. Up stepped Boult and in his third over he clean bowled Cook. It was a fine, full delivery that deviated from leg to off and, with Cook’s feet stuck on the crease and his bat lunging desperately in front of him, he missed the ball by a remarkable distance given he has more than 12,000 Test runs to his name. Cook’s dismissal did not preface an Auckland-style subsidence, although there was some swing and nip for the pace attack. Mark Stoneman, off the mark after an inside edge sped perilously close to his off stump, played and missed frequently while Vince looked more assured. As ever a couple of drives purred from the middle of his bat as the Kiwis kept searching for swing via a full length. Then, on 18, Vince was stuck on the crease against Tim Southee and was lbw, with the replays confirming that the ball would have clipped leg stump. Like so many of the batsmen he needs a substantial score in the second innings to guarantee his place in the next Test team. Root settled easily and scored without difficulty, often on his toes and punching the ball through the offside. He navigated the side to 70 for two at lunch, not a bad foundation after being put into bat. For another half an hour after the interval all was serenity. New Zealand tried a review against Root that reflected how dangerous the England captain was looking. Root drove Southee to the onside boundary to confirm this but then he tried to clip another full-length delivery through midwicket and was bowled. Without looking back at the damage he marched off swiftly, disgusted with himself. From here there was mayhem. Dawid Malan missed his first ball from Boult and set off for the pavilion before the umpire’s finger was properly raised. It was as if he had never sighted the ball. In the next over Stoneman’s luck ran out as he edged a handy delivery from Southee into the safe hands of Tom Latham at second slip. Stokes and Bairstow, batting properly, now added 57 but after tea Stokes was caught down the leg side off Boult. The standard response to this dismissal is to say that he was “strangled” but this happens so often now, especially against left-handed bowlers, that the batsmen must take note of an error rather than bemoan their bad luck. Stuart Broad, elevated to No 8, did not bat like one, soon chipping an easy catch to mid-off against Southee. But Wood did. There were several crunching cover drives and as well as a six hooked off Neil Wagner. Wood had not played against a red ball since September. Practice? Who needs it? Having posted his maiden half-century in Test cricket he was bowled by Southee. All the while Bairstow had mixed discretion and aggression adeptly as he often can with the tail. The crack of two pull shots against Wagner echoed satisfyingly around the ground. After Wood’s departure, Leach supported Bairstow with impressive composure throughout the final 10 overs. For the New Zealanders the old firm of Boult and Southee did all the damage, with the latter the more potent this time, but thanks to Bairstow and the infusion of new blood – perhaps England should try this more often – the Kiwis were still in the field at the close."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/31/sportwatch-brisbane-v-central-coast-collingwood-v-gws-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T11:06:21Z","webTitle":"Sportwatch: wins for Waratahs, GWS, Melbourne United, Brisbane Roar and Warriors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/31/sportwatch-brisbane-v-central-coast-collingwood-v-gws-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/31/sportwatch-brisbane-v-central-coast-collingwood-v-gws-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Sportwatch: wins for Waratahs, GWS, Melbourne United, Brisbane Roar and Warriors","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Final score: Brisbane Lions 74-100 Melbourne Demons Final score: Melbourne Victory 3-1 Western Sydney Wanderers The Waratahs have hung on for a 24-17 Super Rugby victory over the Brumbies, doing it on the road without Israel Folau, who went to the bench with a suspected hamstring injury four minutes into the match. It was concerning news for the Waratahs’ season as well as for Wallabies coach Michael Cheika, who was watching in the crowd. However, a powerhouse two-try performance from Taqele Naiyaravoro sparked Daryl Gibson’s team towards their third win of the season, closing the gap on the Australian conference-leading Melbourne Rebels. The winger made the most of some sloppy play from the Brumbies right on half-time at GIO Stadium, running down the left wing to ensure the Waratahs were 13-11 after a Bernard Foley conversion. The Brumbies’ only try for the evening came through Lausii Taliauli as he ran onto a classy chip kick from Hawera. David Pocock had a quiet night in his first match with the Brumbies since 2016 after recovering from knee surgery following his 12-month sabbatical. It was also the 100th Super Rugby appearance for Pocock, who took over as captain when Christian Lealiifano was subbed off in the 56th minute. Greater Western Sydney claimed an impressive win over Collingwood at the MCG but both clubs are counting the cost of the brutal contest. Serious injuries to the Magpies’ Tim Broomhead and Giants’ Tom Scully marred the thrilling 16-point Saturday night win in front of 33,941 fans. Broomhead suffered a broken leg and Scully a suspected fractured ankle in the first quarter, with both stretchered from the ground and taken to the Epworth hospital. Darcy Moore added to Nathan Buckley’s injury concerns, failing to appear in the second half due to a hamstring strain. The Pies led by 11 points early in the final term but the Giants finished a gruelling contest strongly to secure a 15.5 (95) to 12.7 (79) win - just their second victory at the ground in the club’s history. A quick break from the football codes for some surfing news. Mick Fanning has made a good start to his swan song Rip Curl Pro, while fellow Australian Sally Fitzgibbons suffered an upset in the sudden-death second round. Three-time Bells winner Fanning beat Sebastian Zietz and Brazilian Jesse Mendes in his opening heat on Saturday to book a place in third round, where he’ll face Zietz again after the Hawaiian went on to dispatch Brazil’s Ian Gouveia. Fanning’s impending retirement means he’s the top drawcard at Bells beach this year and he was mobbed after his opening-heat win. “It’s so awesome to have so much support down here at Bells and to have my family and friends around is great,” Fanning said. “I’m stoked to get through that heat. It definitely wasn’t my best but it will do for now.” Manly Sea Eagles 32-16 Canberra Raiders. This is a big win for Manly after a poor showing last week. Brumbies 17-24 Waratahs. This was the Waratahs only fourth ever win in Canberra. Bernard Foley has just scored a penalty and Waratahs are closing in on victory over the Brumbies with two minutes to go. Brumbies 17-24 Waratahs Scores update: NRL: Manly 32-16 Canberra with six minutes to go A-League: Melbourne Victory 3-1 Wanderers with 23 minutes to go ALF: Fremantle 52-44 Essendon at half-time AFL: Brisbane 41-63 Melbourne after 16 minutes of the third quarter Rugby: Brumbies 17-21 Waratahs with six minutes left I should point out that it’s 10 plays 10 in the Victory v Wanderers game. Both teams have had a man sent off. Thomas Deng has just scored an extraordinary bullet of a goal for Melbourne Victory, who now lead Western Sydney 3-1. It is not looking good for Wanderers with 37 minutes to go. Scores update: NRL: Manly 28-16 Canberra with 20 minutes to go A-League: Melbourne Victory 2-1 Wanderers at half-time ALF: Fremantle 44-37 Essendon after 10 minutes of the second quarter AFL: Brisbane 21-62 Melbourne after eight minutes of the third quarter Rugby: Brumbies 14-18 Waratahs after 58 minutes The Brumbies trailed the Waratahs at half-time in Canberra for the first time since 2005, and are still behind 10 minutes into the second half. They have just narrowed the gap though, and are now just four points behind, 14-18. David Pocock’s long awaited return is not going quite to plan. So much AFL today. It’s half-time in the Brisbane v Melbourne game, with the Lions trailing 18-55. Scores update: NRL: Manly 26-6 Canberra at half-time A-League: Melbourne Victory 1-0 Wanderers after 37 minutes ALF: Fremantle 20-24 Essendon after 15 minutes of the first quarter Rugby: Brumbies 11-13 Waratahs at half-time Melbourne United beat Adelaide 36ers 100-82 in game 5 of the grand final to win NBL championship. Chris Goulding and Casper Ware scored 23 points each helping United win the series 3-2. Shannon Shorter led the scoring for the 36ers, with 20 points and four rebounds. Israel Folau has gone to the bench with a suspected hamstring injury in the Waratahs’ Super Rugby clash with the Brumbies. He lasted just four minutes in the match at GIO Stadium before being replaced by Alex Newsome. Scores update: NRL: Manly 26-6 Canberra after 35 minutes A-League: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Wanderers after 20 minutes ALF: Fremantle 14-6 Essendon after four minutes of the first quarter Rugby: Brumbies 11-6 Waratahs after 33 minutes Brisbane Roar have kept their A-League finals hopes alive with an uninspiring 1-0 win over Central Coast Mariners. Henrique’s first goal for the Roar in nearly two years was enough to see them leapfrog Western Sydney Wanderers into the top six – at least for the moment. It was Roar’s sixth win in their last nine A-League games, continuing a strong run of late-season results for John Aloisi’s side. Next weekend’s away clash with the Wanderers now looms as a winner-takes-all battle for the one finals berth still up for grabs. Manly are running away with it in Brookvale, leading the Raiders 24-6 with 12 minutes left in the first half. The Trbojevic brothers, Tom and Jake are playing very well. Presumably they are familiar with the Free song, My Brother Jake. Some good cricket news after some dark days: Australia have won the women’s T20 tri-series. I’m glad I said a few minutes ago that Manly had plenty of time to overcome their bad start to the game against the Raiders, because they have. And how. Manly 18-6 Canberra, with 15 minutes to go in the first half. The Warriors have trounced the Roosters 30-6 in Sydney. Warriors’ halfback Shaun Johnson was ruled out with a groin injury, but his replacement, Mason Lino, had a great game. The Warriors are unbeaten after four rounds and look genuine contenders after six years in the finals wilderness. For the Roosters, the result was a shock after their win over Newcastle last week. At least half the crowd of 14,493 at Allianz Stadium seemed to be Warriors supporters. Manly are having a bad start at Brookvale and are trailing Canberra 0-6 after seven minutes. Plenty to time to go on Sydney’s northern beaches though. In the basketball, Melbourne are leading Adelaide 79-69 with nine minutes left in the fourth quarter. Full-time in the A-League after an awful lot of time wasting in added time by the home side. Brisbane Roar 1-0 Central Coast Mariners. Scores update: Rugby: Blues 40-63 Sharks NRL: Roosters 6-30 Warriors AFL: Collingwood 12.7 (79)-15.5 (95) GWS With two minutes to go in Auckland, the visitors from South Africa are running away with it. Blues 35-56 Sharks. There are three minutes to go at the MCG and the Pies are running out of time. The score is: Collingwood 79:89 GWS. The Roosters are heading for their second loss from four and the Warriors are heading for their fourth straight win. With five minutes to go in Sydney, it’s Roosters 6-30 Warriors. Scores update: Rugby: Blues 28-43 Sharks with 15 minutes left NRL: Roosters 6-26 Warriors with 14 minutes left A-League: Brisbane 1-0 CCM after 63 minutes AFL: Collingwood 73-73 GWS with 13 minutes left The Warriors are continuing to pile the pressure on the Roosters, with a superb try from David Fusitua. Mason Lino converts and the score now is: Roosters 6-26 Warriors. It’s 16 minutes into the second half in Auckland and the Blues’ Patrick Tuipulotu and Stephen Perofeta have scored wonderful trys in quick succession, both of which were converted. But the Sharks quickly responded with a try of their own, also converted. What a game at Eden Park. Blues 28-33 Sharks. The game at the MCG is proving to be real roller coaster. After a very strong second quarter from the Magpies, GWS are dominating the third. And, just as I typed that, the Pies have scored another goal and narrowed the gap. Collingwood 53-56 GWS. At the risk of sending many of the readers of this blog elsewhere, our South Africa v Australia cricket Test live blog has just started. Rugby: Blues 7-26 Sharks at half-time NRL: Roosters 6-18 Warriors at half-time A-League: Brisbane 1-0 CCM after 40 minutes AFL: Collingwood 46-38 GWS in the third quarter The Warriors continue to inflict more pain on the Roosters. The Kiwis are now leading 18-4, with three minutes to go in the first half. In the rugby, the Blues are trailing the Sharks 7-16, with 13 minutes to go in the first half. The Warriors have stretched their lead against the Roosters and are now leading 12-4. There are 13 minutes left in the first half. Henrique has just scored for Brisbane, so the home side are leading Central Coast 1-0. John Aloisi looks happy. Just kidding, he doesn’t. Collingwood are clawing their way back into the game against GWS. After a goal they are now within five points, 33-38. This is much better from the Pies in the 2nd quarter. It’s half-time at the MCG. In the last few minutes Super Rugby, NRL and A-League games have kicked off. And there’s an AFL game already under way. Our various football codes are showing no consideration for the humble live blogger trying to cover them all. Rugby: Blues 0-3 Sharks NRL: Roosters 4-6 Warriors A-League: Brisbane 0-0 CCM AFL: Collingwood 27-38 GWS Collingwood have just scored. They now trail by a mere 11 points, 26-37. I was so shocked I spilt tea all over my lovely Hawaiian shirt. Luckily, I made it ages ago, so embarrassment, rather than a burn, has ensued. Ooh, the Pies fans are NOT happy. They reckon their man made a clean mark. The referee reckons otherwise, and GWS score another goal. The Sydney side now lead 37-20 in the 2nd quarter. Collingwood’s Tim Broomhead and Greater Western Sydney’s Tom Scully were stretchered from the MCG in the first quarter with what appear to be serious injuries. Broomhead looked to suffer a badly broken leg when he attempted to kick a loose ball off the ground but instead smashed his left leg into a goalpost. Minutes later, Scully was left distressed when his right ankle collapsed underneath him in a strong tackle. The second quarter has just started at the MCG and the visitors have added to their lead. Collingwood 20-25 GWS Giants. Some good news about Australia’s rugby sevens captain, James Stannard. He has been told by surgeons he’ll make a full recovery from the fractured skull he suffered in a one-punch attack. Sevens coach Andy Friend says Stannard has been cleared to be discharged from Sydney’s St Vincent’s hospital on Saturday. Gold Coast co-captain Tom Lynch kicked a career-best eight goals on as the Suns beat the Blues by 34 points. The Suns have had a 2-0 start under new coach Stuart Dew. Carlton saw a lot of the ball but made too many errors. They kicked the opening two goals of the second half to trail by 13 but Gold Coast held their nerve and kicked clear for a convincing win. What a packed line-up we have this evening. Super Rugby: Blues v Sharks (5.35 – Sydney time), Brumbies v Waratahs (7.45) NRL: Roosters v Warriors (5.30), Manly v Raiders (7.30) A-League: Brisbane Roar v Central Coast Mariners (5.35), Melbourne Victory v Western Sydney Wanderers (7.50) AFL: Carlton 9.13 (67) - 15.11 (101) Gold Coast (already finished), Collingwood 20-24 GWS Giants (1st quarter), Brisbane v Melbourne (7.25) Fremantle v Essendon (8.10) Cricket: South Africa v Australia (7pm) Basketball: NBL grand final decider (6pm) I will keep you informed with progress scores in a timely manner. My previous post has reminded me of the genius of Hank Williams’s I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry. Good evening readers and welcome to the Guardian’s sportwatch on a much too hot Saturday (where I am anyway). But is anyone paying attention to any sport other than cricket today? I hope so, or I’m going to be lonesome for the next five hours. Two of the three most read stories on Guardian Australia today are about David Warner’s press conference.

Why would she have to work on Easter? That’s how I found out that Easter isn’t a public holiday in the US and, frankly, I was shocked. A typical Australian, I thought most Americans were paid-up members of the religious right, and the idea that they would work on the holiest days of the Christian calendar made no sense. Easter holidays are sacred to Australians, although not just for religious reasons. Who would give up a four-day holiday at the beginning of the autumn, and the last chance to get away for a break before the cold weather sets in? That doesn’t seem to have changed in the 18 years since I left. Prime minister Malcom Turnbull’s Easter messages hint at the true meaning of Easter to Australians. One whole minute of his 1.35-minute 2016 message was devoted to exhortations to drive carefully. A typhoon in 2017 meant that Jesus got a mention as a model of service to others but the message was still proportionally weighted to the “drive defensively”, “take a break every two hours”, “enjoy the long weekend”, rather than the rebirth aspect of this Christian rite. And while there’s no holiday in the US, a quick trip to my local fish store last Friday underscored the importance of the religious calendar to my fellow New Yorkers. The place was packed – a sign that Lent is in full swing. My mother, a Catholic, served fish every Friday even after Pope Paul VI let everyone off the hook, so to speak. Because my father was a Methodist, I can eat meat any time, but thanks to Mum I wouldn’t dare eat it on a Friday, let alone a Lenten Friday. When I was growing up it was a different story. Good Friday was a meat-free Friday on steroids. Every business, every shop, restaurant and petrol station that didn’t shut down on Good Friday was fined. It was a dismal day for children. Back then, most Australians lived in church-going nuclear families. If you were at home you were expected to sit quietly and contemplate Christ’s crucifixion. If you were out, you were supposed to be at church or on your way to or from church. One time, when a few of the kids in my neighbourhood escaped the gloom of our homes and played rambunctiously in the street, a stray parent appeared from nowhere, yelling, “How dare you have fun the day that Christ died?” The only “good” thing about Good Friday in those days was warm hot cross buns smothered in butter. That and the images of Christians around the world flogging themselves and dragging heavy, wooden crosses on their backs on the television news at night. They made me feel glad to be Australian. Those rituals seemed so extreme and distant from my practice and, as the days drew in and the temperature dropped, even the positive depictions of Easter – flowers, fertility, and new life – seemed so at odds with my experience. Things picked up on Easter Eve though. I grew up in Kangaroo Flat, a suburb of the regional city of Bendigo where the annual Easter fair got under way on Saturday with a parade that boasted the longest imperial Chinese dragon outside of China, and sideshows and amusement park rides with names like the Octopus and the Cha Cha Cha in the main street. Back then, it was one of only two occasions each year – the agricultural show being the other – when we got access to “American”-style jam donuts and fairy floss (cotton candy). Easter Day, which for us kids meant church, then chocolate eggs, bunnies and jelly beans – a sugar high that carried us through the next week – was a favourite. Once I left home, the Easters I didn’t return were spent hiking or camping or at the ocean with friends. Perhaps that’s why we Aussies aren’t so in tune with the religious calendar – it’s pegged closely to the northern hemisphere’s seasons. While Americans are cleaning house and preparing for the renewal of spring, Australians are primed for a Thanksgiving-like overindulgence. True, we are secular, but we’re also topsy-turvy, and that might be the reason for our lackadaisical embrace of the resurrection. In any case, here in New York, as the temperature rises and lawns turn green, it makes perfect sense to celebrate the joy of a new beginning. • Jillian Abbott is an Australian journalist living in New York City"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/02/doddie-weir-mnd-motor-neurone-disease-rugby-scotland","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"'In a way, I'm lucky': Doddie Weir on MND, rugby and his crusade for a cure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/02/doddie-weir-mnd-motor-neurone-disease-rugby-scotland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/02/doddie-weir-mnd-motor-neurone-disease-rugby-scotland","fields":{"headline":"'In a way, I'm lucky': Doddie Weir on MND, rugby and his crusade for a cure","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In a famous scene from Living with Lions, the seminal documentary about the 1997 victory in South Africa, Doddie Weir is told his tour is over. “Ah well,” says the big lock, his eyes betraying a deeper pain than his grimace as the doctor flexes his knee, smashed by some Mpumalanga stormtrooper. “We’ve had a good old time of it, eh?” Twenty-one years later, in the bar of the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel, at Lexington Avenue and East 57th, Weir ruefully smiles again. “It’s been a bit of a nightmare, having MND.” The king of understatement is now 47. Eighteen years have passed since the last of his 61 caps for Scotland. It’s 15 months since he was told he has motor neurone disease, closing on a year since he broke the news to the world. “I don’t know if you know much about MND,” he says, “or ALS, as I guess it’s called here in America, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. It’s a muscle-wasting disease, so all the muscles in your body begin to stop functioning through the neurons stopping firing, so you eventually can’t walk, you can’t lift, you can’t swallow, you can’t eat. You can’t breathe, because your diaphragm stops working. So your whole body shuts down eventually. It’s terminal, at the moment.” Life expectancy is usually two to five years. Weir was told he’d be wheelchair-bound in one. But here he is, hands weakened a bit but still cheerfully indomitable. Later, at the New York Athletic Club, he takes control of a charity auction. Reveling in hours of chat and horseplay, he raises $8,000 for his foundation with a shirt worn in Scotland’s November loss to New Zealand. He throws in a bottle of special edition whisky – Doddie’s Dram – though he struggles to hold it, then sells two more for $2,000 a pop, a sound repeated when he opens the bottles with their owners. The room is full of laughter, stoked by the genial giant in the “fashion disaster” suit made of specially commissioned tartan. “I’ve been looking over at wee Alex,” Weir says into the mic, gesturing to where Alex Corbisiero, Lions prop turned US TV host, sits in his still-beefy prime. “And I’ve been thinking if I’d worked in the gym as hard as he has, I might have longer to live.” The room catches its breath. When it exhales, the sound is somewhere between shock and a sigh. Weir still works his farm in the Borders – he’s sporting a black eye dealt by one of his cows – but he has acquired another cause: survive and find a cure. “In Scotland there’s only one drug for it,” he says. “One drug that came out 22 years ago. Basically you’ve got a death sentence. So my crusade at the moment is to try to get options for people who have this, so they have a chance. It might be a minimal chance but at least a better chance than they have now.” This is Weir’s second visit to New York in the last few months. The Colorado Clinic has an office in the city and can provide masitinib, an inhibitor drug, which the NHS cannot. Weir has spoken passionately on the subject elsewhere. Here, in the bar, he speaks warmly of the clinic and of Brian Kennedy, the former Sale Sharks owner who is funding his trips to the States for treatment. He speaks warmly of others, too, from his fellow “rugby legend” and old English foe Jerry Guscott fixing his collar in the elevator down – “he was the first lady I saw so I asked him” – to the legions that have dined, cycled, walked or just talked in support of My Name’5 Doddie, the research foundation containing his old shirt number. “The support is just unbelievable. Newcastle have been heavily involved” – last weekend’s game against Northampton at St James’ Park was held in part to help an old club soldier, more than 30,000 seeing Weir walk the match ball out. “We had a Doddie Gump, which was an attempt to follow on from the Ice Bucket Challenge, which Rob Wainwright, my former team-mate, very kindly put together. “Our big finale was a walk in Italy which we thought maybe 500 or 600 people might do: I think there was 5,000 or 6,000 there. It’s just overwhelming, heartwarming and very difficult to explain. I’m just a Borders boy and a bit of a fashion disaster. The love and the support … it’s amazing. He gives me a sharp look. “There was somebody who biked up for the Calcutta Cup match – I don’t know if you know but Scotland won that this year, for the first time in 10 years.” I shake my head, Englishly. “That was the first time I wore my Doddie’s tartan suit, it came out for that game. No? Don’t remember?” The tartan is unforgettable: blue and white for Scotland, yellow and black for Melrose, black and white for Newcastle. Still no, though. “A guy cycled 500 miles from Twickenham to Murrayfield in two days, to raise money. That was quite a special day … when Scotland beat England, aye. Still no?” He laughs, eyes my Guinness enviously, takes a gulp of water. Weir has always been a glass-half-full sort of chap. Now, it turns out, it’s literal. “Drinking a pint,” he says, “I can’t hold it too long. So I drink half of it first to make the glass a little bit lighter. “A chiropractor I go to has been wonderful. An example of his thinking is, instead of sucking out of a straw because your hands are weak, you’ve got to lift and drink the pint. You use, you lose. You’re really telling MND you’re no gonna win.” And yet, barring some medical breakthrough perhaps helped by My Name’5 Doddie, MND will win. Not long before our meeting came the end of the most famous case of all, with the death of Stephen Hawking at 76, 55 years after diagnosis. Weir sees Hawking as cause – as evidence – for hope. He and his wife Kathy have three sons, Angus, Hamish and Ben, all in their teens. They accompanied him on to the pitch at Murrayfield in November before that All Blacks epic, then again at St James’ Park this month. He’s determined to see them grow. Nonetheless, life has acquired new urgency. Long-held plans have been brought forward. Last year Weir took his family to New Zealand to watch the Lions. The next aim is the World Cup in Japan next year. Two years after that, the Lions in South Africa again. This week, his eldest passed his driving test – “second time, mind” – and another longed-for day was done. Weir has said he does not link his MND to the blows and batterings of a top-flight rugby career. But it has taken players before. The Auckland and London Irish back Jarrod Cunningham learned he had the disease in 2002 and died five years later. The great South African scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was diagnosed in 2011. He died last February. Weir is talking to Van der Westhuizen’s foundation “about staging an event in South Africa”. He laughs, thinking back to that day with the Lions in ’97. “Maybe do it in Mpumalanga, yeah … that’d bring back some, well, some memories. I might not say good ... “Joost went through quite a lot of drugs and one thing or another and quite a lot of testing and I’m not really doing that at the moment. There’s a lot of work been done since Joost was about into what’s working and not working. There’s a lot of bandwagon-ing about ‘this will work’ or ‘this will cure it’ but it doesn’t work, which can be cruel to the person with MND. So my gang are saying, ‘We’ll not do that.’” Weir is not trusting to fortune – as suggested by the trips to New York for treatment – but he insists more than once he is lucky, citing cases of people diagnosed one month and dead the next, leaving spouses and young children. “I wouldn’t say it’s been a wonderful journey,” he says. “I probably knew something was wrong for a year or so before my diagnosis. But in a way, yes, I am lucky. They say two to three years is a lifespan with this. And in that time, I’ve never been invited to so many parties.” His laughter, like mine, is fuelled more by joy than sorrow. And before the five-block walk to dinner through a chilly Manhattan dusk – he waves away all offers of an Uber – there is time for a philosophical turn. “I never, ever think I want to be someone else,” he says. “I’m not that religious but there are certain things that have happened in my life. I crashed my car 15 years ago, a real bad smash. But I think Him upstairs took a look and said to Himself: ‘I need a rugby player, who am I going to get? Weir? Ah, you’re not good enough so I’ll just let you smash your car and you can live.’ “My brother-in-law, he was 54, he was found on the bathroom floor. So I was thinking maybe the big guy wanted a shepherd. ‘Michael Dun, you’re the one, come upstairs.’ So again, I’m not religious but maybe the big boy has said: ‘Right, you were lucky with your car crash, go sort this MND/ALS out, see what you can do.’” Doddie Weir’s charitable foundation is myname5doddie.co.uk.

He was unequivocal. Wylie would have answers to the two questions that were troubling me most. He could tell me about Facebook. And he would know about Canada. What Christopher Wylie knows about Facebook, the world now knows. Facebook certainly knows – its market value is down $100bn. But the Canadian connection remains more elusive. What it is. Why it matters. And why it triggered my search for Wylie. We heard from him at a session of the digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) select committee that the BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D’Arcy described as “by a distance, the most astounding thing I’ve seen in parliament”. Perhaps not because of Wylie’s arresting appearance – though there was that too, his pink hair offset with a suit for the occasion – but because of what he said: a four-hour account of his involvement with Cambridge Analytica that he backed up with documents, a selection of which the committee published two days later. It was a moment that marked a significant milestone in our coverage of this story. Because back on 13 May 2017 we received a letter from Squire Patton Boggs, lawyers for Cambridge Analytica, that set out their intention to issue a “pre-action protocol for defamation” – though its immediate concern was regarding an “article that is proposed to be published this weekend”. Seven fraught hours later, we published an article headlined “Follow the data” . It was centred on one particular document. A document that linked Cambridge Analytica to a small, seemingly inconsequential firm based above an optician’s shop in Victoria, Canada. A document that was among the stash of those released by the DCMS committee on Thursday. The firm – AggregateIQ – didn’t appear inconsequential. In the words of Vote Leave’s campaign manager, Dominic Cummings, it played a crucial role in the Brexit campaign. For more than a year, a quote from Cummings – “we couldn’t have done it without them” – was emblazoned across AIQ’s website. Words that disappeared from the website a week ago, removed after we submitted our questions to the firm. The first major article I wrote about Cambridge Analytica last February outlined a relationship between Nigel Farage’s Leave.EU campaign and Cambridge Analytica and the relationships with Robert Mercer, the firm’s main investor, and its shareholder and vice-president Steve Bannon. It kicked off an investigation by the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office. Then, a few days later, a reader from Canada got in touch. Did I know that the telephone number and address listed on Cambridge Analytica’s website as its Canadian office – SCL Canada – belonged to Zackary Massingham? Did I know that he was the chief executive of a company called AggregateIQ? A firm that had worked for Vote Leave? I didn’t. Because Vote Leave was the official campaign. It was of a different order of importance to Farage’s Leave.EU. Vote Leave had been recognised by the Electoral Commission. It had been entrusted with taxpayers’ money. It was headed by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove – now both ministers in Theresa May’s government. And who are now seeing the scandal currently engulfing Cambridge Analytica arriving at their doorstep. Last week we published the account of another whistleblower, Shahmir Sanni, and how he believed that Vote Leave senior officials took advantage of him and his friend, Darren Grimes, to ramp up their own spending. Vote Leave gave their campaign, BeLeave, £625,000 – but in November the Electoral Commission opened an investigation into it. The donation was legal only if BeLeave really was an independent organisation, operating separately. And Sanni had startling new evidence: he said it wasn’t. Sanni – the treasurer – wasn’t even allowed to get his train tickets refunded. Instead, the money was paid directly to AggregateIQ – the company that a year earlier I had found listed on Cambridge Analytica’s website as SCL Canada. The documents published last week finally make the legal connection between AggregateIQ and Cambridge Analytica public. The committee has published an intellectual property agreement between AIQ and SCL Elections – Cambridge Analytica’s parent company. There’s also a service agreement between the two firms that set out revenue-sharing clauses and payment details, an internal Cambridge Analytica staff list that names Massingham, and emails about work the two firms did together for John Bolton, the newly appointed national security adviser to Donald Trump. On 21 August 2014, Alex Tayler, the acting managing director for Cambridge Analytica, wrote to Jeff Silvester, co-founder of AggregateIQ, and said: “Personality Cluster information for the target voter segments for all 3 states (modelled for all voters of interest, not just Kogan sample/seeders).” “Kogan” is Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University psychologist that Cambridge Analytica contracted to harvest Facebook data. And the “sample/seeders” are the individuals who Kogan’s company, GSR, paid to fill in personality surveys and allow access to their friends’ data. Last week, AIQ sent us a legal letter. It said that AggregateIQ is not a direct part and/or the Canadian branch of Cambridge Analytica and that it has not been involved in the exploitation of Facebook data or otherwise been involved in any of the allegations of wrongdoing made against Cambridge Analytica. It did not secretly and unethically coordinate with Cambridge Analytica on the EU referendum. It did not share technology with Cambridge Analytica. It never represented itself as SCL Canada. The first it knew of its phone number being on the website was when the Observer reported it. And it is 100% Canadian-owned. But Wylie told MPs that he had helped set up both Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ and that it was based in Canada, in his hometown of Victoria, because Silvester and Massingham, the directors, were friends. From Hansard: “They had new families, had just got a house, and it is not easy to just get up and move to a different country when you have young kids. “The compromise was that a Canadian company would be set up … But the deal was that they would sign an intellectual property licence whereby all of the work that they were doing for the company would be assigned to SCL Group and they would trade as SCL Canada, but they set up a Canadian entity, and the legal name was AggregateIQ.” The same week, Gizmodo, a specialist tech site, published an article headlined “AggregateIQ created Cambridge Analytica’s Election Software and Here’s the Proof” based on research that a cybersecurity firm, UpGuard, had produced. Chris Vickery, the director of cyber-risk research at UpGuard, claimed they had found a repository of code that AggregateIQ left exposed online. The code suggested that it was AggregateIQ that had developed the Ripon platform – the software product that is the foundation of Cambridge Analytica’s technology. This was part one of the AggregateIQ Files. The second part, which UpGuard published on Thursday, revealed code that suggested that AIQ had built websites and landing pages for Vote Leave, Veterans for Britain, the DUP, Change Britain and Gove 2016. These were all new claims. Last May, David Banks of Veterans for Britain told me it had engaged AIQ in the last weeks of the campaign after it had received a donation from Vote Leave, which it used for digital marketing. For Facebook ads. There was no mention of a website and the AIQ invoice for £100,000 it submitted to the Electoral Commission is for a “digital ad campaign”. The Observer could not reach Banks for comment. The repository also appears to include code for landing pages for the DUP’s website. The AIQ invoice it submitted to the Electoral Commission, for £32,750.73, is for digital advertising, and a spokesman for Jeffrey Donaldson MP, whose name is on it, told the Observer: “AIQ did not build any pages for the DUP website at any point.” Another of the sites in the repository appears to be for a campaign not previously associated with AIQ. Change Britain was a “grassroots campaign” with “1000s of volunteers who want to help make Brexit happen” led by Gisela Stuart, formerly Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston and the chair of Vote Leave. Its code appears to contain details of a Vote Leave staff member’s email address. Stuart did not respond to questions about who had paid for or commissioned this site. The final discovery in UpGuard’s AIQ find is code for a website for Gove 2016. This was the campaign Gove launched on 30 June, six days after the referendum result, to be leader of the Tory party. AIQ gained administrator access to the site the same day Gove turned on leadership candidate Boris Johnson and announced his own intention to run. When asked about the work AIQ did for Gove, a spokesman said: “The Gove 2016 campaign paid AIQ £2,720.46 in July to set up its website. The payment was authorised by the campaign manager and paid for from funds donated to the campaign. All campaign spending was fully declared to CCHQ as required under Conservative party leadership election rules.” AIQ did not respond to inquiries about its work on the Gove 2016, Change Britain, DUP and Veterans for Britain websites, or the UpGuard report. Gove’s statement above wasn’t just given to the Observer, however. It found its way to the rightwing gossip site Guido Fawkes two days ago, in an apparent spoiler for this story. It’s not a good look. But then, of the many questions being asked by the British authorities investigating Vote Leave – the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office – one must be: what did Gove know? Sanni, the whistleblower who came forward last week to tell his story about the BeLeave donation, claims Gove knew everything. “Everyone associated with the campaign knew who Darren was,” he says. “Everybody congratulated us and knew what role we’d played. Michael Gove knew exactly how important we’d been. He’s a close friend of Dom Cummings. Of course he knew. Boris Johnson knew. Everybody knew.” Cummings, the campaign mastermind behind Vote Leave, had worked as a special adviser to Gove when he was in the Department for Education. His fellow adviser was Henry de Zoete, the head of Vote Leave’s digital operations. This is a tight-knit group who have known each other for years. “The thing about Gove and Cummings is that they are friends,” says Sanni. “They hang out at each other’s houses. It’s a relationship that goes well beyond being colleagues.” It was Cummings’s name – along with de Zoete’s – that was deleted from 140 files on a Google shared drive two weeks after the Electoral Commission opened an investigation last March. A drive that was set up by Vote Leave to share content with BeLeave and AIQ. Vote Leave says it acted “ethically, responsibly and legally in deleting any data”. Last week Cummings said of Sanni and Wylie: “I think they have lied to the Observer and its lawyers”. But it is Gove, the co-convener of the campaign, along with Stuart, its chair, and Johnson, its figurehead, who need now to answer questions. It’s the proximity of Vote Leave’s activities to the heart of government that is the most troubling aspect of this. Gove and Johnson are Theresa May’s ministers. Two other Vote Leave directors implicated, Stephen Parkinson and Cleo Watson, are advisers to May. Watson said: “I absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me.” Parkinson said the allegations were “factually incorrect and misleading”. Campaigns are forbidden by law from coordinating. Unless they declare spending jointly. None of these campaigns did. They were all separate. They were all separate – and all connected to AggregateIQ. Facebook would know, of course, if there was a common plan. But Facebook is a black unknowable box. And Mark Zuckerberg has, for the third time, turned down parliament’s request to answer questions on that and other issues. A year ago, I was told that Christopher Wylie was the key to understanding AggregateIQ. To unravelling Cambridge Analytica’s Canadian connection. Last week, the week that marked the one-year countdown to Britain exiting the EU he told parliament about it in explicit detail. Now it is up to parliament. It is in possession of Cambridge Analytica’s and AIQ’s corporate documents. It supports a government that is intimately entwined in this. And how it negotiates those two irreconcilable facts may be a yardstick that future generations will come to measure it by. • This article was amended on 3 April 2018 to remove an incorrect reference to the Gove 2016 website having never gone live.

The 23 March crash on highway 101 in Mountain View is the latest accident to involve self-driving technology. Earlier this month, a self-driving Volvo SUV that was being tested by the ride-hailing service Uber struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. Federal investigators are looking into the California crash, as well a crash in January of a Tesla Model S that may have been operating under the Autopilot system. In a blogpost, Tesla said the driver of the sport-utility Model X that crashed in Mountain View, 38-year-old Apple software engineer Wei Huang, “had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision. “The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider … but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.” Tesla also said the concrete highway divider had previously been damaged, increasing its impact on the car. The vehicle also caught fire, though Tesla said no one was in the vehicle when that happened. The company said its Autopilot feature can keep speed, change lanes and self-park but requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, in order to be able to take control and avoid accidents. Autopilot does not prevent all accidents, Tesla said, but it does make them less likely. “No one knows about the accidents that didn’t happen,” Tesla said, “only the ones that did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe. “There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year.” The company added that it “care[s] deeply for and feel[s] indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves safety. “None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer’s family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their loss.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/31/brighton-leicester-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T16:11:01Z","webTitle":"Iborra and Vardy seal victory for 10-man Leicester after Brighton penalty miss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/31/brighton-leicester-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/31/brighton-leicester-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Iborra and Vardy seal victory for 10-man Leicester after Brighton penalty miss","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For 78 minutes Leicester were dire and the main question was whether Brighton would summon enough quality to claim three points rather than settle for just one against visitors who appeared to be struggling even to go through the motions. Then Glenn Murray was given the perfect opportunity to fire the home team towards a victory that would have put a comforting distance between them and the relegation zone. But Kasper Schmeichel saved the striker’s penalty – and then the rest of the Leicester team sprung into action, Vicente Iborra and Jamie Vardy scoring a goal each to deepen Brighton’s anguish. Two weeks ago Murray was dreaming about going to the World Cup with England. Now, after being left out of Gareth Southgate’s last squad, he must wonder whether his miss could be among the reasons for Brighton no longer being a Premier League club by the summer. There are teams in more precarious positions, of course, including Huddersfield, who visit Brighton next week. “It’s a massive game,” acknowledged the Brighton manager, Chris Hughton. Before Schmeichel’s penalty save, Murray had spurned the best chance of the game, blasting wide from 10 yards after being put through by Pascal Gross in the first half. But the spot-kick failure was identified by both managers as the game’s turning point. “It gave them the lift that saw them go on to score,” lamented Hughton. “It was a great boost for us and the opposite for Brighton,” agreed the Leicester manager, Claude Puel. Puel had cut an angry figure for most of the match because his team were so sloppy. For long periods the only entertainment came from watching the normally even-tempered Frenchman build to a thunderous rage on the sidelines as his players repeatedly gave the ball away. On countless occasions Leicester got opportunities to spring counterattacks, only to abort the move by either over- or under-hitting an intended through-ball. Shinji Okazaki was a serial offender before being withdrawn in the 55th minute. Vardy was isolated. And Puel’s angry contortions in front of the dugout suggested he felt personally trolled. “We didn’t come back from the international break, I think,” said Puel of his team’s first-half slackness. Brighton, in greater need of three points, were more sprightly. Jürgen Locadia impressed on his first Premier League start since signing from PSV for more than £14m in January. Powerful and adroit, the Dutchman made several dangerous incursions down the right before he faded and was replaced in the 75th minute. If loose passing spoiled most of Leicester’s attacks, it also nearly offered an opening goal to Brighton in the 34th minute. Harry Maguire was the culprit, giving possession to Murray, who scurried forward before lashing a shot just over from the edge of the box. Three minutes later Murray squandered a better chance, blasting wide from 10 yards after being sent through by Gross. Leicester improved after Fousseni Diabaté’s introduction in the 55th minute. They found a little more urgency and accuracy. But a Brighton substitute seemed to swing the game in the hosts’ favour in the 78th minute, when Solly March wriggled his way into the Leicester box before feeding José Izquierdo, who was brought down by Wilfred Ndidi. Murray stepped up to extend a hot streak that had seen him score six goals in his last eight matches. But Schmeichel, who came into this game in poor form, flung himself to his left to tip the shot away. Five minutes later Iborra struck, getting a strong downward header to a cross by Ben Chilwell. As Brighton hunted an equaliser, Ndidi was unlucky to be shown a second yellow card when Shane Duffy tumbled under a legitimate tackle. By this stage Duffy had shifted from defence to attack and Leicester exploited that fact in stoppage time, when Demarai Gray crossed for Vardy to stab in from close range."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/02/lgbt-people-protest-120-beats-per-minute","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"LGBT people need to rediscover their rage in this age of protest | Caspar Salmon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/02/lgbt-people-protest-120-beats-per-minute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/02/lgbt-people-protest-120-beats-per-minute","fields":{"headline":"LGBT people need to rediscover their rage in this age of protest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When director Robin Campillo won the prize for best film last month at France’s César awards, he used the opportunity to plead for the rights of French sex workers, drug users and migrants. The star of 120 Beats per Minute, Nahuel Pérez Biscayart, upon winning a César for most promising actor, spoke out on the subject of abortion rights in his home country of Argentina. This is all to say that the film, released in the UK last week, has politics coursing through its veins. In a time of great political division, its clarion call for protest and its questions about queer identity are perhaps more urgent than ever. The film tells the story of a group of Parisian activists in the 1990s who form the French arm of the protest group ACT UP. Consisting of HIV and Aids sufferers and assorted queer folk, the collective takes radical action to remind society of the savage Aids epidemic that predominantly affected gay men, and to campaign for better laws and access to medication. The film underlines divisions between group members who are unsure about whether to be more radically queer and in-yer-face, or whether that belligerence undermines their efforts for recognition. What is unmistakable, however, is a vigour and excitement about the idea of protesting: there is a nostalgia for the concept of marching together, for the camaraderie of hatching plans. The film proposes homosexuality as a vibrant and questioning counterpoint to polite society; its protagonists are young, aware and angry. It could not be more burningly topical. In late March, a young woman stood up in Washington DC and called out the names of her peers who had died in a school shooting, before descending into a long and powerful silence, as she stood at the lectern for the amount of time that it had taken for her classmates to be gunned down. Emma Gonzalez, the bisexual Cuban-American woman spearheading the March For Our Lives movement, has talked about the way her LGBTQ activism and her work against gun violence are related: it seems clear that her outsiderness is key to her stance. In being outspoken, Gonzalez has been attacked by Republicans such as Steve King, a congressman with a history of making homophobic statements. Members of ACT UP and Gays Against Guns could also be found protesting at the anti-gun marches in the US. Today’s generation of young people demanding change, including Black Lives Matter protesters fighting state violence, is of a piece with 120 Beats per Minute’s activists – right down to their witty, irreverent responses to the establishment. The film’s generational clash between out gay activists and a homophobic society finds an easy parallel in a dispossessed generation of millennials fighting ideological battles today. Equally, the film asks where queer people can go next. It comes at a time when queer cinema has become less niche and less confrontational: from God’s Own Country to Call Me By Your Name, to Love, Simon, the new gay theme is one of acceptance of homosexual people by their straight families. Coupled with the return of the appalling minstrelsy of Queer Eye, we are seeing a more emollient culture, one aimed at happy and accepted gay people who are sick of anguished depictions of suffering victims. But we need to rekindle some of our abrasiveness. 120 Beats per Minute doesn’t plead for heterosexual patronage, because straightness is not a part of that world. Its register, while combative, is joyous and celebratory, giving us something with fire in its belly, and which calls for queers to rediscover our radicalism and fight not for integration so much as acceptance of our difference. There is still much to fight for. We have a Tory government riddled with homophobia, outing a young whistleblower in a statement sanctioned by Downing Street, and forming a coalition deal with the Democratic Unionist party. From Andrea Leadsom and Jacob Rees-Mogg flaunting their opposition to equal marriage to David Davies expressing transphobic views, the ruling party isn’t often shy about its disregard for the queer community. Taking a page from 120 Beats per Minute’s generosity of spirit and universalism, all queers should make a point of standing with our trans siblings, attacked every day in our streets and press, and the Muslim community, often the object of ignorant vilification in our name. Access to the HIV medication PrEP should be made readily available on the NHS. Queer people are over-represented among Britain’s growing homeless population.

Danny Ray Thomas appeared to be experiencing a mental health crisis when he was shot dead last month by a deputy with the Harris county sheriff’s office who encountered the 34-year-old walking on a north Houston street. “Until our local officials put policies in place that will discipline officers for shooting an unarmed man, we will continue to see these things,” said Tarsha Jackson, criminal justice director of the Texas Organizing Project, an advocacy group. “The community is hopeful that there is a fair investigation but the fact that his pants were down to his ankles is an indication that there is something going on, there’s something mentally wrong with this man, and how can you feel endangered when you actually are the one with the gun? [The officer] could have used a Taser if he felt he was in danger. “Until we get leadership across the board, local, state and federal, that’s demanding that officers stop being a judge, juror and executioner on the street, we’re going to see this.” Harris county’s sheriff, Ed Gonzalez, has pledged a transparent and thorough investigation and released dashcam video. The footage shows Thomas engaged in a minor verbal and physical altercation with another man. He then walks towards the officer, Cameron Brewer, 44. The officer, who is black, yells: “I’ll shoot your ass, man, get down, man! … Get down on the ground! Get on the ground!” The shooting takes place off camera. Gonzalez told reporters Brewer had been issued with a body camera only about two hours before, but it was charging in the deputy’s car at the time of the incident. In cellphone video published by the Houston Chronicle, Thomas is seen walking towards Brewer, who backs off while pointing his weapon at the man. “He about to get Tased,” a woman says, laughing. A passing vehicle obscures the moment of the shooting. The woman exclaims: “Why he shot him? Why he shot that man? He should’ve got Tased.” The time between Brewer arriving at the intersection and firing a single, fatal shot into Thomas’s chest is less than 30 seconds. Gonzalez told reporters Thomas was “foaming at the mouth” before the shot. “It is concerning that Mr Thomas was unarmed; he was obviously in a state of crisis of some kind,” he told the Chronicle. “To go straight to [lethal force], that’s concerning to me.” Thomas’s two children, aged five and seven, were allegedly drowned by their mother in a bathtub in 2016 and their bodies hidden under a neighbour’s house. Thomas died on the afternoon of 22 March, the same day protesters demonstrated in Sacramento after another unarmed African American man, Stephon Clark, was shot dead in his grandmother’s back yard by officers. More protests followed. On Friday Clark’s family said an independent autopsy showed the 22-year-old was shot from behind seven times. On Friday night, the police chief in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that Blake Salamoni, the officer who killed Alton Sterling in 2016, had been sacked, though he is not facing charges. Footage released on Friday showed Salamoni swearing at Sterling and threatening to shoot him in the head. Kita Thomas-Smith, Thomas’s sister, gave a tearful address to Houston city council members last week. “My brother was unarmed, not trying to harm, and possibly just wanted to have someone help him,” she said. “What happened to my brother should not have happened. “To have this going on in my family, to me, it’s unimaginable. It’s unimaginable and it’s unacceptable what happened. This is not just ‘I’m sorry’, it’s much more than that. You took somebody’s life, an innocent life … He took a life when he could have saved him.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/05/american-conservatives-are-still-clueless-about-the-97-expert-climate-consensus","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T10:00:45Z","webTitle":"American conservatives are still clueless about the 97% expert climate consensus | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/05/american-conservatives-are-still-clueless-about-the-97-expert-climate-consensus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/05/american-conservatives-are-still-clueless-about-the-97-expert-climate-consensus","fields":{"headline":"American conservatives are still clueless about the 97% expert climate consensus","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Gallup released its annual survey on American perceptions about global warming last week, and the results were a bit discouraging. While 85–90% of Democrats are worried about global warming, realize humans are causing it, and are aware that most scientists agree on this, independents and Republicans are a different story. Only 35% of Republicans and 62% of independents realize humans are causing global warming (down from 40% and 70% last year, respectively), a similar number are worried about it, and only 42% of Republicans and 65% of independents are aware of the scientific consensus – also significantly down from last year’s Gallup poll. The Trump administration’s polarizing stance on climate change is probably the main contributor to this decline in conservative acceptance of climate change realities. A recent study found evidence that “Americans may have formed their attitudes [on climate change] by using party elite cues” delivered via the media. In particular, the study found that Fox News “is consistently more partisan than other [news] outlets” and has incorporated politicians into the majority of its climate segments. Americans are gradually becoming better-informed Nevertheless, public awareness about climate change realities has improved over the long-term. For example, about two-thirds of Americans now realize that most scientists agree global warming is occurring, up from less than half in 1997. There’s also a strong correlation between awareness of the expert consensus, that humans are causing global warming, and concern about the issue. This suggests that when people are aware that experts agree, they accept the consensus and realize we need to address the problem. This is consistent with research finding that the expert consensus is a ‘gateway belief’ leading to public support for climate action. There’s a handbook for that John Cook and Stephan Lewandowsky, who previously published The Debunking Handbook, teamed up with Sander van der Linden and Edward Maibach to write The Consensus Handbook. It’s a concise and definitive summary of everything related to the expert climate consensus, including how we know 90–100% of climate scientists agree on human-caused global warming, efforts to manufacture doubt about the consensus, its role as a gateway belief, its neutralizing effect on political ideology, and how to inoculate people against misinformation. Those last points are particularly important in light of the Gallup survey data. There’s an intense battle over public opinion on climate change, with cues from political elites having a polarizing effect that’s largely offset when people become aware of the expert consensus. Thus, there’s been a concerted campaign to misinform people about the consensus. That was a key issue that major oil companies accepted in a recent court case, while their fossil fuel-funded supporters denied the consensus in briefs submitted to the court. Meanwhile, the Trump EPA is distributing misleading statements about scientific uncertainty on climate change, helping create this tribal identity that ‘Team Conservative’ denies the realities and dangers associated with human-caused global warming. However, as the Consensus Handbook discusses, research has shown that inoculating people against misinformation can largely offset its influence. The bad news is that misinformation can totally offset the influence of facts on topics like the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. The good news is that people don’t like being fooled, so when they’re additionally informed about the tactics used to trick them with misinformation, they’re more likely to accept the facts. Some are polarized, but many are simply unaware The challenge is that politicians on Fox News and other media outlets are able to reach a wide audience with their polarizing messages about climate change. Reaching a similarly sized audience not only with facts but also inoculation against the misinformation is a daunting task. However, as John Cook notes, People always ask me “how do you convince conservatives” or “how do you convince Trump voters” and I answer, “the question isn’t how to convince conservatives, it’s who should we be targeting - our audience is the large, undecided majority” One key point from the Gallup polling data is that consistently over the past 20 years, less than 10% of Americans have believed that most scientists don’t think global warming is happening. The vast majority of Americans are either aware or unaware of the expert consensus, but few have it backwards. Data from Yale and George Mason universities tells a similar story – only about 10% of Americans think less than 50% of climate scientists agree on global warming. While Americans badly underestimate the expert consensus – just 13% are aware there’s over 90% expert agreement, and the average American thinks the consensus is just 67% – despite growing polarization, few believe that most scientists reject global warming. Most Americans are simply unaware about and thus underestimate the expert climate consensus. While a number of people can’t be convinced by the facts due to their polarized views, many more in that undecided, uninformed group remain open-minded and reachable. We could solve the problem if conservative politicians and media outlets would simply stop spreading misinformation about and polarizing the subject of climate change. Sadly, the rise of this ‘tribal epistemology’ has done lasting damage to America, and nobody seems to have any good ideas how to stop or reverse it. But the Consensus Handbook provides some important information about the importance of consensus messaging and tools to help it take hold."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/01/anthony-joshua-deontay-wilder-joseph-parker","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T11:08:37Z","webTitle":"Anthony Joshua's road to Deontay Wilder remains rocky | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/01/anthony-joshua-deontay-wilder-joseph-parker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/01/anthony-joshua-deontay-wilder-joseph-parker","fields":{"headline":"Anthony Joshua's road to Deontay Wilder remains rocky","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Of all the boxes that Anthony Joshua had rushed to tick during his whirlwind four-year professional career, only one had remained blank until Saturday night: going the distance in the ring. No more. Joseph Parker proved as tough as advertised, outgunned but never overwhelmed, but – tellingly – it was Joshua, with his supposedly suspect stamina, who finished the stronger man as he won a wide and unanimous points decision. In truth it wasn’t a classic. It was too stop-start for that, with the referee Giuseppe Quartarone rightly taking much of the blame for being too eager to break up every clinch. Yet there was enough menace in both men’s work to keep it interesting – even though Joshua’s stiff left jab, which acted like a cattle prod for most of the fight, dominating and repeatedly stinging his opponent, ensured he stayed in control. Victory means that the 28-year-old leaves Cardiff with Parker’s WBO heavyweight title, to add to his WBA, WBC and IBO belts, and the obvious next step would be for an immediate reunification bout with the big punching WBC champion, Deontay Wilder. In boxing, however, things are rarely that simple. The American was expected to travel to Cardiff to see Joshua up close, but instead watched it on Showtime in the US. And when asked whether a reunification fight was likely to happen he replied: “Given the mannerisms they have been showing at the way they have acted, I highly doubt it.” Afterwards Joshua made it clear he wants Wilder next. However promoter Eddie Hearn insisted that Wilder has shown no interest in making terms. So, not for the first time, there is an impasse. Whatever happens the Joshua Express will charge on regardless. This, after all, was a fight beamed live to 215 countries – from Honduras to Holland – compared to 140 for his meeting against Wladimir Klitschko last April. The message is clear: Joshua might be made, and apply his trade, in Britain, but he is a fast-growing global brand. And now he can rest and reflect on a job well done against Parker. Beforehand his trainer, Rob McCracken, had warned this would be his man’s second-toughest test, after his seesawing epic against Klitschko last April. And so it proved. Parker had arrived at the Principality Stadium smiling and fist-bumping the security guards. And as his hands were wrapped he also promised that “this was his destiny and his time”. If there were any pre-fight nerves he masked them with the skill of an illusionist: he had, his camp promised, even slept for nine hours on Friday night. But once the action started the devilish intent in Joshua’s fists quickly woke him up. The first four rounds were largely one-way traffic, with Joshua stalking his man from the centre of the ring, and making his towering presence felt with stiff jabs and spearing body punches. By the second round Parker’s nose was slightly bloodied. And by the fourth he looked increasingly ragged and out of ideas. True, the New Zealander had enjoyed some success with his fast left jab. But every time he threw a combination Joshua adroitly stepped back, making his opponent’s floundering punches fall short. But as Joshua slowed in the fifth round, Parker got a second wind and a surge of confidence when he landed a couple of meaty blows. The sixth too went Parker’s way, and suddenly we had a fight. No less a dignitary than Sugar Ray Leonard was at ringside, having called Joshua the “entire package” after visiting his dressing room beforehand. But Leonard was perhaps a little too fulsome with his praise: for while the Briton’s jab was excellent, he was unable to put together enough sustained combinations to put Parker in significant trouble. Yet Joshua never looked in much bother himself. One of the oldest adages in boxing is that a good big one usually beats a good little one. Despite Parker’s best efforts, that old the rule proved as robust as ever. Joshua leaves Cardiff with the confidence of knowing that he can do 12 rounds – even though his future opponents will note that he was breathing heavily during the middle rounds. The only frustration is that with Wilder refusing to play ball, and Tyson Fury yet to return to the ring after his well-publicised problems Joshua will take longer than he would like to confirm his dominance over the heavyweight division. Yet, 21 fights into his career, he continues to barely put a foot wrong."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/01/gkn-stripped-sold-for-parts-miller-hanson","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T05:00:12Z","webTitle":"GKN will be stripped and sold for parts by ghouls who have no interest in making things | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/01/gkn-stripped-sold-for-parts-miller-hanson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/01/gkn-stripped-sold-for-parts-miller-hanson","fields":{"headline":"GKN will be stripped and sold for parts by ghouls who have no interest in making things","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The past is never dead. When the wheeling, dealing, asset-stripping Hanson Trust finally collapsed in 2007, having played a major part in the deindustrialisation of Britain – but having greatly enriched its Thatcherite founder Lord Hanson – I thought a stake had finally being driven through the heart of a particular ghoul. Never again would our Westminster, Whitehall and City establishments indulge a glorified super-accountant who knew the price of everything but the value of nothing. And, in the name of “culture change” and rigorous “management”, had laid waste to industrial Britain. I was wrong. The ghoul lives on, reincarnated as Chris Miller, the executive chair of Melrose, a company self-consciously cast in Hanson Trust’s image, and now the victor in the £8bn battle for control of Britain’s third largest engineering group, GKN. Miller is in fact a Hanson protege and, like his former boss James Hanson, he trained as an accountant – the perfect professional background for asset stripping. For what glory days were those! The young Miller will have been part of the finance team working to Hanson and his chief accomplice, Gordon White, at their headquarters overlooking Buckingham Palace. It was a company wholly controlled by the two men, insisting on approving every expenditure above £500 by the companies they acquired – even while they pioneered stowing profits in tax havens and raiding pension funds of the companies they took over. Crucially, Miller will have seen firsthand how Hanson and White stalked their takeover targets, set about winning the battles and then made a fortune from breaking up the victim company while running its core businesses to incredibly stringent financial targets. I have no doubt that, like Hanson and White, both ennobled by Margaret Thatcher who admired them uncritically, he believes in the virtue of what he does. Since founding Melrose, the financial returns have been stratospheric. Miller has yet to be named capitalist of the year by the Times as Hanson was in 1986 – but he is on his way. But, like Hanson’s, Miller’s is a capitalism organised entirely around extracting rather than creating value. Hanson’s model was brutally simple, exemplified by the 1982 takeover of Berec, the manufacturer of Eveready batteries, and its subsequent breakup – Miller will have had a ringside seat. Like GKN, it was a proud Midlands-based British engineering company setting about the hazardous business of becoming the international brand leader in batteries, based on high investment in research and development. Who knows? In a different business culture, Berec might now be the world’s leading battery manufacturer, set to exploit the electrification of cars. Instead, it does not exist. For, like GKN, it made a mis-step – the share price dipped and Hanson launched his bid. The European division was sold off to its chief competitor, Duracell, thus recouping most of the cost of the takeover. Battery prices were increased across the board, so that Eveready quickly lost market share. All new investment could only be justified if the cash was returned in four years while making a 20% return. Ten years later, Eveready had been milked dry, and Hanson sold out to Ralston Purina. Its verdict on Eveready as it assessed its purchase: a company “a number of years behind the times… a business in decline… the whole infrastructure was pretty thin”. Hanson had made a fortune – but Britain had lost another pivotal company. So it continued. Two years before he left Hanson to found his own Hanson-like shell company, Miller would have been in the thick of the 1986 bid for Imperial Tobacco – then dismembered like Eveready. But the Hanson business model was inherently unstable. To grow and maintain his own share price, he had to go for ever bigger targets to feed the beast. Hanson had an unsuccessful shot at ICI, which saw him off – but only at the price of ICI changing its declared business purpose from bettering society through science to maximising the share price. ICI then broke itself up – but so did Hanson, with the company ignominiously being sold to a German cement company. We can foretell what will happen to GKN. Businesses will be sold to repay the £8bn. Prices will increase, and market share will be foregone: there is no other option given the millstone of debt around Melrose’s neck. R&amp;D will be frozen at the current levels, already running at half to two thirds the rate of its chief competitors, rendering virtually valueless the promise to the business secretary, Greg Clark, to maintain it. Investment will only be allowed on Hanson-type terms – four-year paybacks and 20% returns. Yes, the company headquarters will remain in Britain – but in Mayfair, not in Redditch. In 10 years’ time, some company will buy the rump of GKN, only to find it in the same condition as Ralston Purina found Eveready. Melrose’s future is also foretold. For all the hundreds of millions it is making, it will wind up like Hanson. Britain, which already has no major indigenous company in an array of sectors, will have them in even fewer – with all the implications for work, wages, careers and skills. For most of the young analysts at the asset management groups who took the decision to accept Melrose’s offer for GKN, the events I describe will seem like ancient history. But the same mistakes keep being repeated. To prevent them, the government simply has to rule that only shareholders who own shares at the time of the bid can vote, so disenfranchising the arbitrageurs and hedge funds who swung the decision. But the City establishment lobbies ferociously against this move. For the City is wedded to the value extraction on which its fees depend. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/01/lost-faith-god-religion-pope-francis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"Yes, we’ve lost our faith in God, but we’ve lost our faith in reason too | Kenan Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/01/lost-faith-god-religion-pope-francis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/01/lost-faith-god-religion-pope-francis","fields":{"headline":"Yes, we’ve lost our faith in God, but we’ve lost our faith in reason too","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. So runs the inscription above the gates of hell in Dante’s Inferno. Through those gates walks Dante with his guide Virgil: Now sighs, loud wailing, lamentation Resounded through the starless air, So that I too began to weep. Unfamiliar tongues, horrendous accents, Words of suffering, cries of rage, voices Loud and faint, the sound of slapping hands… Inferno is the first part, or canticle, of the Divine Comedy, Dante’s great triptych of journeys through hell, purgatory and heaven. Today, we read it as poetry, even if it is poetry that seems to have been touched by the divine. Seven hundred years ago, it was read as a glimpse of something far more real. Dante’s imaginative recreation of both the physical and the moral universe, and of the interlacing of the two, infused medieval culture and allowed Europeans to understand both their place in the physical architecture of the cosmos and their duties in the moral architecture of Christian society. So far have we moved today from Dante’s reality that even the pope, if we are to believe the Italian journalist Eugenio Scalfari, no longer acknowledges the existence of hell. Scalfari asked Pope Francis where “bad souls” go after death. Hell, Francis supposedly replied, “doesn’t exist”. “Sinning souls” simply “disappear”. The Vatican has condemned the article, published in La Repubblica, insisting that the pope was misquoted. Whatever the truth, the controversy nevertheless points up the dilemma in which religion finds itself in the modern world. Religious values are immensely flexible over time. Christian beliefs on many issues have changed enormously in the past two millennia. Yet an institution like the Catholic church can never be truly “modern”. Christianity, like all monotheistic religions, views human desires and beliefs as unreliable guides to notions of good and bad. Values derive primarily from God, and the authority of the church rests on its claim to be able to interpret the Bible and God’s word. Were the church to modify its teaching to meet the wishes of its flock, the authority of the institution would inevitably weaken. But were it not to do so, a chasm would emerge between official teaching and actual practice. Dante’s hell may be difficult to believe in, but to jettison difficult beliefs is to question the need for religion itself. A recent pan-European survey by Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology at St Mary’s University in London, showed that in a dozen countries, including Britain, a majority of young people are irreligious. And even those who identify as religious have attitudes increasingly like those of their irreligious neighbours. A survey of the social attitudes of British believers published in 2013 by Linda Woodhead, professor of sociology of religion at Lancaster University, suggested that two thirds of Catholics accepted abortion of some kind. Half said that they are primarily guided by their own reason, intuition or feelings. Fewer than one in 10 sought guidance from the church or Bible. Meanwhile, Woodhead observes, a minority of believers have marched in the opposite direction. They possess an absolute belief in God, make moral decisions primarily on the basis of religious sources, and are deeply conservative on issues of social morality. The literalism of fundamentalist Muslims and evangelical Christians speaks to a yearning for the restoration of strong identities and moral lines. The sectarianism of fundamentalist religion is reflected also in the political sphere. Witness the rise of tribal politics and of social movements built around excluding the Other. All this poses a challenge, not just for believers, but for non-believers, too. Religion is not simply a set of beliefs. It is also a means of creating a sense of community, identity and meaning. One reason for the growth of fundamentalism is that all these seem in short supply today. The world appears increasingly trapped between an atomised liberalism, on the one hand, and a sense of community created by fundamentalist religion or reactionary politics, on the other. In his 1946 book Man’s Search for Meaning, the Austrian psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, who spent three years incarcerated in German concentration camps, meditates on that experience; a meditation on surviving hell. “This is a profoundly religious book,” suggested the rabbi Howard Kushner in the foreword to the second edition. Frankl’s faith is, however, very different to that embodied in religion. It is a hymn not to a transcendent deity but to the human spirit that, through its own efforts, can transcend the immediacy of its being in the world. Humans, he suggests, find themselves only through creating meaning in the world. Meaning is not something to be discovered through God. It is something that humans create. “Man is ultimately self-determining,” Frankl wrote. “Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be.” Today, it is that very capacity to “decide what our existence will be” that seems to have ebbed away. For all the material improvements in the world, life feels more precarious for millions of people. They seem to have less control in shaping the direction of their world. Liberals often laud the Enlightenment as the moment when faith was replaced by reason. The new moral vision was, however, also rooted in faith, though of a different kind – faith that humans were capable of acting rationally and morally without guidance from beyond. It was that faith upon which Frankl drew. It was expressed not just through science and technology but also through politics that helped overthrow tyranny and bring about democracy. That faith, too, has eroded, as have the movements in which it was embodied. Religion once helped provide meaning and identity through sublimating human agency to God’s will. Not only is it less capable of doing so these days, but when it does so, it often takes sectarian or bigoted forms. Equally, as the optimism that once suffused the humanist impulse has ebbed away, politics, too, is less capable of providing a means through which people can express agency. The politics that today seeks to do this is also often sectarian or bigoted. “God is dead,” Nietzsche wrote, before adding: “Yet his shadow still looms.” That shadow is in reality our failure to create movements and institutions that can nurture a sense of meaning and belongingness and dignity. Disbelief in God carries little weight without also a faith in ourselves as human beings. Otherwise, we find ourselves in a different kind of hell. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/02/dina-asher-smith-commonwealth-games-gold-coast-zharnel-hughes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Dina Asher-Smith chases Commonwealth Games medal not celebrity status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/02/dina-asher-smith-commonwealth-games-gold-coast-zharnel-hughes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/02/dina-asher-smith-commonwealth-games-gold-coast-zharnel-hughes","fields":{"headline":"Dina Asher-Smith chases Commonwealth Games medal not celebrity status","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Dina Asher-Smith is Britain’s fastest woman over 100m and 200m and our brightest female sprinting talent in decades but she does not feel those accolades lend her celebrity status. Which is why she was so surprised to see details of her split with Zharnel Hughes, one of Britain’s most talented male runners, in the papers. “I didn’t think it was that much of a big deal to be in the papers,” she says. “We are fine, we are friends. I won’t go into the details because that is personal life but we train the same time, we are still pretty cool. I’m not a celebrity, which is why it is hilarious that people care if I have a boyfriend. I can’t wait to tell him.” Asher-Smith and Hughes are already at the Team England preparation camp in Brisbane, an hour away from the Gold Coast venue for the Commonwealth Games, which begin on Wednesday. Both have a strong chance of winning medals, even against the might of Jamaica. Hughes ran the fastest 200m on Australian soil since 2001 in a warm-up meeting last week and Asher‑Smith is also peaking at the right time. The 22-year-old’s extraordinary ability has been known for many years, emphasised when she broke Kathy Cook’s long‑standing 200m national record in 2015. At the world championships in London last summer she came within seven hundredths of a second of what would have been a remarkable medal in the 200m. A month previously she had been unsure whether she would even compete in London as she recovered from a broken foot. Asher‑Smith was also balancing training with studying for a degree at King’s College London, but is now a full‑time athlete, after graduating with a 2:1 in history, and injury free. “I feel pretty happy,” she says. “I have finished university which is one stress out of the way, even if I did love it. The impending doom of dissertation and exams has gone and my foot is no longer broken so that worry is gone, too. “I am not racing to get into shape this time, so I am just relaxed. Not relaxed about competition because I need to bring my A game, or A plus, but I feel more confident within myself because I achieved something in such difficult circumstances last season.” Asher-Smith won Commonwealth youth gold in 2011 and will draw on that experience to give her confidence in the Gold Coast. It is her first Commonwealth Games at a senior level and she has opted not to double up, competing in only the 200m. She has also chosen the Gold Coast over Birmingham, which hosted the World Indoor Championships in March. “I would have loved to do both,” she says, “but I wanted the opportunity to do the Commonwealth Games because I have never done it before and to me it has a lot of pedigree to it. It is an opportunity to hone my skills, learn more and race against the fastest in the world, which is what I love doing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/01/governments-easter-pay-rise-is-not-all-its-cracked-up-to-be","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T10:35:38Z","webTitle":"Government's Easter pay rise is not all it's cracked up to be | Richard Partington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/01/governments-easter-pay-rise-is-not-all-its-cracked-up-to-be","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/01/governments-easter-pay-rise-is-not-all-its-cracked-up-to-be","fields":{"headline":"Government's Easter pay rise is not all it's cracked up to be","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When George Osborne promised Britain a pay rise in the summer of 2015, fresh from electoral victory over Ed Miliband, he pledged a “national living wage” in an attempt to steal a march on his defeated opponent. Three years later, his promise means more than 2 million workers received an inflation-beating pay rise of 4.4% on Easter Sunday as the living wage rose for the second time, from £7.50 per hour to £7.83 for those over the age of 25. The increase amounts to more than £600 per year for full-time workers on basic pay. Combined with steps to raise the personal tax threshold, taking more low-income families out of paying tax altogether, it makes for a powerful political message: the Conservatives are the party of the workers, not Labour. Trust us, we’re putting more money in your pocket. But the policy was a masterclass in political deceit. Even though the promise has been kept, and is in some small way a sign of progress, the average pay of British workers remains 6% below its pre-financial crisis peak. Britain hasn’t had a real pay rise in almost a decade. As for the language used to make Osborne’s argument, the government’s national living wage does not deserve the name. The term belongs to the Living Wage Foundation, which has campaigned for better pay since 2001 – well before the then-chancellor used the term to rebadge the national minimum wage first introduced by Tony Blair’s Labour. The foundation warned last week that a worker on the new government minimum will receive almost £1,800 less per year than they really need for basics such as housing, transport, childcare and food. The government’s own official number cruncher, the Office for National Statistics, also warned the new government minimum falls short of average family spending. It reckons mums and dads working full-time would earn £212 per week less than the average amount spent by all households with two adults and two children last year. Put simply, the living wage rise is not what it says on the tin. Osborne stole the term for reasons of political expediency, in a sleight of hand that must not be forgotten over the coming weeks when Tory ministers boast of raising workers’ pay. The Conservatives have pledged to increase the living wage to £9 an hour by 2020. Labour has trumped that by saying workers, including those under the age of 25, should be paid £10 an hour by the end of the decade. But it’s worth remembering earnings are not the only source of income. Tax credits, benefits and investments can also be counted – although the latter rarely applies to the lowest earners. Analysis from the Bank of England last week showed the bottom 10th of earners take home less in wages from hard graft than those at the top of the pile make sitting on their investment portfolios. Herein lies another policy change set in motion by Osborne three years ago, but one his successor, Philip Hammond, is less keen to talk about. While the chancellor happily mentioned the living wage rise at the spring statement last month, he glossed over some other significant changes that also take effect from the start of this week. The “non-event” status given to the spring statement was, again, far from the truth. A massive £2.5bn of working-age benefit cuts will take effect from the start of this week, as part of the £10bn of cuts earmarked by Osborne in 2015. A further £2.7bn savings must be found in the year from April 2019, just as the UK leaves the European Union. According to the Resolution Foundation, those cuts will mean “just about managing” families in the poorer half of Britain in terms of income – the very households Theresa May pledged to help on the steps of Downing Street when she took power almost two years ago – will lose about £1,000 per year on average by the early 2020s. As a result, the thinktank reckons Britain is set for the largest rise in income inequality since the 1980s. The freeze on benefits under way since 2015 means most of the support for working-age adults won’t increase with inflation this month as usual. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, this will take £200 per year on average off 10.5m households – a great many more than the rise in the living wage will help. There are some signs of hope. Rising real wages – when average pay growth beats the rate of inflation – are in sight after the ONS reported that pay in the three months to January was rising at the fastest rate in two years. With inflation also now beginning to fall, that could mean pay begins to outstrip rising prices within the coming months. Many employers choose to pay the Living Wage Foundation recommended hourly rate of £8.75 and £10.20 in London, viewing it as a selling point to attract and reward good employees. Manchester city council, for one, recently moved to pay home care workers in the city the real living wage to help retain staff. Other bosses are concerned that higher statutory pay could prompt rising unemployment, as firms are faced with the prospect of paying more money to fewer workers. But that discounts the idea that raising the minimum wage can boost the spending power of consumers, lifting demand in the economy and therefore helping create the conditions for more jobs to be created. There are already clear signs about the dangers for the economy when British households have too little money in their pocket to spend. Several retailers – including Maplin, Toys R Us and Bargain Booze owners Conviviality have gone bust, while others are teetering on the brink. Fresh figures from the ONS last week showed households became net borrowers, rather than savers, for the first time since 1987. Meanwhile, the households savings ratio, which measures outgoings and incoming money, is at its lowest level since 1963. With the Brexit countdown clock having now reached a year to go until the UK leaves the EU, this should be a warning that Britain needs the pay rise Osborne promised more than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/everyman/3730","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T23:00:13Z","webTitle":"Everyman crossword No 3,730","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/everyman/3730","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/everyman/3730","fields":{"headline":"Everyman crossword No 3,730","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/31/new-zealand-v-england-second-test-day-three-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T05:50:07Z","webTitle":"New Zealand v England: second Test, day three – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/31/new-zealand-v-england-second-test-day-three-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/31/new-zealand-v-england-second-test-day-three-live","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand v England: second Test, day three – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That’s all from me. Thanks for your company – Vic Marks’ report from Christchurch will be with you before too long. Speak soon! And they decided it’s too dark. Bit odd, as the sun is still out. Does look gloomy though. An excellent batting display from England, then. Cook failed again but Stoneman and Vince made encouraging half-centuries before Root and Malan shored things up. They have the chance to crack on tomorrow and build a huge lead and base for a declaration. Stokes and Bairstow might fancy it, you sense. 66th over: England 202-3 (Root 30, Malan 19) Wagner steams in, and England pick up just a single Malan single. The umpires are chatting about the light... 65th over: England 201-3 (Root 30, Malan 18) There’s a review here for caught behind down the legside. Malan the batsman, Sodhi, from round the wicket, the bowler. It turns down the legside, there was a noise, but I don’t think it was bat. They send it upstairs. I was right, nothing doing. Not out. The batsmen take two singles each from this over, then Root pulls the last ball away for four to bring up the 200. John Starbuck asks: “Will, Do NZ have another spinner to help out when the light is going?” Williamson got four-fer in that game at Eden Park in 2013... 64th over: England 193-3 (Root 24, Malan 16) Wagner’s back to bowl some bouncers, and there’s immediately a run out chance! Root pushes to cover, calls Malan through then says no. Nicholls set himself and launched to the nonstrikers, where Wagner doesn’t gather cleanly. Malan, somehow, gets back. Eventually, they do get a single to a similar gap. 63rd over: England 192-3 (Root 23, Malan 16) Sodhi is threaded through the offside by Root and then the legside by Malan, for a single each. Root is good at counting to six, and he pinches the strike. 62nd over: England 189-3 (Root 21, Malan 15) The sun is still just about up in Christchurch, and Boult’s finding a little reverse swing. In this over there’s a Malan single and a controlled edge from Root that doesn’t carry to slip. Next ball, he takes one to deep cover. 61st over: England 187-3 (Root 20, Malan 14) Spin! Sodhi is back on with the shadows now very long. He starts round the wicket to Malan but drops too short and is cut for one. The batsmen trade singles, before Root carts to to mid-on’s right. 60th over: England 182-3 (Root 17, Malan 12) As soon as Boult goes round the wicket, Root flicks two through midwicket. These are the only runs of the over as he goes back over the wicket. 59th over: England 180-3 (Root 15, Malan 12) A run! Two, in fact. Malan threads a drive through the offside off Wagner. Ah, that’s better still. Wagner drops shorter and Malan cuts brilliantly for four. He loves that shot. Malan takes two more through that area later in the over, which is a good one for England. 10 left tonight. 58th over: England 172-3 (Root 15, Malan 4) Root’s started to free his arms here, but keeps finding fielders. There’s another maiden. 57th over: England 172-3 (Root 15, Malan 4) With England’s lead over 200 and without a great deal happening, it’s worth wondering how England will play it. It’s getting a little dark and they may not bowl all 12 of the remaining overs. England would probably want four sessions to bowl NZ out on a flattie like this. Stokes and Bairstow are obviously capable of kicking on, as are these two. So two big sessions of batting tomorrow would give them a total New Zealand couldn’t chase. While I thought that through, Wagner bowled a maiden to Malan. 56th over: England 172-3 (Root 15, Malan 4) Boult is still just hanging the ball outside Root’s off-stump with a packed offside field. Root cannot get through. 55th over: England 172-3 (Root 15, Malan 4) Again, Root gets a single first ball then Malan blocks out the rest of the over. 54th over: England 171-3 (Root 14, Malan 4) Root eases himself off strike, then Malan gets himself off his pair! Shot. Tall pull through square-leg for four. 53rd over: England 166-3 (Root 13, Malan 0) Malan is on a king pair, then. He’s struggling for runs a little, and has been a bit static of foot movement. He leaves his first ball to negotiate the king pair but is still on a pair at the end of the over. 23 wickets to the same four bowlers now, by the way... I doubt this, to be honest. All three are legitimate talking points, I reckon. So is Malan’s form. 52nd over: England 165-3 (Root 12) Boult to continue after the short break. Root picks up a single through cover, then Vince does the same. Boult’s bowling very wide of off stump without a fine leg, so Root has to reach to squeeze another single through backward point. OH, JAMES VINCE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! He’s thrown the hands really hard at a drive and been caught sharply by Taylor, who is at a floaty second slip position. Quality catch, lovely innings but a slightly needless dismissal. And one we have all seen before. 51st over: England 162-2 (Vince 75, Root 10) A double change: Wagner on. I’m going to shock you here: he’s started with a bouncer. Root sways that one, but pulls another very fine and gets four. Shot. And there’s another pull, but in front of square and straight to the fielder. A single each ends the over, and that’s drinks. 50th over: England 155-2 (Vince 74, Root 4) A change of bowler and angle, then. Boult’s on, and I think that’s a good move. The Barmies are warbling away as Boult bowls a decent over, which sees just one Root single and a pulled two from Vince. 49th over: England 152-2 (Vince 72, Root 3) Root scampers a tight single to mid-on but Vince keeps finding fielders! He’s just gone a touch quiet. That’s better, a very hard-run two behind square on the legside. Zaph Mann’s in my inbox again. “At this point it’s possible that 4 different bowlers could get a 10 for in the match - surely without precedent. However, I predict that the run-chasing fear will involve England’s new spinner Leach who will be a hero or villain as he takes wickets or ships sixes...” 48th over: England 149-2 (Vince 70, Root 2) Root’s just feeling bat on ball from CdG. There are 21 overs after this one today – surely Boult, Wagner and Sodhi will all have a decent trundle each? Root waits until the fifth ball to score, flicking one wide of mid-on. No big score, but Stoneman ends the series with an average north of 40. Talk of dropping him seems oddly-timed, I reckon. 47th over: England 148-2 (Vince 70, Root 1) Root’s busily away with one to fine leg, then Vince plays out the over. Stoneman was the 50th time a batsman has been caught Watling bowled Southee. Nice. That’s the wicketiest pairing for New Zealand. Finally, they have caught one! It’s Watling, and it’s a belter. He dives to his left to take a thick outside edge off a drive. Stoneman will be kicking himself because he’d been living a charmed life. In other news, 22 wickets have fallen in this match, and still only four bowlers have taken any. That’s Southee’s seventh. 46th over: England 147-1 (Stoneman 60, Vince 70) For the first time in Test cricket, Mark Stoneman is out of the fifties! He has passed 50 five times, but this is the first time he’s converted it into a 60. He gets there with a push into the offside off CdG, who then bowls a wide to Vince. 45th over: England 145-1 (Stoneman 59, Vince 70) Stoneman just needs to calm down a touch. He misses a wafty cut off Southee. Anyway, he gets off strike with that very shot, before Vince is wise to some canny variations from Southee. It’s also April Fools, of course. 44th over: England 144-1 (Stoneman 58, Vince 70) Dropped! Again. Stoneman’s had another reachy drive at CDG and Southee, at wide slip, gets two hands to it at full stretch but can’t hang on. Taylor (who is now off the field) dropped him on 48, now Southee has on 57. Anyway, they scamper one, then Vince gets two through the offside. David Griffiths is confused. “Wasn’t Vince regularly out to late swing in the Ashes tests?” he asks. “Doesn’t seem to bother him against NZ.” It wasn’t so much late swing that did for Vince, but poor shot selection. He just kept throwing his hands at the thing. 43rd over: England 141-1 (Stoneman 57, Vince 68) Southee is just getting the old ball to tail a touch. For Vince, he has stuck two catching midwickets in. Vince plays out a maiden, mainly because his attacking strokes kept picking out fielders. 42nd over: England 141-1 (Stoneman 57, Vince 68) Suddenly, there are singles everywhere. Vince and Stoneman cover drive one each, the latter’s giving him his highest Test score. Vince’s ends the over with a flicked one to midwicket, and England’s lead is 170. 41st over: England 138-1 (Stoneman 56, Vince 66) Stoneman gets us moving by dabbing Southee to deep point for one. Vince doesn’t bother dabbing cuts, and he has a huge yahoo at one – and misses. Never mind, he’s just come down the track to a swinging ball and squeezed it to mid-on’s left for four. Shot. And then he cover-drives for two, then one. 40th over: England 130-1 (Stoneman 55, Vince 59) A brilliant piece of fielding from Henry Nicholls saves a run at the start of CdG’s new over. Vince pulls beautifully in front of square, and Nicholls sprints round to dive and cut it off. Stoneman ends the over with a cut for one. Zaph Mann’s been in touch. “OK I won’t stay silent so you know you’re in company,” he says (“thanks,” I respond.) “I’m having a work night (evaluating new music releases) and the pace of the OBO is the perfect accompaniment… so far Leicester’s Echolocation are IN, two LA bands are OUT - now listening to Racco - from Fremantle and Tasmania.” Fremantle is one of the great spots. Little Creatures! 39th over: England 126-1 (Stoneman 54, Vince 56) There’s Mark Stoneman’s half-century! He gets there a bit chancily, with an edge over the cordon for four. Never a chance, but Southee is not very happy and has plenty to say. That’s his fifth in Tests, and came from 121 balls. A nice drive to the man in the deep brings one, then Vince pinches the strike. 38th over: England 120-1 (Stoneman 49, Vince 55) Stoneman’s trying to pierce the gaps on the offside, and not making much progress off CdG. He nips an inside-edged single to leg, and that’s the over’s only run. 37th over: England 119-1 (Stoneman 48, Vince 55) Southee at the other end. And there’s a shout for a strangle against Vince! Has he got a tickle on this? Umpire says no, Kiwis say yes and review! He’s going to survive here – there’s nothing on HotSpot or Snicko. There was a noise, but it was Vince’s trousers I reckon. Anyway, it’s a maiden over. This is nice to know. There haven’t been many Tests at Hagley Oval. It’s new. Anyway, here’s the ground’s record page. Here’s the list of matches – all four won by chasing teams... 36th over: England 119-1 (Stoneman 48, Vince 55) Big Colin is round the wicket to Stoneman, who angles it through backward point for two. Well run. And now he’s edged low through the vacant slip area for four! To be fair, it wouldn’t have carried. Dropped! Stoneman’s been dropped on 48! He’s got a thick edge on a cut and Ross Taylor, stationed at thirdish slip, has got one hand to a very sharp chance but it’s popped out! A life. Colin de Grandhomme will get us going in the final session. 34 overs remain today. The action is moments away, but there’s time for this email from Jason Ali in Hong Kong. He’s got Alastair Cook in his sights. “The unavoidable question is what should England do with Alastair Cook?” he fumes. “The team needs him, like all of its players, to be regularly making a contribution. The occasional big score which then gives him a reprieve is no use to us. Test series are, generally, played over several matches and your team has, at the very least, to turn up for N-1 of them. Discuss.” If he wants to go, he has every right to. But there’s certainly no point in discarding 12,000 Test runs. There’s no one better, yet. The “occasional big score” is proving mammoth, and game-shaping. Don’t think there’s a single player in England’s team or any opposition that thinks England would be stronger without Cook. John Butler is endearingly easily pleased! “Enjoying following the cricket on a train in Tokyo,” he writes from, err, Tokyo. “111-1 off 33.3 overs brought on a chuckle.” Vince, then. He’s played nicely here, and has a brilliant chance to secure a spot and enhance England’s position in the game. Can he seize it? The sleep-deprived Simon McMahon is in my inbox. “Top of the morning/evening to you, Will,” he grins. “Having a 19 year old daughter certainly helps keep you awake at night, especially at weekends. Back at 3.15 tonight / this morning. So pretty early really. Very useful for England tours to New Zealand.” The England team would be very proud of your ability to take the positives, Simon. Would you too like to get in touch? Here’s how you can: By email: will.macpherson.freelance@theguardian.com On Twitter: @willis_macp 35th over: England 113-1 (Stoneman 42, Vince 55) The Barmies are making lots of noise because England are on Nelson, so Vince gets them off it with a push through cover off Sodhi. Stoneman cuts one and Vince leaves the last. And that’s the tea break. A good session for England. I’ll be back in a tick. 34th over: England 111-1 (Stoneman 41, Vince 54) Wagner’s bumping Stoneman again. He gets off strike, and Vince keeps pulling - this time just for one. Speaking of Wagner, Sachin Paul doesn’t rate the great man. Stoneman evades the rest of the over, which is the penultimate one before tea. “Wagner doesn’t do it for me,” he grumps. “You can’t have a bowler who bowls *only* bouncers. Yes, he’s likely to win you the odd match but you’re giving away the initiative by bowling such a predictable bowler. Williamson is losing the match through this spell.” Not sure about that. Wagner averages 27! 33rd over: England 109-1 (Stoneman 40, Vince 53) Stoneman turns Sodhi away for one, then Vince gropes at a big leggie outside off. He’s bowling nicely now. Just as I type that... he drags down horribly, and Vince pulls away for four to move to 49. And there’s his 50! With the signature stroke – a gorgeous cover drive. Well batted, but there’s plenty still to do. It’s taken 71 balls, and included nine lovely fours. 32nd over: England 100-1 (Stoneman 39, Vince 45) Field is set for Vince to pull Wagner, and he does! The bumper doesn’t get up and he pulls fine for four. Shot. There’s another bouncer next ball, and he pulls one. Stoneman will get more of the same. He gets under some bouncers, and also turns two fuller balls away through midwicket for two, then one. Tea is a couple of overs away. 31st over: England 92-1 (Stoneman 36, Vince 40) The batsmen trade singles off Sodhi. Vince turns one to leg off the googly; is Vince picking him? It’s not an outside edge! It’s taken Stoneman’s upper arm, with just the sleeve disturbed. 30th over: England 89-1 (Stoneman 35, Vince 38) Right, now we are talking. Wagner goes round the wicket to Stoneman, and bumps him. Short leg’s in there, and Stoneman turns one round the corner. Vince is bumped too and, with three men back, takes on the pull. He gets one to fine leg. Back over the wicket to Stoneman, with leg gully in now too, there’s an outside edge and Watling snaffles a low catch! The batsman reviews... 29th over: England 87-1 (Stoneman 34, Vince 37) Sodhi can make Stoneman’s life tough from round the wicket with those footmarks, but he overpitches and the leftie gets off strike. Vince wants to get after the leggie, and misses a big drive. One from it. 28th over: England 86-1 (Stoneman 33, Vince 37) Classic Wagner. Full or short. Stoneman is resistant, and takes a single – guided through backward point – off the final ball. 27th over: England 85-1 (Stoneman 32, Vince 37) Vince pinches a single to mid-off from Sodhi’s first ball, so the leggie goes round the wicket to Stoneman. One off the inside edge past short-leg follows. There are footmarks there. The trouble for New Zealand here is that England are just milking singles, with four coming from this over. 26th over: England 81-1 (Stoneman 30, Vince 35) I sense today’s final session will see one of those Wagner spells where he just chugs in for hours, and then a couple more overs for good measure. Stoneman is defensive here, and it’s a maiden. 25th over: England 81-1 (Stoneman 30, Vince 35) Vince is careful to Sodhi until, again, summoning a brainfade. He pulls hard, just short of the man at deep midwicket. They run one, then Stoneman gets a single too. Sodhi goes wide and floaty and Vince just nails one of those cover drives for four utterly gorgeous runs. Root, I reckon, will absolutely relish this situation. One of his swift 50-somethings would be very handy. 24th over: England 75-1 (Stoneman 29, Vince 30) Wagner’s back. Always a pleasure! The only run is a pulled single for Vince from the over’s last ball which, strangely, is the first proper bumper. Alex Butler’s been in touching with a “Hello from Qingdao, the home of Chinese beer!” “I was surprised,” he gasps, “to hear the suggestion that Cook may retire after this Test, considering the constant upheaval of our middle order and possible lack of alternatives as opener. I was excited as anyone when Hameed broke into the side but his county form hasn’t forced the selectors hand has it? With Stoneman still new and Vince for the chop wouldn’t stability, his valuable experience and familiar English conditions mean he should stay on a while?” I don’t think Cook is going anywhere. He will go back to Essex, prove that he is better than the alternatives (Hameed and Gubbins will, in time, be Test openers). Cook no longer has the great series of old in him, but the great innings are there. He’s got a few of them in him yet. 23rd over: England 74-1 (Stoneman 29, Vince 29) Sodhi drifts onto Stoneman’s pads and he takes one to deep midwicket. Vince is watchful, and picks the wrong’un before sending a half-tracker away for one to bring up the fifty partnership. It took 85 balls. Right now, Vince has 501 Test runs, and Stoneman 482 (from 10 Tests to Vince’s 13). 22nd over: England 72-1 (Stoneman 28, Vince 28) More from Big Colin. From round the wicket, he is looking to tempt Stoneman into a big drive – there are two catching covers and two gullies (no slip...). Stoneman drives past all these men for one, but it’s a no-ball. Vince defends the second effort under his nose. 21st over: England 70-1 (Stoneman 27, Vince 28) Nice start from Sodhi. Bit of drift and loop and Stoneman gets an inside edge for one past short leg. Vince defends a few under his nose and then, utterly maddeningly, premeditates a sweep, but there’s a legslip there! It bounces just before him. Vince makes up for it with two to leg to end the over. Good morning/afternoon/whatever. Will here, to guide you through the 49 overs that remain in the day. It’s been a superbly entertaining day while Rob was at the wheel, and I’m hoping for the same luck. Hagley, as ever, looks a picture. England are in pretty good nick. Their lead is 96, Stoneman and Vince have 26 each and a huge chance to bury some doubts. Time for some legspin. Ish Sodhi is having a bowl. Here’s a podcast with him. 20th over: England 67-1 (Stoneman 26, Vince 26) James Vince plays another lovely stroke, driving de Grandhomme through mid-on for four. He has raced to 26 from 32 balls. That’s drinks, and time for me to hand over to Will Macpherson for the rest of the day. Thanks, goodnight! 19th over: England 61-1 (Stoneman 26, Vince 20) If this innings goes well for England they will need to think of a declaration at some stage, though I suspect that won’t be a consideration until tomorrow. We’re about to reach the halfway point of the Test so there is plenty of time left, though the pitch is unlikely to deteriorate much. 18th over: England 60-1 (Stoneman 26, Vince 19) Stoneman back cuts de Grandhomme for four more. I would definitely give him another chance next summer - his Test career has been frustrating, with all those unfinished starts, but he has shown enough to suggest he can handle Test cricket. England lead by 89. “Regarding the inevitable conclusion of Cook’s career,” says Chris Wright. “What are your views on the merits of: a) retirement after the fact, with the match concluded, with no big send-off and guard of honour and all that; b) announcing retirement ahead of a home tour (or at least a final match) and thus getting to farewell your public but also perhaps creating extra pressure on yourself and the team through that tour?” I loved the modest dignity of Mike Atherton’s retirement in 2001, and much prefer that to the Steve Waugh-style farewell tour. But it’s easier said than done. I’m sure Cook will choose a), whenever the time comes. 17th over: England 56-1 (Stoneman 22, Vince 19) Neil Wagner is coming into the attack to replace Trent Boult (8-1-23-1). With the pitch flat and the ball not doing much, this could be a Neil Wagner sort of day. Vince greets him with another sweet cover drive for four. Jeez he looks so good. But we all know how this story ends. 16th over: England 52-1 (Stoneman 22, Vince 15) A beautiful, flowing cover from Stoneman races away for four. He has got his eye in once again, and will be desperate to avoid another nothing score. 15th over: England 48-1 (Stoneman 18, Vince 15) Boult continues to tempt Vince with full, wide deliveries. Vince resists those and pushes a straighter delivery for two. “Wotcha, Bob,” says Mac Millings. “I thought I would write to say how good Vince looks, although my main purpose is to see if he’s out by the time this gets to you.” 14th over: England 46-1 (Stoneman 18, Vince 13) Colin de Grandhomme replaces Tim Southee and has a huge LBW shout against Vince turned down. It was a very full delivery but looked like it was angling down the leg side. “Sometimes it is best to just stay inside and be old,” says Adam Hirst. “Just heard what sounded like a chase through the streets below, one car shooting repeatedly at another. Saturday night in Rio…” 13th over: England 45-1 (Stoneman 18, Vince 12) That’s nice from Stoneman, a confident cover drive for four off Boult. He looked a bit nervous before lunch but has been comfortable since then. 12th over: England 38-1 (Stoneman 11, Vince 12) Southee has an LBW shout caught in the throat after an inside edge from Stoneman. Then Vince, who has started assertively, cuts smoothly for four. He has 12 from seven balls. 11th over: England 34-1 (Stoneman 11, Vince 8) Boult angles one across Vince, who squirts it wide of the slip cordon for four. 10th over: England 29-1 (Stoneman 10, Vince 4) Cook has had such problems with left-arm quicks this winter. England’s next opponents are Pakistan, who have Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz, although India are unlikely to bring a left-arm quick for the five-Test series that follows. They do have Ravindra Jadeja, though. I agree with Nasser Hussain, who says Cook should give himself the summer and get some rhythm with Essex, but I’m not sure he will. “Hi Rob,” says Joe Maitland. “I’m writing from Mexico where I’m having the surreal experience of watching a series of small children swinging wildly at and missing a piñata. The comparison to the recent performances of England’s top order is too obvious to make, but I’ve had a couple of beers so I’ll make it anyway...” 9th over: England 28-1 (Stoneman 8, Vince 4) Cook was visibly annoyed when he got out, which is not something you see too often. I think he might decide to retire after this game. The new batsman Vince, who is probably playing his last Test innings, gets off the mark with a typically gorgeous extra-cover drive for four. Cook has gone! He’d started his innings really well but that’s irrelevant now. He felt indecisively outside off stump at a ball he could have left, and Watling took a nice tumbling catch. 8th over: England 23-0 (Cook 14, Stoneman 8) A short ball from Southee is spanked through midwicket for four by Cook, who then edges a flashing drive over the slips for four more. I think he deliberately went up and over with that shot. “Rabbits!” sniffs John Starbuck. “I too watched MOTD but then went to bed as the rum was making me tired. However, I woke up some time back as I’d forgotten to take my various medicines, so won’t leave it until daylight to check the OBO. Welcome to old age.” 7th over: England 15-0 (Cook 6, Stoneman 8) Cook, sent back by Stoneman, survives when Wagner’s throw whistles past the stumps. He might have been safe anyway. Cook and Stoneman look pretty comfortable at the moment. “Lunchtime shenanigans, guess where I am,” says Jo Beasley, sending a picture of BLOODY CHRISTCHURCH AND CRICKET AND PEOPLE HAVING FUN. I always wanted to go to New Zealand. I hate you all, and you can all bugger off. 6th over: England 14-0 (Cook 5, Stoneman 8) Southee starts after lunch. There hasn’t been much swing with this new ball, which is good news for England, and there are already signs that Southee is starting to pull his length back a touch. Stoneman gets up on his toes to time a lovely boundary through the covers. “Gorblimey, Aus/SA this morning and Eng/NZ tonight, you’re really putting in a shift, young Smyth,” says Robert Wilson. “Your dreams must be spectacular (your wistful demand for partygoers to write in was one of the saddest things I’ve ever read). Knockout stuff from Southee. Can you still love the game on doubletime? I hope you still have enough hope and cheer in your heart to concede that whatever ails cricket, this Kiwi team may well be the cure.” Absolutelzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. That mini-session wasn’t too fraught for England, with Cook looking encouragingly light-footed. There’s still plenty of work to do against this new-ball pair of Boult and Southee after lunch. See you in 30 minutes for the afternoon session. Meantime, here’s an old favourite. 5th over: England 7-0 (Cook 4, Stoneman 2) Boult bowls the last over before lunch. Stoneman, who looks a bit nervous, plays a loose back-foot force and is beaten on the inside. He gets off the mark with a couple off the final ball of the over - and that’s lunch. 4th over: England 4-0 (Cook 3, Stoneman 0) Stoneman is beaten, feeling tentatively at Southee. I would give him another chance even if he fails here, but there’s no guarantee that’s what will happen. You suspect that, in his head, he’s playing for his Test career. A maiden from Southee. 3rd over: England 4-0 (Cook 3, Stoneman 0) A quiet over. Cook is obviously determined to get forward as much as possible against the new ball, and so far he has looked good against his nemesis Boult. 2nd over: England 3-0 (Cook 3, Stoneman 0) Southee’s first ball is a good inswinger that Cook just manages to shovel to safety. His feet seem to be moving a bit better that in the first innings, though, and he gets forward to drive through extra cover for two. New Zealand might have to do without Neil Wagner for a while - he is off the field, presumably being assessed after that blow to the head from Broad. 1st over: England 1-0 (Cook 1, Stoneman 0) Boult starts with a good over, making Cook play at everything. Cook gets off the mark with a leading edge for a single. I have a feeling that, if Cook fails here, he might retire after the match. “Rob,” says Brian Withington. “Given the performances of the respective England and NZ upper orders and support bowlers, are we witnessing a new type of Test cricket: five-a-side?” Good call. Mind you, Brian Lara was playing one-a-side in Sri Lanka in 2001-02. Cook and Stoneman will face a tricky 15-minute spell before lunch. This game is beautifully poised. The pitch is not expected to deteriorate, so New Zealand will not fear a fourth-innings chase. Broad finally ends the nonsense. Boult top-edges a pull towards fine leg, where Malan takes a well judged catch despite looking straight into the sun. Broad ends with six for 54 and shares all 10 wickets with James Anderson. England have a lead of 29 and plenty to fear. 93rd over: New Zealand 278-9 (Wagner 24, Boult 16) The frustration continues when Boult mishits Wood just over the head of Broad at short mid-off. Trent Boult survives an appeal for a catch down the leg side off Wood. England decide to review on Bairstow’s recommendation, but replays show it missed the bat. 92nd over: New Zealand 276-9 (Wagner 22, Boult 15) There have been a few twists in this match already, and this last-wicket partnership has provided another. Boult chips Broad breezily down the ground for a couple to reduce the lead to 31. 91st over: New Zealand 273-9 (Wagner 22, Boult 13) Mark Wood replaces Jimmy Anderson, presumably with instructions to bowl full and straight. Boult carts him wide of mid-off for three more and then blasts an outrageous four through the covers. England’s lead has been trimmed to 34. I swear they are playing the theme from Jaws on the tannoy. “A lot of spring chickens emailing in tonight bemoaning turning 40 as excuse for a quiet evening in. It was my 60th last week so no prizes for guessing where I’m sipping my Malbec,” says Brian Withington. “Lovely to see a couple of veteran bowlers proving there is still life in the old dogs after a tough winter tour. In the words of Mickey Flanagan, Watling’s dismissal by Anderson was a clear case of ‘going out, out’.” 90th over: New Zealand 265-9 (Wagner 21, Boult 6) Wagner carves Broad for four more. This partnership is worth 28 - not exactly on a par with Dave Richardson and Paul Adams, who produced the most miserable 10th-wicket partnership in history, but still extremely handy in the context of the match and series. “In response to Martin Burley’s question on when daylight savings will occur on Easter Sunday again the answer is not in the foreseeable since NZ is switching daylight savings to the third Saturday in March from 2019,” says Kevin Burley. “Enjoy the opportunity while it lasts I say!” 89th over: New Zealand 259-9 (Wagner 15, Boult 6) Wagner edges Anderson for four over the slips and then top-edges a falling hook for six! Thirteen from the over, and Anderson is about to misplace his rag. “Perhaps England should face facts and change their order,” says Ian Copestake, “so that the walking wafters and edgers can be spared the new ball and open with Bairstow and Cook instead.” Enough of the cricket chat mate, what cocktail are you drinking? 88th over: New Zealand 246-9 (Wagner 2, Boult 6) Boult, skidding around the crease like a foal on roller skates, misses an almighty slap at a short ball from Broad. England have a useful lead of 63 but they certainly aren’t immune from defeat. The pessimist in me fears for England’s top order against the new ball. There is a lot pressure on Cook, Stoneman and Vince, any of whom might be about to play their last Test innings. “Lovely sunny day to be sitting on the embankment here in Christchurch,” says Martin Burley. “Just enough of a breeze. And I think it was very considerate of England to wait half an hour to get their first wickets of the day, since I imagine a few people would’ve arrived late due to an April Fool double bluff (“You’re saying the match is starting earlier because of daylight savings change? Nice try!”). Wonder how many years it’ll be until Easter Sunday plus April Fool’s Day plus the daylight savings change will next be in conjunction?” 87th over: New Zealand 243-9 (Wagner 1, Boult 4) That’s Anderson’s fourth wicket. He is in sensational form: in the last year he has taken 63 Test wickets at 18.58. Not bad for a 35-year-old. Anderson ends the fun and games with another good delivery. It was on a full length with just enough movement to beat Southee’s yahoo and send the middle stump flying. 86th over: New Zealand 239-8 (Southee 50, Wagner 1) Wagner visits the canvas after being hit by a beautiful bouncer from Broad. It jagged back off the seam and followed Wagner before ramming into his helmet. Wagner springs straight to his feet and tells Broad he’s fine, though the physio has come on to make sure. After a bit of treatment, including ice and painkillers, Wagner continues and fences another short ball wide of short leg for a single. That brings Southee back on strike, and he takes a single to bring up an impressive, menacing fifty from just 45 balls. 85th over: New Zealand 236-8 (Southee 48, Wagner 0) Southee top-edges an almighty pull stroke over the keeper’s head for four. England fans should not count a solitary chicken while he is still at the crease. 84th over: New Zealand 231-8 (Southee 43, Wagner 0) That was the last ball of the over. Anderson, Broad, Southee and Boult have shared all 18 wickets in this game. Broad gets his five-for! Sodhi fiddles outside off stump and edges straight through to Bairstow. That’s Broad’s first five-wicket haul since he flattened South Africa at Johannesburg a couple of years ago, and a reward for all the work he put in after the Ashes. 83rd over: New Zealand 231-7 (Southee 43, Sodhi 1) Southee edges Anderson wide of the slips for four and is then cut in half by a big nipbacker. Anderson is making it talk. Anderson has cleaned Watling up with a stunning delivery. It was a full-length outswinger that beat the outside edge and rammed into the stumps as Watling tried to flick to leg. That’s an absolute peach, and ends an admirable innings of 85 from Watling. 82nd over: New Zealand 226-6 (Watling 84, Southee 39) Stuart Broad shares the new ball and locates the fuller length that brought so much joy yesterday. Watling looks really solid in defence, however, and tucks the last delivery off the pads for a single. Good cricket from both gentlemen. “Evening Rob,” says Phil Sawyer. “Hang on. Gin and rum? Chris Green (75th over) mixes my kind of cocktails.” Ah, the dignity of middle age. Who needs a sophisticated Tom Collins when you can have a tumbler of Gum. 81st over: New Zealand 225-6 (Watling 83, Southee 39) James Anderson takes the second new ball and gets it to move straight away, beating Southee with a lovely outswinger. Southee responds with a thumping straight drive for four. Shot! This has been a scintillating innings, 39 from 36 balls. In the context of a slow-scoring, lowish-scoring Test, it’s been a gem. 80th over: New Zealand 219-6 (Watling 83, Southee 34) Watling edges Stokes wide of slip for four. These are useful runs for New Zealand and irritating for England, who could face a dose of the third-innings blues if they don’t wrap this innings up before lunch. The second new ball is due. “I’m not so much ‘on the town’, as I am ‘eating cheese and crackers and drinking red wine while watching Match of the Day and reading about cricket’,” boasts Matt Dony. “Young rock n roll Matt is disappointed in what he will become. You either die a hero, or live long enough to become the villain...” The dignity of middle age. 79th over: New Zealand 215-6 (Watling 79, Southee 34) Jack Leach comes on for one over before the second new ball. That’s an interesting decisioin from Joe Root, because Southee will surely go after him. And so he does, crashing a boundary down the ground off the second ball. Leach got a hand on it but it would have been a miraculous catch. “Morning/Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Does lying on your sofa half asleep with a can of warm beer and some peanuts count as being ‘out on the town’? If it’s after 10 o’clock in the evening, it does in my house.” 78th over: New Zealand 209-6 (Watling 78, Southee 29) Watling is a lovely, orthodox batsman, and defends immaculately throughout that over from Stokes. A maiden. “May I engage in bravado,” begins Ian Copestake, “and state that as someone well past 40 I am not in the least bit tired and this is only partially to do with the beverage being consumed and more with eating the peach of glorious weekend sporting banter.” 77th over: New Zealand 209-6 (Watling 77, Southee 29) There’s a bit of reverse swing for England, though I’m sure it won’t stop them taking the second new ball after 80 overs - not least because Southee is looking really dangerous. He ends the over with consecutive boundaries off Wood, smoking a full ball down the ground and clouting a pull through midwicket. 76th over: New Zealand 200-6 (Watling 77, Southee 21) Ben Stokes is going to bowl, so Anderson and Broad will be saved for the second new ball. Southee is a dangerous customer at No8 - an absurd 27 per cent of his Test runs have come from sixes. Right on cue, he smashes Stokes’ third ball of the day over midwicket for six. Stokes responds by beating the bat with the next two deliveries. 75th over: New Zealand 192-6 (Watling 77, Southee 13) Mark Wood has one ball remaining of his 18th over. It swings into Watling, who defends solidly. Next! “I had to respond to your request for people partying late at night in the UK,” says Chris Green. “As I’m approaching 40, I must admit I’m nearly ready for bed... but have indulged in a few fine glasses of gin and rum this evening. Happy Easter! This match seems a mite more finely balanced than the last. My friends have been muttering about Root the captain being ‘too soon’, but I think give him a chance - even if that chance takes five years to develop. What do you think?” Yes, it’s far too early to consider a change, not least because there are no alternatives. I think he’s done pretty well as captain, although I’m not sure it comes naturally. I’m sure he’ll be captain until at least the end of summer 2019, after which a lot of things may change in English cricket. “Morning Rob,” says Andy Bradshaw. “England to balls this up by bowling too short &amp; not at the stumps. Allow NZ to get within spitting distance &amp; then an almighty collapse by the joke that is our top order. It might seem a tad defeatist, but I have no confidence in this side at the moment. Still, happy sugar coma to everyone for the morrow.” An email! “It’d be some turnaround for Broad to get a five-fer today, and I doubt many bar himself would’ve predicted it,” says Guy Hornsby. “But I’d be cock-a-hoop if he did. This little series may be overshadowed by *other events* but it’s about more than sandpaper, and an England win would arrest a significant slide, and frankly, be a breath of fresh air in a winter tour that is more stale than Jimmy’s insoles.” Fantasy County Cricket Now, the folks who congregate below the line on our county blog have organised a Fantasy League for the upcoming season.

There have been a dozen or so in Tests, yet they have all occurred in two countries: England and South Africa. He might add New Zealand to the list in the next few days. A rejuvenated Broad and the marvellous James Anderson look like England’s best hope of drawing the series and ending their long run without a Test win overseas. Welcome to England’s future; it looks quite a look like their past. Broad’s first task is to complete his first five-for since he routed South Africa at Johannesburg in January 2016. He took four of the six wickets to fall yesterday, and looked somewhere near his rampaging best. New Zealand will resume on 192 for six, a deficit of 115, with the new ball due in 5.1 overs. There will be more twists, as there always are in mid-scoring Tests. But with Broad in this mood, England at least have a chance of victory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/31/west-ham-southampton-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T16:20:34Z","webTitle":"Marko Arnautovic double lifts West Ham and sinks Southampton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/31/west-ham-southampton-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/31/west-ham-southampton-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Marko Arnautovic double lifts West Ham and sinks Southampton","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"What a relief it was for the West Ham hierarchy that the only boos at the London Stadium floated out of the away end. There were no pitch invasions, no missiles thrown at the directors’ box. David Gold and David Sullivan were able to keep Sir Trevor Brooking company until the final whistle this time and if there was a hint of mutiny, it came from the Southampton fans who watched their bedraggled team sink closer towards the Championship on an afternoon when the hosts found a way to keep their bitter civil war hidden from their guests. Of course, it should be pointed out that Southampton did not even begin to flirt with the idea of testing the strength of West Ham’s truce. Mark Hughes’s side wilted in the face of some vintage East End defiance, collapsing in wretched fashion in the opening 45 minutes and wasting a fine opportunity to move out of the bottom three at the expense of their opponents. David Moyes could not have asked for a better response from his players. The mavericks in his team rose to the occasion, with Marko Arnautovic and João Mário tearing the visitors to shreds, and the victory moved them five points above Southampton, who are two behind 17th-placed Crystal Palace with seven matches left. One look around this unloved stadium was enough to revive memories of the pitch invasions and protests that marred the Burnley game. Stewards in bright yellow jackets lined the perimeter of the pitch, there was a sizeable police presence inside the ground and barriers below the directors’ box were intended to stop supporters from getting too close to Gold and Sullivan, West Ham’s unpopular owners. The operation added £60,000 to the security bill, which was footed by taxpayers, and amid all the focus on events in the stands it was almost possible to forget that a game of football was taking place. It began in a lively atmosphere, signalling the crowd’s determination to remain supportive, and West Ham tore into the early challenges, rattling Southampton with energetic pressing. Mark Hughes picked an attacking 4-4-2 for his first league game, with Charlie Austin fit enough to start up front for the first time since tearing a hamstring on 23 December, but Southampton’s lack of intensity in midfield and organisation in defence in the first half was startling. West Ham roared forward and took the lead when Mario Lemina cheaply lost possession in the 13th minute, allowing Cheikhou Kouyaté to charge down the right and find Mário, who controlled before walloping a brilliant shot past Alex McCarthy. Mário’s first goal since arriving on loan from Internazionale in January shocked the visitors. West Ham’s bench contained four players without a single Premier League start and Moyes could have done without an inconsolable Michail Antonio limping off in the ninth minute, especially with Andy Carroll, Manuel Lanzini and Javier Hernández already unavailable. Yet Southampton were too feeble to expose those weaknesses. Arnautovic had already spurned one glorious opportunity, screwing a shot wide after being released by Mark Noble, but the forward’s eighth goal of the season arrived in the 17th minute. The marking from Wesley Hoedt and Jack Stephens left much to be desired when Mário crossed from the right and although McCarthy saved Arnautovic’s initial header, the Austrian bundled in the rebound. Hughes looked disgusted on the touchline. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Lemina were overrun in midfield, Dusan Tadic and Nathon Redmond sunk into their shells on the flanks and Southampton’s fans greeted Jon Moss’s half-time whistle with jeers. In Southampton’s defence, perhaps it was simply their misfortune to be caught in the middle of Arnautovic’s feud with Hughes. Arnautovic enraged the former Stoke City manager when he inspired West Ham to a 3-0 victory over his old side in December and he was at it his cocky best here, scoring his second in added time with a spectacular volley. A deep cross from Arthur Masuaku, who impressed at left wing-back after returning from a six-match ban for spitting, hung in the air and Arnautovic’s vicious effort flew past McCarthy. Shane Long replaced Manolo Gabbiadini at half-time, but Southampton did nothing to test Joe Hart’s brittle confidence. The day passed off peacefully in the end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/31/stacey-dash-congress-campaign-clueless","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T15:40:28Z","webTitle":"Clueless star Stacey Dash drops run for office with 'plantation politics' lament","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/31/stacey-dash-congress-campaign-clueless","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/31/stacey-dash-congress-campaign-clueless","fields":{"headline":"Clueless star Stacey Dash drops run for office with 'plantation politics' lament","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The actor turned conservative commentator Stacey Dash ended her campaign for a southern California congressional seat on Friday, about a month after it began. The Clueless star said in a statement she believed the bitterness in politics and the rigors of campaigning and holding office would be detrimental to her family. “I believe we live under a system of ‘Plantation Politics’,” she said, using a word freighted with racial and historic meaning, “which offers people on the lower end of the economic spectrum little more than symbolic gestures instead of true political empowerment and improvement.” Dash, running as a Republican, faced long odds in the heavily Democratic 44th district, which includes part of Los Angeles, the city of Compton and other communities running south of downtown LA. Republicans account for only about 10% of voters in the district, which Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 presidential election with 83% of the vote. There was no Republican on the ballot in the November 2016 House contest, which the Democrat Nanette Barragan won. Speaking to the Guardian this month, Dash said she believed her political views had seen her blacklisted in Hollywood. “Because I’m black I’m supposed to therefore be a Democrat,” she said, “which is absurd. They’re supposed to be the party of tolerance. I don’t see any tolerance. I’ve made a choice to stand up for what I believe in and don’t think I should be condemned.” In the same piece, Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College, said Dash’s “chances of making a credible bid [were] about equal to [Donald] Trump’s chances of winning the Nobel prize in physics”. Dash co-starred with Alicia Silverstone in Clueless, a 1995 coming-of-age comedy.

He, of course, would say he never went away, but in Greece’s hurly-burly world of politics his is a name prone to triggering toxic reaction. Abroad, the shaven-headed economist is feted as the man who took on Europe’s establishment. At home, the former finance minister is seen, on both left and right, as a reckless incarnation of all that was wrong with Greece at the height of its struggle to remain in the eurozone. In Athens and Brussels, his confrontational style is still blamed for the price the debt-stricken country had to pay to be bailed out in the summer of 2015. Although his resignation now seems a long time ago, the sight of Varoufakis launching his own party in Greece has unleashed emotions that have run the gamut from enthusiasm to anger and disdain. Media reaction has been cool; so, too, has that of politicians. None of which seems to bother him in the least. “Nobody believes the systemic media in Greece, and they’re all bankrupt,” he told the Observer with typical defiance, days after announcing his new venture in a packed Athens theatre. “To those who say I cost the country, and I’ve heard €30bn, €86bn, €100bn and even €200bn… I say I cost exactly zero. The troika [of creditors] cost Greece two generations and continue to impose cost.” At 57, in his leather bomber jacket and boots, Varoufakis clearly relishes his anti-establishment role and believes the birth of his European Realistic Disobedience Front, AKA MeRA25, is not a moment too late. Greece, almost nine years after the eurozone crisis erupted, is still condemned to being a debtors’ colony, he says. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, and his once radical leftwing Syriza party, not only gave up the good fight; they signed up to the draconian austerity demands of Germany in exchange for a third bailout that has only exacerbated the nation’s plight. For Varoufakis, it was a huge political – and personal – betrayal. “I think Tsipras and his colleagues have seriously let themselves down. They are young people, and they have to walk the streets knowing that they have condemned this country to debt bondage for another 30 years,” he says. “I am probably the only one who did what they said they would do.” Bankruptcy and Greece’s battle to keep it at bay was the force that prompted the academic to go into politics in the first place. On Monday, it was still the force that propelled him on to the stage to announce MeRA25, founded with the express purpose of not only reclaiming democracy but stopping Greece’s inexorable slide into further debt serfdom and insolvency. In a political landscape that veers from the extreme left to the extreme right, Varoufakis believes there is room for impact. “Our target is the 1 million Greeks who don’t abstain from voting due to apathy but because they are highly politicised. It’s another unique phenomenon in this country.” Under the party’s programme, on day one banks would be nationalised and proposals advanced to radically reduce Athens’s staggering debt load – at about €320bn or 180% of GDP, by far the highest in the EU. “I wake up, and dream at night, of debt [relief]. It’s like being a prisoner of war. You have to try to escape. Our country is a debtors’ prison.” Part of the pan-European DiEM25, or Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, that he co-founded two years ago, this new grassroots alliance of leftwingers, progressives, feminists and greens already has a reported 7,000 members. DiEM25, which is active in seven countries “but spreading fast,” reportedly has more than 100,000 members and the endorsement of the likes of Naomi Klein and Noam Chomsky, the radical linguist who via video link on Monday described MeRA25 as “a beacon of hope in a troubled world”. But does Varoufakis mean trouble for Greece? After all, the new movement has set itself the not inconsiderable goal of dismantling Europe’s “toxic, class-oriented, powerless and discredited” establishment by 2025. At the height of the debt crisis, Varoufakis claimed the austerity measures Athens was being forced to apply were tantamount to “fiscal waterboarding”. Far from being anti-EU, or in favour of the bloc’s break-up, Varoufakis insists supporters want more of it. “We are radical Europeanists, we are in the EU but against this EU,” he says. “We are not proposing exit or disbandment. We are not recoiling into the bosom of the nation state. We want to see Europe democratised, not disintegrated.” The self-declared “erratic Marxist” has long argued that without reform, the continent is heading for trouble. Already the bloc has begun to breed monsters. The far right, xenophobia, racism are all in the ascendant. Stuck in its own Great Depression, Greece makes fertile ground for such malaise. “Europe must be saved from itself. If [Golden Dawn] hadn’t been such thugs,” he says referring to the nation’s own neo-Nazi party, “it would be 30%, not 10%, now.” MeRA 25 has been working behind the scenes for a year now. Its plan is to contest the European elections in May 2019, although Varoufakis acknowledges Tsipras may elect to call a general election before that. After almost a decade under international surveillance, Athens will exit its third international rescue programme – the biggest sovereign bailout in global financial history – in August. With his popularity compromised under the weight of enforcing measures he once vehemently opposed, Tsipras may opt to capitalise on the success of finally exiting the programme and economic oversight. “We have travelled the whole country and held rallies in all major towns,” says Varoufakis, adding that politicians are already expressing interest in jumping ship. Far from being saved, Varoufakis believes Greece’s future has been put on hold. If anything, he argues, it is in for an even tougher time because Europe has elected to tackle its debt problem by taking the “extend and pretend” approach of prolonging repayment timetables and condemning the country to decades of further austerity. More pension cuts and tax hikes loom, legislated by MPs at the behest of the EU and International Monetary Fund. Short of measures to stop the rot, Varoufakis quips that he sees Greece becoming another Kosovo, “with beautiful beaches, only it’s a protectorate emptied of its young people. Every month 15-20,000 young Greeks leave. Everywhere I go, I meet them.” At the University of Athens, where he has returned to his old teaching post, students line up to get references for menial jobs, he says. It’s outrageous, he counters, that the government should choose to “celebrate” what it calls an almost seven-point drop in unemployment when the uglier truth is that so many people are leaving the country for wealthier climes. Up close, Varoufakis is still all swagger and in chipper mood. But whether he can capitalise on Syriza’s losses is far from certain. At the last election – the first he contested as an MP – he won more votes than any other candidate on Syriza’s ticket. These days, Greeks have less appetite for confrontation. Forever the maverick, Varoufakis announces that he doesn’t really mind. He always has “a book on the boil” and, anyway, he never wanted to be a minister. “You have no idea what it is like to be on the receiving end of such toxicity,” he says, suddenly looking pained. “For me, personally, the worst thing that could happen is to go back to a parliament that is so distressing, unproductive and boring.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/01/shame-of-anitsemitism-on-left-has-long-malign-history","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T05:01:09Z","webTitle":"The shame of antisemitism on the left has a long, malign history | Philip Spencer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/01/shame-of-anitsemitism-on-left-has-long-malign-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/01/shame-of-anitsemitism-on-left-has-long-malign-history","fields":{"headline":"The shame of antisemitism on the left has a long, malign history","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"So, we’re back to the “Jewish Question”? The current antisemitism crisis on the left has not come out of nowhere. Instead, it has its roots in a tradition on the left itself, which, at best, has always had difficulty in responding swiftly to antisemitism and, at worst, excused or condoned, even promoted it. It is not, of course, the only tradition on the left, but unless we understand this history, we won’t get very far in resolving today’s crisis. We need, above all, to think about why some on the left have always seen Jews as a problem and why they have helped the idea of a “Jewish Question” to re-emerge with such potency. At root is the thought that if antisemitism exists, it must have something to do with how Jews supposedly behave. That supposed behaviour may be described in different ways – sometimes it has an economic character, sometimes a social one, sometimes a political one. But what is common is the idea that Jews are to blame for antisemitism and that to protest against them is understandable, or even necessary. This first became a serious problem on the left in the late 19th century, as antisemitism first became a political force in the modern world. Some on the left flirted with the response that there might be something progressive about antisemitism: that it was a kind of anti-capitalism, however crude, which could be harnessed to the socialist cause. They also thought that philosemitism was more of a problem, because it supposedly encouraged Jews to make too much of (or even fabricate) antisemitism and to resist assimilation. One criticism of this approach at the time was to call it the “socialism of fools”, a problematic formulation because it suggested that antisemitism was still some kind of socialism. As antisemitism was radicalised by the Nazis – it no longer being enough to exclude Jews when they should be wiped off the face of the Earth – this way of thinking made it difficult for too many on the left to prioritise solidarity with Jews. Neither the Social Democrats nor the Communists in Germany made opposition to antisemitism a major issue, nor did the Resistance across Europe. The fear was that to highlight the fight against antisemitism would alienate potential supporters. This is not to ignore some wonderful examples of solidarity, though the repeated invocations of Cable Street can give a misleading picture. The Communist party soon switched to loyally supporting the Hitler-Stalin pact, which effectively delivered large numbers of Jews up to the Nazis. When the Soviet Union was finally forced to fight the Nazis, the suffering of Jews was deliberately and repeatedly downplayed. But after the war, things got much worse. The Soviet Union not only suppressed knowledge of what had been done to Jews but launched its own vicious antisemitic project, one that would have culminated in another genocide had Stalin not died. This campaign matters because it was around this time that some key elements of today’s antisemitism on the left were first formulated. The charge laid against Jews then was that they were cosmopolitans and Zionists. This may seem like a bizarre contradiction: how can one, after all, be both a cosmopolitan and a Zionist? But what connected them is the idea that Jews are a problem, that as cosmopolitans they are more loyal to each other across national borders and, as Zionists, are loyal to another, foreign state. The charge of cosmopolitanism is heard less frequently these days, though one finds echoes of it in the idea that Jews are responsible for the evils of globalisation. The charge of Zionism, though, has now become absolutely central to today’s version of the “Jewish Question”. What began as a Stalinist cry was taken up in some on the New Left, which helped shape the world view of Jeremy Corbyn and many of his supporters. For both Stalinists and that part of the New Left, Zionism is a racist ideology that pits the interests of Jews against the interests of everyone else. Furthermore, the state of Israel is an integral part of the western imperialist power structure that exploits and oppresses the rest of the world and the Palestinians in particular, whose land Jews have plundered and colonised and whom they keep in a state of permanent subjugation. The Soviet Union formulated its approach within the context of the cold war, when it often appeared to support anti-colonial, national liberation struggles, although only for strategic reasons. Those on the left who (rightly if often too uncritically) supported those struggles, especially in Vietnam, where the Americans were so clearly the enemy, slipped fatally, however, into embracing this anti-Zionism into their world view, even though the Israel-Palestine conflict had such clearly different roots. At the same time, they found it unbearable to acknowledge what was glaringly obvious – that the establishment of the state of Israel was profoundly connected to the Holocaust, which had changed everything for Jews. To integrate anti-Zionism into an anti-imperialist, anti-western, anti-American world view therefore also meant either denying or (better) reinterpreting the Holocaust. Holocaust denial is not an accidental feature of today’s antisemitism, but it is more common to downplay what happened to Jews as Jews. So the Holocaust has to be thought about only in universal terms, as only one genocide among many and one that supposedly excludes the others. (Actually, of course, it is the other way around: thinking about the Holocaust helps people think about other genocides.) Indeed, some have gone further. Not content with accusing Israel of being like apartheid South Africa, it is supposedly guilty of genocide itself… against the Palestinians. If such purported behaviour makes people antisemitic, it is understandable and part of a fundamentally progressive view of the world, which can be harnessed to the cause. We are back then to where we started, with Jews as the problem, only with this difference: what was previously attributed to Jews inside nation states is now attributed to the Jewish state on the international stage. There has always been, though, another tradition on the left, which has never accepted the very idea of a “Jewish Question”. What it understands is that there is a question of antisemitism; that Jews are not responsible for antisemitism but antisemites are; that Jews are not a problem but antisemites are. Antisemitism is not something that should be excused or condoned. It has to be fought wherever it shows its face, even – and sadly now more than ever – when that face is on the left. • Philip Spencer is emeritus professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Kingston University and a visiting professor in politics at Birkbeck College.

Before being laid, bird eggs form a hard calcium-rich shell with three main layers. While it was already known that these thin from the innermost out as a chick grows in preparation for hatching – with calcium from the shell being incorporated into its skeleton in the process – quite what happens at the molecular scale has been something of a mystery. Now scientists say they have discovered that eggshells have a nanostructure, and that it appears to play a key role in the strength of the shell. “Everybody thinks eggshells are fragile – [when] we’re careful, we ‘walk on eggshells’ – but in fact, for their thinness they are extremely strong, harder than some metals,” said Prof Marc McKee, a coauthor of the study from McGill University in Canada. “We are really understanding now at the almost molecular scale how an eggshell is assembled and how it dissolves.” Writing in the journal Science Advances, McKee and colleagues describe how they probed the issue by focusing on the role of a protein known as osteopontin. This substance is found throughout the eggshell and was already thought to be important in organising the structure of its minerals. “Something as different as an eggshell and a tooth and a bone, they all have this protein,” said McKee. “We think it is proteins like that that help guide the mineralisation process to give these tissues their properties.” Using a number of microscopy techniques, as well as a cutting-edge method known as focused-ion beam for preparing thin sections of the eggshell, the team found that all of the layers appear to be formed from an array of tiny areas packed with a crystalline calcium-containing mineral. The team also found the areas are smaller and more closely arranged in the outer layer, with the nanostructure becoming larger towards the inner layers. Levels of osteopontin were found to be lowest in the innermost eggshell layer. “The third discovery was that the outside of the shell is harder as it has the smallest [nanostructure] and then you move inwards and it gets a little bit softer,” said McKee. The team say the upshot is that osteopontin seems to form a sort of scaffold that guides the arrangement of calcium-containing mineral, generating a nanostructure that affects the hardness of the eggshell layer. McKee says the theory is backed up by experiments in the lab. “If you don’t put in the protein in the test tube you get a big giant calcite [calcium carbonate] crystal like you’d find in a museum. If you throw in the protein, it slows the process down, it gets embedded inside that crystal and it generates a very similar nanostructure property in those synthetic crystals and they have increased hardness,” said McKee. Higher concentrations of osteopontin were found to produce a smaller nanostructure. The team then turned from the eggs that wind up on our breakfast tables to looking at the structure of chicken eggs that had been fertilised and incubated for 15 days. While the nanostructure of the outermost of the three eggshell layers remained unchanged, the nanostructure of the inner layers had become smaller in size. That, said McKee, is a result of calcium carbonate being dissolved in acidic conditions and used in the chick’s skeleton, and the process might be aided by the nanostructure increasing the surface area of the calcium-containing mineral. The upshot is that the shell weakens, allowing it to crack and the chick to hatch. While the role of other proteins in the structure of eggshell layers has yet to be unpicked, McKee said the latest findings could prove useful in the design of new human-made materials. “When you think about it, we should be making materials that are inspired by nature and by biology because, boy, it is really hard to beat hundreds of millions of years of evolution in perfecting something,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/02/social-media-ad-spend-to-overtake-tvs-in-spite-of-facebook-woes","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Social media ad spend to overtake TV's in spite of Facebook woes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/02/social-media-ad-spend-to-overtake-tvs-in-spite-of-facebook-woes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/02/social-media-ad-spend-to-overtake-tvs-in-spite-of-facebook-woes","fields":{"headline":"Social media ad spend to overtake TV's in spite of Facebook woes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More money will be spent advertising on social media networks than on the entire TV ad market within two years, according to a new report. The report predicts that Mark Zuckerberg will shake off any potential commercial impact from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, hoovering up more than four-fifths (84%, £2.76bn) of the predicted £3.3bn that will be spent on social media networks in the UK this year. Facebook is also expected to weather the wider threat of a boycott by the world’s two biggest advertisers - Dove to Lynx maker Unilever and Pampers to Gillette owner Procter &amp; Gamble - who say they have had enough of Facebook’s “swamp” of fake news, racism, sexism and extremism. By 2020, Facebook will be making an estimated £3.8bn in UK ad spend – over a billion pounds more than this year – and just behind the value of the entire commercial TV market (£4.04bn): led by ITV, Channel 4, Sky and Channel 5. A younger generation of digital-savvy consumers is fast emerging that has dramatically eroded the once unquestioned power of traditional television as the most important medium advertisers had to spend on in order to reach big audiences. In 2010, a peak audience of almost 19 million viewers tuned in to watch Matt Cardle win the X Factor, the biggest show on British TV, capturing more than half the entire audience watching TV across the UK at the time. Last year’s final saw the lowest ratings in the show’s history with less than 5 million tuning in to see Rak-Su win. By comparison Facebook has amassed more than 2 billion active users per month; its sheer scale the very reason advertisers direct so much digital ad spending its way. Such is Facebook’s power, advertisers believe they have little option but to spend with them in order to reach the digital-savvy audiences they crave to influence. Facebook’s scale dwarfs would-be rivals with Twitter and Snapchat estimated to be set to pull in less than £300m (8%) of social network advertising spending between them this year. The spend on traditional TV advertising will remain comfortably ahead at £4bn this year. Facebook is weathering a barrage of criticism over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the harvesting of information from more than 50m Facebook profiles to target US voters without permission, including calls for users to delete their profiles in protest. Analysts say there is little sign so far that a boycott of a size to commercially hurt the social network will take place. “The social media juggernaut shows no signs of slowing down commercially,” said Bill Fisher, UK senior analyst at eMarketer. “You have the Cambridge Analytica Facebook privacy issue and it is difficult to know right now whether it will have a fundamental impact on user numbers. Until we see significant numbers of users coming off we are not going to see any drop in ad revenues. Advertisers follow eyeballs and there are plenty of eyeballs on social media.” Emarketer’s report predicts growth in social media advertising will continue to surge, despite wider issues of potential advertiser boycotts over measurement, transparency and content issues such as fake news dogging Facebook. Growth in social media ad spend will rocket 40%, some £1.3bn, between 2018 and 2020 from £3.29bn to £4.59bn, the report predicts. By 2020, social media advertising will have passed traditional TV advertising by about £500m – £4.59bn compared to £4.04bn, it forecast. However, TV broadcasters are likely to increase revenuefrom their online TV services in the next few years, figures which are not covered by the eMarketer report. “It is a tipping point reflecting consumer trends,” said Fisher. “But the fact that more and more consumers are on social media does not diminish the importance of broadcast TV per se. The television industry is also pivoting to digital to a degree as well, building revenues from their own digital services. Broadcast TV is still an incredibly important medium. We are forecasting a slight rise in our report, it is just that social media is just becoming an even more significant number.” The report also shows that Facebook’s dominance over its rivals for social media advertising is likely to continue. Facebook’s 82.5% share of social media advertising in 2020 is predicted to be only marginally less than this year (84%). This means rivals Snapchat and Twitter, which are forecast to increase their ad take from £260m to £478m over the next three years, will not have made a meaningful dent in Facebook’s position. Overall, social media advertising spending is expected to grow from accounting for 25.4% of the total £12.98bn UK digital ad market this year, to just short of 30% of the £15.42bn market in 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/29/labour-focus-beating-tories-feuding-2022-election","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T12:10:18Z","webTitle":"Labour’s focus should be beating the Tories.

Today the person responsible for rooting out racism as chair of Labour’s internal disputes panel has resigned after her disgraceful support for a council candidate spreading Holocaust denial. But some on the left genuinely think all these accusations against them of antisemitism are just the latest weapons used by “Blairites” against Jeremy Corbyn and his circle. They are blinded to seeing how legitimate rage against the Israeli government and support for Palestinians leaches into the same anti-Jewish racist passions of, say, Hamas. Trying to rescue Labour’s credibility from Corbyn’s too-little-too-late apology had Labour MPs out demonstrating with Jewish groups – and now they get threats of deselection. The Labour leader in Barnet expresses alarm at the damage done, fearing loss of north London Jewish votes risks Labour’s chance to seize this exceptionally rightwing Tory council in May. John McDonnell on Thursday morning tried hard to cauterise the wound. “We will deal with it firmly and severely,” he told the BBC’s Today programme. “We will eradicate it from our party.” Let’s assume that happens and that any future outbreak is stamped on so harshly by Labour’s new general secretary that it never happens again. But for now the great political cleft in Labour just yawned wider. What’s to be done? When Corbyn outshone expectations at the general election, the leadership question was killed stone dead. He will lead in 2022: under the Fixed-Term Parliament Act, this government can lose any number of votes and still not fall before then. There is no knowing who the next Tory leader will be – the fruitcake, the narcissist or some plausibly sensible face? Will we be out of the EU or still in transition – and if so to where? Wise commentators have thrown away their crystal balls. The one certainty is that Corbyn will be leader, with unshakeable membership support. He will again take on the worst Tory government in living memory, whose Euro-madness has inflicted irrecoverable damage on future generations, whose austerity has impoverished millions, stolen life-chances from children and wrecked public services. Those worrying about Corbyn’s ability to govern, the weakness of his team, the lack of gritty detail backing up radical policies should never forget the appalling prospect of a newly invigorated Tory government in power until 2027. The only course for every Labour MP is all-out assault on this government. And since the election, so most have done. Labour’s chairs of select committees have been exceptionally good at holding May to account: Yvette Cooper at home affairs, Rachel Reeves at business, Hilary Benn at Brexit, Frank Field at work and pensions, Meg Hillier at public accounts. These non-Corbynites can’t be accused of slacking in exposing government failure. They are daily reminders of Labour’s depth of brain, energy and experience. Now Corbyn has control of every powerbase within the party, he and his coterie should reject the ceaseless search for enemies within, from those such as Skwawkbox, and open up his small group of the faithful. Widening out to embrace the breadth of his own party would bring in the voters Labour needs. Are they alarmed enough that Labour still only level pegs with this exceptionally inept government? As for the other side, extreme outriders such as John Woodcock do real harm, along with a handful of Labour people who might prefer the party to lose than Corbyn to win. Owen Smith was right on substance – on the single market and an option for a public vote on the deal – but his stand was mistimed. Why now, as Labour inches forward in the right direction? McDonnell again today reinforced Labour’s Brexit line, after Emily Thornberry’s misinterpreted throw-away remark: Labour sticks to Keir Starmer’s six strict tests. Since none of them can be met by May’s spilt party, not the Irish border, nor “the exact same benefits” of customs union and single market, Labour will vote against the government on every Brexit issue. Never has an opposition been in such a strong position to rescue the country from a government’s disastrous errors. For both sides of the Labour party there is no alternative but cohesion. Can they do it? If Corbyn keeps leading from inside a tiny group of the like-minded, Labour will fail to win the wider votes it needs. All distractions from that goal are a dereliction of duty. The worst accusation against either side would be that they preferred fighting internal wars to confronting the real threat to the country on the opposite side of the house. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/31/phantom-withdrawal-nationwide-atm-liverpool-cash-machine-error-message","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Data expert battles Nationwide after phantom withdrawal from ATM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/31/phantom-withdrawal-nationwide-atm-liverpool-cash-machine-error-message","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/31/phantom-withdrawal-nationwide-atm-liverpool-cash-machine-error-message","fields":{"headline":"Data expert battles Nationwide after phantom withdrawal from ATM","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An IT data expert claims Nationwide staff effectively accused him of trying to defraud the building society following a routine £300 cash machine withdrawal that failed to produce his money. Steve McQueen, whose previous work for Cheshire police and other organisations required him to pass GCHQ security vetting and to sign the Official Secrets Act, says the building society has refused to refund him after the failed withdrawal in Liverpool last month. McQueen, a Nationwide customer for more than 30 years who says he has never had cause to complain about a withdrawal before, used his debit card at a Santander ATM in the city’s main shopping precinct. He says he inputted his pin but, instead of producing his cash and receipt, the machine displayed a transaction error and nothing came out. Thinking the transaction had simply failed, he took £200 out of a Lloyds ATM just along the street. But when he later looked at his statement, both transactions had been debited from his account. Despite a spate of attacks on ATMs by criminal gangs across the north-west in recent years, Santander has told Nationwide that a thorough check of the ATM and its records had shown up no discrepancies. “Therefore I regret that no adjustment (refund) can be made to your account,” Nationwide told McQueen, who lives in Prescot, Merseyside. He went back to the building society, pointing out that there must have been some mistake and suggesting that the error code must have been logged, but he was rebuffed again. Nationwide, he says, has denied his refund on the basis that his money had left the ATM and was not held at the end of the day, as happens if a customer fails to take their cash and it is retained. “In a long phone call from Nationwide, I was effectively accused of trying to defraud it,” says McQueen. “I pointed out that I used to work in high-level IT security and for the police, but to no avail. I can’t understand why there isn’t camera footage of the incident, but no one appears willing or able to access it. I have been treated shabbily.” The explanation could be that a criminal had attached a device to the ATM to prevent the money being dispensed. This is a problem that has afflicted Santander ATMs in the area in the past. In 2016, police warned people in Lancashire and Wilmslow, Cheshire, not to use Santander cash machines over fears they had been compromised. Officers were concerned that criminals had fitted a false front or other device to ATM machines to prevent the cash leaving them. Santander shut down five affected ATMs at the time. In August 2017, police in Liverpool arrested a gang armed with a crude “cash trap device” that they were allegedly using to rob a cashpoint at a Merseyside petrol station. Nationwide told Guardian Money that only Santander had the CCTV footage of the incident, which it had not passed on. “We have asked Santander to double-check that no device has subsequently been detected on the ATM. We will review the claim and update the customer once we receive the outcome of this request,” says a spokeswoman. Santander adds: “This ATM was replaced a couple of years ago with one of our new models, which comes with security measures that make it difficult for criminals to fit a cash-trapping device. We have no record of any installation of a cash-trapping device at any of these new ATMs.” It says its CCTV cameras are not pointed directly at the ATM “to ensure customer privacy of pin numbers is maintained”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/08/tomorrow-will-be-different-sarah-mcbride-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-08T07:59:24Z","webTitle":"Tomorrow Will Be Different by Sarah McBride review – passionate advocate for trans equality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/08/tomorrow-will-be-different-sarah-mcbride-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/08/tomorrow-will-be-different-sarah-mcbride-review","fields":{"headline":"Tomorrow Will Be Different by Sarah McBride review – passionate advocate for trans equality","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"At times, reading Sarah McBride’s account of her first years in politics as an advocate for trans equalities, one is forced to realise how foreign a country the United States is, particularly in the endless moral optimism that bubbles through every page. Yet the agendas of trans advocacy in both the US and UK remain the same: basic respect, often in the face of cynical misrepresentation and open hatred. The infectious enthusiasm of McBride’s approach shames hardened hacks in the movement here, perhaps because the battle lines in the US are so clear, whereas in the UK much of the constant attempt to take away even those rights that have been gained comes from people who describe themselves as feminists and progressives yet never pause to ask why they are getting so much support from the rightwing press. Another area of difference is in the way the US political mainstream embraces – some would say makes use of – the young. McBride was engaged in politics long before she transitioned, working on the Democrat campaign for the governorship of Delaware. She went on to be student body president at her university, where she was so popular that, at the end of her term, her announcement of her transition to an openly female identity passed off fairly undramatically and with huge support from her peers. She then proceeded to an internship in the Obama White House. Even before she transitioned, there was a sense that she was a future star simply because of that passion and this was in no way diminished by her coming out. Much of the core of the book is a detailed account of how Delaware passed a trans anti-discrimination bill in the face of hostile lobbying by the misleadingly named Family Research Council and the occasional obtuseness of local politicians. For anyone who has ever been involved in politics, this is genuinely thrilling. It captures that sense of having to keep an eye on everything and everyone, of needing to keep your own people on side and perpetually counting the likely votes, of watching out for supposedly helpful amendments that would actually sabotage everything you are working for. The chapter is paced like a thriller, as well it might be. In all of this, she was backed by her parents and her political mentor, Governor Jack Markell, but her principal partner was the love of her life – a young trans man she had met during her internship, Andy Cray. They dated, worked together, started to plan their future and their political careers, and then he contracted aggressive cancer from which he died four days after they got married. This part of McBride’s story is hard to read. She manages to talk about love and death without being mawkish, partly because she is aware of how like the Hollywood version of her life her account inevitably has to be. It’s a salutary reminder of how much sentimental cliches overlap with everyday experiences. Her utter lack of cynicism serves her well. She carries on campaigning, because it is what her late husband would have wanted her to do. In the presidential election of 2016, she knows what is at stake for the trans community – Republicans were promoting “bathroom bills” aimed at making it impossible for trans people to function in society because they’d be unable to use lavatories that tally with their identities. Trump was already indicating that trans people were one of the groups whose progress he was keen to roll back. McBride, at 25, accordingly became the first open trans woman to speak as a delegate at a major political convention. This is a good book in all sort of ways but it is clearly a campaign biography aimed at whatever her next step turns out to be, as well as promoting an embattled community’s rights. Its introduction by Joe Biden feels like an anointing, one she has earned by hard work, passion and her survival in the face of bad luck. What can we learn from her? Probably that social media clicktivism and even journalism are no substitute for political lobbying. If there’s a weakness here, it’s that McBride is a classic tall poppy who speaks a lot about the trans community without being especially engaged with it – she has much to say about talking to trans kids, about the future, less about long, boring arguments on committees for trans housing and health provision. That last may be a little churlish – this is a fascinating look at how progress gets made and the charm and passion that turn an American into a candidate.

Put chops under grill, looked in cookery book for a recipe for gravy. Made gravy. Strained lumps out with a colander. Set table, served dinner, washed up. Put burnt saucepans in to soak.

The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue Townsend. --- This morning, it was drizzling as I walked to work. I arrived with raindrops trickling down inside my collar and dripping from my hair into my eyes. When I shrugged back into my coat this evening, 10 hours later, it was still cold, and slightly damp. It’s almost April, and we’d be forgiven for expecting that spring should have arrived in earnest. Instead, it’s likely we’ll see snow again this weekend. Selfishly, I’m thrilled; I missed most of winter this year, and this type of weather provides the perfect excuse for an evening of hibernation. So tonight, I ducked out of the work drinks I’d hoped to attend, and walked a winding route back to the station, listening to Adrian Mole’s teenage diaries on audiobook. I read them when I was around his age – a young teenager – and have never tired of them; this first book in particular has provided endless comfort and amusement. You probably don’t need me to tell you, but it’s laugh-out-loud funny, packed with perfectly drawn characters, and genuinely moving in parts, too. It is also filled with references to food: school dinners, a failed attempt at coq au vin, Sunday lunches, a warming slice of dripping toast. But I latched on to a passing mention of crumble – it’s the perfect dish for a cold night in. The apples bubbled away in the oven while I stirred custard and listened to more of Adrian’s trials and tribulations. And then, late at night, I dished it up for some friends who had just arrived back; I can’t think of a more comforting dish to come home to. The ingredients are mostly humble, and probably available in your local corner shop. You can buy the custard, if you prefer, or make it according to the directions on a tin of Bird’s. You can add other fruit, if you like – rhubarb, of course, or a handful of berries, or some pears. Change up the spicing, if nutmeg isn’t your bag (cinnamon is good, as is cardamom, or ginger), or add chopped nuts to your crumble mix, if you fancy. You can even store the mix in your freezer, like my dear friend Liv taught me to do, in anticipation of a crumble emergency. There are so few rules here; it really is the easiest possible version of baking. This is comfort food, and comfort cooking, at its most reassuring: just what I needed this week. Apple crumble and custard Serves up to 6 (but 3 or 4 could easily polish it off) Ingredients Crumble 1.25kg cooking apples 150g light brown sugar ¼tsp nutmeg 200g plain flour 150g salted butter 50g porridge oats Custard 150ml whole milk 150ml double cream 3 egg yolks 50g light brown sugar ¼tsp vanilla bean paste/vanilla extract Equipment Vegetable peeler Knife Saucepan Wooden spoon Mixing bowl Ovenproof dish Whisk Preheat the oven to 180C (160C fan). Peel, core and chop the apples, and tip them into the saucepan with 75g of the sugar, and a splash of water. Simmer until the chunks of apple have softened and are starting to break down. Turn off the heat and season with nutmeg. Meanwhile, rub the flour and butter together with you fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs. Mix in the other 75g of sugar and the oats, and set aside. Tip the apples into the oven dish, and then wet your hands with cold water. With damp hands, squeeze handfuls of crumble together (to encourage them to clump a bit) and drop it on to the apples. Transfer to the oven for 25 minutes, until golden brown on top. While the crumble bakes, make your custard. Warm the milk and cream in the saucepan, until small bubbles start to appear at the sides of the pan. Whisk the egg yolks, sugar and vanilla together until light, and then pour the warm milk over them, whisking constantly. Pour the custard back into the washed-out pan, and stir over a low heat for at least 15 minutes, until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Serve big spoonfuls of crumble with a generous pour of custard. Any leftovers are delicious cold for breakfast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/29/brexit-good-left-progressive","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T13:05:54Z","webTitle":"Brexit can be harnessed for good.

The left hasn’t realised this yet","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The one-year anniversary of the triggering of Brexit means many are marking Britain’s progress – and the results are not good. A new Survation poll for the GMB trade union shows that only 15% think the government is handling the Brexit process well, while more than three times that number (48%) think they are handling it badly. This is not surprising given the multiple climbdowns, public squabbles and diplomatic blunders. It is easy to deride the Conservatives’ shambolic approach, but the truth is the progressive left are also lacking clarity on what we want from Brexit. By being in Brexit denial we are unwittingly ceding ground to a vision of Brexit that will only worsen the inequalities and prejudices that led to Brexit in the first place. Over the past year, we at the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class) have been holding seminars and speaking to progressive economists about how we get a Brexit that tackles inequality. It’s been a difficult task – mainly because most see a “progressive Brexit” as an oxymoron, arguing that Brexit in its very nature is not progressive. This is a fair position, especially when you consider the conversation on immigration during the referendum campaign that descended into xenophobic posters and scaremongering. Furthermore, the likely negative impacts on economic growth if new trade tariffs and non-tariff barriers are imposed means that there is a real risk of further reductions in funding for public services. This line of thinking leaves us desperately firefighting across issues from workers’ rights to chlorine chicken with the aim of mitigating the worst impacts. As such, we lack a broader vision of post-Brexit Britain. We have spent a large part of the last year arguing about customs union and single market membership. Of course, these are important distinctions with very different consequences, but our focus on this debate shows we are constantly fighting against change rather than demanding positive actions. As such, we appear to be wagging our fingers and wanting to protect the status quo. This ignores the fact that things weren’t good before the Brexit vote. The result is we are leaving the space wide open for a low-tax, low-regulation and immigrant-bashing post-Brexit Britain. If we don’t have a plan, we will have no choice but to follow their plan. I know that many of my pro-European friends may not appreciate me writing this. Recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica have renewed hopes that Brexit can be stopped. But the stakes are too high to put all our eggs in the “reversing Brexit” basket, and in any case this could turn very nasty, potentially leading to revolt across the country from those who voted to leave. Inequality is predicted to soar at a rate not seen since the Thatcher era, and regional inequalities are also forecast to worsen. A recent report from the Women’s Budget Group found that Brexit will adversely affect women, meaning a double austerity and Brexit effect. On issues such as immigration, there have been campaigns for the rights of EU citizens, but we have failed to mobilise around a pro-migration narrative that seeks to level up opportunities and rights for non-EU citizens. On trade, we need to make sure we know what a progressive trade deal looks like, and on tax we cannot be content with a commitment to change nothing. We have to go bigger and bolder. This is particularly true when it comes to regional investment. There is a strong case for rebalancing our economy sectorally and regionally, given concerns about employment as well as about attracting new business and investment in the post-Brexit era. Ending our ideological commitment to lowering public spending and borrowing is more important than ever. Plans such as that in last year’s Labour manifesto to borrow £250bn for a national transformation fund to invest around the country through regional investment banks makes even more sense as we seek to find ways through the storm. In light of Brexit we should also be reviewing policies such as cuts to benefits and tax credits. If more people are going to at least temporarily find themselves out of work or facing higher inflation, these already punitive policies will punish this group yet again. We cannot sleepwalk into a post-Brexit Britain that is even more cruel to our most vulnerable. So here is my plea: it’s time to move beyond binary positions. That doesn’t mean you’re supporting Brexit, but rather recognising a thirst for something new. If Brexit helps us make the case for things we wanted anyway, then why not use it for good? Undoubtedly some with still prefer to work on cancelling Brexit all together, but I hope more people will admit we at least need a fully worked-up plan B. Otherwise we’ll end up wasting a good crisis. • Faiza Shaheen is the director of the Centre for Labour and Social Studies.

Brat Camp, Jamie’s Dream School, The World’s Strictest Parents, That’ll Teach ’Em, they have all tried it. In this one, five delinquent Brits are sent to the Doon School in Dehradun, often called India’s Eton, to get some GCSEs. At the moment, they have one between them – 18-year-old Jack’s C in maths. Which is more than they have in terms of ambition, focus, belief, motivation and application. The show attempts to give itself credibility by being inspired by a couple of stats: the worst performing group in British education is white working-class boys, and they perform better in ethnically diverse classrooms. But it is really about tossing a bunch of lazy teens way out of their comfort zone, and hoping for amusing cultural differences, tears, tantrums, entertaining bad behaviour and maybe some positive results as well. And it pretty much delivers on all of the above. They will be in for a considerable number of cultural shocks, says 16-year-old Doon boy Amal. The shocks start on the way from the airport – crazy traffic, cows in the road, a man with pebbles on his head. Then, at the school, there is no loo paper and there is snitching. Jake has brought a bottle of rum and Kanav grasses him up. Jake’s in trouble, already. And in a reading comprehension test, to the question “What helps Maggie get to sleep?” Jake writes: “Xanax and pint”. Ha, quite funny … No! Not funny. Go and see the head teacher now, Jake. Seventeen-year-old Ethan from south Wales, who will be transitioning when he is a bit older, has not been to any school for two years. The strict rules, traditional values and respect for teachers at the Doon School don’t sit easily with him. The British headteacher, Matthew Raggett, allows him to skip the mandatory short back and sides, accepting that long hair is part of Ethan, but the nail extensions have to go. And it is not long before Ethan is skipping classes and threatening to storm off. It’s not all bad though. Alfie, 17, gets into a bit of Hindi. Jack does well in Mrs Bhattacharya’s English classes. He needs English GCSE to pursue his dream of being a chef. Jake does well at pottery. There might be some positive results, journeys, even a few GCSEs at the end of this. Obviously not every English kid who is doing badly can swan off to an elite and very expensive Indian boarding school: this is an experiment rather than any kind of solution, but there might be some lessons learned along the way. Plus, it is amusing TV, taps into its (our) obsession with school, class and race. And, of course, it’s not all down to school – what’s going on at home is quite important, too. There is a telling moment when Harry, 17, is on the phone to his mum, and he is telling her it is going well, the lessons are proper good. But she is straight in asking if he’s behaving himself. She finds out about the rum incident with Jake and starts yelling at Harry: it’s all negative, no encouragement. Here is a new TV idea: Parents’ School. It doesn’t even have to be in India. I wouldn’t just watch it, I’d go. In The Long Run (Sky 1) doesn’t just star Idris Elba – it’s his baby, loosely based on his childhood growing up in east London in the 80s. He plays Walter, who came to London from Sierra Leone 13 years ago, living a quiet family life with his wife Agnes (Madeline Appiah) and son Kobna (Sammy Kamara) until his party-loving, DJ-ing brother Valentine (Jimmy Akingbola) flies in from West Africa. The subject matter – immigrant family living in mixed working-class community in the capital in the 80s while Brixton burns on the telly – is more interesting than the comedy, which could have come from the 80s, too. One liners, a bit of wordplay (Paris/Powys), more amusing cultural difference and misunderstanding … there isn’t a laughter track, but there might have been, if you know what I mean. Sit’s better than the com, in other words. It’s good natured, though. There are a few chuckles, nice performances, and a lovely nostalgic soundtrack – the Jam, the Beat, Junior Murvin, Toots, plus a stack of West African highlife records Valentine brought over with him. I like the Singing Boy, too, singing out over London from his tower block."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/29/ft-editor-appointed-new-chair-of-tate-galleries","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T15:43:53Z","webTitle":"FT editor appointed new chair of Tate galleries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/29/ft-editor-appointed-new-chair-of-tate-galleries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/29/ft-editor-appointed-new-chair-of-tate-galleries","fields":{"headline":"FT editor appointed new chair of Tate galleries","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Tate has appointed Lionel Barber, the editor of the Financial Times, as its new chairman, one of the most prestigious positions in the arts. It is an unpaid role which, despite raised eyebrows in media circles over his demanding day job, is nominally supposed to take up one day a week. He takes over at a time of major change at the group of galleries, which together are one of the world’s most successful arts institutions, with relatively new or incoming directors at all four branches, and the ending of its increasingly controversial 26-year sponsorship by BP oil. “I am honoured to accept the position of chair of Tate, one of the world’s leading cultural institutions,” Barber said. “I look forward to working with Tate’s trustees, Maria Balshaw [the Tate’s director], and her fellow directors to bring art in all its aspects to an ever bigger and diverse audience.” Barber had been acting chair since Lord Browne left last summer, after 10 years in the post, to take over as chair of the Courtauld Institute. His own paper, the Financial Times, contradicted the gleeful media gossip [paywall] that Barber had been leading the hunt for a new chair before concluding that he himself was the most suitable candidate. He did recruit Roland Rudd, the chairman of the financial PR firm Finsbury and a former FT journalist, to fill the vacancy among the trustees left by Lord Browne. Rudd was tipped to become Tate chairman, but once Barber emerged as the frontrunner for the top post, that selection process was taken over by another trustee, Tim Davie. The board of trustees chooses the chair from among their number, but the announcement by the Tate was delayed because the gallery had to wait for the government to confirm that Barber’s term as a trustee, due to run out later this year after seven years, had been extended until 2021. The trustees will be advising on filling the corporate sponsorship gap left by the ending of BP funding three months ago. The sponsorship by the oil giant, which also backs exhibitions at the British Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, has become bitterly controversial in recent years. It has sparked pickets of major exhibitions and demonstrations, including climate change messages written in charcoal on the floor of Tate Modern’s giant Turbine Hall, as well as a demonstration on the anniversary of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster by a naked oil-drenched activist at Tate Britain. In March 2016, the oil firm announced the ending of Tate sponsorship from the end of 2017, citing the “challenging business environment”, and insisting that the demonstrations had nothing to do with the decision. The London Evening Standard, edited by the former chancellor George Osborne, ran a particularly acid piece claiming that Barber’s imminent appointment had caused shock at both the FT and the Tate, over a perceived conflict of interest between editorial independence and corporate fundraising. Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator, tweeted: “I’d love to have been there when this diary item was pitched in editorial conference.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/09/jobcentres-sanctioning-refugees-for-learning-english-watchdog-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-09T13:42:20Z","webTitle":"Jobcentres sanctioning refugees for learning English, watchdog finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/jobcentres-sanctioning-refugees-for-learning-english-watchdog-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/09/jobcentres-sanctioning-refugees-for-learning-english-watchdog-finds","fields":{"headline":"Jobcentres sanctioning refugees for learning English, watchdog finds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Families who fled war in Syria are being wrongly sanctioned by jobcentres for attending English-language courses, the chief inspector of borders and immigration has said in a report critical of the Home Office. David Bolt said recently arrived refugees faced “substantial barriers” to finding work and some had had welfare payments stopped while trying to learn English. His report to the home secretary also said Home Office policy meant “particularly vulnerable” pregnant women were giving birth in refugee camps instead of in the UK despite being safe to fly. Bolt said the vulnerable person resettlement scheme (VPRS), which aims to take in 20,000 refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict by 2020, was “essentially effective”. However, he criticised the Home Office’s lack of strategic oversight once refugees arrived in the UK, and accused it of appearing “closed to the idea that there is any room for improvement”. Inspectors found it was default Home Office policy to “pause” all cases involving pregnancy until the child was born, “even when there was no indication of any risk and the woman was in the ‘fit to fly’ timescale”. The Home Office said its policy on pregnant women was to avoid arranging accommodation in Britain where there was a risk the person would not travel for any reason, but it would emphasise to caseworkers that there “should not be an automatic assumption that they should not travel”. The inspection also found jobcentre staff had not been given specific guidance or training on how to deal with refugees resettled under the VPRS, which has so far taken in more than half of the 20,000 target. The absence of clear guidance meant some refugees had been sanctioned while undertaking English-language tuition rather than seeking work, the report said, and others had been refused applications for personal independence payments or disability living allowance. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: “If someone has arranged with their work coach to undertake activity that improves their chances of getting a job, such as English-language lessons, then they wouldn’t be sanctioned for doing this.” The report said refugees were given only a two-day “cultural orientation” workshop to prepare them for life in Britain, despite waiting an average of nine months between being accepted on to the scheme and moving to the UK. Inspectors described this as “too little, too late,” especially for those unable to speak a word of English, and said Home Office officials had resisted calls from the International Organisation for Migration to extend the workshops beyond two days. In its formal response to the inspection, the Home Office said it was pleased that the report had acknowledged positive elements of the scheme and said some of the recommendations were already being implemented. However, Bolt described the Home Office’s response as disappointing because, he said, it “commits to few if any actions. As such, it appears closed to the idea that there is any room for improvement.” A Home Office spokesman said it was undertaking a “comprehensive review” of the scheme and that it was not complacent about the need to improve. The report said only 2% of the working-age men and women that had arrived in Britain under the scheme up to spring 2017 had found paid work. It cited the lack of English as the greatest barrier to employment. ‘It’s beautiful here’: Syrians settling in Coventry In Coventry, about 400 Syrians have arrived under the VPRS since 2014. On a cold, wet morning in March, a group of 20 men, women and children gathered around a table in the city’s central library as an Arabic interpreter repeated the words of council workers. The families had arrived at Birmingham airport on a Home Office-chartered flight a fortnight earlier. The adults are among 50 refugees in the city who have signed up to a specialist training and employment programme (Step) run by the charity World Jewish Relief, initially in West Yorkshire, and part-funded by the Home Office. The morning class was akin to their first day at school – but in a strange new language. Of the 50 refugees enrolled on the Step programme in Coventry, 20 have found work – 19 men and one woman – with employers such as Waitrose, Costco and Parcelforce. Out of the 250 people on Step in Coventry and West Yorkshire, 20% had university-level qualifications and the majority were semi-skilled or low-skilled, said Janice Lopatkin, who runs World Jewish Relief’s UK programmes. Four out of five people looking for work through Step were men, she added. At the library session, the importance of Syrian women in particular finding work was hammered home to the newly arrived refugees. “It may be a sensitive subject, but the truth is this country is a great opportunity for equality in work,” Mahmood Bismillah, the council’s employment manager, told the group. “Our prime minister is a woman! You can turn the telly on and see women in hijabs on cook shows!” Of the 20,000 refugees to arrive in Britain by 2020, a maximum of 6,000 will find work, according to Lopatkin. About 40% of the adults will be unable to work for reasons including ill health, lack of skills and the language barrier. Imad Umar al-Tyar, 52, an Arabic teacher who arrived with her husband and two children in Coventry on 16 March, said her family were desperate to learn English so they could find work and make conversation with their new neighbours. “We are very happy. It’s very beautiful here,” she said through an interpreter. “People are always welcoming you. We never felt like we are abroad because there are a lot of Syrians here and a lot of people we can talk Arabic and learn English with.” Baraa Alsaadi, 20, arrived in Coventry with his mother, father and two younger brothers in September 2014, having fled their home in Damascus after the outbreak of the civil war two years earlier. The Alsaadis were the fourth Syrian family to settle in Coventry under the VPRS. Arriving in Britain was “like a dream” compared with the terrifying daily ritual of “just waiting for death” in his homeland 4,700 miles away, Alsaadi said. With the help of council workers, Alsaadi enrolled at Coventry college to learn English and study maths. In April last year, he started work as an apprentice at Timpson, the locksmiths chain, and within six months he had been promoted from trainee to branch manager. Behind the counter of a Timpson store on the edge of Coventry, Alsaadi said he felt he was finally giving something back. “If you do someone’s watch or something, that means everything for them. That helps people,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/03/junya-ishigami-japanese-architect-i-want-to-make-the-sky","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Junya Ishigami: 'I want to make the sky'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/03/junya-ishigami-japanese-architect-i-want-to-make-the-sky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/03/junya-ishigami-japanese-architect-i-want-to-make-the-sky","fields":{"headline":"Junya Ishigami: 'I want to make the sky'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Imagine a world where buildings don’t exist. A place with no rustic cottages nor gleaming skyscrapers, no classicism nor modernism, no preconceived idea of what a house or an office block should be. How would we make spaces from scratch if anything was possible? Freed from the conventions of architecture and construction, what would this world look like? It’s a question Japanese architect Junya Ishigami has been trying to answer for the past decade, dreaming of structures that are as light as a cloud, as vast as the sky, as random as the trees in a forest or the stars in the sky. Many architects are fond of using nature metaphors, of attempting to blur the inside and out, but Ishigami is determined to create another nature altogether: by designing buildings that are as primitive and strange as natural phenomena. As one of the most experimental of Japan’s younger generation of architects, his poetic visions have often seemed too radical to be realised, destined to be confined to the realms of books and installation art. In a gallery in Tokyo, he made a five-storey cuboid metal balloon that actually floated; and, at the Barbican in London, he installed a white frame so thin and delicate that visitors could only see it when invigilators dressed in black stood behind its columns. A similarly slender structure for the 2010 Venice Biennale collapsed just before the opening, leading sceptics to question if it was ever really there. Its title, Architecture as Air, didn’t help. So it comes as a surprise to learn that this structural alchemist and defier of physics is now erecting substantial structures around the world, from a museum in Moscow to a monumental arch in Sydney. And, as a new exhibition of his work at the Cartier Foundation in Paris shows, they are buildings but not as we know them. “If we forget everything we know,” says the 43-year-old, standing in the foundation’s airy glass galleries, “just imagine how many more kinds of architecture there could be.” He’s surrounded by fragments from his fairytale worlds: ribbons of looping white steel dangle from the ceiling, above models of gossamer-thin rooftops draped over sunken spaces, like clingfilm stretched over a bowl. A gnarled concrete cave stands on knobbly legs, next to a menagerie of animals fashioned from kitchen foil. It is part scientific laboratory, part creche. Children, and how they see the world, are a constant inspiration to Ishigami, in his mission to free himself from preconceived notions. “Imagine how the world would seem if you were a really tiny person, like an elf,” he says, leading me over to his collection of foil creatures. “Animals would seem like huge landscapes.” In his design for an indoor children’s park in Japan, a dog becomes a big roof, a bear forms a dome, while the gaping mouth of a hippo makes a cave. He has deployed a similar approach for a kindergarten in China, where the plan of the building has been made by collaging together animal silhouettes. You can make out the tentacles of an octopus, the belly of a whale, the jaws of a crocodile – all merged to form an undulating landscape where floors become roofs and some spaces are so low-level only children can access them. Others, even smaller, are only for animals. Forming a loosely defined patchwork of ramps, plateaux, steps and caves, these spaces are whatever the kids and their imaginations want them to be. Ishigami is a product of the Pritzker prize-winning practice SANAA, where he worked for four years under Kazuyo Sejima, 61, who is herself a product of Toyo Ito, 76. The latter’s genre-defying buildings – from the coral-like columns of the Sendai Mediatheque in Japan to the labyrinthine cave of his opera house in Taiwan – are clearly a touchstone for Ishigami . Each new generation of this architectural family tree seems to strip back a layer, shedding the ballast of their forebears to float ever closer to the clouds. Ishigami has come the closest to weightlessness yet. In 2010, several years after setting up his own office, he was catapulted to international recognition with his first building: a workshop for the Kanagawa Institute of Technology in Japan. Rather than erect the usual big shed, he created a glass-sided building containing hundreds of slender steel columns arranged randomly. It was like a forest punctuated by small clearings, for chairs and tables. “A lot of students go there to work alone,” he explains, “so I wanted to create a feeling of enclosed personal space, while keeping the sense of an open hall. No matter how big a space has to be, it should always be designed from the individual scale.” His 60-metre-high Cloud Arch for Sydney was developed on the same principle and looks a little like something Salvador Dalí applied his melting powers to. Its drunkenly swaying silhouette (“moving like a cloud”) is designed to form a different shape from every possible viewpoint around the city. Next door to the Kanagawa workshop, meanwhile, Ishigami is about to begin construction on his most ambitious project yet: a multipurpose covered square for student sports, parties and barbecues that promises to be one of the most unlikely structures ever built. “I made the forest,” he says, “Now I want to make the sky.” His sky will take the form of a continuous plane of steel, just 12mm thick, hanging over a space 110m long and 70m wide – without a single supporting column in sight. Due to steel’s expansion and contraction, the height of the covered space will vary from 2.3m to 3m, depending on the weather, while a scattering of square holes will mottle the interior with pockets of sun and shade – and allow rain to fall inside. The shallow bowl-like floor means you’ll never see any end walls: they simply merge into one, in a continuous interior landscape boasting its own clouds and horizon. A 20m-long model in the exhibition gives you an idea of what a miraculous feat this will be, what an unusual space he will create beneath the huge drooping meniscus. When Ishigami is not busy creating his own version of nature, he tries to preserve or amplify what is already there. On a rocky hillside on the edge of Dali in southwest China, he has designed a series of eight holiday homes in an area rapidly being denuded of its countryside. Rather than remove the big boulders and start with a clear site, as any sane architect would, he has meticulously arranged the rooms and furniture of the homes around the great rocks, all to be topped with a 300m-long wafer-thin roof. The natural boulders become structural pillars, forming a megalithic indoor landscape. It comes as no great surprise to learn that Ishigami is obsessed with plants. In his beautiful pencil drawings, he often pays more attention to petals and leaves than he does to the building they surround. He says you should approach designing a house “as if you were putting together a garden, a little at a time”. For a park in the grounds of a historic building the Netherlands, where no trees could be removed nor paths altered, he built a sinuous glass pavilion, again without columns, whose walls follow the line of the existing paths, disappearing into the trees. “I just turned the footpath into a space,” he says, making the elaborate feat sound effortless . As he takes me around the show just days before it opens, armies of assistants are busy with tweezers, meticulously placing tiny pieces of coloured tissue paper on the models, to give them the desired hand-rendered finish. He doesn’t talk of designing buildings but of “making scenery”. And the simplicity with which Ishigami explains his projects – a style echoed by the exhibition catalogue, which is designed like a large children’s storybook – belies the fiendish complexity behind the facade. He is currently building a cave-like restaurant in Yamaguchi, Japan, that looks like something tunnelled into being by giant worms. It was created by “digging holes in the ground, filling them with concrete and burrowing out the soil around them”. The resulting fat curvy columns, which spread out as they rise, required seven years of planning before construction could even begin. “The client wanted an old-feeling space, like a wine cellar,” he says, “but I didn’t want to do a pastiche. So I thought about how to make something feel truly archaic by digging it straight out of the ground.” It is easy to leave this exhibition, appropriately titled Freeing Architecture, feeling liberated from the shackles of architectural history, from the messiness of cities, and even from the laws of physics. It is a tranquilliser dart of pure poetry. Some might find it all too cute, the childlike naivety a little cloying. Free of context, it can all seem a little too perfect: only when these buildings are finished will it be possible to assess how Ishigami’s dream worlds perform in reality. For now, though, it’s tempting to close your eyes and fall under the spell of one of the most original minds in a generation – and be transported to a place where other architectures are possible. Junya Ishigami: Freeing Architecture is at the Fondation Cartier, Paris, until 10 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/29/pro-eu-groups-to-ramp-up-efforts-to-thwart-hard-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T19:25:18Z","webTitle":"Remainers marshal their troops for battle against hard Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/29/pro-eu-groups-to-ramp-up-efforts-to-thwart-hard-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/29/pro-eu-groups-to-ramp-up-efforts-to-thwart-hard-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Remainers marshal their troops for battle against hard Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Remain campaigners plan to use the next six months to try to stoke public concern over Brexit and pressure MPs to vote against the final deal that Theresa May extracts from her negotiations with the European Union. Best for Britain this week began spending the £500,000 it raised from George Soros’s foundation, starting with a set of billboards asking “When will we know what we voted for?” and stating “We all deserve a say on the final deal”, talking up the idea of a second referendum. The pressure group is pursuing tactics akin to a political party, focusing its energies on targeting voters in the Midlands and north of England with billboards at the main railway stations and advertisements in the regional press as the battle to halt or soften Brexit starts to go beyond parliament. It hopes to target a constituency of 7 million “soft leavers”, according to communications director Paul Butters, and will also use Facebook to reach such people. Social media messages will highlight the number of doctors and nurses from the EU who work at local hospitals. “The argument will be this is not the Brexit you signed up to,” Butters said. The approach differs subtly but importantly from Open Britain, which developed from the failed remain campaign, and has been consolidating with other grassroots organisations such as the European Movement or Scientists for the EU in shared offices based at Millbank Tower – a short walk along the Thames to Westminster. Open Britain works as a more traditional pressure group. With a staff of eight, it is aiming to lobby MPs and campaign in the first instance for a softer Brexit, trying to keep the country within the customs union or even the single market, by mobilising supporters from a mailing list that it claims is 500,000-strong. It wants supporters to hold events around the country in a day of action on 14 April. That approach isn’t enough for the more fundamentalist Best for Britain, which has far more money to spend. “They want to argue for a softer Brexit,” Butters argued. “We think that no Brexit should be on the table; they are not comfortable with that argument.” But the differences between the groups are not vast, and their staffs – many of whom have links to Labour or the Liberal Democrats – are well known to each other. James McGrory, the executive director of Open Britain and a former adviser to Nick Clegg when he was deputy prime minister, emphasises unity: “Just look at what we achieved with amendment 7 before Christmas, where all of the pro-European groups, including Open Britain, Best for Britain and the European Movement, worked hand-in-glove to lobby MPs to vote for it.” There are doubts whether Best for Britain’s posters and local newspaper ads will be effective in leave-supporting parts of the country. Billboards are a particularly crude form of political targeting, with political parties spending less on them as social media has taken their place. There are mixed messages from the polls, several of which nominally put the remain camp about three points ahead if the referendum were held again tomorrow. Anti-Brexit organisations have been attending a Wednesday morning coordination meeting chaired by Labour MP Chuka Umunna. Despite reports to the contrary, few other MPs attend. Another key figure is Open Britain chair Roland Rudd, who runs corporate communications firm Finsbury. Until recently, Rudd had Open Britain operating out of a tiny room in his own Thameside offices off the Strand. A wider group participates in an email chain. People such as journalist and former spin doctor Alastair Campbell pitch in; one of the most active participants is said by some recipients to be philosopher and author AC Grayling. Best for Britain has an openly stated goal to stiffen the Labour party’s anti-Brexit stance so that opposition MPs vote against the final deal on offer. It intends to produce research showing that in 150 mainly Midlands and northern seats, sitting Labour MPs owe their majorities to remain supporters. For Umunna, as part of Open Britain, the focus is on staying in the single market. “Whether the UK stays in the single market – through participation in the European Economic Area – is in Jeremy Corbyn’s hands,” he said. However, Umunna’s challenge is that within Labour ranks he is seen by many as anti-Corbyn. Some figures linked to Open Britain – but not Umunna himself – have argued that their campaign should become the basis for a reinvented third party. Few are taking that talk seriously, not least because the pro-Europe Lib Dems are doing so poorly. The problem for both organisations has been working with Conservatives. Pro-EU Tories cut their ties with Open Britain before the 2017 general election after it released an “attack list” of MPs to target. Earlier this week, however, Anna Soubry and former cabinet minister Chris Patten spoke at an Open Britain event – a signal, some hope, of the beginning of a rapprochement. Open Britain and Best for Britain each claim that the energy is on their side, not least because there is nobody as enthusiastically making the case for Brexit, even though it is government policy. During May’s tour of the country on Thursday, which included a muted endorsement of the UK’s post-Brexit prospects, she said it “would deliver a country that will be different” and that the UK would have the chance of a “bright future”. Jacob Rees-Mogg has emerged as the Brexiters’ standard bearer, with influence gleaned from his chairmanship of the European Research Group, the group of 50 or so Tory MPs with the principal aim of pushing party policy towards the right. The pro-Brexit campaign groups are weaker: Leave Means Leave provided a backdrop for a Rees-Mogg speech earlier this week, but it has a skeleton operation, and puts out far fewer press releases than the hyperactive pro-remain groups. Richard Tice, the international property developer and co-chair of Leave Means Leave, said the aim of the group in the coming months would be to push for “clean, swift Brexit” and to emphasise that “a Canada-style free trade deal on goods and agricultural products is there for the taking”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/29/melrose-trio-gkn-christopher-miller-david-roper-simon-peckham","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T15:06:16Z","webTitle":"Melrose trio who sought biggest deal yet with GKN – and biggest challenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/29/melrose-trio-gkn-christopher-miller-david-roper-simon-peckham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/29/melrose-trio-gkn-christopher-miller-david-roper-simon-peckham","fields":{"headline":"Melrose trio who sought biggest deal yet with GKN – and biggest challenge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The three men who built Melrose into a £4.3bn business have a long track record of buying struggling industrial companies, turning them round and selling them on at a profit. Christopher “Jock” Miller, Melrose’s executive chairman, was a protege of Lord Hanson, the 1980s wheeler dealer who built a corporate empire with a number of aggressive takeovers. Miller and David Roper met while working as chartered accountants in Switzerland in the 1970s. Miller then joined Hanson, while Roper went to work in the corporate finance divisions of banks SG Warburg, BZW and Dillon Read. Roper was nicknamed “the Grinder”, supposedly for his detailed financial analysis of companies targeted for takeover. Together they bought into small Leicestershire shoe retailer Wassall in 1988. Using Wassall as an acquisition vehicle, the duo turned it from a company worth just £1.9m into a wide-ranging engineering business, from glue to bottle tops. The shoe shops were sold and a series of ever larger takeovers followed. Eventually Wassall was itself sold to the US buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for £672m in 2000. Simon Peckham, a solicitor, joined Wassall in 1990 and later became its corporate development director. He started his career as a solicitor at Clifford Chance and later worked for the equity finance division of Royal Bank of Scotland between 2000 and 2003. After spending a couple of years doing little but improving their golf handicaps, according to Roper, he and Miller teamed up with Peckham again to set up Melrose. They put in £3m of their own money and floated the company on London’s junior Aim market in 2003 with a market capitalisation of £10m. Melrose gained backing from a number of top City institutions including Schroders and Fidelity. Once again they used the company to mount a series of acquisitions – the die-cast specialist Dynacast, the engineering group McKechnie and the metering business Elster among them – before disposing of them and returning the proceeds to shareholders. Melrose’s current businesses are Nortek, a US company that makes kitchen stove hoods and extractor fans, and Brush, which produces electricity generating equipment. Melrose has an annual turnover of just over £1bn and employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. It has a market value of £4.3bn. Miller, Roper and Peckham, along with Melrose finance director Geoff Martin, hit the headlines last year when it emerged that they would share a bonus pot of £160m, one of the biggest corporate paydays in the City. Peckham has been chief executive of Melrose since 2012, taking over from Roper who was appointed executive vice-chairman at that time. Setting out their philosophy, Roper once said: “We find fundamentally good businesses which are badly managed but need a change of culture.” A takeover of GKN would be their biggest deal yet, and their biggest challenge. Miller has always been philosophical about failures along the way. He told the Daily Telegraph in 2004 after losing the battle for mini-conglomerate Novar: “If you fail in a public company bid, everyone knows and of course it is disappointing. My children said: ‘Oh Daddy, can’t you just pay them more?’ This is about getting an asset at the right price. If you can’t get the right price, you just go home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/01/1-april-price-hike-day-household-bills-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"No April fool: it’s national price hike day in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/01/1-april-price-hike-day-household-bills-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/01/1-april-price-hike-day-household-bills-rise","fields":{"headline":"No April fool: it’s national price hike day in the UK","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If the Easter weekend is proving expensive, then stand by, because it’s only going to get worse. Sunday 1 April has been dubbed national price-hike day as a host of government bodies and private firms will increase charges, potentially adding at least £100 to family budgets this year. Council tax bills will rise by an average of 5.1% (on band D properties in England), typically adding an extra £81 a year. The average water bill for England and Wales is to rise by 2%, or £9 a year, while the cost of a colour TV licence goes up from £147 to £150.50 a year. The NHS charge for a dental check-up will also increase, by £1 to £21.60. And if you need a doctor’s prescription, it will cost £8.80 – up 20p. Sadly, all this is no April Fools’ Day joke and comes days after a rise in the cost of stamps – from 65p to 67p for a first class stamp – on 26 March. Those taking long-distance flights of more than 2,000 miles from UK airports will pay £3-£6 more in air passenger duty: taking it to £78 in cattle class or £156 at the front. Mobile phone firms Three, EE, O2 and Vodafone will hike the cost of monthly contracts for some customers by up to 4% on or around 1 April, depending on billing date. Sky TV and broadband customers will see their monthly contracts rise by around £30 a year. Hannah Maundrell of Money.co.uk says: “As you tuck into your Easter eggs this year, your wallet could be hit left, right and centre. These price hikes may appear small and nothing to worry about, but add them all together and they could cost you around £100 extra a year. You won’t be able to avoid some of the increases, but you can certainly take control when it comes to managing the cost of your energy, phone and broadband.” Energy provider E.ON is removing its dual-fuel and paperless discount on 19 April. The discount is worth around £30 a year to customers who take both gas and electricity from it. In effect, it amounts to a 2.7% price increase for dual-fuel customers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"law/2018/apr/01/alarm-as-government-rewrites-uk-torture-guidance-in-secret","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T18:00:03Z","webTitle":"Alarm as government rewrites UK 'torture guidance' in secret","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/apr/01/alarm-as-government-rewrites-uk-torture-guidance-in-secret","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/apr/01/alarm-as-government-rewrites-uk-torture-guidance-in-secret","fields":{"headline":"Alarm as government rewrites UK 'torture guidance' in secret","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A British government guidance paper that is intended to prevent the country’s intelligence officers from becoming involved in human rights abuses is being rewritten in secret, much to the alarm of civil liberties groups. Rights activists are deeply worried that the UK government may be tempted to water down the guidance at a time when the US president, Donald Trump, has said he hopes to restore waterboarding – “and a hell of a lot worse” – and has nominated Gina Haspel as the next head of the CIA. Haspel reportedly oversaw a secret CIA prison in Thailand, where a terrorism suspect was tortured. The UK paper, known in Whitehall as the ”consolidated guidance”, was rewritten and made public by the coalition government following a series of scandals in the years following the 9/11 attack on the twin towers in New York. Under the terms of the previous version, drawn up early in 2002, MI6 officers had helped to plan a number of so-called rendition operations. Officers from MI5 and MI6 had also become embroiled in the torture of detainees held overseas, usually by handing questions to overseas intelligence agencies with poor human rights records. On publishing the current version of the consolidated guidance, David Cameron, then prime minister, told MPs: “We are determined to resolve the problems of the past so are we determined to have greater clarity about what is and what is not acceptable in the future.” Cameron said that in future, MI5 and MI6 officers should not do anything that they believe could lead to an individual being tortured, and that only ministers could decide what steps to take if the agencies wanted to interrogate prisoners who could hold information crucial to saving lives. The consolidated guidance is now being redrafted again after a 2016 report by the intelligence services commissioner, Sir Mark Waller, was critical of both the wording of the guidance and MI6’s dealings with a Kenyan anti-terrorism unit. So far, however, government departments, the intelligence agencies and Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command are the only bodies known to have been consulted. Waller had also recommended that “in order to improve transparency and accountability”, the Cabinet Office should consult rights groups about the new version, and suggested the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Fair Trials Abroad, Prisoners Abroad, Redress and Reprieve. However, none of these organisations have been consulted and a number of groups are concerned that the guidance may be weakened during the process. In a joint letter to Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, five human rights groups – including Fair Trials Abroad, Reprieve and Redress, as well as Amnesty International and Liberty – have warned: “The deep and lasting stain of UK complicity in extraordinary rendition and torture over the so-called war on terror powerfully demonstrates the need for safeguards. “We therefore have serious concerns that the government may be seeking to amend or even water down its guidance on torture behind closed doors. “The government has provided no justification for why it has failed to adhere to the recommendations of its own commissioner and engage in a meaningful and transparent consultation, and chosen instead to talk only to itself and its own intelligence agencies.” At the legal charity Reprieve, director Maya Foa said: “Donald Trump has nominated one of George Bush’s torturers-in-chief to lead the CIA. Gina Haspel oversaw a ‘black site’ in Thailand and helped destroy video evidence of detainees being subjected to beatings and extreme abuse. As the US regresses, the UK government must stand firm and reject torture in all its forms. “The government’s secret internal review risks watering down the high standards expected of the UK’s intelligence agencies,” she added. “It must be opened up to full public consultation without delay.” The Cabinet Office declined to say why rights groups were not being consulted in line with Waller’s recommendation. A government spokeswoman said: “Work is ongoing to identify what, if any, further changes could be made to the consolidated guidance, following the intelligence services commissioner’s recommendations. “We have engaged with both the intelligence services commissioner and the office of the investigatory powers commissioner, to whom the prime minister has issued a direction to continue the statutory oversight of the consolidated guidance.” She added that the government would consider any comments from parliament’s intelligence and security committee, the group of MPs and peers that provides oversight of the intelligence agencies, and that the guidance paper would be made public once it had been rewritten. The existence of official guidance for intelligence officers seeking information from detainees held by overseas intelligence agencies became known publicly in 2009, during the cross-examination of an MI5 officer who had interrogated a British resident, Binyam Mohamed, who was being tortured by CIA officers at a prison in Pakistan. The coalition government acted to rewrite the consolidated guidance and make it public in 2010 after the Guardian highlighted a series of cases in which terrorism suspects were tortured by overseas intelligence agencies while being asked questions that had been drawn up by the UK’s intelligence agencies. The victims included one man, later convicted and jailed for life for terrorism offences, who had three fingernails pulled out by Pakistani intelligence officers after MI5 had drawn up a series of questions to be put to him, and MI6 had handed the questions over to the Pakistani authorities. The following year the Guardian obtained a copy of the post-9/11 guidance, which showed that senior intelligence officers were expected to weigh the importance of the information being sought against the level of mistreatment the detainee was likely to suffer while it was being extracted. The document also warned that the agencies’ reputation was likely to be damaged if the existence of the guidance was disclosed. Later that year, a number of MI6 and CIA documents discovered during the Libyan revolution exposed the way in which MI6 had assisted in the kidnap of two of Muammar Gaddafi’s Islamist opponents, who were flown to a Tripoli prison, along with their wives – one of whom was pregnant – and four children."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/29/arsene-wenger-hungry-as-ever-success-arsenal-says-steve-bould-jack-wilshere-fit-stoke","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T10:08:33Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger is as hungry as ever for success at Arsenal, says Bould","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/29/arsene-wenger-hungry-as-ever-success-arsenal-says-steve-bould-jack-wilshere-fit-stoke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/29/arsene-wenger-hungry-as-ever-success-arsenal-says-steve-bould-jack-wilshere-fit-stoke","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger is as hungry as ever for success at Arsenal, says Steve Bould","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger’s hunger to lead Arsenal is stronger than ever before, according to his assistant manager, Steve Bould. The Frenchman’s future remains the hottest topic of discussion at the club, with a section of the fan-base adamant he should stand down after another season of Premier League failure. Wenger, for his part, has made it clear that he intends to see out the final season on his contract in 2018-19. The 68-year-old was unable to attend his media briefing before Sunday’s home game against Stoke because of a sore throat and he sent Bould in his stead. Bould, who has been the assistant since 2012, having previously coached the club’s youth players for 11 years, was evidently under instruction to say little, which was a shame as his insight into the dynamics of the coaching team and training sessions would have been interesting. But he did have warm words for Wenger. “He is remarkable,” Bould said. “Behind closed doors, I’ve never known someone who’s as hungry and determined to win football games. It’s as big as I’ve ever seen, for sure. “I admire him immensely. He takes unbelievable stick off an awful lot of people and he’s just one of the great managers. It’s a pleasure for me to sit next to him. I understand that he’s doing a great job, as far as I’m concerned, and has done a great job for an awfully long time.” Bould reported that Jack Wilshere was fit after the knee problem that ruled him out of England’s friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy.

That’s the logical conclusion to draw after they totally dominated the second day. Temba Bavuma made an unbeaten 95 before Vernon Philander knifed through Australia’s rejigged batting line-up. Thanks for your company, goodnight! 38th over: Australia 106-6 (Paine 5, Cummins 7) There is time for one more over from Morkel. Paine leaves a series of deliveries outside off stump; Morkel overcompensates and Paine tickles him for four. That’s the end of a wonderful day for South Africa. 37th over: Australia 106-6 (Paine 1, Cummins 7) Paine receives treatment between overs, so this may now be the last over of the day from Maharaj. Cummins slaps airily past extra cover for four, misses a big heave and then settles down to play out the rest of the over. 36th over: Australia 100-6 (Paine 1, Cummins 3) Paine’s first delivery is a vicious lifter from Morkel that smacks him on the bottom hand. Both batsmen get off the mark, with Cummins bringing up the Australia hundred. We should have time for two overs before the close. 35th over: Australia 96-6 (Paine 0, Cummins 0) A wicket maiden from Maharaj. Australia have lost three for six in the last six overs. This is turning into a grim last hour for Australia. Shaun Marsh edges a defensive stroke off Maharaj to slip, where de Villiers takes the catch. Maharaj has his first wicket. Marsh battled hard, making 16 from 74 balls. 34th over: Australia 96-5 (S Marsh 15, Paine 0) Morne Morkel replaces Philander and gets the first wicket of his farewell Test. Mitchell Marsh tries to thump a drive through extra cover but instead drags it back onto the stumps. Australia are in a mess. 33rd over: Australia 95-4 (S Marsh 15, M Marsh 4) A short ball from Maharaj is hammed for four by Marsh, Mitchell. “If you were thinking of reading the new Sean Penn, DON’T,” says Robert Wilson. “I’m halfway through it. Jesus effing Christ...” Will you finish it? I never know what to do if I hate a film/book/boxset/meal. There’s a certain nobility and achievement in finishing, but there’s also considerable satisfaction in thinking, Bugger finishing The Assassination of Versace, I’ll just watch the Sopranos again. 32nd over: Australia 91-4 (S Marsh 15, M Marsh 0) Philander has moved to 198 Test wickets, so you’d expect him to reach 200 during this match. And you would certainly expect South Africa to win a home series against Australia for the first time since readmission. Their comeback from that towelling in Durban has been really admirable. 31st over: Australia 91-4 (S Marsh 15, M Marsh 0) Shaun Marsh survives a missed stumping chance. He charged Maharaj, who slipped it a bit wider and beat the outside edge, but the ball kept low and raced between de Kock’s legs. de Kock rubbed his arm afterwards, which confused everybody until replays showed he’d been stung by a bee as he tried to complete the stumping. How thoroughly bizarre. “I guess now that I’ve been promoted to correspondent I need to keep checking in with you:-)” says Eva Maaten. “The game seems to be drifting a bit, and so is the attention of the audience; there’s definitely a (dare I say it) slightly drunken restlessness about the remaining crowd - which is thinning out. The families are drifting away... unsettled weather forecast for the next couple of days, I’d be surprised if we get a result. A draw is enough for the South Africans, of course. Did I read correctly that you’ll also be covering England-NZ? That sounds like a very long shift...” I am, but working from home means I can sleep for England (and New Zealand, Australia and South Africa) between games. 30th over: Australia 90-4 (S Marsh 15, M Marsh 0) “Just back from watching my beloved Fremantle Dockers win the footy at the absolutely stupendous new stadium in Perth,” says Martin Turnbull. “Just wondering if the Aussies are behaving themselves at the cricket.” Indeed they are. They’ve been exemplary. Khawaja has gone! Philander has his third wicket! Quinton de Kock came up to the stumps for Philander and the tactic worked straight away. Khawaja tickled one down the leg side and de Kock moved smartly across to take a brilliant catch. 29th over: Australia 90-3 (Khawaja 53, S Marsh 15) Khawaja saunters down the track to chip Maharaj classily for four and reach a superb, counter-attacking fifty from 77 balls. Australia have been aggressive against Maharaj, using their feet to almost every delivery. His four overs have gone for 27. 28th over: Australia 81-3 (Khawaja 47, S Marsh 12) Marsh, padding up to a straight one from Philander, survives another huge LBW shout. As is often the case on this ground, bounce saved him. Faf du Plessis decides not to risk South Africa’s last review, and I think he’s right. “Great call about Graeme Smith,” says Robert Wilson. “An exemplar of the dogged and cussed. Bavuma is not quite there yet because, yes, I agree, both indomitable deciders, but sometimes Smith went further and insisted...” And at Edgbaston in 2008, he went so far as to decree. 27th over: Australia 79-3 (Khawaja 47, S Marsh 10) Maharaj returns to the attack and has a very big LBW shout against Marsh turned down with his first ball. Maharaj had no interest in a review, which suggests there was an inside edge because it was otherwise an extremely good shout. UltraEdge confirms that was the case. That’s terrific umping by Ian Gould because it was barely perceptible even on the replays. 26th over: Australia 78-3 (Khawaja 47, S Marsh 9) Khawaja is beaten, swishing loosely at a wide half-volley from Philander. The ball has beaten the bat so much in this match, an does so again later in the over when Khawaja feels tenatively outside off stump. Brilliant bowling from Philander, whose figures are 9-5-15-2. 25th over: Australia 78-3 (Khawaja 47, S Marsh 9) A short ball from Rabada is whisked to the point boundary by Khawaja. He has bowled a few loose deliveries, though nobody really minds as they are all part of a spectacular package. That’s drinks. “How much Bavuma-love is reasonable do you think?” asks Robert Wilson. “Catching up on his innings, I’m choking with emotion. Clearly in absolutely stinking nick, he just wasn’t having it. How the hell did he get ninety-odd? That’s immense. There’s a plague of Nietzschean spaff in professional sport about the imposition of your will (by which people seem to mean toddler-level acting out and posturing). I’m thinking little Temba there just showed us the real truth of it. The guy just decided. That’s immense.” Ha, yes. Graeme Smith, who did a lot of deciding during his career, would surely have approved. 24th over: Australia 73-3 (Khawaja 42, S Marsh 9) The Vern returns, in place of Morkel. He finds his line straight away, forcing a couple of slightly desperate defensive strokes from Marsh. A maiden. 23rd over: Australia 73-3 (Khawaja 42, S Marsh 9) Too wide from Rabada, and Khawaja plays a flowing extra-cover drive for four. 22nd over: Australia 69-3 (Khawaja 38, S Marsh 9) Oof. Marsh leaves a delivery from Morkel that jags back and just misses the off stump. Actually, on reflection Marsh left that on height which was fair enough. 21st over: Australia 68-3 (Khawaja 37, S Marsh 9) Rabada almost bursts a nipbacker through the defence of Marsh, who does well to adjust and get in line. It’s a quiet spell, with three consecutive maidens from Rabada and Morkel. 19th over: Australia 68-3 (Khawaja 37, S Marsh 9) Rabada replaces Maharaj, whose two overs went for 17, and zips a fine delivery past Shaun Marsh’s outside edge. Although Khawaja and Marsh are batting pretty well, there is no sense of permanence about their partnership. 18th over: Australia 68-3 (Khawaja 37, S Marsh 9) Khawaja misses an extravagant pull stroke off Morkel, whose radar has been a bit askew in this spell. A straight delivery is tucked fine for four more. 17th over: Australia 64-3 (Khawaja 33, S Marsh 9) Khawaja saunters down the track to crunch Maharaj through mid-off for four, and then Marsh does the same to punch a boundary between extra cover and mid-off. Excellent batting. 16th over: Australia 51-3 (Khawaja 26, S Marsh 3) Marsh, on the walk, is beaten by a sizzling delivery from Morkel. “Hi Rob,” says Pete Salmon. “Good to have terrible, terrible Peter Handscomb back in the side. Something different to get angry about! He’s terrible.” How terrible? 15th over: Australia 50-3 (Khawaja 26, S Marsh 3) “Although there is an undeniable pleasure in seeing the Aussies receiving a sound thrashing (yes, I’m counting chickens) it almost feels unfair in the circumstances,” says Richard Mansell. “I’d rather an SA victory was really earned, so I’d prefer that Australia not wholly collapse but manage to make a game of it.” Keshav Maharaj replaces Philander. Khawaja offers no stroke to his final delivery and survives a big shout for LBW. There was a lot of guesswork involved for the umpire - but du Plessis decides to review. This is close. It turned a long way from the rough and hit Khawaja on the back leg. Height is the issue - and Hawkeye suggests it was just bouncing over the stumps. Khawaja survives and South Africa lose a review. 14th over: Australia 46-3 (Khawaja 25, S Marsh 0) Khawaja slams a pull through mid-on for four off Morkel. That’s a belting stroke. He has played with impressive intent at a time when everyone else has just tried to survive. 13th over: Australia 38-3 (Khawaja 18, S Marsh 0) Shaun Marsh survives the hat-trick ball, offering no stroke outside off stump. But it’s a wicket maiden from Vern, who has lovely figures of 7-3-15-2. He is a sensational new-ball bowler. “Handscomb in and out faster than the last time he was on as a message boy,” says AB Parker. “No smiles this time around either...” But maybe the same question from Darren Lehmann. Handscomb goes first ball and Philander is on a hat-trick! Handscomb tried to shoulder arms outside off stump but was too late in doing so and deflected the ball onto the stumps. 12th over: Australia 38-2 (Khawaja 18, Handscomb 0) Morne Morkel replaces Kagiso Rabada. There are still 29 overs remaining today, so it could get a lot messier for Australia. Morkel starts with a maiden, though his first ball did go for four leg-byes. 11th over: Australia 34-2 (Khawaja 18, Handscomb 0) That was the last ball of the over. The new batsman is Peter Handscomb. This is an unusually poor shot from Renshaw. He had left well but chased a very wide delivery from Philander and thin-edged it through to de Kock, who took a good catch to his left. Australia are two down. 10th over: Australia 32-1 (Renshaw 7, Khawaja 17) Renshaw, having been stuck on six for seven overs, steals a quick single off Rabada. Khawaja places a nice drive for a couple, promoting Rabada to switch over the wicket. After a fraught start, Australia’s batsmen are starting to look slightly more comfortable. 9th over: Australia 29-1 (Renshaw 6, Khawaja 15) Khawaja gets a leading edge for four off Philander. He’s living pretty dangerously, and is beaten twice later in the over. Philander is bowling majestically and could easily have a couple of wickets. 8th over: Australia 25-1 (Renshaw 6, Khawaja 11) Khawaja and Rabada continued to trade blows, with expansive drives for four and three sandwiched by a play and miss. Sooper cricket. 7th over: Australia 18-1 (Renshaw 6, Khawaja 4) Philander slips consecutive deliveries past Renshaw’s outside edge, the second a monster that growled off the seam. This is quite an interrogation for Renshaw, but we know he has the temperament to cope. It’s another maiden. 6th over: Australia 18-1 (Renshaw 6, Khawaja 4) A snorter from Rabada takes the splice of Khawaja’s bat and flies right between third slip and gully at catchable height. Another sharp delivery is inside-edged onto the body by Khawaja, who is getting a fair working-over. Rabada is pure gold, just so good to watch. He is everything you could want in an elite sportsman. 5th over: Australia 10-1 (Renshaw 6, Khawaja 0) Renshaw is batting outside his crease to Philander, an interesting and confident tactic designed to negate the impact of any late nibble. There’s so much to like about this kid, and he will surely be a key player in Australia 2.0. “Great match so far,” says Eva Maaten, our Bullring correspondent. “The (very predominantly South African) crowd is fired up and full of expectations for an early wicket. Or two. Or three. There’s s a slight sense of baffled disappointment that the two new openers can actually play cricket and haven’t both been out for duck in the first over. Lovely to watch.” 4th over: Australia 10-1 (Renshaw 6, Khawaja 0) Kagiso Rabada is just magnificent. That was his 141st Test wicket. He’s 22 years old. I suppose it was a fairly loose stroke by Burns but it did move late. Here’s Robert Wilson. “(Sweeping Generalisations and Baseless Assertions Alert). I’ve always found Australians easy to like and hard to hate. I’m not alone. Australians are the Italians of the English-speaking world. There’s something irresistible about their chilled-out, scabrous allergy to pomposity or pretention. Of course, there are outliers. For every Hugh Jackman or Jim Jefferies, there’s a Julian Assange or a Rupert Murdoch (when they go dark, they don’t hold back, the Aussies). I feel that recently the cricket team has tended to this dark side, kicking against the pricks of chipper Oz warmth and charm. It’s time to redress the balance and select a coach on likeability alone. Dizzy Gillespie definitely squeezes in but Tim Minchin is the funnier choice for me.” Gone! Joe Burns falls to a fine delivery from Rabada. It swung away, took the edge and was nicely claimed to his left by du Plessis at second slip. 3rd over: Australia 10-0 (Renshaw 6, Burns 4) Philander scurries in to bowl to Burns, who fences a straight delivery a fraction short of Markram at short leg. This is a testing start from Philander, who as ever is making the batsmen play at almost everything. But when he goes a bit too straight, Renshaw flicks handsomely over square leg for four. That’s a cracking shot. “I just hope it’s not Justin Langer,” says Paul Dickinson. “Cut from the same cloth as Lehmann and Warner. Key player in the odious Waugh/Ponting ‘mental disintegration’ era. Jason Gillespie talks a lot of sense and would bring a fresh, and dare I say, intelligent, approach.” 2nd over: Australia 3-0 (Renshaw 2, Burns 1) Kagiso Rabada shares the new ball, with three slips and a gully. There’s a hint - nay, a suggestion - of movement, and Renshaw is beaten on the inside by a fine delivery that snakes back off the seam. “If the goal is to play (and behave) like NZ, why not Mike Hesson?” says Kandukuru Nagarjun. “It was he, along with McCullum, that led the cultural regeneration of the Black Caps... There’s plenty of time before Australia’s next Test. Even with less money from TV, a Big Three nation ought to be able to offer a deal a man can’t refuse. It would hurt NZ, but surely the Australian way is to act like Big Brother in Trans-Tasman matters?!” I suppose there is a precedent for underhand behaviour towards New Zealand. 1st over: Australia 2-0 (Renshaw 2, Burns 0) Australia’s replacement openers stride to the wicket to face an interrogation from Vernon Philander. Matt Renshaw gets off the mark with a couple before being hit near the box by a nipbacker. The last delivery of the over takes the edge and falls just short of gully. A good start from Philander. “Speaking as someone who loves watching cricket, but can’t claim to follow it closely (and thus always feels faintly like a fraudster on the OBO), it seems hard to look past Dizzy,” says Matt Dony. “Even a casual observer can see he’s proved himself, been successful, seems very knowledgeable and respected, but importantly has spent the last few years on the other side of the world from the current team/set-up. Young and dynamic, but with an outsider’s viewpoint. Failing that, I might fire off a CV to CA.” And he’s vegan. Think of the potential for cultural change there. Something to watch during the tea break “Dizzy as coach please,” says Eamonn Maloney. “Just right to redress the hard/fair balance, evolutionary not revolutionary. Speaking of fine South Australians am looking forward to nay-Sayers being silenced. Has dominated the Shield for yonks but those perceptions about pace and conditions wouldn’t go away. Now that sheer weight of results has given him his chance you’re about to see the intelligence that completes the puzzle. It’ll be Aldermania all over again if he can get a regular gig, albeit that’s only likely through long-term injury.” I agree about Gillespie; he’s almost custom made for this situation. The umpires will take an early tea due to the change of innings. That was a manic, emotional few minutes, with Bavuma stranded and Morkel out for a golden duck in his final Test. Cummins ends with outstanding figures of 28.5-5-83-5. The Australians get together to applaud Morkel onto the field for what will probably be his final Test innings. And it lasts one ball! Morkel edges Cummins to Handscomb at second slip, so Bavuma is stranded five short of a century. He played beautifully. That wicket also gives the heroic Pat Cummins a five-for. Maharaj goes, caught behind having a zesty slap at a wide delivery from the new bowler Cummins. That was a breezy innings, 45 from 51 balls, but he has fallen with Bavuma still five short of a hundred. 136th over: South Africa 486-8 (Bavuma 94, Maharaj 43) Maharaj is taking Lyon to the cleaners. He drives four past short midwicket and then picks up a huge six over square leg. A steer for two makes this his highest Test score, and then Bavuma reverse sweeps for four to make it 17 from the over! South Africa are having all kinds of fun out there. 135th over: South Africa 469-8 (Bavuma 90, Maharaj 31) That’s a strange one. Maharaj seemed to miss a flashing cut stroke off Marsh, and nobody on the Australian team appealed for a catch behind. There was a clear sound on the replays, but nothing on Ultra-Edge. 134th over: South Africa 463-8 (Bavuma 89, Maharaj 26) Bavuma flashes Lyon to third man for three to bring up the fifty partnership. 133rd over: South Africa 458-8 (Bavuma 85, Maharaj 25) There is no sign of Bavuma trying to rush towards a hundred. He likes to play each ball on its merits and rarely deviates from that approach. When Marsh drops short, he swivel-pulls for a single. That’s your lot. “Bayliss might have been available before this Test?” says AB Parker. Get your filthy hands off him, damn it. He’s ours! Forever! Or at least until the end of the 2019 World Cup! 132nd over: South Africa 457-8 (Bavuma 84, Maharaj 25) Maharaj goes on the attack after drinks, belting Lyon for 14 in the over! There were two fours, cuffed through the off side, and a lusty swish for six over midwicket. Here’s a question for you all Who should be the next Australia coach and why? Drinks 131st over: South Africa 443-8 (Bavuma 84, Maharaj 11) Mitchell Marsh returns to the attack and has an adequate LBW shout against Maharaj turned down. I suspect it was sliding down. With every passing over, Australia’s task becomes stiffer. A victory from here, to draw the series, would be astonishing. 130th over: South Africa 442-8 (Bavuma 84, Maharaj 11) Bavuma charges Lyon and whirls a one-bounce four to deep midwicket. Shot! He’s such a nice player; I can’t quite fathom why his Test average is in the low 30s. 129th over: South Africa 438-8 (Bavuma 80, Maharaj 11) There’s no need for South Africa to declare - they have a series to win, and a Bavuma hundred would be a feelgood bonus. Maharaj, who is batting relatively sensibly, misses an attempted uppercut off Hazlewood. “Bavuma has been excellent today,” says AB Parker. “Missed so many, but so composed and bouncing back from every miss. Some English batsmen could learn from that.” True that. In fairness, Cook is one of the best I’ve ever seen at forgetting what has gone before. When he’s beaten, the ball is behind him in more ways than one. 128th over: South Africa 436-8 (Bavuma 79, Maharaj 10) Thanks Jonathan, hello everyone. As I ease into the OBO chair, Bavuma slams a sweep for four off Lyon. He’s 21 away from a second Test hundred. That’s enough from me for now. Over to Rob Smyth until the close of play. Thank you for your company, as always. Catch you tomorrow. 127th over: South Africa 429-8 (Bavuma 74, Maharaj 8) Maharaj continues to handle himself with aplomb, seeing off a very Hazlewood over. He nicks a single from the fifth ball of the over allowing Bavuma to pull powerfully for four from the sixth. It has been a chastening day for Australia’s trio of quicks. All have bowled well but all have been devoid of luck. Another excellent question to chew over... “It is clearly necessary to dissect all of this poor culture and bad behaviour, but who can Australia learn from as they look to improve?” asks Daniel McDonald. “What are some positive models of elite athletes in high profile sports not only avoiding controversy but maintaining their integrity and composure alongside their humility and popularity? I guess Federer and Usain Bolt lead the field. I don’t think Nadal is too far behind. Linsday Davenport and Kim Clijsters maybe? Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott in golf? Despite “The Deicsion” Lebron James has been very good for a long time. Messi? Paolo Maldini? Jurgen Klopp? 05 Flintoff was magnificent, but 07 Flintoff not so much. Mark Taylor was very good very often, but then incidents by McGrath and Warne and Healy probably count against him. Brendon McCullum’s NZ team?” 126th over: South Africa 424-8 (Bavuma 70, Maharaj 7) No breakthrough for Lyon. Maharaj looking switched on. Can he accompany Bavuma to a ton? Yep, realised that error too late (although since corrected) - still not enough to prevent me from The Bad Place. I will go willingly. https://twitter.com/patto_mike/status/980041521650159616 Yep, realised that error too late (although since corrected) - still not enough to prevent me from The Bad Place. 125th over: South Africa 422-8 (Bavuma 69, Maharaj 6) Josh Hazlewood is given another opportunity to improve his figures of 0-79 but Maharaj only makes them worse with a wristy cover drive that skips to the boundary. “To compliment my earlier comment,” writes David Griffiths (99th over), “I have surprised Australian fellow cricket tragics by not being too worried over a level 2 offence. I think we are all agreed the response has been way over the top with a level of hatred from online trolls that has been extreme (or perhaps to be expected in today’s climate). But my take is that Warner has been designated fall guy by CA from the first. They have reason to dislike him since his robust negotiation over players pay and he is the least “nice” of the three in the frame. Of the three he is the only one not to lie (admittedly by only apologizing for any wrong he has done). And he has far fewer miles in him than the other two. Incidentally it’s widely believed in Australia that Bancroft is the designated ball “conditioner” for Western Australia; if so an obvious choice to be asked (if somewhat incompetent).” 124th over: South Africa 418-8 (Bavuma 69, Maharaj 2) Lyon continues to extract plenty of turn and bounce, all of which will please Faf du Plessis greatly. Maharaj again survives and the lead ticks over to 418. 123rd over: South Africa 416-8 (Bavuma 69, Maharaj 2) Bavuma accepts the single first ball, exposing Maharaj to Sayers and the number 10 survives, just, despite edging agonisingly short of the diving gully. Sayers and the rest of the pace attack cannot believe their misfortune today. David asks: “How long do you think it will take Australia to re-coach and motivate their bowlers to take wickets without the assistance of Warner and his sandpaper?” Ignoring the obvious snark, Australia have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to pacemen, although it will be interesting to see who emerges in Warner’s stead as the Duracell bunny in the field. There are no obvious candidates for that roll. 122nd over: South Africa 413-8 (Bavuma 68, Maharaj 0) Australia have deserved that wicket, and for the second time today Lyon is the beneficiary of an unnecessary shot. The seamers must be fuming. James Calder speaks for us all. “When all’s said and done, I’m just glad Mark Nicholas didn’t go “Ohhh hello! Massive!” when he saw Bancroft pop the sandpaper in his pants the other day.” Aditi spotted The Good Place reference earlier. “Which cricketers do you think would get a spot there?” she asks in response. “Would ball tampering cause a massive drop in one’s score?” Great question! Lyon teases Philander from over the wicket and after a couple of inside edges onto pad he decides to try attack as the best form of defence. He succeeds only in larruping across the line into the hands of Khawaja on the midwicket fence. 121st over: South Africa 412-7 (Bavuma 67, Philander 12) Despite the amount of edges and plays and misses, Bavuma remains calm as you like at the crease and still with the clarity of mind to leave anything he needn’t poke at from Sayers outside his off peg. Maiden. 120th over: South Africa 412-7 (Bavuma 67, Philander 12) A less eventful Lyon over than usual, just two singles from it as South Africa continued to rack up a healthy first-innings total. 119th over: South Africa 410-7 (Bavuma 66, Philander 11) Yet another narrow play and miss to start Sayers’ latest over. Bavuma again the luckiest man in Johannesburg. And he cashes in that luck for four runs, finally edging a Sayers outswinger but getting enough wood on it to beat the despairing dive of the gully fielder. “All these tears are a poor spectacle, clearly designed to make people feel sorry for them,” writes Alexander Agranovsky. “The difference between Smith’s first press conference after they were spotted and the one yesterday was astonishing. Instead of a still quite arrogant Steve Smith telling us that “he is not proud of what they have done” and that “it will never happen again on his watch”, we saw a supposedly broken down man who asks for second chance. In between those two events, Smith did not do much wrong on the field, so clearly he was now significantly more upset not because of his cheating, but because he was caught and punished for it. For a 5 year old kid, that’s understandable. By his age, he should have known that crime is inevitably followed by a punishment.” 118th over: South Africa 406-7 (Bavuma 62, Philander 11) Big test of Paine’s captaincy credentials now to keep his tired troops in the game despite a morning full of near misses. He’ll be looking to leaders like Lyon to make his job easier and the offie teases Philander on a few occasions without inducing the error. 117th over: South Africa 405-7 (Bavuma 61, Philander 11) Maiden from Sayers to Philander. Not much to write home about. Some fine advice from Robert Wilson (or is it Chidi Anagonye?). “As this sticky-pocketed, lachrymose cautionary tale goes into its nine hundred and seventy second consecutive day, I have some advice for the spiritually lost and ethically abandoned. Whilst no dilemma is a truly binary proposition, this particular moral conundrum is a piece of cake. All you have to do is ask yourself the two absolute questions of ethical measure. Would Rahul Dravid have done it? And what does Gideon Haigh say about it? Everything else is goonish slapstick.” 116th over: South Africa 405-7 (Bavuma 61, Philander 11) Nathan Lyon begins after lunch and he starts with a strong appeal for a catch down the legside. No appealing the next delivery which is cut with finesse by Philander just beyond the dive of backward point and away for four. Lyon is then desperately unlucky. Bavuma flicks meatily into the onside but picks out leg slip but Joe Burns under the lid can’t hold on despite two or three desperate grabs. The players are back out on the field at the Wanderers. It’s a much brighter, sunnier scene after lunch with the floodlights off and patches of blue sky over the Bullring. “Every kid knows that when you’re up to no good and you get rumbled you have to come clean,” reckons James Calder. “The biggest mistake the three of them made (apart from coming up with and executing the plan in the first place) was not appearing at the first press conference together and explaining exactly what happened, blow by blow. Warner should have been there, and Smith and he should have fallen on their swords there and then. Owning up and doing the decent thing is usually the best course of action, even today.” I think that’s the thorny issue at the moment James, there’s still an uncertainty about what happened, who knew, and (to quote Ace) how long it had been going on. A situation not helped by a CA-marshalled press conference today that was a lesson in obfuscation. “Whatever the commentary on the press conference of the players punished for the ball tampering, the punishment is severe, and the personal cost to each of the players is quite high,” argues Peter Brook. “I understand the interest in finding more information about the event, however, it is likely that it was a one off event given the clumsy implementation of the action to alter the condition of the ball. It was a serious breach of the rules, hence the very severe punishment. Let’s see what happens in the course of further investigation by CA rather than just speculate.” “Did the cricket media smile at Warner being marshalled through his fake press conference by Malcolm Conn?” asks Ross McGillivray. “The Conn I remember, the man who exposed the coverup of the Warne and M Waugh fines, would never have tolerated that charade. Remember this from Broadcast News?” South Africa’s morning in Johannesburg. They’ve taken this Test match from even to firmly in their favour courtesy of Temba Bavuma’s unbeaten 61. It’s far from the cleanest of innings but despite numerous near misses and only one run off his bat during the opening hour he remains at the crease and on course to guide his side to a sizeable first-innings total. Australia have bowled well and deserve better than the solitary wicket of Quinton de Kock. Pat Cummins in particular has whistled deliveries past Bavuma’s outside edge as though there are magnets positioned deliberate to repel expected contact. With the pitch turning and now showing signs of uneven bounce, don’t expect a declaration any time soon. South Africa will now want to bat again on this surface. There remains the threat of rain too but thankfully the showers have held off so far despite gloomy conditions at the Bullring. 115th over: South Africa 400-7 (Bavuma 61, Philander 6) 400 up for South Africa and the ball immediately after the milestone is reached is, you guessed it, a play and miss by Bavuma at Cummins. Hmmm, a couple of deliveries later and another close shave favours the batsman but it’s from a worryingly low bouncing delivery. This pitch has shown no inclinations to keep low thus far but South Africa will have no problem seeing misbehaviour like that with 400 on the board. And that will be lunch. 114th over: South Africa 399-7 (Bavuma 61, Philander 5) Bavuma is not grinding his way to lunch, taking Lyon over the infield on the onside for a couple then driving powerfully on the front foot through extra cover. 113th over: South Africa 393-7 (Bavuma 55, Philander 5) Deary me, poor Pat Cummins. Another over, another selection of ‘how did that miss?’ rictus grins. At village level this would be called bowling too well, with plenty of encouragement from the cordon to the bowler to make it easier for the batsman. We’re left to wonder what Paine and Renshaw are saying in this new era of clean cut Australia cricket. Felix Wood is back. “Re: Naylor’s point (105th over). Of course he’s right, there has to be innocence until - unless! - guilt is proven or admitted, and the court of rumour and innuendo is unlikely to get us anywhere. But the only people to have given the story are the three who lied from the start and officials who weren’t there. Would it kill anyone to allow Starc and Lyon to give their side? Because frankly, assuming they are innocent, they must be stewing. Can you imagine what the outcome would have been if one of the bowlers had taken it on themselves to make sneaky adjustments to Warner’ s bat?” 112th over: South Africa 391-7 (Bavuma 55, Philander 3) Vernon Philander doesn’t look at ease facing Lyon first up, but he survives and picks up a two and a one with soft hands into the on-side. 111th over: South Africa 388-7 (Bavuma 55, Philander 0) Even with that wicket of the previous over Australia have been desperately unlucky today. Here again Cummins does Bavuma all ends up twice in quick succession but he can’t find an edge. The diminutive batsman then deftly uppercuts for four to rub salt into the wounds. “It’s improbable that this was the first time or a one-off (9:41),” writes Ravi Raman. “I mean the TV guys were told to keep a close watch, remember? That said, the guy I feel for the most is Bancroft. Blighted at the beginning of his national career. He’ll need strong JuJu to overcome that.” 110th over: South Africa 384-7 (Bavuma 51) He’s ridden his luck and struggled for form during the opening hour, but Temba Bavuma has reached 50. Since the drinks break South Africa have played with much more intent, Bavuma in particular, and fortune has favoured them. De Kock is getting in on the act now too, sweeping Lyon powerfully for four and then cutting for two. Lyon exacts his revenge eventually though, getting one to grip and bounce, converting a de Kock whip into a leading edge taken easily at mid-on. Australia have deserved wickets all morning and they’ve been gifted one with a lazy shot. 109th over: South Africa 375-6 (Bavuma 48, de Kock 33) Another delivery whistles past Bavuma’s outside edge, forcing a rueful smile from Cummins’ lips. That smile turns to disbelief two balls later when Bavuma launches one over extra cover like Virender Sehwag in his pomp, and then snatching four more with a thick edge that scoots wide of gully. “While I can’t feel sorry for Warner, the positioning of him as the villain compared to the other two as poor innocents sadly led astray started indecently early in the piece,” suggests Allan Hobbs thoughtfully. “He wasn’t at the original press conference talking of tape and I don’t think Smith and Bancroft were since asked if anyone else was involved the way Warner was. Similarly, contrast their refusal to talk about him, with their ‘I’m just here to take responsibility’ lines, seen as almost noble, compared to the suspicion and scorn when he said the same thing. While he instigated this particular crime, the real villain is the culture, both around the team and in the way the team is treated, but that’s a much less comfortable situation to resolve. And a bit too close to home for many in the media to be able to discuss.” 108th over: South Africa 366-6 (Bavuma 39, de Kock 33) Better from Lyon this over, working the outside and inside edges of de Kock’s bat, as well as the shoulder. There’s turn, bounce, and a half-appeal for a catch at slip but no breakthrough for Australia. 107th over: South Africa 366-6 (Bavuma 39, de Kock 33) Pat Cummins returns to the attack and he induces another big air swing from Bavuma. We’ve seen the ball beat the outside edge on numerous occasions today. Cummins overcorrects and Bavuma just nudges a four fine of fine-leg. It could (should?) have been this straightforward but alas it no longer is. 106th over: South Africa 362-6 (Bavuma 35, de Kock 33) A much less threatening Lyon over, South Africa nurdling runs around the infield. “I spent yesterday not going on the internet,” begins Peter Salmon, “so have missed any chat about THE FUTURE! The main question I have is how is Paine going as captain? Is the gig his from now on? And what sort of team is likely to be going out there in our next home test? I assume the bowlers are locked in, but the batting looks completely open... Thoughts?” Lots of water to flow under many bridges before the summer Peter. You’d think Paine is the preferred captaincy candidate for the time being and he’s done a decent job so far. He’s definitely at home leading the culture change CA have talked about. As for batters, I think the three called up here plus Glenn Maxwell are at the front of the queue but for one of the few times in modern history the Sheffield Shield may actually count for something come October/November. 105th over: South Africa 359-6 (Bavuma 34, de Kock 31) Who is this man at the crease!? Since drinks Bavuma has looked a different player and he confirms his return to form by square driving Hazlewood for four. He reverts back to type later in the over though, playing inside a beauty from Hazlewood that was worth a caught-behind every day of the week and twice on a Sunday. “I’m beginning to get a whiff of a witch hunt because (surprise, surprise) three press conferences have not answered every question about Australian cricket culture since 1877,” writes Gary Naylor. “In that Cape Town dressing room, just say Starc looks at the guilty three plotting and says to Cummins, “I think they’re going to have a go at the ball.” What would Cummins do? Every side has a go at the ball - so does he (and the other eight) do an Inzy and refuse to take the field? Even if they know sandpaper was involved, they may have a pop at Warner and Bancroft, but surely only Smith can say No. At the close they could go to Lehmann and tell him to sort it out, but even that might be hard to do and anyway, it’s too late then. I say let the process continue without conjecture about those to whom we should extend the traditional assumption of innocence until proved guilty.” 104th over: South Africa 354-6 (Bavuma 29, de Kock 31) Bavuma’s on the tear, working Lyon into the leg side for a single and then sweeping hard for what looks like a boundary but it’s kept to just one by some spectacular fielding by Usman Khawaja. There’s plenty of turn and bounce for Australia’s spinner but South Africa are doing a decent job keeping him out so far. The right-hander looks much more comfortable than the leftie. 103rd over: South Africa 351-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 30) A run for Bavuma! His second of the morning, after 44 deliveries - and it was an overthrow... Hazlewood would be disappointed to have to bowl to de Kock, but he almost makes it work to his advantage, rapping the South African on his pads on the crease but his LBW appeal is correctly declined for pitching outside leg-stump. Steve Ditchburn revisits a topic that continues to resurface. “Are we really to believe that none of the bowlers were told of the plan? Surely if you hatch a plan to change the state of the ball then you have to inform the bowlers because they will - assuming that the plan is successful - notice that the ball state has changed. And on from that, if a bowler notices that the ball state has changed and was not party to ‘the plan’ then is it his duty to inform the umpires that something has happened?” It was one of the questions David Warner declined to answer at his press conference today. All the information so far indicates none of the bowlers knew. I don’t think it’s an unreasonable question to ask. 102nd over: South Africa 350-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 30) Lyon coming around the wicket to de Kock and he beats his man with an absolute fizzer! Drifting in, spinning and bouncing away, catching the skinniest edge of de Kock’s glove but it ricochets off Paine and loops agonisingly over Renshaw in the slips. Oooh, another one passes the outside edge - Lyon has found his pace here - but de Kock is unperturbed, retaining the presence of mind to dispatch the loose long hop. Terrific over from Lyon. Australia have bowled well enough to take a bagful this morning but South Africa remain six-down at drinks. 101st over: South Africa 346-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 26) Bavuma is now 26 from 92 deliveries and looking unlikely to hit the ball off the square. As if to prove the point a rare attacking stroke morphs into a wafty play and miss at one from Hazlewood that bounces and seams away on a length. 100th over: South Africa 345-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 25) Nathan Lyon’s turn to have a bowl and he keeps de Kock on his toes during a positive start to his spell. 99th over: South Africa 344-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 24) After a lengthy delay Paine has his gloves back on, Hazlewood has the ball in his hands, and de Kock has the seven best runs of the day, four from a textbook straight drive and three more from a calmly placed cover drive. Bavuma has no such fluency and is almost caught on the crease by one that nips back and catches him near his unmentionables. Without intending to be heightist, replays show that was only a couple of inches away from an LBW dismissal. David Griffiths wonders on email if “Smith is the better actor?” which I think is an extremely harsh reading of the past few days. Smith’s distress and remorse seems incontrovertible to me. Yes, he made a mistake. Yes, he deserves to be punished. But aside from a horrible error of judgement there’s nothing to suggest he’s as mendacious as some people are making him out to be. While Paine deals with his pain, a chance to revel in Australia’s tri-series victory secured earlier today. 98th over: South Africa 337-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 17) Paine continues his policy of standing up to the stumps and it costs him four runs and no little pain. Sayers is perilously close to inducing a nick from de Kock but has to watch on as the ball cannons into Paine’s right thumb and away to the fence for four. Paine is now receiving treatment for what could easily be a broken thumb, at the very least a really nasty blow. And unless I’ve missed a memo, Australia haven’t named a vice-captain... 97th over: South Africa 332-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 16) Josh Hazlewood is belatedly called into the attack and he finds Bavuma’s edge almost immediately. It was a very faint nick with soft hands though and it failed to carry to the cordon. Bavuma is in quicksand out there right now. I have no doubt whatsoever that all the tears we’ve seen so far are genuine, Mike. Smith in particular was distraught, aware of the magnitude of his failings. As for your second point, we’ll never know. And it’s one of the questions Warner declined to answer at his press conference. Were they desperately unlucky to be caught during a one-off, or was it only a matter of time following a systematic abuse of protocol? England’s post-Ashes comments suggest we would be naive not to at least suspect there have been prior instances, although perhaps not to this egregious level. 96th over: South Africa 331-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 15) Bavuma has gone nowhere this morning and shows no indication he is bothered about getting anywhere in a hurry, continuing to leave or dead-bat everything sent his way like a tailender clinging on for a draw. He’s 26 off 75 now, South Africa’s number six, and he’s allowing Sayers in particular to refine his line and length to the millimetre. “How wonderful it would be to put the nastiness behind us and focus instead on actual cricket,” emails Felix Wood. “Unfortunately CA and those involved seem determined to mismanage the response in a way that does the opposite. With Warner’s presser today I’m less convinced than ever that a clean breast has been made, and now if it wasn’t for Starc’s long history of injury I’m sure people would be asking whether his going home was entirely coincidental. It still feels like damage limitation is the approach being taken, and that’s not going to get anyone’s trust back.” I reckon that’s a decent summary of what a lot of people are thinking. 95th over: South Africa 331-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 15) When he gets it right Cummins is finding some spite on a length. He connects with de Kock’s gloves this over, angling the ball across the left-hander from over the wicket. There are plenty of wicket balls out there and you sense one could bring plenty as new batsmen adjust to the conditions. 94th over: South Africa 329-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 13) Tim Paine is now standing up to the stumps to Australia’s new-ball bowler, on a track that is offering pace and bounce. One for The Grade Cricketer chaps that one. It doesn’t put either player off their stride though, Sayers presenting a beautifully proud seam and Paine showing flawless glovework as the ball misses Bavuma’s edge by a gnat’s wing. Sayers shows he’s no one-trick pony later in the over, almost castling Bavuma with one nipping back sharply off the pitch. Excellent cricket. 93rd over: South Africa 328-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 12) Cummins is bowling nicely this morning, finding a decent rhythm and occasionally looking for that odd one that climbs off a length. He eventually tries too hard and concedes five wides with one that launches into space from near his own toes. Jon Millard is happy I revisited Geoff Lemon’s takedown of the blokey C9 commentary culture (18.36). “The emotional depth of a sock puppet during a button shortage,” he emails gleefully. “I’d forgotten that line. Can we have Geoff Lemon when you don’t need him? Also fits Warner’s tears. Smith appeared to be crying for what he’d done to cricket, but Warner only for what he’d done to himself. And that difference was manifest between the two events, despite Warner’s attempts to mimic Smiths words, the non-verbals were stark.” I think that’s a very astute reading of the situation Jon, and why Smith is already on the road to redemption and Warner still fiddling with his GPS. 92nd over: South Africa 322-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 11) Sayers is full and straight to de Kock, aisde from the one wide half-volley that the batsman doesn’t time as sweetly as he would like, almost offering a catch to short cover instead of drilling the expected boundary. 91st over: South Africa 319-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 8) A maiden for Cummins is the product of Bavuma leaving as much as he dares. That includes declining a couple of wide teasers provoking comment from Graeme Smith and Michael Holding that if Bavuma is going to progress at this level he needs to start putting those kind of deliveries away. 90th over: South Africa 319-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 8) Chadd Sayers opens proceedings alongside Cummins and his arrival is met by the floodlights easing their way into life at the Wanderers. A typical Sayers over you’d say; decent line and length, a little wobble, two singles from it. Amod Paranjape has an interesting angle on cricket culture. “I write this in the office as the financial year in India comes to a close contemplating among other things the reaction to sellotape gate as the OBO community so eloquently puts it. I am one of the people who do not have sympathy for the Australians. This is according to my father a knee-jerk reaction to the in-your-face policy adopted by the Australians for the last many years. (My Dad is one of the most balanced individuals I know. All his life he has yelled at me once, once only). I will be interested to see if the Indians under Ravi Shastri and Virat Kohli who are fans of the Australian way will be changing to the ways of old. Though considering the monetary clout of BCCI I do no think they will deem it necessary.” It will be fascinating to see exactly how radical Australia’s changes turn out to be, and whether they attempt to implement them unilaterally or look to resuscitate the moribund Spirit of Cricket. It would surprise me if India changed what is proving to be a successful strategy. Let’s be frank, none of the big three have shown much regard for the rest of the cricketing world in recent years. 89th over: South Africa 317-6 (Bavuma 25, de Kock 7) Good start by Cummins, into his rhythm early and getting one to bounce and seam from a length that reared up menacingly at the diminutive Bavuma, landing a glancing blow to the batsman’s right elbow. Bavuma, hard as nails, doesn’t even pretend it hurt him. Four leg-byes from the final delivery get the scoreboard operator moving for the day. The players are out on the Bullring as the clouds look increasingly ominous overhead. Pat Cummins has the ball, Temba Bavuma is on strike. Warner’s tears landed differently to those of Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft earlier this week. Here’s my reaction immediately following an unsatisfying press conference that did nobody any favours. In case you’re overseas and just waking up, or you’ve been busy so far this Easter long weekend, today’s agenda has been dominated by David Warner’s press conference in response to allegations of ball tampering. Christopher Knaus was at the SCG to watch the latest tearjerker unfold. Congratulations to Australia’s women’s team who have just triumphed in their tri-series final against England. Meg Lanning top scored with 88 and Megan Schutt took three wickets in a 57-run victory. If you’re looking for more sport, there’s a dedicated Australian sportwatch on the go right here: Or you could catch up on a decent day for England in their Test match against New Zealand. The weather is more overcast than it was yesterday and there are showers about, so we could be in for some breaks in play, especially later in the day. The strip in Johannesburg has played excellently so far. Plenty in it for the new ball bowlers, turn and bounce for Nathan Lyon, and predictable enough for Aiden Markram to make it look like a road. Which reminds me, any excuse to revisit this Geoff Lemon tour de force. Some early correspondence. Please do join in if you have something to share. Contact details are at the top of the page. Tully Haines thinks that if Cricket Australia is series about culture change then it should extend to its broadcast partners. “I was thinking if Australian cricket really wants to change culture they need to change the tone of the commentary. Channel 9 is almost unwatchable because of the suburban pub tone of the commentary. Now the first day of cricket after the scandal Warnie is is the box telling a ‘hilarious tale’ of Merv Hughes trying to hit a fan with his cricket bat, apparently it’s one of Merv’s biggest regrets that he didn’t get him properly, haha.” Couldn’t agree more. It’ll be interesting to see how the broadcast rights situation plays out now C9 have invested so heavily in alternative summer sporting content. South Africa will resume at 313-6 at the start of day two. Temba Bavuma is unbeaten on 25, Quinton de Kock is on seven. Australia are in possession of the second new ball, it is eight overs old. Need to catch up with anything else from the Bullring yesterday? Adam Collins, the hardest working man in cric-biz, has you covered. If this was a normal Test match we’d be as giddy as an army of toddlers on an Easter egg hunt. We’d be swooning over Aiden Markram’s graceful 152, commending Pat Cummins for his late burst, and patting Chadd Sayers on the back for coming through a tough examination on debut. We’d be gripped by the conclusion of a topsy-turvy Test series that remains in the balance with just four days of play remaining. But this isn’t a normal Test match. The residue from the ball-tampering scandal has yet to wash away and another layer of crud was added to the mess today with David Warner’s unsatisfying press conference. What continues to happen off the field is refusing to relinquish precedence to events occurring on it. We’re back again to bring you all the day two action from the Wanderers, once more with one eye on the scandal that is tearing Australian cricket asunder.

Barnaby Lenon, a former headteacher of Harrow, the prestigious independent boarding school that educated the likes of Winston Churchill, Benedict Cumberbatch, the singer James Blunt and the rugby player Billy Vunipola, suggests in a much discussed list of revision tips, a total of 100 hours study over the fortnight long holiday. All topics should be revised at least three times before the exam; studies should start at 9am and finish by 6pm with regular 30-minute breaks and a good night’s sleep at the end. “Good exam results are made in the Easter holidays,” he writes in a blog for the Independent Schools Council, which he chairs. “Public exam results are important. They can determine the course of your life. Other students will be working hard. So it is worthwhile sacrificing your holidays.” Lenon continues: “The best GCSE and A-level results don’t go to the cleverest students – they go to those who revised in the Easter holidays.” “That’s unbelievable,” said one 17-year-old who is studying for A-levels in politics, economics and French, and is evidently shaken by the idea of seven hours revision a day during his holidays which have just begun. “It’s just nonsensical. No one could do that. It’s way too much. No one can concentrate by themselves for so long. My view is I can achieve my potential with maybe three hours a day. Seven hours a day is simply not productive.” Lenon, however, has an impressive track record. As well as being head at Harrow for 12 years, he was deputy head of Highgate school in north London and headmaster of Trinity school in Croydon. He is chair of governors of the London Academy of Excellence, a selective free school in Newham, east London, known as the East End Eton, and is a board member of the qualifications watchdog Ofqual. His former students have gained the best possible qualifications and made it to the best universities. As the Easter holidays get under way and pressure begins to mount ahead of the summer exams, parents may increasingly find themselves in conflict with their offspring over the fraught issue of exam revision. For some, it is taken out of their hands with large numbers of schools now choosing to open during the holidays to hold revision sessions. Experts agree that exams are important and young people need to devote holiday time to their revision, but there is agreement that one size does not fit all, and it is not helpful to be prescriptive. Dr Nihara Krause, a consultant clinical psychologist, said motivation can be a problem and some parents use money as an incentive to encourage revision. Some of her young patients are promised £400-£500 for every A at GCSE or even a car. “I don’t think those are the best motivators,” she said. “I think seven hours is far too much. Students also need to have a bit of a break. People talk about trying to do four or five hours. But there will be some students who need more time because they are less efficient with the way they use their time. “There will be others who need a lot less because they work slightly differently. These global messages are not good ones for teachers to give.” Sarah Kendrick, a psychotherapist who manages clinical services across the south of England for the children’s mental health charity Place2Be, says parents need to encourage both work and relaxation. “We can’t expect adolescents to work to the timetables we set them always. What we can do sometimes as parents is let our stress and our anxiety about our child’s achievement get into the mix. “It’s really important while we are encouraging them to revise – saying yes, you need to do this work – that you then say what’s equally important is that you play football or you go swimming or you watch that programme you were interested in. We need to be advocates for downtime as well as for revision.” According to Kendrick, new GCSEs being rolled out this summer have increased academic pressure on children and their teachers, who are having to teach a new curriculum which will be tested purely by end of year exams rather than any form of continual assessment. Alert to the risks to mental health, schools are running stressbuster sessions, including yoga and resilience training to support anxious students. In the higher education sector, universities are offering therapy dogs and rabbits to try to soothe worried students. Vic Goddard, the principal of Passmores Academy of Educating Essex fame, agrees that students need to make some sacrifices to be successful in their exams, but says family time is important too. “Revision is very individual but does need to be planned for. Giving a blanket number [of revision hours] may cause anxiety to increase when it isn’t achieved, which won’t help. “It is important that the family time available over the holidays is made the most of but also that the family supports their young person by helping them find a suitable amount of time, and an appropriate environment, to study what is needed. “My top bit of advice would not be about the amount of time needed and more about the quality of the deliberate practice undertaken. That and put your phones away while you do it!” Geoff Barton, an English teacher for 30 years, a former head teacher and now general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, recommends short bursts of revision of 30 minutes to an hour with regular breaks in between. “I would be very worried about a young person spending seven hours a day right through their Easter holidays. In my experience it’s the quality of the revision, not just the quantity. More does not necessarily mean better.” Reflecting on Lenon’s advice, Justine Roberts, founder and chief executive of the parenting website Mumsnet, said: “For young people who have left it to the last minute or who thrive on cramming, this advice could be great. For others, it risks adding to already considerable stress levels. “In the run-up to big public exams there are always plenty of reports on Mumsnet about children who are visibly upset, not sleeping or eating, or just feeling generally hopeless. The consensus is that these children need to be encouraged to take more breaks, not chain themselves to their desks.” Dr Krause’s exam preparation tips 1 Repetition is an essential part of learning. Studies on neural plasticity show that repetition can also help your brain rewire itself so that your thinking becomes stronger. 2 Learn the difference between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset. Fixed mindsets assume that intelligence and creative ability are a given and there’s nothing that you can do to change it. Growth mindsets thrive on challenge and see failure as a springboard for growth. 3 When motivation is a problem, write down your goals. Set a date and time and make the fact that you’re getting started public, then force yourself to do at least 30 minutes of study. To keep focused walk around as you study. 4 Prevent distractions – keep all technology out of reach. 5 The day before the exam aim to run through your work and complete it by 3pm. Do something that relaxes you the night before. Decide whether it’s a good idea or not to speak to friends – last-minute comparisons are not very helpful. Go to bed at a reasonable time – not too early so you toss and turn but not too late."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/29/egyptian-president-wins-second-term-after-purge-of-challengers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T21:32:20Z","webTitle":"Sisi wins second term as Egyptian president after purge of challengers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/29/egyptian-president-wins-second-term-after-purge-of-challengers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/29/egyptian-president-wins-second-term-after-purge-of-challengers","fields":{"headline":"Sisi wins second term as Egyptian president after purge of challengers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has been re-elected for a second term after an election campaign in which five of his potential challengers were prevented from getting on the ballot. Preliminary results showed that Sisi won about 92% of the vote, with turnout at around 41.5%. Twenty-five million of the 60 million registered voters turned out during the three days of polling that ended on Wednesday, state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram reported. Twenty-three million voted for Sisi. The Akhbar el-Youm newspaper did not report the full turnout but said Sisi won 21.4 million votes. According to the Al-Ahram newspaper, in addition to 23 million who cast valid votes, 2 million spoiled their ballot papers. Sisi’s sole challenger was Mousa Mostafa Mousa, who previously declared that he “was not here to challenge the president” and who entered the race at the last minute after five other potential challengers were blocked from getting on the ballot. Mousa conceded his loss on Wednesday night, telling a TV station he had hoped for 10% of the vote. “But I know the immense popularity of President Sisi,” he said. Other, more heavyweight would-be challengers were all sidelined, detained or pulled out. As army chief, Sisi ousted Egypt’s first freely elected president, Islamist Mohamed Morsi, after mass street protests in 2013, then went on to win his first term in 2014 with 96.9% of the vote. Turnout of 47% in that year’s election was higher than this year’s 40% despite appeals from Sherif Ismail, the prime minister, for voters to fulfil their patriotic duty. Boycotters who cannot show good reason for not going to the polls could a face a fine of up to 500 Egyptian pounds (£20), the electoral commission has warned. At a news conference, election commission official Mahmud al-Sherif said there had been no violations of Egypt’s election law. Opposition groups had called for a boycott of this week’s vote, which they labelled a facade. There were no presidential debates and Sisi himself did not appear at any official campaign events, although he spoke at a number of ceremonies. In an interview days ahead of the vote, Sisi said he had wished there were more candidates, denying any role in sidelining them. At a speech before the vote, he also called for a high turnout. “I need you because the journey is not over,” Sisi told a mostly female audience. “I need every lady and mother and sister, please, I need the entire world to see us in the street voting.” Morsi’s removal had ushered in a deadly crackdown that killed and jailed hundreds of Islamists. The initial attack on Morsi’s supporters expanded to include liberal and leftist secular activists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/29/cricket-fourth-test-australia-playlist-music-south-africa-ball-tampering","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T19:36:18Z","webTitle":"Wanderers playlist captures downbeat mood of Australia’s players","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/29/cricket-fourth-test-australia-playlist-music-south-africa-ball-tampering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/29/cricket-fourth-test-australia-playlist-music-south-africa-ball-tampering","fields":{"headline":"Wanderers playlist captures downbeat mood of Australia’s players","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘Tell ’em all I’m sorry I screwed up this time.’ The lyrics to Paul Kelly’s How to Make Gravy came blaring from seemingly every speaker in the Wanderers Stadium as Australia filed out to train minutes after Darren Lehmann had stepped off the media stage in tears when announcing his sudden resignation as coach. Tears had been the theme of the day when their deposed captain, Steve Smith, sobbed in front of the Sydney press. The Bullring does not have the definitive claim on being the most intimidating venue in world cricket but it is certainly in the semi-finals with its steep and daunting grandstands. Here, these lads were as broken as a sports team could be imagined. Kelly’s classic tells the story of a prisoner apologising for being locked up for Christmas dinner, much like Australia’s truncated preparations for the fourth Test against South Africa: focused inescapably on those not present. Then the songs kept coming, Australian classics both poignant and pugnacious, as the warmup gathered pace. Don’t Dream It’s Over felt right not only for the title but because the band who own it, Crowded House, are the greatest New Zealand export Australia ever appropriated and 24 hours earlier Lehmann said the Black Caps’ humble style of play was what he was looking to in order to recast his side. Hunters and Collectors Throw Your Arms Around Me returned even the steeliest soul back to Smith in Sydney, as did Nick Cave’s funereal Into My Arms. It went on. Australian Crawl’s Reckless was a reminder of the foolish incident that got them here to begin with. As the group came to their feet, the energy did too when The Saints were so loud that finally the volume was taken down a notch. Suddenly, it was Australian cricketers looking like Australian cricketers again, hooting and hollering in a fielding game played against the support staff. How relieved they must have felt to be out of a hotel interrogation room. How the soundtrack came to be does not matter. One player said it was a “stitch-up” rather than a pre‑planned act of defiance but it did, if briefly, create an environment of comfort after a week of anything but. It also did not matter when Faf du Plessis, South Africa’s carefree captain, said his side had suspicions Australia had tampered with the ball before. On any other day that was a headline but it was overtaken when Australia’s coach walked in to have a chat instead of the new captain, Tim Paine. Lehmann’s tired, red eyes made it obvious what was coming, not even 24 hours after pledging to be the man who could change enough to lead Australia through its toughest period in modern memory. Lehmann said he had it in him to cop plenty but not when watching his disgraced former players face the music at home looking more like extradited criminals than cricketers in the airport arrivals hall. “After seeing events in the media today with Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft, the feeling is that Australian cricket needs to move forward and this is the right thing,” he said. “I really felt for Steve, I saw him crying in front of the media and all of the players are really hurting.” Belatedly, Lehmann arrived at the conclusion that if the culture of the side he oversees was on trial, then it was unsustainable for him to remain: “I’m ultimately responsible for the culture of the team and I’ve been thinking about my position for a while. After viewing Steve and Cameron’s hurting, it’s only fair that I make this decision. This will allow Cricket Australia to complete a full review into the culture of the team and allow them to implement changes to regain the trust of the Australian public.” Reflecting on his proudest time at the helm, Lehmann pointed to the stewardship in the aftermath of Phillip Hughes’s death in November 2014, adding that it was more important to him than any on-field win. It was a human response James Sutherland, Cricket Australia’s chief executive, reiterated when having to appear one last time before leaving the country. For his part, he just wants the suspended players left alone to recover from the trauma of the week. Whether Sutherland has to tap the mat himself is an increasing point of fascination, despite his urging to the contrary. That pressure only intensifies with sponsors jumping ship and broadcasters trying to talk down the worth of the television rights in an effort to take advantage of the scandal. For the long-serving CA chief it really is one unpalatable sandwich after another. Before the players moved to the nets there was one last tune: Heavy Heart, sung by Tim Rogers. On Friday it will be Paine running the show on the pitch for the first time. If he can do the seemingly impossible and lead Australia to a win to square the series, the team anthem will be sung like it has never been before.

The UK bank refused a deal with the DoJ 16 months ago but is now having to pay a large bill for polluting the financial system with mortgage junk – aka, residential mortgage-backed securities – between 2005 and 2007. But resistance was not futile, which is the critical point. The sums are everything. Nobody will ever confirm figures, but it was widely reported that Barclays was offered a settlement at about $5bn in 2016. If so, chief executive Jes Staley’s threat to take the case to court was justified. The figure has more than halved. Why, though, settle at all? Didn’t Staley argue at the time that the DoJ’s case was “disconnected from the facts”? Yes, he did, but you can’t blame Barclays for deciding at this point that it’s better to swallow some financial pain for the sake of certainty. Going the distance with the DoJ would be perilous. The reaction in Barclays’ share price – it didn’t budge – suggests shareholders are also happy to take a $2bn hit. The sum is roughly what they expected and it has come at a moment when Barclays can plainly afford to pay. Back in 2016, a $5bn settlement could have forced a fundraising. These days, $2bn doesn’t interrupt Barclays’ dividend plans. Staley deserves credit for playing the long game. There has always been a strong suspicion that DoJ has treated European banks more harshly than US counterparts when it comes to settling cases of mis-selling mortgage securities. Barclays was prepared to challenge the methodology and was right to do so. A chief executive cannot let a few billion dollars slip out of the door if he feels the sum is too harsh or the dice are loaded. Staley’s standing rests entirely on the Financial Conduct Authority’s investigation into his attempt to unmask a whistleblower in 2016. Any adverse ruling will probably cost his job. But his handling of the DoJ case was correct. £3.9bn sale of Nex Group is example of deal-making skill Is Chicago-based CME Group £3.9bn purchase of Michael Spencer’s electronic trading and technology outfit Nex Group “a signal of tremendous support for Britain’s financial services sector”, as the seller declares, or another example of a US giant bagging an interesting piece of City infrastructure? Spencer’s patriotic boast is probably fair. CME is the world’s largest exchange and if it had serious short-term worries about London’s status as the European home for trading in fixed-income securities it would not be doing this deal – or not at a price that looks juicy, certainly for Spencer, who will collect £670m for his stake. That does not imply, of course, that Brexit threats to the City have gone away. It’s just that other areas of financial activity – especially fund management – look to be more directly in the firing line. And the long-term effect on the City of having EU financial regulation decided in Paris and Frankfurt remains the main story. The number of jobs being shifted immediately to the eurozone looks smaller than the scary numbers being advertised a year ago, but it’s the steady drip-drip over time that matters. So, yes, it is good news for the City that CME has agreed to place its European headquarters in London. If Spencer made that a condition of the deal, well played. Beyond the Brexit lens, though, this deal is mostly an example of Spencer’s deal-making skill. Back in 2016, when his former outfit Icap sold its voice broking business to Tullett Prebon for £1.4bn, the part that remained was disparagingly described as the “rump”. Spencer preferred Nex as a name and now this business is going for £3.9bn, a price that would have been hard to believe two years ago. It is the UK’s biggest fintech, or financial technology, company on some measures. One can bemoan its passing into US ownership, but remember that Spencer assembled Nex by buying important pieces in the US, Sweden and Israel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/05/data-valuable-citizens-silicon-valley-barcelona","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-05T12:33:46Z","webTitle":"Our data is valuable.

Here's how we can take that value back","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tech firms are emerging as new feudal lords. They control essential digital infrastructures – in this case, data and artificial intelligence – which are crucial for political and economic activity. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Have you ever asked yourself why the immense economic value that such data represents accrues exclusively to technology firms – and not to ordinary citizens or public institutions? We can return some of that value back to citizens. Here’s how. We badly need a new social pact on data that will make the most of our data while guaranteeing citizens’ rights to privacy and information self-determination. This will require reconquering critical digital infrastructures – long surrendered to the likes of Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft – and protecting citizens’ digital sovereignty. This should help in developing decentralized, privacy-enhancing and rights-preserving alternative data infrastructures. Given the gloomy state of politics on both sides of the Atlantic, this might seem mission impossible. And yet, there’s one bright spot on the horizon: cities. Cities can’t, of course, solve all our digital problems: many of them need urgent attention at the national and global level. But cities can run smart, data-intensive, algorithmic public transportation, housing, health and education – all based on a logic of solidarity, social cooperation and collective rights. Barcelona, for instance, is experimenting with socializing data in order to promote new cooperative approaches to solving common urban problems: tracking noise levels and improving air quality, to take just two examples. This data is collected via sensors operated by citizens with the city taking the lead in aggregating and acting upon such data. Incubating such innovative approaches that encourage the creation of new social rights to data is the objective of Decode, a project I lead with 13 partner organizations from across Europe, including the cities of Barcelona and Amsterdam. The Decode project develops decentralized technologies (such as the blockchain and attribute-based cryptography) to give people better control of their data generated both in their homes and in the city at large, in part by setting rules on who can access it, for what purposes, and on which terms. By helping citizens regain control of their data, we aspire to generate public value rather than private profit. Our goal is to create “data commons” from data produced by people, sensors and devices. A data commons is a shared resource that enables citizens to contribute, access and use the data – for instance about air quality, mobility or health – as a common good, without intellectual property rights restrictions. We envision data as public infrastructure alongside roads, electricity, water and clean air. However, we are not building a new Panopticon. Citizens will set the anonymity level, so that they can’t be identified without explicit consent. And they will keep control and ownership over data once they share it for the common good. This common data infrastructure will remain open to local companies, co-ops and social organizations that can build data-driven services and create long-term public value. Involving citizens in Amsterdam and Barcelona, Decode addresses real-world problems, for instance, it’s integrated with the participation platform decidim.barcelona, already used by thousands of citizens to shape the city’s policy agenda. Rather than using the personal information of voters (furnished by the likes of Cambridge Analytica) for manipulation, we plan to use data-intensive platforms to boost political participation and make politicians more accountable. We must challenge the current narrative dominated by Silicon Valley’s leaky surveillance capitalism and dystopian models such as China’s social credit system. A New Deal on data, based on a rights-based, people-centric framework, which does not exploit personal data to pay for critical infrastructure, is long overdue. In May, Europe will pass data protection rules based on worthy principles such as “privacy by design” and “data portability”. Coupled with new regulatory instruments in the areas of taxation and antitrust, such bold interventions can create alternatives where citizens have greater power over their data and the artificial intelligence-powered future built with it. Cities such as Barcelona are happy to show the way. Francesca Bria is the chief technology and digital innovation officer for the city of Barcelona.

Of the eight matches between English and Irish teams in the 2015-16 Champions Cup seven were won by Premiership sides. Leinster’s home victory over Bath proved the exception. “Anglo-French dominance is removing the shine from European rugby and don’t expect that to change,” ran one headline. But change it has. The Anglo-Irish record in the Champions Cup this season is the reverse of two seasons ago, with the provinces recording seven victories and the Premiership recording only one, Wasps at home to Ulster in the final set of group matches. Leinster and Munster were the top two seeds while another Pro14 side, the Scarlets, beat La Rochelle in Friday’s quarter-final. However, the Leinster and Ireland second-row Devin Toner takes no encouragement from this. “The record of the Irish sides against the English in Europe this season does not matter this weekend,” he says. “We take a lot of pride in this competition and have a lot of good history in it but we are not looking at statistics. Saracens are a very good side and we know what a challenge it will be.” Two years ago Saracens won the Champions Cup a few months after England had achieved their first Six Nations grand slam for 13 years and Ireland failed to provide a quarter-finalist in Europe for the first time since 1998 and won two games; there was a feeling there had been a sea-change in the European game. Money was talking. English and French clubs had succeeded in making the Champions Cup a tournament that was run by clubs rather than unions, with participation based on merit rather than geography. The Premiership and the Top 14 in France were commercially vibrant and the then Pro12 trailed a distant third in terms of finance. Now, two weeks after Ireland defeated England at Twickenham to secure the grand slam, the talk in rugby is not of financial muscle but the ability to rest leading players throughout the season as the game becomes ever more physically demanding. England’s debrief after a Six Nations campaign in which they slipped from first to fifth concluded there were two main areas that needed addressing: the breakdown and discipline. The Pro14 allows more of a contest for possession after a tackle than the Premiership, something that has filtered into Test rugby this season to England’s discomfiture. The quarter-final at the Aviva Stadium will be refereed by a Frenchman, Jérôme Garcès, but he gave Wales latitude to compete at the breakdown when they played England at Twickenham in February. “The breakdown may be a factor,” says Toner. “I have never played in the Premiership but there are a number of good poachers in the Pro14. It is a facet of the game that we like with the aim of securing quick ball for the backs.” Leinster’s attacking game is masterminded by the former England head coach Stuart Lancaster, who was last week compared with the Ireland coach, Joe Schmidt, by Jamie Heaslip. The former Lions and Leinster No 8 cursed the fact he had had to retire through injury because he enjoyed playing the Lancaster way. Standing in Lancaster’s and Leinster’s way will be a former Ireland international, Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby. One of the most innovative attacks in the game will face one of the most aggressive defences. While Saracens struggled to get out of the group stage, not least because of the injuries they accumulated, they have reached the last eight for the seventh consecutive season and have not lost a quarter-final since 2012. It may be first seeds against eighth but little separates the sides. “There is no way we will be taking anything for granted,” says Toner. “They will be a huge challenge with the talent they have. What has happened in Europe so far and Ireland winning the grand slam are all out of the window. A quarter‑final is all about the 80 minutes and we know they will come out with all guns blazing.” The sides have won the tournament five times between them. “Leinster are the top seeds and their Irish players have just come off a grand slam so they will rightly be hot favourites for this game and beyond,” says McCall. “But we do not fear playing away from home and our players relish big occasions. We are going to have to get a lot of things right and we are capable of doing that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/03/museum-of-banned-objects-imagining-future-without-contraception-planned-parenthood","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T16:53:35Z","webTitle":"Museum of Banned Objects imagines a dystopian future without contraception","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/03/museum-of-banned-objects-imagining-future-without-contraception-planned-parenthood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/03/museum-of-banned-objects-imagining-future-without-contraception-planned-parenthood","fields":{"headline":"Museum of Banned Objects imagines a dystopian future without contraception","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the Gallery at the Ace Hotel in New York sits eight items, ranging from Plan B to a contraceptive sponge, in glass vitrines. Beside them are placards referring to these items in the past tense, as though they are artifacts from a bygone era. “Levonorgestrel was a hormonal medication used to prevent pregnancy,” reads the placard next to a box of Plan B, referred to by its medical name. “A few years prior to its ban, landmark legislation had passed to allow people of any age to buy Levonorgestrel without a prescription.” As part of a month-long exhibition called the Museum of Banned Objects, these items are meant to suggest a dystopian future in which contraceptive and reproductive health products are prohibited, forcing viewers to reckon with the possibility of an expansive rollback of reproductive rights. Conceived of by Ellie Sachs and Matt Starr, a pair of New York-based artists, in tandem with Planned Parenthood, the exhibition takes objects like Truvada and oral contraceptives and presents them in isolation, amplifying a sense of stigma and scarcity. A box of spermicide, for instance, the vaginal contraceptive film first used in ancient Egypt, appears worn and tattered, the words on the label slightly obscured by rust. Next to a latex condom, the description reads: “Right before their ban, about four to six million condoms a years were sold in the United States.” The two were inspired by the ways dystopian worlds as presented in television and film, like those of The Handmaid’s Tale, were beginning to resemble reality, as well as initiatives that encourage abstinence training rather than safe-sex education and cuts to government programs like Medicaid. News items played a part in motivating the exhibition, too, like a Washington Post report from late 2017 detailing a list of words – including “vulnerable”, “diversity”, “transgender” and “science-based” – supposedly banned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While it was later clarified that career CDC officials discouraged employees from using those words in budget requests to stave off cuts to funding by a Trump administration averse to Obama-era programs and public health initiatives, Sachs and Starr nevertheless found the story “pretty telling”. “We wanted to create a reality to avoid another possible reality,” Starr explains. “Art helps us take abstract ideas that we’re constantly reading and talking about and visualize them into something that can help us understand the real severity of things now.” Sachs adds: “We’re interested in providing a glimpse into a dystopian reality as a forewarning. Sometimes you have to completely reframe an idea for it to stick or take hold.” When the artists conceived of the idea for the exhibition, they contacted Caren Spruch, director of arts and entertainment engagement at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. By collaborating with a nonprofit that provides reproductive healthcare to over 2.5 million patients per year, and whose federal funding has been under threat as recently as last year’s Obamacare repeal bill, the project conveys a greater sense of urgency. “Instead of it just being an imagined future,” Sachs explains, “it reminds the viewer that this is actually already happening in some capacity, albeit on a smaller scale.” “Art can drive social change and help shape a world that is fairer and more just by powering awareness, defiance, resistance and change,” says Spruch. “We appreciate Sachs and Starr’s work to use their passion and creativity to resist and bring attention to protecting access to birth control for everyone.” The exhibition is of a piece with the themes present in Starr and Sachs’ work: the two host a monthly curated dinner series at Whole Foods, where guests discuss contemporary politics. At one dinner in late 2017, the topic du jour was nuclear tensions between the US and North Korea. Last year the pair also remade the classic film Annie Hall, this time entirely with a cast of senior citizens. Sachs, who directs and acts in theatre productions at maximum-security prisons, recently spearheaded a production of On the Waterfront at the Sing Sing correctional facility in Ossining, New York. When asked about the power of social justice art and the choice to look at reproductive rights through the lens of a dystopian future, Sachs invokes the famous Gore Vidal quote: “We are the United States of Amnesia, we learn nothing because we remember nothing.” “America has a strange relationship with past, present and future,” she adds. “Things repeat themselves but manifest with slightly different calibrations. By placing these objects in cases they suddenly become more precious and important.” The Museum of Banned Objects will be on exhibition at the Gallery at Ace Hotel New York through the month of April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/31/stansted-airport-flights-resume-after-shuttle-bus-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T08:59:04Z","webTitle":"Stansted airport flights resume after shuttle bus fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/31/stansted-airport-flights-resume-after-shuttle-bus-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/31/stansted-airport-flights-resume-after-shuttle-bus-fire","fields":{"headline":"Stansted airport flights resume after shuttle bus fire","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Flights from Stansted airport have resumed after a fire on a passenger shuttle bus forced departures to be cancelled. The bus burst into flames at around 4.20pm on Friday, belching thick black smoke that clouded much of the front of the terminal building. No one was injured but passengers described an atmosphere of confusion in the aftermath as flight details disappeared from departure boards. The airport in Essex cancelled all departing flights until midnight but services resumed as normal on Saturday. Airport bosses have advised passengers to check flights with their airlines. “Following the earlier incident involving a shuttle bus fire on the terminal forecourt, we confirm that the airport will be open tomorrow [Saturday] and flights are expected to operate as normal,” the airport wrote on Twitter. “Passengers are advised to check the latest flight information with their airlines.” The bus, which was outside the terminal entrance, was alight when firefighters appeared on the scene and the blaze was completely extinguished by 5.02pm, Essex fire and rescue service said. Passengers were told to leave the area and advised to rebook flights. Several travellers expressed disappointment at how the evacuation was handled. Taylor Fulton-Ward, 18, from Hertfordshire, who was flying to Dublin with her family for the Easter weekend, said people were “pushing and panicking” after some doors were not open to allow people to leave. She said: “We arrived at the airport and after a lot of waiting we got through security and staff told us all flights were running but delayed. “After an hour, our flight disappeared from the board with no communication. We went back through to check in to try and re-book the flight but the crowds were crazy. “Announcements were telling us to leave the building, but the doors were not open – so people began pushing and panicking. The biggest problem was not being able to get out the doors and a lack of communication.” Evan Roth tweeted: “We’re at Ryanair Gate 57 waiting with hundreds of people with no communication from anyone and we were just told that we now have to leave and go through security again because people had to go through security without being checked in order to evacuate.” A spokesman for the airport, which is the fourth busiest in the UK, said some exits were cordoned off to protect passengers from the burning bus, which was very close to some of the doors, and staff guided passengers to alternative exits. Some passengers were given the option of having their luggage mailed to their home address if they needed to leave the airport quickly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/31/kanye-west-rise-fashion-virgil-abloh-louis-vuitton","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T23:01:02Z","webTitle":"The rise and rise of Kanye West’s influence on fashion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/31/kanye-west-rise-fashion-virgil-abloh-louis-vuitton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/31/kanye-west-rise-fashion-virgil-abloh-louis-vuitton","fields":{"headline":"The rise and rise of Kanye West’s influence on fashion","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In 2014 Kanye West famously criticised the fashion industry for discriminating against him for being famous and black. “Cause you know damn well there aren’t no black guys or celebrities making no Louis Vuitton nothing,” he announced, mid-performance at London’s Wireless festival. Less than four years later, partly as a result of West’s influence, the fashion landscape seems to have significantly shifted. Last week his friend and collaborator Virgil Abloh was appointed men’s artistic director of Louis Vuitton, in one of the most dramatic shake-ups in recent menswear history. Two weeks ago UK streetwear label A Cold Wall – founded by Abloh’s former creative consultant, Samuel Ross – was announced as a finalist (and favourite to win) in the prestigious LVMH prize for new talent. Elsewhere West’s former art director Heron Preston has collaborated with Nasa for autumn/winter 2018 and launched his first womenswear line. And Matthew Williams of Alyx Studios, who was part of the rapper’s design agency, Donda, has also become a rising star. Given that all these can trace their influence back to West, is fashion witnessing the Kanye effect? Abloh has been tipped for the top job at a fashion house for months but his move to one of the biggest labels marks a huge shift in direction for high-end menswear. Not only will Abloh become one of the most influential designers at a major label – other top black designers include Olivier Rousteing at Balmain and previously Ozwald Boateng at Givenchy – when he shows in June, his appointment also proves that streetwear is no longer the antithesis of catwalk fashion. Abloh is the 37-year-old behind fashion label Off-White. He trained as an architect and engineer, and also worked as a DJ and designer, he has little formal fashion training. Instead he has an ability to speak to a younger generation and turn a lifestyle into a fully-realised product. “Virgil creates hype and no brand can argue in this current climate that they don’t need hype,” says Ellie Pithers, fashion features editor of British Vogue. “He understands the crossover between athletic wear and high fashion. [It] makes sense for a brand like Louis Vuitton, which started as a luggage manufacturer rather than a couture house.” “Virgil is incredibly good at creating bridges between the classic and the zeitgeist,” Michael Burke, chief executive of Louis Vuitton, told the New York Times. Burke met Abloh over a decade ago when the designer was interning at Fendi and Burke was the Italian label’s chief executive. If the appointment of a designer who described his label as an “art project” is dividing some critics, Alec Leach of influential streetwear site Highsnobiety is unfazed. “I can’t say I’m massively surprised,” he says. “It just goes to show that streetwear is the norm now. I think it’s more significant for fashion than it is for streetwear, which has been leading the conversation for years.” Leach sees Abloh’s lack of formal training as a non-issue. “I’m not convinced by the idea that you have to be technically proficient to be part of the conversation.” Louis Vuitton is estimated to be fashion conglomerate LVMH’s top-selling brand, with annual sales of more than €9bn (£7.9bn), the largest in the luxury industry. In handing the baton to a young, black American from Illinois with almost no fashion training, LVMH is showing an increased recognition of the power of streetwear, a contentious term sometimes deemed to be racial code but which Abloh uses freely. Just last autumn Vuitton collaborated with the skateboarding label Supreme. Yet less than 20 years ago it issued a cease-and-desist order after Supreme put Vuitton’s monogram on its skateboards. Vogue’s Pithers thinks West’s influence reflects a new direction in commercial design. “When you look at how well he knows how to design, market and sell clothing, at a time when fashion and retail is struggling to connect with young people, he comes off as a very successful definition of a fashion designer,” she said. Boima Tucker, an American-Sierra Leonean DJ and producer who knew Abloh’s work long before Off-White, thinks Kanye West’s rise to fame was achieved through old-fashioned “hard graft”. To him, West as a fashion phenomenon is fuelled by social media “[blurring] the line between underground and commercial … Of course you’re gonna buy the Kanye shoe and support his team if you like his album, because you’ve bought into his lifestyle.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/30/tiger-woods-masters-walking-miracle","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T20:18:37Z","webTitle":"Tiger Woods targets Masters title and claims to be a ‘walking miracle’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/30/tiger-woods-masters-walking-miracle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/30/tiger-woods-masters-walking-miracle","fields":{"headline":"Tiger Woods targets Masters title and claims to be a ‘walking miracle’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tiger Woods described himself “a walking miracle” as he prepared to return to major championship action at the Masters. Next week will mark the former world No 1’s first appearance at Augusta National since 2015. Wood has suffered persistent back troubles, which culminated recently in fusion surgery. “I got a second chance on life, I am a walking miracle,” he said. Woods has the same aspiration as always at what he called “the best-run tournament in the world”. The 14-times major champion added: “I’m just there to win.” Ian Poulter’s hopes of joining Woods in the Masters field received a huge boost as the Englishman hit a second-round 64 at the Houston Open. Poulter’s opening score of 73 had left him 124th in the field. “Are you going to pack your suitcase, throw it in your car and go home or go out there and play?” Poulter said. “I rolled a few putts in and moved up the leaderboard. “I actually played all right yesterday. That’s why I was so angry, because I wasn’t that bad and wanted to give myself a chance.” Shane Lowry’s consecutive 68s leave him eight under and a shot ahead of Poulter. The Irishman is also chasing the Houston win that would earn him the last available Masters berth. “I have a flight booked home to Ireland next Friday and if I have to change that, it’s a good problem,” Lowry said. “I’m a long way from thinking about that just now. Hopefully I can get myself right there on Sunday afternoon, then it’s something to think about. “ I have played the last three Masters so to not be there would be disappointing but I badly need a good week on this tour.

The new characters – dubbed Brexit Bulldog and Starry Blue – are part of plans by an Italian emoji firm to cash in on the Brexit debate. A paid-for app download is due to be launched on Sunday, giving people the option to use the emojis to give their social-media profiles a Brexit “brand identity”. Brexit is one of the most used words in British social-media conversations and the developers believe that if this can be monetised, the proceeds could be enormous. Brexit Bulldog sports a Churchillian cigar and bowler hat, exuding defiant belligerence. By contrast, Starry Blue has the yellow stars of the European flag for eyes and wears a French beret and a broad grin. Negotiations are under way with software companies to install the emojis. Users could pay for them or gain access for free by completing a quiz about their politics. But MPs have attacked the company after plans for the “Brexiji” app were leaked to the all-party parliamentary group on new social media. The European Collective – a group of pro-Brexit Conservative MPs –and the Remain Group – an umbrella organisation representing pro-EU MPs – both condemned the app as “making money out of politics”. “Nobody who campaigned in the referendum wanted to give shadowy organisations the chance to exploit British voters,” the groups said in a joint statement. “Brexit is far too serious a matter for foolish jokes.” A former employee of the firm behind the scheme, Riccardo Nicoletti, told the Observer the app developers had originally been motivated by “genuine concern” that emojis were being misinterpreted. “People have put the British flag and the EU flag in their profiles on Twitter and Instagram,” he said. “Then they have to use other things to make their point, like ‘heart’ or ‘poo’ or ‘clown face with blond hair’.” Most emojis are free, but the Italian firm believes that even if few voters are prepared to pay for the app, plenty of political campaign groups “will happily spend other people’s money to get an advantage”, Nicoletti said. “You’ve got the Remainers, the Brexiters and the Russian trolls. Some senior managers believe there are enough fake accounts on Twitter alone to make it the break-out app of the year. Our focus groups also showed that there were people who would use the emoji because they just want someone to tell them what Brexit means.” Government sources indicated that if the Gibraltar-based company pressed ahead with the launch, ministers might look at imposing a post-Brexit import tariff on emojis. “I’m sure the social media companies will be watching this closely,” said Daly Best, the chairman of Youth Systems, a social media thinktank. “Political emojis could be a great way to restore trust in social media.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/31/armistice-centenary-theatre-tribute-unknown-warrior-dover","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T23:05:03Z","webTitle":"Dover turns clock back a century to welcome home Unknown Soldier … again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/31/armistice-centenary-theatre-tribute-unknown-warrior-dover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/mar/31/armistice-centenary-theatre-tribute-unknown-warrior-dover","fields":{"headline":"Dover turns clock back a century to welcome home Unknown Soldier … again","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In 1916, the Rev David Railton, a former curate in Folkestone, was serving as a chaplain on the western front in France when he came across a makeshift grave in the back garden of a house at Armentières. The wooden cross above it bore the pencilled words “An Unknown British Soldier”. Two years later, after armistice, Railton remembered that simple cross and suggested Britain might commemorate its own unknown warrior as a symbol of the many anonymous dead left in France. This November, a century after the first world war ended, the port of Dover is to stage a large-scale theatrical event to commemorate the arrival of that chosen soldier’s body back in Britain. The planned performance, announced in the Observer today, will involve drama, music, dance, digital art and a simulated “time tunnel”, and will be led by the Marlowe theatre in Canterbury. The Return Of The Unknown is to be performed with a company of 400 volunteers from across Kent and will centre on Dover marine station, where the unidentified soldier’s body arrived back in Britain in 1920. The railway terminal on the western docks was also the embarkation point for many soldiers leaving Britain for the last time and the place where 1.26 million wounded servicemen returned. Sir Michael Morpurgo, author of War Horse, and patron of the Marlowe theatre, spoke in support of the project this weekend. “How should we remember? We can’t. They are all gone. All we can remember is what they have done, and the peace they gave us, a peace we must hold dear. All we can do is sing the anthem; tell the story,” he said, adding that it is “wonderful” that the Marlowe will continue to tell the story with a new production set in a place “with so many stories to tell”. The Return Of The Unknown is written by the Marlowe’s James Baldwin and directed by his colleague Andy Dawson, while the Jasmin Vardimon Company will train 60 young dancers. The people of Kent are also being asked for stories, poems and photographs from the first world war to form part of an exhibition. “We were inspired by the space really,” the show’s producer, Fiona Banks, said. “And by the extraordinary numbers of the wounded that returned there. And then of course there are some wonderful descriptions of how the band played Land of Hope and Glory to the crowds as the Unknown Warrior arrived two years after the war. This is the right moment to mark it, as we remember the centenary. We really want to tell the story of this homecoming.” In 1920 the task of finding an unidentified body to represent so many dead fell to another army chaplain, the Rev George Kendall. He and a team of five exhumed the remains of several candidates from battlefield cemeteries thought to have included sites at the Aisne, the Somme, Arras and Ypres. They were brought to a military base at Saint Pol, near Arras in France, on 7 November. Kendall, who died in 1961, never revealed where the remains were found. “But again I stress this great fact,” he once wrote. “The soldier lying in Westminster Abbey is British and unknown. He may have come from some little village or some city in this land, and he may be the son of a working man or of a rich man, ‘Unknown to man, but known to God’.” The final selection of the warrior was made by the officer in charge of troops in France and Flanders, Brigadier General L J Wyatt. He simply placed his hand on one coffin, it is believed. The next day this coffin was taken to Boulogne and placed inside another, made of oak sent over from Hampton Court. It carried the inscription, “A British Warrior who fell in the Great War 1914-1918 for King and Country” and had a 16th century sword from King George V’s private collection placed on the lid. The oak coffin reached Dover aboard the destroyer HMS Verdun and went on to London by train. On the morning of 11 November, exactly two years after the end of the war, it was drawn on a gun carriage through London to Whitehall, where the new cenotaph was unveiled by George V. A two-minute silence followed at 11am and then the cortege moved on to Westminster Abbey for the burial at the west end of the nave, after passing through a guard of honour of 100 holders of the Victoria Cross. The grave was filled with earth from French battlefields and the tomb inscribed with words from the Bible: “They buried him among the kings, because he had done good toward God and toward his house.” At the same moment in Paris, at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe, France buried its own Soldat Inconnu. In the week after the interment an estimated 1,250,000 visited the abbey to pay their respects, and in October the following year, Britain’s unknown soldier was awarded the US Medal of Honor. Railton, who earned a Military Cross for a rescue carried out under heavy fire on the Somme, returned to Kent after the war to work as a parish priest in Margate, despite suffering severe depression. The “padre’s flag” he once used as an altar cloth and shroud in France was consecrated after the burial of the Unknown Warrior and now hangs in Westminster Abbey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/30/middlesbrough-wolves-championship-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T18:35:59Z","webTitle":"Nine-man Wolves beat Middlesbrough to stay six points clear at top","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/30/middlesbrough-wolves-championship-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/30/middlesbrough-wolves-championship-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Nine-man Wolves beat Middlesbrough to stay six points clear at the top","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rúben Neves and Matt Doherty were sent off as Wolves lost their tempers on Teesside but even the reduction to nine men failed to prevent Nuno Espírito Santo’s side from extending an apparently unassailable lead at the top of the Championship. While three wins would guarantee Wolves promotion, Tony Pulis’s Middlesbrough cling to sixth place on goal difference. If they are to reach, let alone win, the play-offs, a team increasingly built around the attacking talents of Adama Traoré will need to be rather more ruthless than this. Although the largely isolated Patrick Bamford registered his ninth goal in seven games with a brilliant 94th-minute volley, it was too little too late. “I’m really disappointed; nine men behind the ball can make it difficult for you but we lacked a bit of quality,” said Pulis, whose midfield sat deep and lacked invention. Boro’s manager suffered the indignity of a seemingly out of control Nuno declining to shake his hand at the final whistle before provocatively, manically, jumping up and down in celebration in front of him. It was needless and hardly classy, and stewards, sensing potential trouble, surrounded the pair. Pulis, though, played things down. “It don’t make no difference to me,” he said. “It would have been different if I’d known him but I don’t know the fellow.” Nuno claimed the indiscipline stemmed from the referee’s perceived failure to send off George Friend for a supposedly “professional” foul on Hélder Costa that many neutrals interpreted as a dive on the forward’s part. “A bad decision caused the emotions,” said a manager whose otherwise elegant side’s often rough treatment of Traoré in a game of two red cards and eight yellows showed Wolves know how to play tough. “It was difficult to keep calm. Both teams lost control. It was crazy.” And his celebration? “I jumped in the air. I was very happy.” An absorbing first half was littered with evidence revealing precisely why Wolves are cantering to the title, not to mention why Traoré is arguably the division’s most dangerous attacking force and why Neves’s excellent central midfield skills will surely enhance the Premier League. By the end of it Darren Randolph had made a couple of exceptional saves following subtly swerving long-range Neves shots and the visitors had scored twice. After Randolph saved from Costa, Ivan Cavaleiro performed wonders to keep the ball in play, permitting it to fall to Barry Douglas, whose audaciously chipped, high-calibre pass was volleyed home, left-footed, by Costa. The second goal arrived from a corner after Randolph could only parry Willy Boly’s header and Cavaleiro headed in the rebound but, until then Wolves had looked unusually fragile whenever Traoré had run at Boly, the left-sided element of Nuno’s back three. Boro though failed to capitalise when Neves was sent off after receiving his second yellow card in as few minutes. Newly booked for dissent, he then slid recklessly into a lunge on Friend. Minutes earlier Nuno had turned incandescent in the wake of the Friend/Costa non-sending off but replays suggested contact was minimal and Stuart Attwell’s decision correct. Bamford, set up superbly by Traoré, lost his footing while shaping to shoot, and Doherty lost his composure, catching Friend’s head with an elbow as they challenged for a high ball and seeing a second yellow card and dismissal. Even though Bamford’s stunning volley eventually eluded John Ruddy and Stewart Downing shot wide, Nuno’s nine men somehow held on. “It’s massive,” Nuno said. “A massive win.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/30/arnold-schwarzenegger-undergoes-open-heart-surgery","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T18:43:08Z","webTitle":"Arnold Schwarzenegger undergoes heart surgery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/30/arnold-schwarzenegger-undergoes-open-heart-surgery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/30/arnold-schwarzenegger-undergoes-open-heart-surgery","fields":{"headline":"Arnold Schwarzenegger undergoes heart surgery","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Arnold Schwarzenegger had heart surgery in Los Angeles on Thursday, his representative has confirmed. The former California governor and Terminator actor underwent surgery to replace a pulmonic valve, a spokesman, Daniel Ketchell, said in a statement. Schwarzenegger originally had the valve replaced in 1997 to counter a congenital heart defect. Ketchell said Thursday’s operation was a planned procedure to replace that same valve. “That 1997 replacement valve was never meant to be permanent and has outlived its life expectancy, so he chose to replace it yesterday through a less-invasive catheter valve replacement,” Ketchell said. The spokesman claimed Schwarzenegger’s first words upon waking from the operation were “I’m back”. The celebrity news website TMZ had reported early on Friday that Schwarzenegger had undergone “emergency open-heart surgery”, sparking a wave of news coverage, but Ketchell said that although an open-heart surgery team had attended the operation, they were only there as a precaution. “They frequently are in these circumstances, in case the catheter procedure was unable to be performed,” Ketchell said. “Governor Schwarzenegger’s pulmonic valve was successfully replaced.” Schwarzenegger, 70, was 49 when he had his first heart surgery. “Choosing to undergo open-heart surgery when I never felt sick was the hardest decision I’ve ever made,” Schwarzenegger said at the time. The actor, who served as governor of California from 2003 to 2011, has been most active recently in his role as a Donald Trump antagonist. Schwarzenegger has criticized Trump over his response to the violence in Charlottesville – Trump defended far-right marchers – and over the president’s tax reforms. In 2017, James Cameron, who wrote and directed the first two Terminator films, said Schwarzenegger had signed up to appear in a sixth Terminator movie. The film will be set in Mexico City, although it is not clear when it will be released."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/mar/31/teachers-poll-reveals-impact-of-cuts-on-english-state-schools","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Teachers' poll reveals impact of cuts on English state schools","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/31/teachers-poll-reveals-impact-of-cuts-on-english-state-schools","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/mar/31/teachers-poll-reveals-impact-of-cuts-on-english-state-schools","fields":{"headline":"Teachers' poll reveals impact of cuts on English state schools","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Teachers are reporting more pupils being squeezed into classrooms, and “filthy” working conditions because of fewer cleaners, as budget cuts take effect on state schools across England, according to a survey of teachers belonging to the National Education Union. In a straw poll of 900 members, the country’s largest union reported that one in five said their schools were asking parents for financial contributions as a result of budget pressures, while two-thirds said funding for special needs provision had been cut. Schools also appear to be using redundancies among staff to reduce costs, according to the NEU’s joint general secretary Kevin Courtney, with almost one in five reporting compulsory staff cuts. Courtney said an 11-year-old currently in a state school in England would have been only a year old when the financial crisis struck in 2008, but was still suffering from the fallout in terms of austerity and spending cuts. “This generation of children should not still be paying the price of the global financial crisis,” Courtney said. Three-quarters of secondary school teachers who responded to the survey said their class sizes were higher than previous years, with Courtney telling of one secondary school with 37 pupils in one maths class. Almost half of those teachers who responded to the NEU survey said their schools had asked parents to pay for particular items, including textbooks and materials for art or design classes. But a spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “By 2020, core school funding will rise to a record £43.5bn – 50% more per pupil in real terms than in 2000 – and the introduction of the national funding formula will address historic disparities in the system. “We trust schools to manage their own budgets, but offer support to help them get the most out of every pound they spend.” The NEU conference is due to debate a series of motions on school funding and teacher pay during its conference in Brighton over Easter. The NEU is made up of the recent merger between the National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, with the Brighton conference being the last of its sort for the NUT section of the new union. Next year the two unions will hold a joint conference. Meanwhile, a survey conducted by the NASUWT teachers’ union – holding its annual conference in Birmingham – has suggested that almost one in 10 teachers in England have been sexually harassed by pupils, while several had “upskirt” images taken by them in the workplace. The survey found 81% felt they had suffered sexual harassment or bullying since entering the profession, including instances of harassment by other staff members. Chris Keates, the NASUWT’s general secretary, also reported issues of pupils goading teachers in order to secretly film videos for social media. “We’ve even had cases where pupils have staged an incident in the classroom, videoed it, and then put the video up on to YouTube which shows the teacher either being put under pressure or being given the runaround by pupils, to try and get the teacher to react in some way so that it would make a good video,” Keates told the Press Association."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/30/facebook-staff-leaks-memo-andrew-bosworth","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T18:21:44Z","webTitle":"Internal posts show Facebook workers condemning leakers and fearing 'spies'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/30/facebook-staff-leaks-memo-andrew-bosworth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/30/facebook-staff-leaks-memo-andrew-bosworth","fields":{"headline":"Internal posts show Facebook workers condemning leakers and fearing 'spies'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook employees are calling for a crackdown on suspected leakers and questioning whether “spies” have infiltrated the corporation, according to leaked internal posts that suggest the social media giant’s workforce is becoming defensive in the face of critical public scrutiny. The posts were a response to the leak of a memo by a senior Facebook executive who defended the social network’s negative effects on society. While Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, publicly sought to distance himself from the controversial memo, many of his staff, it appears, focused their ire on the leaker, lashing out at disloyalty within the company. The extraordinary messages obtained by tech website the Verge provide a rare window into Facebook’s internal culture: while there was dissent from employees, many appeared focused on flushing out whistleblowers. “Leakers, please resign instead of sabotaging the company,” one wrote in response to a note Bosworth sent this week addressing the controversy. “How fucking terrible that some irresponsible jerk decided he or she had some god complex that jeopardizes our inner culture and something that makes Facebook great?” another said. Facebook has come under unprecedented scrutiny in months, which intensified in the wake of reporting in the Observer and the Guardian revealing that the personal information of 50 million users was used by the electioneering firm Cambridge Analytica. The crisis has wiped billions off Facebook’s stock and Zuckerberg is expected to be grilled before the US Congress in the coming weeks. On Thursday, BuzzFeed published the 2016 memo from Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, in which he acknowledged that Facebook’s expansion could lead to deaths and help terrorists plan attacks, but argued those were reasonable consequences of the company’s broader “growth tactics” and mission to “connect” people, writing that “anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good”. (Bosworth subsequently distanced himself from his own memo, claiming it was intended to be provocative, adding: “I didn’t agree with it even when I wrote it.”) However, the Verge found employees directing their frustration at the leaker, urging Facebook to do more to screen employees for “integrity” during hiring, with one writing: “Although we all subconsciously look for signal on integrity in interviews, should we consider whether this needs to be formalized in the interview process?” Another said: “This is so disappointing, wonder if there is a way to hire for integrity. We are probably focusing on the intelligence part and getting smart people here who lack a moral compass and loyalty.” Another lamented that leakers were inevitable, writing: “We have our representative share of sick people, drug addicts, wife beaters, and suicide bombers. Some of this cannot be mitigated by training. To me, this makes it just a matter of time.” Some employees went so far as to speculate that people could be joining Facebook for the purpose of monitoring and leaking. “Keep in mind that leakers could be intentionally placed bad actors, not just employees making a one-off bad decision. Thinking adversarially, if I wanted info from Facebook, the easiest path would be to get people hired into low-level employee or contract roles,” one wrote. Another added: “Imagine that some percentage of leakers are spies for governments. A call to morals or problems of performance would be irrelevant in this case, because dissolution is the intent of those actors.” Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on Friday about the leaked posts. In a memo to staff this week addressing the scandal, also obtained by the Verge, Bosworth also focused on the leak of his memo, complaining that the release of the document forced him to delete the original post. “If we have to live in fear that even our bad ideas will be exposed then we won’t explore them or understand them as such, we won’t clearly label them as such, we run a much greater risk of stumbling on them later. Conversations go underground or don’t happen at all.” Facebook and other big tech companies are known for aggressively monitoring their own employees and swiftly punishing people who get caught leaking. A recent Guardian investigation uncovered details of Facebook’s so-called “rat-catching” team, which conducts intense surveillance on workers and fired one employee who leaked innocuous information to the press, based on records of a screenshot he had taken and links he had clicked or hovered over on his computer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/mar/31/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league-anfield","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T19:00:20Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp’s call for Anfield intensity against City has rich heritage | Andy Hunter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/mar/31/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league-anfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/mar/31/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league-anfield","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp’s call for Anfield intensity against City has rich heritage","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Times have certainly changed since the September night in 1978 when Nottingham Forest’s team coach rolled up late to a European Cup tie at Liverpool with Bill Shankly sat up front alongside Brian Clough. The players who usurped Liverpool as European champions that season never asked Clough why he invited the Anfield icon on board, though suspected it was part of their manager’s attempts to defuse the tension and animosity that surrounded the visit to Bob Paisley’s holders. All-English European ties have tended to carry a similar edge ever since. Anfield on Wednesday will be no exception. Within minutes of arguably the Premier League’s two most exhilarating teams being drawn together in the Champions League quarter-finals, a call went out on social media for Liverpool fans to give Manchester City the kind of pyrotechnic, frenzied “welcome” that accompanied the team’s pursuit of the 2014 title and 2016 Europa League. City, mindful of previous hostile receptions for their players and supporters, raised safety concerns with Liverpool and Merseyside police, who have warned of prosecution for anyone found guilty of “dangerous and reckless” behaviour. The warning will not dilute the atmosphere inside the stadium, however, and caution is unlikely to enter the philosophy of Jürgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola as they renew a rivalry that can only intensify on the Champions League stage. There exists a healthy respect between the former managers of Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. Klopp, talking before Liverpool’s last-16 rout in Porto, described City as “probably the strongest team in Europe at the minute” and their manager as the perfect fit for a club that crave success with fluent, offensive football. Guardiola, despite the disappointment of seeing City’s unbeaten Premier League campaign ending at Anfield in January, was genuine in his praise of the pressing game from Liverpool that ensured “we lost a little bit of our control”. Anfield can do that to opponents, especially in Europe, as Clough recognised 40 years ago. “He wanted us to walk in front of the Kop,” recalls Garry Birtles of Forest’s pre-match routine for the European Cup first round, second leg at Anfield. The team coach, Shankly up top, had arrived only half an hour before kick-off. “Anfield was the most hostile place I’d ever been but Clough insisted on it. He sent us out there to make it clear we respected them but it was effectively us saying: ‘You can sing You’ll Never Walk Alone until you are hoarse but it won’t make any difference.’ “Liverpool’s fans despised us. The sight of us strolling around laughing and joking riled them. They were booing us, throwing oranges and everything they could get their hands on. A tennis ball came on the pitch. John Robertson flicked it up, volleyed it and stuck it in the top corner of the net. All of a sudden the mood changed and the Kop started to applaud.” A goalless second leg sent England’s champions through at the expense of the then European champions Liverpool, following a 2-0 first leg win at the City Ground. Birtles opened the scoring in the home tie, his first Forest goal, and created the second in the 87th minute for Colin Barrett. It is the ferocity on the pitch that Birtles remembers most. The former striker, who admits to having “two or three pints” the night before the first leg, says: “At 1-0, Phil Thompson ran past me and said: ‘One won’t be enough.’ He almost spat out the words.” After Barrett’s volley Birtles retorted: “One not enough, Phil? Will two do us then?’ There was no way I should have been doing that to a seasoned England international. His face was like thunder. I must have been mad, especially with [Graeme] Souness in their team.” The song that starts “We hate Nottingham Forest” echoes from the Kop to this day. Similarly, contempt between Liverpool and Chelsea increased when they opposed each other 10 times in the Champions League between April 2005 and 2009. Relations between Liverpool and City are civil by comparison to the rivalry that shattered the cordiality between Rafael Benítez and José Mourinho, although the quarter-final does have parallels with the volatile opening act of their European saga. Not tactically, of course. As with the Champions League semi-final of 2005, Liverpool’s opponents are cruising towards a manager’s first Premier League title. It was City who denied Klopp a first and early piece of silverware at Liverpool in the 2016 League Cup final, just as Chelsea did to Benítez in the same competition in 2005. The German coach believes there would be a different view of his reign, or more specifically the nagging doubt about his team, had they prevailed on penalties at Wembley or against Sevilla in that year’s Europa League final. “In this moment it’s always: ‘Liverpool are good but …’ We know that,” he said recently. “If we had won the two finals we played in my first season here everything would have settled on another level. It would have helped massively.” A Champions League triumph would be ample compensation, as Benítez can testify. Beating the English champions-elect along the way would also strengthen Klopp’s argument that City can be eventually reeled in over a domestic campaign as well as a cup tie. For Guardiola, it is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate otherwise. Reflecting on that first semi-final victory over Mourinho’s side in an autobiography, Steven Gerrard said a desire for revenge flowed through a Liverpool team who “had so much unfinished business with Chelsea”. He also attributed the unforgettable, spine-tingling atmosphere of the second leg at Anfield not only to his club’s desperate longing for a first European Cup final in 20 years but to the changing landscape of English football. “Kopites wanted us to remind Roman Abramovich that money isn’t everything,” Gerrard said. “They saw the match as a collision of new money and history, Billionaire’s Club v Community Club.” Liverpool are hardly paupers, with the world’s most expensive defender at the heart of Klopp’s back-line, the £75m Virgil van Dijk; but having been frustrated in their pursuit of a 19th league title by Abramovich’s wealth and then that of Sheikh Mansour, among other factors, a desire to bridge the financial gap will again be at work on Wednesday. Not that any extra motivation is required."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/02/ready-player-one-steven-spielberg-virtual-reaility-discuss-with-spoilers","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T12:48:49Z","webTitle":"Ready Player One – do you buy Spielberg's vision of virtual reality?

This is Spielberg’s first science fiction movie since 2005’s War of the Worlds, unless you count the CGI aliens in 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It is a movie that has largely impressed the critics, yet has led to much navel-gazing, largely linked to the widespread reappraisal of its source novel in the wake of Gamergate. It is a vision of the digital future that seems more corporate and branded than those we have seen on the big screen in the past, yet it also feels closer than ever before to the (virtual) reality we are just beginning to enter. What did you think of Ready Player One? Here’s your chance to give a verdict on the movie’s key talking points. Virtual race-swapping and digital diversity It’s probably a little unfair that Ernest Cline’s 2011 novel, on which Spielberg’s movie is not so loosely based, has been branded the unofficial bible for Gamergate types in the years since its publication. At first glance, the big-screen adaptation looks like a pretty progressive affair. Of the five members of Wade Watts/Parzival’s High Five team, two are of Asian extraction and two are female – one of whom chooses to appear as a male orc in the Oasis, the virtual-reality world to which everyone escapes from a ravaged, dystopian 2045. Did Spielberg successfully fix the novel’s flaws by giving Olivia Cooke’s Samantha Cook/Art3mis more to say and do and fudging Aech’s problematic virtual race-swapping? Or is this still essentially the story of one geeky white male (Watts) aspiring to succeed and replace an older and even geekier white male? Too many Easter eggs can make you sick In the book, the Oasis is filled with references to 1980s pop culture because its creator James Halliday grew up on video games, comics and movies from that era. But Spielberg has radically expanded the field of play to include nods to everything from The Shining (1980, but with the distinct feel of a 70s movie) to Mechagodzilla (first appearance 1974) to the T rex from the film-maker’s own Jurassic Park (1993). There’s the sense that this expansion makes the movie feel more mainstream than its source material because its reference points are so much easier to spot. At the same time, it also lessens the idea that this is a digital wonderland where only the most po-faced of geeks can succeed. Do you agree? A new vision of virtual reality Ready Player One stands out from many of the virtual worlds we have previously seen on the big screen. The Matrix was a terrifying digital world created to keep human brains from turning into mush while our vital substances were harvested to power the machine hegemony that replaced us. Tron was similar in its depiction of a vivid and sinister autocracy. By contrast, the Oasis at times feels more like a chirpy virtual Disneyland. Despite all the movie’s progressive pretensions, was there not something rather corporate about the way so many of its denizens chose to appear as avatars based on famous franchises, rather than imagining their own bespoke virtual identities? A place in the Spielberg sci-fi pantheon Ready Player One is barely recognisable as the sort of open-hearted Spielbergian sci-fi we saw the Oscar-winner regularly deliver in the 70s and 80s. Would you agree that this was an example of late-era Spielberg in journeyman big-budget mode, a skilfully made piece of high-octane, CGI-heavy mainstream cinema to place alongside the Jurassic Park movies and War of the Worlds? James Halliday and Nolan Sorrento Mark Rylance plays Halliday as a blend of Willy Wonka, Steve Jobs and Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Meanwhile, Ben Mendelsohn’s scheming corporate bully, Nolan Sorrento, is given a new backstory as a former intern of Halliday’s who wanted to monetise the virtual-reality world at the earliest opportunity. Did you appreciate the subtle shifts here between novel and film? Digital worlds versus actual reality At the end of Ready Player One, having secured the golden Easter egg that gives him ownership and control over Halliday’s creation, Watts chooses to close the Oasis for two days a week to force people to spend time in the real world. Yet there is little sense that he plans to do anything much with his newly acquired riches about the grinding poverty that exists outside the digital realm, which rather undercuts the value of his admittedly well-intentioned concession. Sorrento may have been defeated and his corporation forced to deviate from its more nefarious leanings, but did you really buy the movie’s determination to promote the value of real life over a plunge down the digital rabbit hole?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/01/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T20:00:06Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/01/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/01/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• An opinion piece about the fallout from Carillion’s bankruptcy said that “administrators take first pickings, while debtors, 30,000 suppliers and the £900m pension deficit can expect little”.

I was privileged to serve as his chef de cabinet during his stint as European commissioner in Brussels (1980-88) and remained in contact in the following years. Ivor, despite his public persona, was essentially a private person and shy. Not for him the flamboyant gesture or utterance: he was reluctant to intervene in debate simply to have his voice heard. However, no one would take him on at the commission’s regular Wednesday meetings and I don’t think he lost a single issue that he engaged in during the whole of his tenure in Brussels. A number of the subjects in his portfolio were contentious: reform of the Social Fund to make disbursements more equitable, directives to protect part-time workers, a directive to ban crocidolite against considerable opposition from the German asbestos industry, equality legislation to improve the lot of women in the workforce, measures to protect workers made redundant in the coal and steel industries, and boosting the nascent Erasmus programme. Ivor’s advocacy on some of these issues did not go down well with Margaret Thatcher, and when it came time for the new commission to be appointed she refused Neil Kinnock’s recommendation to reappoint Ivor for a second term, with the threat that if he persisted she would abandon the accepted custom of appointing one Tory and one Labour person, in favour of a Liberal Democrat. Ivor took it in his stride, remarking that he would once again have to dust off his barrister’s wig."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/31/rory-mcilroy-masters-destiny","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T19:00:20Z","webTitle":"Rory McIlroy: ‘I’m not due anything, the Masters won’t just fall in your lap’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/31/rory-mcilroy-masters-destiny","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/31/rory-mcilroy-masters-destiny","fields":{"headline":"Rory McIlroy: ‘I’m not due anything, the Masters won’t just fall in your lap’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Rory McIlroy is aware of the allegation but the rebuttal is firm. Mitigating circumstances aren’t typically factored in when a wait for a major championship victory stretching back to August 2014 – and an inability to capture the Masters – are discussed. To the dissenters, McIlroy has it too easy. Fame, money and marriage, it is said, have doused his competitive instincts. “I don’t see that, because everyone else is in the same boat,” McIlroy says. “Everyone out here has a nice life, why am I any different? Maybe I just portray more of a sense of happiness, I don’t know. I am very happy and, whether I win or lose, I go home and I have everything that I need but that doesn’t make me any less motivated to go out and win. “That [winning] is what I want to do. If I was just coming out here and going through the motions I would hate it, I’d want to do something else. I never want to get to the point in this game where I’m not trying 100% at everything I do. So maybe I portray a sense of harmony but it definitely isn’t complacency.” In reality, the trappings associated with a Hollywood lifestyle aren’t remotely what makes the boy from Holywood, Northern Ireland, tick. There was an episode to back up McIlroy’s point earlier this year. When falling short at the Dubai Desert Classic the 28‑year‑old’s visible level of dejection contradicted any sense of cosiness. He remembers it well. “I went to the locker room and I nearly put my fist through a locker. I was just so angry at letting that tournament slip away. It was a great opportunity. I realise I won’t get an opportunity like that every week. I was angry. Of course I was angry.” Happier moments were to come. McIlroy’s success at the Arnold Palmer Invitational two Sundays ago lifted a competitive burden – it was his first tournament success in 18 months – and reminded the world what this golfer at his best is like. Nobody in the game compares to McIlroy in full flow. His imminent challenge is to take an identical touch to Augusta National and the one major that has eluded him. McIlroy is happy to contradict further assumptions. He insists, for example, that images of donning a Green Jacket do not resonate 12 months of any given year. “People would think it’s on my mind all the time,” he says. “Listen, I’d love the Green Jacket in the closet, to go back every year and use the champions’ locker room, to host dinner as the champion. Nobody could ever take that away from you. But I think about the Masters the week before I play it, because that’s when I prepare for it.” The notion that the Masters somehow represents McIlroy’s destiny, or a logical career step, is the next to be batted away. “No one is owed anything, due anything, it’s not my turn,” he says. “I don’t believe in that stuff. My dad always used to say to me: ‘If it’s for you, it won’t go past you,’ and I hate that line because that’s not how it works. You have to go and do it yourself. It doesn’t just magically fall into your lap. I’m not due anything, I don’t deserve anything, everyone starts on an even playing field on Thursday morning. Whoever plays the best will win.” McIlroy’s caution can be linked in part to the story of Ernie Els, a player for whom a Green Jacket was supposedly an ideal fit. The South African never did prevail in the first major of the year. “He went there as one of the best players in the world for a long time, as a major winner, he would play a practice round and Gary Player would come in and tell the media how well he was playing, how he just shot 64 and was going to win.” McIlroy’s Masters approach is a fascinating one. It relates to a comfort level whereby an event so widely anticipated doesn’t have such a status in his mind as to prevent him from displaying the blissfully natural style which renders him such captivating viewing. It wasn’t always thus; in the past McIlroy has appeared mentally paralysed by the scale of a Masters triumph. Now, he refuses to apply undue pressure. It won’t consume him, it can’t consume him. “I think that’s the worst thing to do,” he says. “The more pressure you put yourself under … there is already a lot of that from outside. You don’t want to compound that. The more you can freewheel it, relish it as an opportunity to do something great and enjoy it, the better. “I’ll get a lot of opportunities at this; we have been watching the Winter Olympics where people have waited four, eight years. I at least get to do it once a year. It took Phil Mickelson how many tries until he got over the line in 2004? Now he has three Green Jackets. The more you play it, the more you get comfortable not just on the course but as soon as you get inside the gates. “It is such a different week. It’s an event run by the members, it isn’t a normal tournament week. That’s why I always take a trip up prior because it makes you more comfortable, even to the point of saying hello to the staff and the chairman. There’s a lot of stuff you don’t have to do any other week because you’re not there again. At Augusta you make an effort.” If – and McIlroy is adamant it has to be if – he solves the Augusta conundrum it will be of his own volition. He isn’t the type to pursue secrets of the Masters from former champions. “I like to work things out on my own, I feel like then I take ownership. I’ve never sought anyone out. That’s not me. “Then when ultimately I do conquer or win something, I will 100% own it: ‘That was me, I know 100% what I’ve done and I know how to do it again.’ People have offered advice and I’ll take it or leave it but I’ll never seek it out. Maybe I’m too stubborn. If I want to figure something out I’ll do it, do it, do it until I get there. Some things take a little longer than others.” Injury has been the key component but Mcllroy concedes he would have been surprised if he had been informed when departing Valhalla and the US PGA Championship of 2014 that he would enter the 2018 Masters having not yet claimed a fifth major title. He was among those reduced to tears as Sergio García ended his major wait at Augusta last year but there has, too, been a niggling McIlroy envy, which he is candid enough to relay. “Of course, there always is,” McIlroy says. “It’s tough because you think: ‘That could have been me, I wish that was me.’ There is always an aspect of professional jealousy, be that Jordan [Spieth] winning three majors in the last three years or whatever, but it’s respectful as well. I 100% respect what these guys do because I know how hard it is. To be on a pace of winning one per year is phenomenal. “Part of you wants to be in their shoes. I don’t mind seeing guys win a first one; I was really happy for Dustin Johnson, for example. But any time someone lifts a trophy and it’s not me? A fraction of me doesn’t like it.” McIlroy does not shy away from the absence of his name at the business end of the Masters since the catastrophic events which befell him on the Sunday back nine in 2011. That he hasn’t spurned subsequent opportunity perhaps adds to his ability to accept the lack of a Masters win from an otherwise glittering CV. “I’ve had four top 10s but never really contended. I’d rather have been back in the box seat and seen what happened because to get in contention you have to be playing well. You can’t fake it there. There are other courses where you can kind of get by and be in contention; there you can’t, you have to be on with every aspect of your game. “The closest was when I played in the last group on the third day with Jordan, 2016, that didn’t go as planned. I’d love again to put myself in a position like that after two days because I feel like I learnt a lot that day, I took on shots that I shouldn’t have. Even just to get myself into that position, I feel like I’d handle that a lot better. Any time you don’t do something right is a learning opportunity and more than anywhere else in the world that we play, I feel like I have learned a lot of lessons at Augusta. “I would just love to put myself in a position where I can put into practice some of the things I feel I have learned. I just want to give myself a chance. If I give myself a chance, I feel when I’m in contention with all these other guys I can hold my own.” Few would begrudge him that Masters opportunity. Just don’t dare suggest any link with destiny to the man himself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/15/manic-street-preachers-resistance-is-futile-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T07:00:11Z","webTitle":"Manic Street Preachers: Resistance Is Futile review – still looking for answers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/15/manic-street-preachers-resistance-is-futile-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/15/manic-street-preachers-resistance-is-futile-review","fields":{"headline":"Manic Street Preachers: Resistance Is Futile review – still looking for answers","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Catchy orchestral pop-rock crafted to call back the Manics’ late-90s imperial era, or hollow heritage bombast, an insult to the trio’s long-lost teenage fury?

The Labour MP – a key architect of the Equality Act 2010, which requies businesses with 250 or more employees to reveal the differences in what they pay men and women – said that the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) should set up a series of inquiries and force change. Ahead of Wednesday’s deadline for companies to report, Harman criticised the “pitiful” excuses that some businesses have given. And she said that the EHRC should act as the Ofsted of the gender pay gap. “What we need is for the Equality and Human Rights Commission to get in there and force the pace of change. The big question is whether they are going to do that,” she said. “In a way the EHRC is like the Ofsted of the gender pay gap. Who is in special measures? Who is outstanding?” The EHRC has the power ultimately to take companies that fail to report their gender pay gap to court, and has repeatedly stressed that while not reporting is unlawful, wide pay gaps are not. But Harman said its focus should not be on illegality but on putting companies with large pay gaps under pressure to take action. “The critical thing now is not just to look at the figures and go ‘oh, that’s awful’, wring our hands and wait for women to bring individual cases [or] unions to negotiate for incremental change to happen a snail’s pace,” she said. “The EHRC have the power to do inquiries and issue codes of conduct and they have to use those powers. They need to do inquiries into particular firms, sectors and regions, so that people don’t just publish their gender pay gap and then get on with pay discrimination as usual.” Large gulfs in pay between men and women have already been exposed among the 9,000 or so companies the Government Equalities Office estimates to have fulfilled the reporting requirement. Some are predictable, with banks and asset management companies showing big differences, such as a median gap of 43.5% at the Barclays International banking group, 29% at HSBC, 32.8% at Lloyds and a 22.6% gap at the Co-operative Bank. Others less so: Guardian analysis has suggested that women working in academy school chains suffer some of the worst gender pay gaps in the UK. But Harman, who has spoken about the sexism she has faced since she entered parliament in 1982, was not surprised by the figures. “I always thought the pay gap would be large and I always thought the excuses from management would be pitiful,” she said. “And that’s exactly what we’ve got – large pay gaps, pitiful excuses. But we are not interested in the excuses or justifications any more.” The mother of the House of Commons has spoken before about her – at the time deeply unpopular – insistence that the Equality Act 2010 include a clause requiring companies to be transparent about their gender pay gaps. But she batted away an opportunity to talk about her pride in the legislation. “It has unveiled the particularity and the scale of the problem, but the transparency is a means to an end,” she said. “What it was never designed for was just to increase the justified resentment and anger of women at pay discrimination. “We’ve had the exploding of the gap, the exposing of the myths. We’re now in the doing phase – it has to be a spur to action.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/03/crackdown-payday-loans-predatory-lending-mental-health-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"We need to crack down on payday loans - for the sake of our health | Mary O’Hara","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/03/crackdown-payday-loans-predatory-lending-mental-health-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/03/crackdown-payday-loans-predatory-lending-mental-health-poverty","fields":{"headline":"We need to crack down on payday loans – for the sake of our health","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Cracking down on expensive and predatory lending is not only desirable, it’s imperative. It is hard enough being poor and paying a poverty premium on utilities and other essentials, never mind not being able to get cheaper credit that better-off people take for granted. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out in January, debt problems tend to be more persistent among the poorest people, with 40% of the poorest fifth of households who were in arrears or spending more than a third of their income servicing their debts between 2010 and 2012 still doing so two years later. Although there have been improvements in regulation, such as capping the overall cost of payday loans, high-cost credit remains a serious issue. It is not uncommon in the US for someone caught in the debt cycle to be rolling over what are supposed to be short-term payday loans for months at a time, forking out around a third of their pay on monthly repayments, and paying far more in costs and fees than the original loan amount. The combination of problem debt and the government’s austerity policies means it’s no surprise that child poverty is at its highest since 2010 and 30% of Britain’s children are now classified as poor (two-thirds of whom are from working families). Research by the Financial Conduct Authority found that 4.1 million people in the UK are already in serious financial difficulty, falling behind with bills and credit card payments. Whether it is debt advice organisations who see the fallout on their front doors day in day out demanding reform, or politicians such as Stella Creasy, who has campaigned for years against the high cost of payday loans and who is now taking on high-cost credit cards, the devastating impact of problem debt is gaining more traction in the political and public consciousness. Last month, actor and activist Michael Sheen said he was stepping back from acting to focus on tackling high-cost credit, and formally launched the End High Cost Credit Alliance, a coalition of charities and responsible credit organisations he founded in 2017 to campaign for fairer sources of borrowing. The need for cheaper credit for all is not just a question of fairness and practicality, it could also be good for people’s health. A new report from health education charity, the Royal Society for Public Health found, for example, that payday loans caused the most negative impact on their mental health. Exploitative and high-cost lending is intricately linked with greater poverty and inequality. The evidence indicates it can be a financial, health, and psychological burden. In the US, where the Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that payday loans are used by 12 million Americans a year (with many others resorting to other forms of high-cost credit), the impact on the financial and general wellbeing of vulnerable families has been well documented. Recent US research, for example, found that people who use short-term high-interest credit are 38% more likely to report poorer health. Some states are already fighting back: payday loans are banned in Washington DC and 15 states, while states such as Colorado have tightened regulations. Joe Valenti, director of consumer finance at the Center for American Progress, points to the fact that voters tend to be in favour of reform and have helped drive regulation within individual states. Nationally, he argues that when the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), set up in the wake of the financial crisis, issued what is called a “final rule” governing payday loans and similar products in October 2017, introducing protections such as requiring that lenders verify borrowers’ ability to pay, it was a significant step forward. But all this could be undone if a bill going through Congress is passed. It would curtail progress and overturn state efforts to tightly regulate payday loan charges. And ultimately if we are going to truly tackle problem debt, we need to ensure that people don’t have to use payday loans or exorbitant credit cards just to get by. With soaring levels of inequality and shrinking welfare safety nets in both the US and UK, this doesn’t look likely to happen any time soon. • Mary O’Hara is author of Austerity Bites: A Journey to the Sharp End of Cuts in the UK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/30/trump-border-wall-military-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"Trump's border wall: US military is as unlikely to pay for it as Mexico","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/30/trump-border-wall-military-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/30/trump-border-wall-military-budget","fields":{"headline":"Trump's border wall: US military is as unlikely to pay for it as Mexico","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"With his original plan for Mexico to pay for a border wall yet to bear fruit, Donald Trump last week reportedly floated a plan B: the US defense department could foot the bill. Plan B might be even more of a long shot. While Trump is known for spitballing ideas – on trade policy, or healthcare, or a joint Russia-US “cybersecurity unit” – he is not known for a mastery of details. And perhaps nowhere are the details so devilish as in the federal budgeting process. “It’s never going to happen,” said Mark Cancian, an expert in defense spending who ran the force structure and investment division of the office of management and budget (OMB) under Barack Obama. “To fund the wall out of the defense budget, Trump would still have to get the Congress to agree.” “This is not a man who knows anything about how to actually govern,” said Gordon Adams, who served as associate director for national security and international affairs at the OMB under Bill Clinton. “You’d have to have congressional action to allow the transfer of the funds. And that would require 60 votes in the Senate and that means he’d have to have the Democrats on board.” Undeterred by any such warnings, if anyone is giving them to him, Trump tweeted what appeared to be a plan for the defense department to cover the cost of the border wall at the weekend. “Our Military is again rich,” he wrote, a week after signing a budget deal that boosted military spending by tens of billions of dollars. “Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country, is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M!” The White House did not reply to a request for confirmation that “M” stands for the military, not Mexico. A request for comment on the budget strategy behind the president’s suggestion likewise went unanswered. Trump’s argument that the border wall serves a vital national defense purpose does not change the fact that Congress would have to be involved to “reprogram” the Pentagon dollars, budget experts said. “They would have to get both the authorization and the appropriation from Congress,” Cancian said. “They could go with what’s called a reprogramming, but then the Congress still has to approve it. No matter how you do it, you have to get both of those pieces, which is why it’s so difficult.” “It just is really a question of congressional jurisdiction,” said Adams. “Your armed services committees are not going to open the floodgates to general transfers of money out of their jurisdiction to somebody else’s jurisdiction. The defense appropriations committees are no more enthusiastic than the authorizers about giving the executive branch the authority to just will-you nill-you throw money in one direction or another. “Budgets don’t work that way. You can’t slop money from one purpose of the US code to another title of the US code and just assume everything will blithely walk along.” Trump approached the House speaker, Paul Ryan, this month about paying for the border wall using military funds, but Ryan was noncommittal, the Washington Post reported. The financial deal recently agreed by Congress and signed by Trump budgets $700bn for the military in 2018, rising to $716bn next year. As Trump has publicly lamented, the deal included only $1.6bn for border defense, a fraction of the $25bn Trump had argued for, a figure in line with what the Department of Homeland Security estimates the wall would cost. To add insult to injury, this $1.6bn is not authorized to be used on the imposing concrete wall prototypes Trump recently viewed in California, since the bill specifies that the money should only be used for 14 miles of “secondary fencing” near San Diego and 25 miles of “primary pedestrian levee fencing” and “primary pedestrian fencing” in the Rio Grande Valley, and is only available for designs “deployed” before this year, “such as currently deployed steel bollard designs”. In any case, the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for border security, and not the defense department, was the logical home for any wall spending, budget experts said. Trump’s plan has been criticized as a waste of money. “The problem that he has is political,” said Adams of Trump. “The House and the Senate have made amply clear in the last two legislative sessions that they’re not really interested in dumping $25bn of funding into the president’s wall.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/31/gay-cinema-homosexuality-coming-out-hollywood-gilbey-sexuality","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-31T23:04:03Z","webTitle":"Love, Simon: at last Hollywood is saying ‘I’m gay’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/31/gay-cinema-homosexuality-coming-out-hollywood-gilbey-sexuality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/31/gay-cinema-homosexuality-coming-out-hollywood-gilbey-sexuality","fields":{"headline":"Love, Simon: at last Hollywood is saying ‘I’m gay’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The coming-out movie, commonly found on the film festival or arthouse circuit rather than at a multiplex, has always been a reliable source of angst. For a sign of how times have changed, try this: at a London preview last week of Love, Simon, a glossy rom-com about a US high-school student (Nick Robinson) inching slowly out of the closet, audience members were invited to ride a giant Love, Simon ferris wheel in Leicester Square in homage to the film’s giddy, fun-fair climax. There were few takers –well, it was raining – but that’s not the point. Even Beautiful Thing in 1996, which represented the previous benchmark for making a mainstream coming-out story that wouldn’t scare the horses, never had a ferris wheel erected in its honour. Money makes a big difference. With the corporate clout of 20th Century Fox behind it, Love, Simon is the first gay teen movie from a major studio. In its eagerness to please (Simon’s opening line is: “I’m just like you”) and its relentless upbeat jauntiness, the film makes Beautiful Thing look like Fassbinder. Breakthroughs come in different shapes and sizes, though, and it would be unfair to disparage this hugely entertaining picture simply for being big and fluffy and pink. It’s important also not to sentimentalise its significance. Fox certainly would not have funded Love, Simon were there not plentiful profits to be made. Tolerance has its commercial benefits; a gay film need no longer appeal exclusively to small or specialised audiences. Back when Beautiful Thing opened in 1996, the UK age of consent for gay men had only recently been lowered from 21 to 18 (still two years higher than the heterosexual one). Lesbians and gay men were banned from serving in the armed forces, the insidious Section 28 was seven years away from being repealed while phrases like “civil partnership” and “marriage equality” were as unfamiliar then as “social media” and “trigger warning”. In Get Real, a British coming-out movie that followed two years after Beautiful Thing, feel-good material still had to acknowledge the possibility of violence and homophobia. The title character in Love, Simon, on the other hand, delays his coming out only because of generalised concerns about being rejected, while the recent God’s Own Country includes a pair of casual coming-out-to-the-family scenes, conveyed in knowing glances, which only the eagle-eyed would spot. To borrow the parlance of the 21st-century teenager, it’s simply not that deep any more. The de-stigmatisation of homosexuality has removed from drama one of its oldest standbys: the threat of ostracisation and social ruin. Audiences in the 1960s could well comprehend the distress of the barrister, played by Dirk Bogarde, who is blackmailed over his sexuality in Victim, just as their 1980s counterparts appreciated the scandal of a married man with a gay lover in Making Love. But no version of those stories made now would have the same currency, just as history has endangered if not rendered extinct the conditions from which the 1997 comedy In &amp; Out emerged. Inspired by Tom Hanks’s Oscar speech in which he accidentally outed one of his former teachers, In &amp; Out gets itself into an awful tizzy over the farcical efforts of its main character, a teacher played by Kevin Kline, to hide his true sexuality. One of the cleverest coming-out scenes in cinema occurs in a film about another teacher, Ron Peck’s 1978 British drama Nighthawks. It ends with the geography teacher Jim (Ken Robertson) being outed in class by his pupils, who bombard him with hostile questions: “Are you bent? Are you queer? Do you wear women’s clothes? Do you carry a handbag?” The scene is highly effective, not least because of its staging: we hardly see Jim at all but the camera is placed in his stead so that the pupils seem to be haranguing us directly. Most importantly, it signals a watershed moment for him, a break in his routine of shame and denial. The ultimate inspiration among gay teachers, however, must be Martin Donovan in the 1998 comedy The Opposite of Sex. Taking the bricks and rocks thrown through his window, he builds a rockery. Coming-out movies (Show Me Love, The Edge of Seventeen, But I’m a Cheerleader) favour the young, if only because that’s the point at which sexual preferences first define themselves. A notable exception is Beginners, in which Christopher Plummer is a widower who comes out in his seventies. “I don’t want to be just theoretically gay,” he says, sporting a rainbow neckerchief and a much younger boyfriend. “I want to do something about it.” But it is the teen genre where openness and inclusivity have traditionally flourished. In Clueless, the audience realises some time before Cher (Alicia Silverstone) does that she is barking up the wrong tree in her pursuit of Christian (Justin Walker). She wants to play footsie, he wants to watch Spartacus. The most striking achievement of Love, Simon is its promotion of a gay character from sassy sidekick to authentic hero. In making gayness its subject, while treating it as no big deal, Love, Simon pulls off a rare conjuring trick with its hero’s sexuality. Now you see it, now you don’t."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/30/signed-off-school-with-beatlemania","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T15:29:15Z","webTitle":"Signed off school with Beatlemania | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/30/signed-off-school-with-beatlemania","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/30/signed-off-school-with-beatlemania","fields":{"headline":"Signed off school with Beatlemania","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If the government fails to intervene to prevent the acquisition of GKN by Melrose it will be further proof, if any is needed, that the UK is being run for the benefit of big business (Outcry as GKN falls to hostile takeover, 30 March).

She is over a decade older than me and lives, with her husband, 200 miles away. My husband is the younger child and her only sibling. My sister-in-law is retired, wealthy and has what many would consider an enviable lifestyle. I have a busy career with lots of travel. I’m pretty competent and have a nice home, am an OK cook and also fairly artistic. I am also the only other female in this family of husbands, nephews and sons. We meet a few times a year, often for a celebratory family meal at my home where I will have cooked. At some point I will be subjected to a vicious attack – possibly a character assassination or a response to some perceived error that I have committed. Each time I am shocked and somewhat incredulous – both that this happens, and also that no one says or does anything about it. I either ignore it or brush it off. Of course I have analysed it and can only conclude that the reasons must be of insecurity, possible jealousy and the need to feel superior to me – to keep me in my place. My husband witnesses many of these instances, but not all of them. When I tell him how unjustified and hurtful I find this behaviour, he says that his sister does not mean it and that it is her attempt at humour. My sister-in-law gives me far more extravagant gifts than any other family member. I feel that she does this so that she can tell herself she is generous and to balance out the verbal attacks. It’s at the point where I dread meeting her and want to minimise contact, but I can’t because this is my husband’s family and he loves them. It takes me days, even weeks, to recover from an incident. I can’t stop being upset by it. How do I get my husband to see how destructive this is? And how can I stop my sister-in-law from treating me this way? Unfortunately, you’re asking the wrong questions. A better one to ask is how you can minimise the effect all this has on you, because yours is the only behaviour you have control over. It would be easy for me to say, “You must tell your husband that his loyalty is to you,” and once upon a time I would have. But real life has shown it doesn’t really work like that. I’m sure his loyalty is to you, but in that moment, surrounded by family, he probably takes the path of least resistance. He may also be right; it may be his sister’s attempt at a joke, however gauche it sounds. You don’t give me any examples of things your sister-in-law has actually said, and I thought that was quite telling. I’m sorry it takes you days or weeks to recover from these remarks, and I understand about stings in comments – I’ve suffered a few. But you may want to look at what nerve this hits, because taking weeks to recover from a comment hints at a deeper wound. I’d be interested to know what your own sibling relationship is or was like. What stops you saying something at the time? Something like, “Ooh, did you mean that to sound so rude?” Said with a hollow laugh and an arched brow, it can stop certain personalities from saying things like that again. It won’t be easy but, then, neither is festering in anger and resentment for weeks afterwards. Is it the words or the person saying them that hurt? Some time ago I came up with a way to help me to work out if it was what was being said, or who was saying it that irked. You take the comment, imagine it in a speech bubble and then imagine it being said by someone you like, trust and who you know likes you. If the comment still hurts, then it’s what’s being said; if not, then it’s who. It can help you separate out which bit to work on. I wonder if she goes away and thinks, “Why did I say that?” – hence the extravagant presents. The comments may not be as loaded as you think. But, really, if you want to try to fix this, then there is only one thing to do: you and she need to talk (converse, not confront). She may well find you annoying, superior, competitive, any manner of things that make her feel (albeit erroneously) that she has to take you down a peg or two. And certain patterns get set in families, laid out on misunderstandings. You could break all that. It won’t be easy, but it’s an incredibly powerful thing to do, not least it tells her you’ve noticed her behaviour, which may be enough to stop it. • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

It feels like we're back in the 1980s","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Do not adjust the year on your electronic devices: religious right pressures Walmart to pull Cosmo from checkout aisle for the sake of “the children”. Being a parent is no picnic. Between attacks on the social safety net, the rising cost of housing and education, and looming ecological crisis, it’s a wonder anyone brings children into this world at all any more. But America’s beleaguered moms and dads can relax just a little this week, for the biggest threat to their offspring’s safety has been vanquished. I’m speaking, of course, of Cosmopolitan magazine in the Walmart checkout aisle. In a campaign straight out of the 1980s, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, or NCOSE (formerly known as Morality in Media) pressured the retail giant to pull the mag from checkout aisles in 5,000 stores across the country. It will still be available elsewhere in the store; presumably you’ll have to sidle up to some roped-off section, show two forms of ID, and carry it out in a brown paper bag. Walmart framed it as a “business decision”. In a Facebook Live session on Tuesday, the NSCOSE – which has frequently allied with anti-LGBT hate group the Family Research Council in the past – took credit for the change. “You can go through and buy your groceries with your family knowing you don’t have to be exposed to this graphic and often degrading and offensive material,” said the NCOSE’s Haley Halverson. A press release further elaborated that this “degrading” material includes articles that “promote pornography, sexting, BDSM, group sex, anal sex, and more, all while marketing toward young teens with Disney star cover models.” (As if young teens did not, themselves, invent sexting.) Halverson tied the campaign to the #MeToo movement, saying, “This is one less drop of hyper-sexualized media that is going to be bombarding people in their everyday lives, which does make a difference, especially in this Me Too culture that we’re living in, where we really want a culture that will respect women and ensure their dignity is understood.” This is a disingenuous hijacking, to say the least. As advocates have explained over the objections of certain vocal contrarians, the current movement against sexual violence, coercion and harassment is not about suppressing sexuality, but making sure sex is actively wanted by all parties involved. This necessitates the acknowledgment of women’s sexual desires, and encourages everyone to figure out what their own desire looks like – through experimentation, erotica, or even a magazine like Cosmopolitan. Which, as the NCOSE notes with chagrin, has become increasingly inclusive of non-normative – if incredibly common – practices like BDSM, anal, and queer sex. They’ve even got features on what it means to be gender non-binary. Given that Cosmo has been about sex since the 1960s, this rising inclusivity does not seem incidental to the resurgent campaign against it. That this association seems ridiculous to most rational observers is evidence of how far the feminist movement has come since the 1970s and 1980s, when anti-porn feminists like Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin teamed up with the religious right to wage legal battles against pornography, prostitution, and other forms of sexuality deemed “immoral”. Even more mainstream feminists like Gloria Steinem drew the line between “good” and “bad” kinds of sexuality, and that line often had nothing to do with consent. But while they were once a marginalized minority within the movement, sex-positive advocates like Annie Sprinkle have since taken over in setting the tone for what most American feminists believe. The mere existence of artifacts like Sex and the City and, yes, Cosmo, in mainstream culture are proof that the Sprinkles of the world have won the war of ideas. (Granted, it helps that the broad liberal value of “sexual freedom” does not necessitate an opposition to capitalism. But that’s an issue for another day.) Given that the right has long lost this battle, then, why is it starting up again now? This isn’t the only example; from a New York Times op-ed calling to “ban porn” to disingenuous attacks on sex workers’ rights, the war on sex been making a comeback. It’s hard to say for sure, but when the right is winning politically, it tends to use culture wars to stoke the misplaced aggrievement on which it runs. And what better target than a magazine that’s literally called Cosmopolitan? It could also simply be that the overlapping groups of LGBT people, kinksters, sex workers, and women who unabashedly enjoy sex are gaining a power and visibility we have not enjoyed in the past, inspiring a corresponding backlash. No matter the reason (and they’re not mutually exclusive), I’ve got some bad news for the progeny of Phyllis Schlafly: we’re not going anywhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/public-registries-shell-panama-papers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-03T08:00:11Z","webTitle":"Oligarchs hide billions in shell companies.

Here's how we stop them","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two years ago we published the Panama Papers after an anonymous source provided 2.6 terabytes of internal data from the dubious Panamanian law firm of Mossack Fonseca. We shared the data with 400 journalists worldwide and together revealed how the wealthy and powerful use shell companies to hide their assets. Such companies are exploited by dictators, drug cartels, mafia clans, fraudsters, weapons dealers and regimes like North Korea and Iran to hide their shady business transactions. As a consequence, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, the prime minister of Iceland, resigned. The Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, did the same, and in the United Kingdom even David Cameron’s father was implicated. So far, the Panama Papers have helped tax authorities around the world to recover more than $500m in unpaid taxes and penalties. It could be far more if lawmakers finally take action. After publishing the Panama Papers, we have heard a lot of promises from politicians around the world. They have talked about the need for transparency, and while the discussion is warm, the details are complicated: a multilateral exchange of information and stronger anti-money laundering regulations are as difficult to implement and control as they sound. But why bother? There is a far less bureaucratic and more powerful measure: public beneficial ownership registries. Databases in which citizens can easily access and explore the owners of companies. Not the nominee director, not the fake shareholder – the real owner. The person at the center of the matryoshka-like corporate structures, or, as experts refer to them: the ultimate beneficial owner of a company. A database of actual owners would enable companies to check with whom they are actually doing business. It would enable activists, journalists and skeptical citizens to investigate the individuals running dubious companies which earn millions in alleged “consulting contracts”, which are in many cases nothing more than concealed payments of corruption money. It would also give prosecutors the opportunity to follow dark money without having to rely on nerve-racking, time-consuming legal maneuvers with foreign governments. Searchable by company and by individual names, it would enable investigators to see if Dictator X or Autocrat Y owns companies in Country Z. Combined with a public property register, it would narrow, if not close, loopholes which allow oligarchs and their relatives to betray their own citizens and stash plundered money across the globe. Creating beneficial ownership registries will not be easy. Recently, the UK House of Lords rejected an attempt to force overseas territories under British control to create said registries. And in the United States, where some states make it more difficult to vote than to start a company, there has yet to be any reasonable public discussion about creating these transparent registries, making America a willing accomplice in global corruption. The treasury department in 2015 estimated that approximately $300bn in illicit proceeds are generated in the US per year! Critics of public beneficial ownership registries often say that exposing company owners could put them in danger of blackmail or even kidnapping. However, no data supports such claims and there will probably never be any. As it is, the financial elite often surround themselves with the symbols and spoils of wealth, such as big cars, yachts and villas. There is no desire to hide their treasure; in fact, they often flaunt it. Corruption is a scourge. It hits the poor first and hits them hard. Whole continents are plundered, the proceeds of human trafficking are laundered, wars are financed and violent religious extremism is supported. The word “corruption” comes from the Latin “corrumpere”, which can mean “to destroy”. Corruption destroys democracy. Corruption costs citizens extraordinary amounts of money. According to estimates, corruption consumes more than 5% of the global gross domestic product. Developing regions lose more than 10 times the money they receive in foreign aid to illicit financial schemes. Without corruption and the shell companies that make it possible, there might be no need for aid to Africa or Asia. Most importantly, corruption kills. According to Navi Pillay, the former United Nations high commissioner for human rights, “The money stolen through corruption every year is enough to feed the world’s hungry 80 times over.” As Louis Brandeis, the late associate justice of the supreme court of the United States, once pointed out sunlight is the best disinfectant. Hence let the sunshine in! Lawmakers must make public beneficial ownership registries a priority to ensure that institutions remain transparent and democratic. There is no legitimate reason to allow individuals to own anonymous companies or to help new “entrepreneurs” to create them. Lava Jato in Brazil, the Fifa scandal and nearly every other major corruption case have involved opaque company structures created to bribe, receive bribes or to hide dirty money. Financial crimes rely on exploiting anonymous companies and trusts, and secrecy jurisdictions like the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands and the states of Delaware and Nevada are partners in those crimes. They must be held accountable. Waiting for a global solution means waiting a long time, if not forever. The only way to draw the corporate curtain back and expose corruption is for lawmakers to work in the public interest and create public beneficial ownership registries and public property registries now. The more countries that adopt these measures, the fewer places dictators, human traffickers, weapons dealers and oligarchs can hide. Lawmakers that claim to stand against corruption should do so by fighting for these kinds of registries now, or forever hold their peace.

There, you’ll find a series of quite beautiful pictures taken from high in the sky above beaches and cities and empty cricket grounds. Smith loves his drone and the photos it allows him to capture from all sorts of places. He’s proud of the shots and enjoys talking about the fun he has with it. The joy is youthful and boyish, exactly as Smith is with his game. The cute and slightly daft story of his fiancee Dani helping him train by feeding the bowling machine for his net practice when they were dating was folklore long before he was the best going around. When asked after his stunningly patient Ashes century at Brisbane in November how he maintains concentration, he said it is because he just wants to bat. He loves a leave as much as a score. By stark contrast to David Warner, he’s entirely straightforward. But Smith’s simplicity has also driven the terrible mess he’s now in. With the game meaning so much to him, broader reference points in life are harder to locate. He was whipped out of high school by his manager aged 17, his school principal told that Smith could earn a million dollars a year. To do so, he had to live little but the game, and he has ever since. Of course, this is the ultimate good problem to have – Smith is young, extremely wealthy, and until now, successful. But captaincy is more than runs; it’s being able to make good decisions across a whole variety of situations. On Saturday in Cape Town, he was exposed in the most critical moment. “It was a failure of leadership,” he admitted at his Sydney airport press conference. “Of my leadership.” He’s right. Remember, Smith was made skipper because he was the best player in the team – so often the case in this sport. He was young, and for all the success, hadn’t long been a permanent member of the XI. That Warner, the second most accomplished player in the team at that stage, was reflexively made his deputy spoke of a dressing room lacking in experience. In that, he was let down. As Gideon Haigh observed during the week, part of the vice-captain’s remit is to provide counsel to the captain if they are losing their way, not to initiate the harebrained schemes to begin with. To what extent was Smith forced to manage Warner instead of being able to rely on him? It’s a question that will haunt him over the next year. What’s clear is that he was let down by his deputy and also by others around him after play on Saturday at Newlands when deciding to further an elaborate lie to cover up the initial mess that he in essence condoned by failing to intervene. Further, Smith commented pre-Test that he was exhausted, echoing similar remarks before the recent one-day series against England where he said he hadn’t felt like batting. This is a player who has also admitted he barely sleeps during Test matches. Living and breathing something can make it toxic, and someone should have twigged that an out-of-sorts captain could make a blunder. Hindsight, sure. But that’s what support staff are for. When Mitchell Marsh was talked up as a future captain by Simon Katich at Durban, people joked that he would never get the chance – Smith, at 28, would lead forever. But in its infancy his era is over. For now, at least. It was instructive that when James Sutherland handed him his sanction, including 100 hours of service to community cricket at local level, Smith smiled back at the Cricket Australia boss and said that’s what he would be doing anyway. He’ll be back as soon as possible. Let’s hope before that, he takes the gap year he never had. Grab that drone and go. Revel in the anonymity of Europe or South America and learn from people who have no idea who he is. Take the Jobe Watson route and make coffees in Brooklyn.

The public disclosure of the 2016 memo, in which a vice-president, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, wrote “anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good”, prompted the CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to defend his company’s mission in a hastily released statement on Thursday. Zuckerberg said Facebook “never believed the ends justify the means” and said he strongly disagreed with the memo circulated by Bosworth, whom he described as a talented but provocative force in the company. Bosworth wrote: “Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.” The memo, which provides an insight into the philosophy among some at the Silicon Valley giant, continued: “It is literally just what we do. We connect people. Period. That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified.” The memo, published in full by BuzzFeed and confirmed by Facebook representatives, comes at a time when the technology corporation is battling significant backlash in the wake of reporting in the Observer and the Guardian revealing that the personal information of 50 million users was used by the electioneering firm Cambridge Analytica. The leaked memo – which implied that Facebook was pursuing growth at all costs and defended “questionable” data practices – prompted defensive statements on Thursday from Zuckerberg and Bosworth, who claimed that the memo was meant to be “provocative” and is out of line with the company’s values. “Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly,” said Zuckerberg, who is currently facing intense scrutiny over the data scandal and is expected to soon testify before Congress. “We’ve never believed the ends justify the means. We recognize that connecting people isn’t enough by itself. We also need to work to bring people closer together. We changed our whole mission and company focus to reflect this last year.” Bosworth said in his statement on Thursday: “I don’t agree with the post today and I didn’t agree with it even when I wrote it.” He argued that the intent of the memo was to “bring to the surface issues I felt deserved more discussion”, adding: “I care deeply about how our product affects people and I take very personally the responsibility I have to make that impact positive.” The memo, however, had a very different tone, arguing that the harms caused by Facebook were just a part of its business: “The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.” He also wrote that all growth efforts are justified, adding: “All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it.” The memo was titled “The Ugly” and argued that the strategies to bring as many people as possible to the platform were essential to the company. “The natural state of the world is not connected. It is not unified. It is fragmented by borders, languages, and increasingly by different products. The best products don’t win. The ones everyone use [sic] win,” he wrote. “I know a lot of people don’t want to hear this. Most of us have the luxury of working in the warm glow of building products consumers love. But make no mistake, growth tactics are how we got here.” He continued: “We do have great products but we still wouldn’t be half our size without pushing the envelope on growth. Nothing makes Facebook as valuable as having your friends on it, and no product decisions have gotten as many friends on as the ones made in growth.” In recent years, there has been growing evidence of societal problems linked to Facebook’s massive expansion. The platform’s groups function, for example, has been used to unite extremists, neo-Nazis, far-right groups and others promoting hate speech and seeking to influence elections and political discourse. There are also escalating concerns about Facebook’s impact on democracies across the globe following revelations that Russian interference campaigns exploited the platform and that Facebook has helped violent and oppressive governments while spreading misinformation and propaganda."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/30/martin-luther-king-50th-anniversary-death-events-planned","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-30T12:00:20Z","webTitle":"Martin Luther King: 50th anniversary of death will see events across nation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/30/martin-luther-king-50th-anniversary-death-events-planned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/30/martin-luther-king-50th-anniversary-death-events-planned","fields":{"headline":"Martin Luther King: 50th anniversary of death will see events across nation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Much of the United States will come to a halt next Wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr’s assassination. Memphis, Tennessee, where Dr King was shot dead on 4 April 1968, will be the epicenter as all across the US commemorations are scheduled to honor the memory of the country’s most influential and celebrated civil rights leader. The National Civil Rights Museum, which was built within the Lorraine Motel, where King died, is planning to host an all-day gathering with performances, speeches and an “evening of storytelling”. The activist Jesse Jackson, who was with King on the evening he was killed, is scheduled to be in attendance, as is the Atlanta congressman John Lewis, who spoke at King’s 1963 march on Washington, when the civil rights leader gave his I Have A Dream speech. At 6.01pm, the time King was shot, the museum will ring a bell 39 times in recognition of King’s age when he was killed. In King’s hometown of Atlanta, the center founded by his widow, Coretta Scott King, immediately after his death also marks its 50th anniversary Wednesday. Its director, King’s daughter Dr Bernice King, said the King Center’s 4 April programming was designed to “introduce the world to the radical Dr Martin Luther King Jr … and to learn about the vital role our founder, Mrs Coretta Scott King, played as the architect of the King legacy.” That design is a reaction to a common feeling among contemporary civil rights activists that King’s legacy has been sanitized and deradicalized as he has come to be recognized as a national hero, and that female leaders, such as Coretta Scott King, are often left out in the retelling of civil rights history. The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, located in the city King once called the most segregated in America, will host a panel on social progress in the south and the media’s coverage of it. The city is where King penned his influential Letter from Birmingham Jail, after being arrested by the city’s infamous police commissioner Bull Connor, who attacked demonstrators with attack dogs and fire hoses in 1963. And in Washington DC, where King helped orchestrate the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the not-for-profit organisation Washington, DC History &amp; Culture will host a walking tour that will pass by the spot on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial where King delivered his seminal I Have A Dream speech, and on to his monument next to the National Mall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/30/religious-freedom-review-margaret-court-claims-anti-gay-marriage-voices-silenced","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T23:20:26Z","webTitle":"Religious freedom review: Margaret Court claims anti-gay marriage voices silenced","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/30/religious-freedom-review-margaret-court-claims-anti-gay-marriage-voices-silenced","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/30/religious-freedom-review-margaret-court-claims-anti-gay-marriage-voices-silenced","fields":{"headline":"Religious freedom review: Margaret Court claims anti-gay marriage voices silenced","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Former tennis champion turned preacher Margaret Court has claimed anti-marriage equality voices will be excluded from public debate in a submission to the Ruddock religious freedom review. The review – which had its reporting date extended to 18 May after it was inundated with submissions – published the first batch late on Thursday, with replies demonstrating a high degree of coordination by anti-marriage equality forces. Of the more than 16,000 submissions received, more than 500 were from six batch lots expressing similar concerns about the ability of religious people to manifest their beliefs after the passage of marriage equality legislation in December. One set warns that “Christian hospitals, aged care, education institutions and care organisations may be inhibited by anti-discrimination laws”. “I am concerned that if I publicly express my opposition to same-sex marriage, my opposition to transgender ideology or forms of sexual activity that I consider immoral, I could face action under discrimination, equal opportunity or vilification laws.” The largest set, submitted by 248 people, calls for a right for parents to withdraw their children from “classes teaching radical LGBTIQ sex and gender theory”. It also said: “In the same way, a Muslim printer should not be forced to print copies of the Torah, wedding service providers should not be forced to participate in a vision of marriage that violates their sincerely held beliefs on marriage.” Guardian Australia has reported that Christian schools have sought to protect their right to hire and fire teachers based on adherence to religious practice while the Catholic church and Sydney Anglican Church have called for a religious freedom act to positively protect religious exemptions to discrimination law. Many of the religious safeguards called for – including “no-detriment” provisions, parental rights to withdraw children from classes and a guarantee regarding free speech about what constitutes a marriage – mirror the amendments in the James Paterson same-sex marriage bill, which were defeated. In her submission, Court warns that Australia is “forsaking foundational truths and the blessings that have made [it] great”. She calls for the panel, led by former attorney general Phillip Ruddock, to ensure “that Christianity will not be silenced or stifled in Australia”. Court included several papers from academic Augusto Zimmermann claiming that marriage equality had wide-ranging consequences for Christian bakers, photographers and florists who refused to serve same-sex weddings. The Presbyterian church of eastern Australia warned that religious protections in the marriage equality law were “woefully inadequate” because they did not contain exemptions to allow civil celebrants “who have a conscientious position on marriage” to refuse same-sex weddings. Despite the fact religious ministers are still able to refuse same-sex weddings, the submission claimed the church had “effectively lost the freedom to teach and preach all that the Bible says about marriage in our own church buildings”. Academic George Williams called for religious freedom to be protected but warned it “should not be by way of a standalone right”. “This would introduce a different problem by privileging religion over other freedoms, such as freedom of speech and the right to equality,” he said. Williams warned freedom of religion “must not be used as cover to wind back historic gains towards equality made by women and other groups”. The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils called for a bill of rights, following the Canadian or New Zealand model, to give effect to all Australia’s obligations under the international covenant on civil and political rights. In the alternative, it suggested a Religious Freedom Act, to include “freedom to manifest religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching”. The Equality Campaign – which successfully prosecuted the yes case in the postal survey – called for the removal of exemptions in discrimination law that allow religious institutions such as schools, hospitals and aged care facilities to discriminate against staff and clients based on beliefs. The exemptions “go too far” – allowing publicly funded religious social services to “lawfully turn away LGBTI people, single mothers and others where this refusal is in line with the charity’s religious beliefs”. “Religious exemptions act as a barrier to vulnerable people accessing the support services they need,” it said. Many submissions warned that the Greens intended to remove religious exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act. In January the deputy Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, said the opposition had no plans to change religious exemptions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/24/corpse-dumped-in-acapulco-after-presidential-candidate-says-cut-off-hands","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T17:40:27Z","webTitle":"Mexico: dismembered corpse dumped after presidential candidate says 'cut off hands'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/corpse-dumped-in-acapulco-after-presidential-candidate-says-cut-off-hands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/24/corpse-dumped-in-acapulco-after-presidential-candidate-says-cut-off-hands","fields":{"headline":"Mexico: dismembered corpse dumped after presidential candidate says 'cut off hands'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When a Mexican presidential candidate proposed in a televised debate that public servants who steal should have their hands cut off, his comments were initially greeted with disbelief, and then mockery. Hours later, however, there was a much grimmer reaction: drug cartel members dumped a dismembered corpse in the Pacific city of Acapulco with a sign saying that they were already enforcing the punishment. Jaime Rodríguez, a cowboy-turned-state-governor who is pursuing the presidency as an independent candidate drew gasps during Sunday’s first presidential debate when he suggested – in apparent earnest – that Mexico could fight corruption by cutting off the hands of those who steal from the public purse. The debate’s host twice asked him if he was speaking seriously, and after the debate Rodríguez – who campaigns under the nickname El Bronco – doubled down on his proposal, saying in a video: “It’’s something we have to do to end corruption in Mexico, which is a cancer.” He subsequently said, “We have to be daring making proposals.” On Tuesday, authorities found the dismembered body on the outskirts of Acapulco, the beach resort city which has become the city for relentless gang violence. Next to the body was a sign reading: “El Bronco has already said it: cutting off the hands of scum who steal is the first thing.” Mexico’s presidential election in July comes against a backdrop of escalating violence and growing frustration with corruption. Recent history suggests that appeals for extreme action against crime can pay electoral dividends. The country’s Green party – which is not an environmental party – campaigned in 2009 with a manifesto calling for the introduction of the death penalty, and won 7% of the vote, a record showing for the group. Four of the five candidates in 2018 have backed a continuation of the country’s militarised crackdown on drug cartels and criminal groups, although frontrunning candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador has controversially proposed offering an amnesty for those in the illegal drugs business. “Amnesty doesn’t mean impunity,” López Obrador said on Sunday. “We have to attend to the causes that give rise to insecurity and violence, especially reducing poverty.” A pre-debate poll put López Obrador 20 points ahead of his nearest opponent. Rodríguez drew 3% support in the same poll. Rodríguez submitted hundreds of thousands of fake signatures in support of his independent candidacy, but was granted a place on the ballot after a bizarre decision from the country’s electoral tribunal. After the debate, Rodríguez said that he had received 57,000 WhatsApp messages regarding his proposal to introduce amputation as a form of punishment, with 95% expressing support. “He knows that the [amputation] proposal is a non-starter, but he also knows that people will talk about it. He’s going for easy points to score name recognition,” said Javier Garza, a journalist in the northern city of Torreón. “He doesn’t have ideas and prefers to play with people’s anger instead of offering a serious proposal. Textbook demagogue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/29/facebook-fake-news-political-ad-security-us-midterms-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T19:15:42Z","webTitle":"Facebook offers plan to tackle fake news ahead of US midterms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/facebook-fake-news-political-ad-security-us-midterms-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/29/facebook-fake-news-political-ad-security-us-midterms-2018","fields":{"headline":"Facebook offers plan to tackle fake news ahead of US midterms","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook has announced new steps it claims will increase election security and combat fake news, but has declined to say whether the company supports federal legislation to regulate political ads. Company executives told reporters on Thursday that the company was expanding its fact-checking efforts, improving ad transparency, doubling its security team and working to prevent “misleading or divisive” memes from going viral in advance of the US midterm elections in November. The announcement, which did not include any major policy reforms, comes as Facebook is battling widespread alarm over its commitment to privacy in the wake of reporting in the Observer and the Guardian that the personal information of 50 million users was used by electioneering firm Cambridge Analytica. The privacy scandal has dramatically escalated concerns about Facebook’s impact on elections and democracies across the globe after revelations about Russian interference campaigns exploiting the platform and allegations that Facebook has spread hate speech and aided oppressive and violent government regimes. Despite its promise on Thursday to bring “unprecedented advertising transparency” to Facebook, the executives reportedly dodged a question about whether the company supports the Honest Ads Act, proposed federal legislation that would require tech companies to disclose the identities of political ad buyers – one of the most robust attempts to regulate social media advertising. In a recent Wired interview, Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said he supported the bill, but company leaders declined to commit to it during the call with reporters. Spokespeople did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries about Facebook’s position on the legislation and whether it intends to lobby against it. The company has recently increased its lobbying presence in Washington in advance of Zuckerberg’s expected testimony on Capitol Hill. In the spring, before the critical midterm elections in the US, advertisers will have to confirm their identities and where they are located in the country, a process that will involve page administrators submitting government IDs and providing a physical address for verification, according to Rob Leathern, product management director. Advertisers will also have to disclose the candidate, organization or business they represent, he said. Samidh Chakrabarti, Facebook’s product manager, said the company has also launched a new “investigative tool” to prevent the dissemination of false news and propaganda and that the company would “now proactively look for potentially harmful types of election-related activity, such as Pages of foreign origin that are distributing inauthentic civic content”. Facebook further said it would be ramping up its partnerships with third-party fact-checkers. The program, which was launched after the 2016 presidential election and involves independent news organizations flagging fake news on the site, has had questionable success over the last year. Some fact-checkers told the Guardian in November that their efforts seemed to be having a minimal impact and complained that the company was exploiting their labor for a PR effort. Tessa Lyons, a Facebook product manager, said Facebook is now partnering with Associated Press journalists in all 50 states, that it has fact-checkers in six other countries and that reporters were now scrutinizing photos and videos in addition to links. The press briefing came one day after Facebook announced it would be shutting down a feature that allowed “data brokers” like Oracle and Experian to use their own consumer information to target users on the platform."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/08/jared-kushner-joshua-harris-budget-director-loan-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-09T05:00:51Z","webTitle":"Wall St star approached to be Trump budget chief a year before loan to Kushner firm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/08/jared-kushner-joshua-harris-budget-director-loan-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/08/jared-kushner-joshua-harris-budget-director-loan-trump","fields":{"headline":"Wall St star approached to be Trump budget chief a year before loan to Kushner firm","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A senior private equity executive was approached about taking the job of US budget director a year before his company agreed to loan Jared Kushner’s private family business tens of millions of dollars, according to two sources who spoke to the Guardian. Joshua Harris, the billionaire co-founder of Apollo Global Management, was considered to be a candidate for the job of director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shortly after Donald Trump won the 2016 election, according to the sources, who had knowledge of the situation and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The sources told the Guardian that Harris began the task of disclosing his financial holdings but then backed out of the potential job because it would have been too difficult to unravel his personal finances in the short amount of time required to accept the government position. The sources said the alleged approach was initiated and backed by Kushner, a senior White House adviser who is also Trump’s son-in-law. The circumstances surrounding the $184m loan by Apollo to Kushner Companies, Kushner’s private family business, is currently the subject of an internal inquiry by the White House counsel’s office after the 2017 loan was revealed in a New York Times report in February. The newspaper reported that Kushner and Harris had discussed a possible White House job but that the job never materialised. Both Harris and an attorney representing Kushner emphatically deny that Harris was offered the OMB director job, which is one of the most powerful positions in any administration. “Mr Harris never applied for, was offered, or accepted any position at OMB,” a spokesman for Harris told the Guardian. The spokesman declined to comment on whether Harris had filled out financial disclosure forms. The spokesman did not dispute that a possible White House job had informally been discussed – as reported by the New York Times – but declined to offer any further details about the discussion. A spokesman for Kushner’s private attorney, Abbe Lowell, also denied the account. “Nothing about this assertion is accurate. Mr Kushner did not discuss any business concerning his former company in any meetings after he entered government, and he did not discuss the OMB or any position with him and did not (and could not) offer Josh Harris or anyone else the OMB position,” said the spokesman. There is no evidence that Kushner ever personally discussed the Apollo loans with Harris or that he personally or formally offered Harris the OMB post. Neither Kushner nor Harris have been accused of wrongdoing. But a source with direct knowledge, who said he was involved in the events, told the Guardian that Harris was offered the OMB job just days after the 2016 election and that the idea was initiated and supported by Kushner. The source said that Harris was “brilliant” and considered an innovative choice to lead the OMB because of Harris’s views about the federal deficit and corporate America. But that source said there was also some internal concern that Harris might be too close to Wall Street, since the administration already planned to tap Steve Mnuchin, a former banker, to serve as treasury secretary. The source with direct knowledge also alleged that Harris began filling out financial disclosure forms in connection to the position. Another source, who worked on the Trump transition, was allegedly informed that Harris had been chosen for the OMB post by a senior administration official. The transition official was later informed that the job did not ultimately work out because the financial disclosure involved in working for the federal government was too complicated for Harris to sort out in the short period required. The OMB directorship was later offered to Mick Mulvaney, a Republican hawk and former congressman, who accepted the job in mid-December 2016. The New York Times reported in February that Harris started making regular visits to the White House in early 2017 and met Kushner on several occasions to discuss US infrastructure policy. Months later, in November 2017, Apollo loaned $184m to Kushner Companies. The loan refinanced the company’s Chicago skyscraper. The White House counsel’s office told David Apol, the acting director of the Office of Government Ethics, that it was investigating the facts surrounding the loan following the New York Times report, according to a letter Apol sent to a Democratic congressman on 22 March. In a statement to the Guardian, the White House denied that Trump ever offered the OMB job to Harris. The loan is drawing scrutiny on Capitol Hill. In a 20 March letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren and other members of Congress, which was provided to the Guardian by Apollo and written in response to the lawmakers’ questions, attorneys for Apollo at Williams &amp; Connolly said that Kushner and Harris never discussed the Chicago loan and that initial discussions between Apollo and the Kushner Companies began in the summer of 2017, months after the alleged approach regarding the OMB job. “To our knowledge, Jared Kushner did not play any role on behalf of Kushner Companies with respect to the Chicago loan,” the letter stated. Apollo said the loan was made at market terms, in the ordinary course of business, and after an arm’s-length negotiation. The letter – which did not make any reference to any alleged job discussions – also disclosed that Apollo had participated in one other loan to Kushner Companies. Apollo’s attorneys said that in the spring of 2017, Kushner Companies and RFR Holding LLC sought to buyout a real estate partner’s stake in properties in Brooklyn, New York. The buyout of the partner, Invesco Real Estate, involved a $425m loan, consisting of a $325m loan by Citigroup, and a $75m loan by Apollo, and a $10m loan by Rockwood Capital. Apollo said the loan was not unusual and that it was not discussed by Harris and Kushner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/29/nine-senior-tories-want-amendments-to-eu-withdrawal-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T18:51:01Z","webTitle":"Nine senior Tories want amendments to EU withdrawal bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/29/nine-senior-tories-want-amendments-to-eu-withdrawal-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/29/nine-senior-tories-want-amendments-to-eu-withdrawal-bill","fields":{"headline":"Nine senior Tories want amendments to EU withdrawal bill","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nine senior Conservatives, including two former Cabinet ministers, have put their name to cross-party amendments to the European Union withdrawal bill. The Conservative peers, including Chris Patten, the former party chairman, and Douglas Hogg, the former agriculture minister, are supporting a series of substantial changes to the government’s flagship bill to leave the EU. A series of amendments have been tabled, including one giving parliament a vote on staying in a customs union which is almost certain to pass, meaning MPs will get a say on the contentious issue despite the government’s efforts to kick it into the long grass. Another significant proposal is to give Parliament a voice on what happens in the event the government’s final Brexit deal being voted down. Ministers have warned MPs that if they fail to back it the only other option is crashing out of the EU without any deal at all. The peers, however, think that MPs should be free to consider other options. The revolt, which was dubbed Theresa May’s Waterloo after the Duke of Wellington, whose ancestor defeated Napoleon in the 1815 battle, put his name to one of the amendments, is expected take place immediately after the Easter recess. MPs would then get the chance to vote on the proposals, which also include removing the government’s fixed exit day and a challenge to Henry VIII powers, which critics say are a power grab by ministers. Other Tory peers backing the cross-party amendments are Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, and former newspaper editor Patience Wheatcroft. Angela Smith of Basildon, the shadow leader of the Lords, said: “This bill is the first piece of legislation that reflects the practical implications of Brexit rather than the principle of whether or not we should continue to be in the EU. “It is therefore, an opportunity for the government to take a pragmatic view of how best to protect the rights of UK citizens rather than be distracted by the ideological pursuits of some on the Commons backbenches. “The period between now and the start of report stage offers Theresa May and her ministers an opportunity to bring forward sensible changes in response to concerns raised previously in the Lords. “A failure to do so however, will amount to kicking the can down what could be a very rocky road. And our peers won’t be shy about sending amendments to the Commons, giving MPs a further chance to scrutinise the detail of the bill.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/29/donald-trump-amazon-attack-twitter-jeff-bezos","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T18:24:10Z","webTitle":"Trump is partly right about Amazon, but for the wrong reasons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/donald-trump-amazon-attack-twitter-jeff-bezos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/29/donald-trump-amazon-attack-twitter-jeff-bezos","fields":{"headline":"Trump is partly right about Amazon, but for the wrong reasons","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump has his sights set on Amazon. He is reportedly “obsessed” with the internet commerce giant, and as is his wont, spent Thursday morning tweeting about it. And it’s not because he loves online shopping. “I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!” he said. Trump is allegedly mulling using antitrust measures to knock Amazon down a notch. Like so many of Trump’s governing impulses, his focus on Amazon probably has more to do with a personal grudge than any principle. He has a well-documented history of attacking the company due to the fact that its CEO, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post, which has been a thorn in the side of the administration on many a story. That doesn’t mean Amazon’s economic and political power isn’t a real problem, however. Trump’s motivation is bad and his grasp of the facts worse, but it’s true that Amazon’s ability to influence the market is an issue that needs a solution. Concerns about Amazon’s capacity to strangle competitors are nothing new, of course, dating back to its big-footing of publishers in the book market, which was its early claim to fame. But those worries have only been magnified in recent years by Amazon’s growing dominance of all online shopping and, now, with its acquisition of the Whole Foods grocery chain, its move into actual brick-and-mortar retail. Currently, more than half of online shopping searches begin directly on Amazon, and it is responsible for more than 40% of all internet retail sales. It simply dwarfs all comers in that space. And it’s involved many other kinds of business too, from data management to entertainment. Plus, Amazon has certain advantages that other businesses don’t. While Trump generally bungles the particulars when he rants about Amazon’s tax treatment, it is true that third-party sellers who use Amazon do not have to collect sales tax, giving them a leg up over Main Street stores. It’s also true that the company may have a sweet deal with the US Postal Service. This market power translates into political power for Amazon. Just look at how the company’s search for a second headquarters location is shaping up, with city and state lawmakers offering loads of tax breaks and other goodies to a company that already pulls in obscene amounts of money. Maryland, for instance, is on track to offer some $5.6bn in incentives for Amazon to bring its new headquarters there; in New Jersey, it’s $7bn. Some cities even want to direct taxes raised from Amazon back to Amazon, or allow it to provide input over where and how tax dollars are spent, abdicating a main government role to a private company. Amazon is so big and powerful that it has politicians all over the country asking “how high?” when it says “jump!” And not for nothing, Amazon already benefits from substantial public subsidies. His focus on Amazon is certainly not the only economic area in which Trump’s less than admirable motivations point him in the right direction. His distaste for CNN could very well have driven the administration to rightfully challenge the proposed merger between Time-Warner and AT&amp;T. On trade, his inability to grasp specific details and bizarre belief that the whole thing is a zero-sum game are still leading him to question a legitimately broken global trade order. Depending on how this all shakes out then, a positive outcome could emerge from one of Trump’s ridiculous grudges, as Amazon definitely needs to be reined in. Given the chaotic state of the administration, such inadvertent progress is probably the best for which we can hope. Pat Garofalo is a writer and editor based in Washington.

At Moto, your first course was your menu itself, which was typically printed in edible ink on a giant tortilla chip. When you finished your menu, you would be handed what looked like a Polaroid of a maki roll. The photograph was made of rice paper and coated in a dust of nori seaweed and soy sauce. It tasted the only way it could: like sesame, avocado, cucumber and crab sticks. Next to emerge would be a tumbler containing butter-poached lobster tail resting on a spoon, with creme fraiche, trout roe and carbonated grapes that would fizz in your mouth like soda. After that, a plate apparently splattered with roadkill would arrive. If you balked at the sight of the gore and guts, that was just what the chefs wanted. The dish was designed to look repulsive but taste delicious. The gristle was made from confit duck and the blood from juniper berry sauce. Thank God for that. You were being pushed and pulled about. Your ice-cream would be piping hot; your caramel apple would be made from pork belly; your table candle would be poured all over your clam bake. You were eating the food of chef Homaro Cantu and normal rules no longer applied. Cantu wanted to change what it meant to go to a restaurant – to reimagine how you were served, how you interacted with food, what could and could not be eaten. “I want to make food float,” Cantu told the New York Times in 2005. “I want to make it disappear, I want to make it reappear, I want to make the utensils edible, I want to make the plates, the table, the chairs, edible.” A large photograph of Salvador Dalí hung over the stairwell leading down to Moto’s basement kitchen. Printed on it was a quote: “The only difference between a madman and me is that I am not mad.” Since its birth in the late 19th century, haute cuisine has had little impact on what most of the planet eats. The greatest advances in cooking and taste barely trickle out from the 40-seat dining rooms of the world’s top restaurants, let alone make an impact upon the human relationship with food. Ferran Adriá’s El Bulli, one of the most acclaimed restaurants ever, once boasted 2m reservation requests a year, with a waiting list of 3,000 people per seat. But the cacophony of powders, foams and tinctures that issued from his Catalan kitchen were enjoyed by no more than 100,000 people before the restaurant closed in 2011. By contrast, Cantu’s project was about more than elevating haute cuisine to ever-higher levels or garnering Michelin stars (though he did win one, in 2012). His ambitions extended far beyond the walls of his restaurant: he wanted to eradicate hunger, eliminate diseases such as type 2 diabetes and save the planet. He was a compulsive inventor, dreaming up new technologies as well as new dishes. One of his big ideas was to eliminate cardboard and plastic packaging for juice drinks by blasting fruit with an ultrasonic wave generator. By bursting a fruit’s cells while keeping its skin intact, he hoped it might be possible for people to drink an orange, say, like a coconut. Another of his creations was a transparent polymer oven (US patent no 11118955) that could cook with minimal power by trapping heat. Cantu believed this oven had the potential to reduce energy consumption and enable people to cook in areas with restricted power supplies. “He just disgorges inventions,” Cantu’s patent lawyer, Chuck Valauskas, once said. By 2016, Cantu and his companies had at least four concept patents, with scores more in the works, tucked away somewhere in his garage or kitchen lab. Part of what made these inventions so remarkable was that Cantu was self-taught. He learned much of what he knew by tinkering tirelessly in the kitchen and reading voraciously when off-duty, sleeping only three or four hours a night (something he put down to lack of oversight as a child). Many of Cantu’s ideas were quixotic at best, or beset by problems that meant they eventually ended up discarded. But others were potentially transformative. “Nobody understood how influential, or how radical, or how far out there the stuff we were doing was,” one of Moto’s former chefs de cuisine, Richie Farina, told me. Since Moto closed, several of Cantu’s biggest ideas, and much of his experimental ethos, have moved to Silicon Valley, where Farina and six of Cantu’s former staff, backed by the strength of California capital, are developing vegetarian replications of meat and eggs, so that animals can be removed from the human diet. Cantu himself is not around to lead the projects he inspired. In April 2015, six months after submitting the first draft of Moto: the Cookbook, he killed himself. He was just 38. The book he left behind is perhaps the fullest expression of his philosophy. Characteristically, Cantu wanted to create something new – a cookbook that would include 100 stop-motion recipe videos. Each of these recipes would have a code you could scan with your phone: once you scanned it, a stop-motion video would appear, showing the dish being assembled. “A restaurant cookbook, typically, is just a faded memory of something that once was,” the book’s editor, Michael Szczerban, told me. “It kills the butterfly and mounts it. He wanted a book that wasn’t fossilised, and still lived.” Although Cantu is gone, the revolution he began endures. Since his death, his ideas have become increasingly influential and if his proteges in Silicon Valley succeed, then Cantu might one day be known as the chef who helped change the way we all eat. * * * Cantu, known to his friends as Omar, often said that his desire to do something radical with food came from growing up poor. Born in 1976 and raised mostly in Portland, Oregon, he was a quiet child who floated between apartments and homeless shelters with his sister and mother, who was often absent. “I don’t know if she was working or doing drugs. I was too young and naive to tell,” Cantu wrote many years later in a Facebook post describing the beatings and abuse he received as a young boy. “Our neighborhood was filled with gangs, drugs and violence,” he wrote. “As long as I didn’t get into fights, my teacher could give a shit why I came to school in tears.” Cantu’s widow, Katie McGowan, with whom he had two daughters, told me that her husband hoped to “use his platform for social change” and eradicate the hunger and suffering that he had experienced in his childhood. When he was 11, Cantu moved to the Bay Area to live with his father, who made him pay rent to sleep in an outhouse on his small property. His first job, when he was about 13 – he had to lie about his age to get it – was in a fried-chicken shack. “The food was awful,” he wrote, but he was enraptured by the restaurant’s tandoor. It was cooking at its most elemental, with the chef as nothing more than the mediator between food and fire. He also worked as a floor-sweeper at his father’s workplace, a factory that developed high-tech parts for the aerospace and defence company Lockheed Martin. At his jobs he “watched and learned between the cooking and the machinery”, absorbing lessons about craft, precision, and mechanics, Cantu said in an interview in 2011. He would often talk about how, as a kid, he had taken apart and rebuilt his father’s lawnmower to understand how a combustion engine functioned. In 1991, after graduating from high school, Cantu was offered free bed and board by Bill and Jan Miller, a Portland couple who offered help to teenagers in need of support. Encouraged by the Millers, who became like family to Cantu, he enrolled at the Western Culinary Institute in Portland. After culinary school, he spent the next few years travelling up and down the Pacific Northwest, working for next to nothing in dozens of restaurants, from fancy establishments such as Wolfgang Puck’s Spago in Beverly Hills to a Burger King in Orange County. One day, during this period, while he was tripping on magic mushrooms, Cantu came across a copy of On Food and Cooking by Harold McGee, the foundational text of molecular gastronomy, a style of cooking that promised to fuse postmodern art with intricate scientific experimentation. The book was a revelation to Cantu, and from then on, he began devouring books and new influences. From the 19th-century French gourmand Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, Cantu took the idea that just as food sustains our physical existence, taste sustains our psychological existence. Enchanted by MC Escher, Dalí and Van Gogh, Cantu resolved to infuse the ideas of great artists into his cooking. At Moto – named after a Japanese word that can mean anything from “idea” to “desire” to “origin” – he would go on to create a dish of duck and skate wing emulating Escher’s tessellated woodcut Sky and Water I. It was accompanied by an edible image that would change tastes – from duck to fish – as you chomped your way through it. Perhaps his greatest influence, though, was the legendary Chicago chef Charlie Trotter, whose cookbook Cantu had cherished at college. Trotter, who died in 2013, was besotted with jazz and philosophy and sought to bring relentless improvisation to his cooking, trying never to serve the same dish twice. As a boss, he was notoriously demanding and volatile. For every anecdote of Trotter’s brilliance and exactitude – many former employees went on to win Michelin stars – there were dozens more accounts of the brutal culture he fostered. Employees at the restaurant were expected to give, give and give again, with 16-hour shifts considered normal. Resolving to learn at his master’s feet, Cantu flew to Chicago in 1999 and headed to Trotter’s restaurant, where he begged Matthias Merges, the long-term chef de cuisine, to hire him. Eventually Merges gave in. “I needed a guy to show me how to kick ass in a no-holds-barred kitchen with nothing but hall-of-fucking-famers on every station. That’s what it was,” Cantu recalled in a Facebook post years later. “It was intense, it was unforgiving,” Merges told me. “Most people who couldn’t take that kind of pressure in that environment usually weaned themselves out after 10-12 months.” But Cantu relished the hothouse atmosphere. If one of the restaurant’s senior chefs joked that Cantu should shell peas after work until 4am while watching the Discovery Channel, he took it as a challenge. “No matter what they piled on, I did it,” Cantu wrote. Cantu lasted four years at Trotter’s, ascending the ranks to become sous chef, the second-highest position in the kitchen, at one of the most daring and decadent restaurants ever to have opened its doors to the public. He was 26 years old. In 2003, Cantu applied to be executive chef at Ima, a yet-to-open Asian fusion restaurant in Chicago. After laying on an intricate tasting dinner for the investors, including fish cooked tableside in his polymer oven, Cantu convinced them to not only to hand him the role, but also the creative reins. He also suggested another name for the restaurant: Moto. * * * Setting up a new restaurant was a very different business to working at an established institution. Money was tight, access to the city’s finest suppliers was gone. Moto was the first restaurant in Chicago’s now-bustling West Loop meatpacking district, and each night, before service could begin, staff had to hose down the street outside to stop the smell of pig blood wafting in through the windows. Ben Roche, who joined Moto early on, told me that the restaurant started out “super low-budget: broken brick walls, plumbing that didn’t work, and shit ovens,” that initially gave the kitchen the feel of a torture chamber. In its early days, many customers, mistaking Moto for a sushi bar, were bewildered when they were presented with a 20-course degustation menu. Cantu’s solution was to hand them the edible polaroid of the maki roll. This was just the start of Cantu’s joyously bizarre innovations. He was obsessed with the seemingly infinite forms a single taste could assume. A pork sandwich, say, did not have to look like a pork sandwich. For the Moto dish Cuban Missile Crisis, the constituents of a Cuban pork sandwich – bolillo bread, pork shoulder, pickles – were flattened out, rolled up, fried and wrapped in a collard green. The end was then dipped in red pepper puree, rolled in an “ash” made of spices and placed in a $2 ashtray, looking for all the world like a Bolivar no 2 cigar. Moto’s most characteristic dishes were all, in some way or other, bound to this mischievous method, from the Cuban cigar to the duck and mole cannoli that looked Sicilian but tasted Mexican. “We wanted people to leave the restaurant wondering ‘How?’ or ‘Why?’ or ‘What the hell was that?’” Trevor Niekowal, who worked at Moto from 2005 to 2007, told me. Behind the subterfuge and sleight-of-hand lay deeper philosophical questions: if something looked, smelled and tasted like a particular food, did it really matter that it didn’t contain the food in question? If you could produce a lobe of foie gras from yellow split-peas without force-feeding a duck, then would foie gras in the future have any more value than an apple or a pot of cress? Cantu was equally fascinated by the practical implications of his experiments: if these products could be made cheaper and more accessible – say, to those with dietary restrictions or little money – then animal cruelty could be reduced, as could much of the environmental damage in our production of food. What’s more, the sheer variety of tastes accessible to the average person would become almost unlimited. Moto began to gain momentum in 2004, when it appeared on the Chicago restaurant review show Check, Please! All three reviewers – a used car salesman, a public school teacher and a lawyer – described it as the best dining experience of their life. After the show aired, the bookings surged in. The following year, the New York Times ran a feature on Cantu, presenting him as a futurist wunderkind hellbent on revolutionising the dining experience with inventions such as inside-out bread cooked with laser beams or ion-particle guns used to levitate food. Although none of these innovations ever made it onto the menu – or even far beyond the conversation with the journalist in question –the article helped confirm Cantu’s image. He was, in the words of a 2006 profile in the magazine Fast Company, the “Edison of the Edible”. Cantu’s approach did not always lead to excellent food; the ratio, according to a couple of former chefs I spoke to, was “three brilliant, four good, three bad”. Bad could be an idea that sounded great in the morning meeting but didn’t make it past its first night of service. One of the restaurant’s less successful creations was the “dynamite stick”, a raspberry-flavoured white chocolate tube, filled with three different-coloured purees, and finished with a candied vanilla bean wick. The waiter would drop the stick onto the guest’s plate, whereupon the dynamite would explode, splattering the multicoloured purees across the plate. “When done perfectly,” Roche told me, “it was a very beautiful and surprising technique.” When the waiters got the timing wrong, it meant that Moto would have to cover a guest’s dry-cleaning bill. Cantu pushed his team hard, and they, in turn, helped shape the creative development of the restaurant. Both Trevor Rose-Hamblin, the general manager at Moto and the second Cantu restaurant, iNG, which opened in 2011 in Chicago, and another former collaborator, Rocco Laudizio, remembered with fondness Cantu’s signature method of getting your attention while you were off the clock: texting you his message letter-by-letter until you responded, whatever the hour. Working with Cantu meant “being told that today you were going to work out how to grow vegetables in space,” said Rose-Hamblin. He meant this literally: one of Cantu’s side project was consulting with Nasa and Elon Musk’s company SpaceX on 3D-printing food for astronauts, and growing crops aboard spaceships. In 2010, Cantu and Roche were given a cable television series, Future Food, and a laboratory to explore their wildest ideas. One idea that Cantu pushed on the show, which has since become a holy grail of the food industry, was the possibility of artificially creating a vegetarian burger patty that tasted and behaved like ground beef. Cantu milled beetroot through a meat grinder to imitate the coarse texture of mince and bound the patty with glycerides to give it fattiness. The patty even “bled” while cooking on the grill. The meatless burger was one element of what Cantu called “zero food-mile gastronomy”, where every element of your meal could be produced in-house. He also embraced aeroponic farming, where plants are grown without soil through constant aeration and the roots are sprayed with nutrient mist. To Cantu, meatless meat and plants grown from little more than light, air and mist were the first tentative steps towards a world where restaurants – beginning with his own – could engineer steaks, eggs, vegetables and all manner of kitchen produce in-house, from natural ingredients, and at low ethical, financial and ecological costs. His hope was for these techniques to become available to everyone, with aeroponic farms eventually becoming as much a part of every normal home as central heating. * * * Nothing better embodied Cantu’s utopianism than the miracle berry. This small west-African fruit contains miraculin, a complex molecule that temporarily disrupts the sour and bitter receptors on the human tongue. The miracle berry was one way to rewrite the rules of what food could be. It was capable, Cantu would often say, of making “a lemon taste like the sweetest lemonade you’ve ever tasted” and of giving bitter foods a savoury, meaty quality. (The miracle berry first came to international prominence in the 1960s, thanks to Robert Harvey, an entrepreneur who managed to synthesise miraculin, attracting tens of millions of dollars in investment as he challenged the sugar and artificial sweetener industries. Miralin – as his synthesised sweetener was called – was on the cusp of launching before the FDA, in 1974, ruled it to be an additive and prohibited its use in the US.) Cantu first came across the miracle berry in 2005, when a chef at Moto introduced him to its “flavour-tripping” capabilities. Shortly after, he received a message from a friend, asking if he knew of any way to alleviate her friend’s difficulty with eating during chemotherapy. Discovering that such patients experienced a rubbery, metallic taste while eating, Cantu and Roche worked in Cantu’s garage late at night after Moto had closed, chewing on aluminium foil and rubber, before dosing with the berry and trying them again. They developed miracle berry strips, designed to easily dissolve on the tongue. It worked, and the 86-year-old chemo patient was able to enjoy her first meal in months. For years, Cantu kept and treasured the voicemail from his friend that told him his idea had worked. The miracle berry’s potential captivated Cantu. If you could take abundant, local plants that still had nutritional value, and make them delicious without lathering them with fat and sugar, you would be opening up a whole new palette of consumable foods. Taking the idea even further, if you could replace refined sugar with natural alternatives without sacrificing flavour, the effect on public health would be seismic. Rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease could potentially plummet. On Future Food in 2010, Cantu performed a startling proof-of-concept dinner for the miracle berry, demonstrating to diners how unpalatable-yet-edible plants could, through the tricking of their tastebuds, be used to mimic familiar flavours in dishes. In one dish, he took crabapples, cactus and hay from his own backyard, and had his chefs turn those ingredients into barbecued steak, astounding the restaurant’s guests. There was, however, a problem with the miracle berry: it didn’t work on everyone. For some, the miraculin would have little-to-no impact, and so the unsweetened, bitter, acidic foods would taste every bit as bad as their original ingredients would suggest. It was also a very expensive crop to grow, and one that can be difficult to grow domestically because of its intolerance to cold. The culinary use of the berry, as opposed to the medicinal use for chemotherapy patients, drew scepticism. “In nature, there’s a reason some things taste good and some things don’t, and a lot of times things don’t taste good because they’re not good for you,” Grant Achatz, chef-proprietor of the three-Michelin-starred Chicago restaurant Alinea, told the Chicago Tribune in 2012. Nonetheless, Cantu persisted with the idea, walking into iNG one day and ordering his head chef Nate Park “to get all of the white fucking sugar out of this restaurant by the end of the day” and find natural substitutes to replace it. In 2013, he wrote and published The Miracle Berry Diet Cookbook with more than 150 painstakingly composed dishes suited to the miracle berry, from teriyaki chicken to lemon and cream cheese eclairs – all made with zero sugar. The thorough testing for the dishes used so much lemon juice and vinegar that Chris Jones, Moto’s chef de cuisine, lost some enamel from his teeth. Cantu’s obsession with the idea reached its height with the opening of the Chicago cafe Berrista in 2014. Berrista allowed Cantu to reach an audience beyond the world of fine-dining, offering, in a more commercial form, some of the innovations he’d developed at Moto, such as carbonated fruit. The food was, in Rose-Hamblin’s words, “stupendous … the best cafe food in the city”, but the central purpose of the cafe – a space to promote the miracle berry – was rendered defunct fairly quickly. “The idea of changing flavours in your mouth in a coffee shop was just a difficult reach,” Merges, chef de cuisine at Trotter’s, told me. By the beginning of 2015, Cantu was working on Moto: the Cookbook, and preparing for the opening of a new brewery and restaurant, Crooked Fork. But things were also unravelling. Cantu’s second restaurant, iNG, closed in May 2014. An ambitious plan for a state-of-the-art green lab – a dedicated space for Cantu’s experiments – fell through. Moto was mired in financial disputes. An investor, Alexander Espalin, was suing Cantu for allegedly moving funds around his businesses too freely, using the money from Moto to shore up his other ventures, as well as failing to pay him due profits. The lawsuit, which Cantu’s wife Katie dismissed on Facebook as “another case of someone trying to make a buck off of him”, sought to oust Cantu from the restaurant he had built from nothing. Meanwhile, Cantu was bouncing from Moto to Berrista, to his research company Cantu Designs, to the new brewery, to a nonprofit mentoring programme he ran in honour of Charlie Trotter, trying to keep each of his projects going. Despite these pressures, his friends and colleagues did not notice that Cantu was suffering more than normal. At the start of 2015, when Cantu visited him in California, Roche recalled him as “in good spirits”, with “lots of stories to tell of the latest project he was working on”. Cantu also travelled to Scotland and Vancouver with Rose-Hamblin, hoping to learn about the craft of brewing ahead of Crooked Fork’s opening. To Rose-Hamblin, Cantu also seemed happy and excited about the future, although he was apprehensive about the upcoming departure of Moto’s chef de cuisine, Richie Farina, who was leaving after seven years. Then, on 14 April, Cantu hanged himself in the large warehouse space where the brewery was supposed to open later that year. Roche was at work when he heard the news. “I didn’t know how to process that right away, it was as if someone had just taken the wind out of me,” he said. In a commemoration of his passing, Farina led a memorial dinner service in Moto on the Saturday after Cantu’s death, supported by past and present staff, and offering a tribute menu of Moto classics from the previous decade. Moto would survive another year under a new chef, Chris Anderson, retaining its Michelin star. It would, however, serve its final service on Valentine’s Day 2016, after being sold to the Alinea Group, which now owns the entire block on Fulton Market where Cantu’s two restaurants stood. Every friend of Cantu’s that I spoke to referred to his frenetic drive and energy. “When he had an idea, and he believed in something, he put 100,000% into it. It was 24/7 – the man was superhuman,” Cantu’s former communications director, Derrek J Hull, told me. “I don’t know of any other human being who would be willing, or physically able, or mentally able, to do that.” His chefs would be used to him greeting them first thing in the morning with a new contraption, if he hadn’t texted them with ideas to wake them up; his wife – already adjusted to his poor sleeping patterns – would see him stop sleeping completely in times of high stress, or sleeping all through his Sundays off out of total exhaustion. With each day, he strived to bring the world closer to his vision. “He was a rescuer,” said Brett A Schwartz, who spent two-and-a-half years filming Cantu for his documentary Insatiable: The Homaro Cantu Story, “but he couldn’t rescue himself.” * * * In his lifetime, Cantu was not able to see his most radical aims become reality. But that doesn’t mean that they won’t. Although the miracle berry still seems a long way from solving world hunger, it does appear to have a future in palliative care, as pilot studies have been conducted on its effectiveness in restoring the sense of flavour to chemotherapy patients. The training Cantu gave his chefs has also translated well to Silicon Valley. Chris Jones, who was Moto’s chef de cuisine until 2011, was the first of Cantu’s team to head to the coast and join the food manufacturer Just, Inc. He has been joined by half a dozen former Cantu employees, including Roche and Farina, and they have moulded the company’s approach along the lines of Moto. Cantu performed R&amp;D work for Just, Inc’s CEO, Josh Tetrick, an entrepreneur who hopes to displace the egg and meat markets with animal-free, vegan versions of these products. Tetrick told me that Cantu was the person who introduced him to “the intersection between the culinary world and science”. He was astounded when Cantu was able to reel off stacks of obscure academic information about the protein composition of albumen and the formation of egg shells in different species. Still, Cantu rebuffed Tetrick’s offers of a full-time job out in San Francisco. He had Moto, and Cantu Designs, and believed that he could produce the same innovations as Tetrick in the manner he had always done – task by task, day by day, however he fancied. Cantu was proud to see his team moving on to new ventures, taking delight in “raising wolves and not sheep”, as he told a handful of them upon their departure. But Rose-Hamblin also recalled Cantu’s attachment to the chefs he had lost to San Francisco, and mentioned his dream “for everyone to live on his block at Old Irving Park … to have a thinktank and a laboratory, and to build an empire of innovation” with them all. Later this year, Just intends to release its first “clean meat” products to the market, including a burger patty. It is also working on a foie gras, which will be cruelty-free and markedly cheaper, while maintaining the same flavour and texture. “Technology is finally catching up with Omar’s ideology,” one of Cantu’s former chefs, Thomas Bowman, told me. But Cantu’s vision was wider than the work of a single company. It was all-encompassing. He understood that we are heading towards disaster, with the folly of our consumptive habits already reshaping the planet. He thought it was obscene to have food so inaccessible to those who need it. But through this stark analysis shone a belief in the transformative power of scientific advancement, and an urgent desire to make an impact now. Few individuals, never mind chefs, have acted on such ambitions. “It’s neither easy nor convenient to want to change the world,” Cantu wrote, in the final lines of the introduction to his cookbook, “but we must stretch our imaginations, and never forget that we have gone from cave-dwellers to space explorers in the blink of an eye.” • This article was amended on 12 April and 1 May 2018.

The charity’s chief executive, Sally Harvey, resigned as the Charity Commission began an inquiry into the Pears Centre for Specialist Learning near Coventry, following several other serious incidents last year. The investigation into the RNIB comes amid questions about the management of charities, with Oxfam and other charitable organisations criticised recently over allegations of abuse and sexual exploitation of vulnerable beneficiaries. The Pears Centre allegation was reported to the police, who are taking no further action. Eleanor Southwood, the chair of the RNIB, said the charity had ordered an urgent review and it was deeply concerned about the allegations. “We take this extremely seriously and we have a plan that will support the children first and foremost,” she said. “I am profoundly sorry that we have let down a group of children whose families have entrusted them to our care.” In a statement, the Charity Commission said the incidents raised concerns that the subsidiary charity “may have consistently failed to comply” with regulations designed to protect vulnerable children. Harvey Grenville, the watchdog’s head of investigations, said: “The first priority of the trustees of both charities must now be to ensure that the vulnerable young people cared for at the centre are protected from harm. The charities have already taken some immediate steps in order to do so.” The Pears Centre is a school and children’s home for young people who are blind or partially sighted and also have multiple disabilities or complex needs, including severe or profound learning disabilities. The site has five bungalows, each with six bedrooms. The school’s classrooms were specially designed to have space for physiotherapy and mobility equipment. The school has special music rooms and therapy rooms, and recently opened a hydrotherapy pool. Children can live at the school year-round. The centre was established in 1957 and originally known as Rushton Hall school. It was reopened by Princess Anne in 2012 and named after the Pears Foundation, which funded its redevelopment. The school was rated “outstanding” by Ofsted in 2013, but in its 2017 report, the regulator noted that “safeguarding is ineffective. The proprietor and governors have not ensured that systems are coordinated and cohesive, accessible and robust”. Ofsted rated the Pears Centre “inadequate” in its most recent report, and earlier this month gave the RNIB notice that it would withdraw the children’s home registration unless there were significant changes. The RNIB has faced difficulties in recent years, reporting a loss of £12.6m in its accounts last year. The accounts said “we have recognised that our financial trajectory was not sustainable”. Late last year, 23 staff were made redundant from one department of the charity. The Charity Commission said it would be working with Ofsted and other agencies during the investigation. The RNIB was founded in 1868 as the British and Foreign Blind Association for Improving the Embossed Literature of the Blind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/apr/07/what-to-see-this-week-in-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-07T08:00:56Z","webTitle":"What to see this week in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/07/what-to-see-this-week-in-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/apr/07/what-to-see-this-week-in-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"What to see this week in the UK","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Five of the best ... films 120 Beats Per Minute (15) (Robin Campillo, 2017, Fra) 143 mins Raise a fist and shed a tear with this remarkable story of a radical Aids-awareness group in 1990s Paris. Shock tactics and lively debates are captured in documentary style, but it’s the relationships that gradually come to dominate, particularly a new gay couple for whom the ticking clock of untreatable HIV adds to the passion and poignancy. Thoroughbreds (15) (Cory Finley, 2017, US) 92 mins Detached, deadpan and downright disturbing, this study of teen partners-in-crime follows in the tradition Heathers and Heavenly Creatures, with sharp dialogue and slick camerawork. Study partners Anya Taylor-Joy and Olivia Cooke bond over privilege and bored disillusionment, co-opting hapless Anton Yelchin into their scheme to murder Taylor-Joy’s stepdad. Ghost Stories (15) (Jeremy Dyson, Andy Nyman, 2017, UK) 96 mins Almost a modern-day Dead of Night, this horror weaves its tales of terror into a grand design. Co-writer and director Nyman plays a paranormal-debunker revisiting three cases that challenge his disbelief in the supernatural: those of Paul Whitehouse, Alex Lawther and Martin Freeman. These episodes are loaded with shock and dread, but common elements hint at a larger pattern connected to Nyman. Isle of Dogs (PG) (Wes Anderson, 2018, US/Ger) 101 mins Anderson’s eye for detail and ear for deadpan go into overdrive in a lovable animated tale. It’s set on a rubbish-dump island off the coast of retro-future Japan, where a band of rogueish mutts help a kid reunite with his pet and overthrow the dog-hating mayor. The story is hardly the point: it’s all about the hand-crafted visuals, eccentric characters and perfectly timed comedy. Love, Simon (12A) (Greg Berlanti, 2018, US) 110 mins It’s almost a selling point that this romcom (pictured) is so normal, since its subject is closeted gay teenhood. Simon (Nick Robinson) is forced to contemplate coming out when an online post from an anonymous classmate declares that he, too, is gay. The stakes are raised when their secret chats become more intimate. Someone’s going to have to put their heart on the line. SR Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop gigs Harry Styles While he spent the last One Direction tour gamely trying to muster some enthusiasm, the immaculately suited Styles seems to have found his comfort zone in 70s-style soft-rock (Two Ghosts) and blustery ballads (Sign of the Times). Expect posturing, some new songs and the requisite Fleetwood Mac cover. Genting Arena, Birmingham Saturday 7; Manchester Arena Monday 9; The O2, SE10 Wednesday 11 &amp; Thursday 12; touring to 16 April Lil Uzi Vert Over the space of four years, Philadelphia rapper Lil Uzi Vert has moved from SoundCloud darling to A-list eccentric, scoring a US Top 10 with XO Tour Llif3, a Grammy nomination for best new artist and a supporting role on Migos’s global hit Bad and Boujee. With five albums to pick from, expect ordered chaos. Manchester, Sunday 8; Birmingham, Monday 9; London, Tuesday 10 April Girl Ray Lo-fi indie trio Girl Ray, AKA Poppy Hankin, Iris McConnell and Sophie Moss, live in their own world. Well, they live in north London, but musically – as showcased on recent debut album – theirs is a timeless conflation of C86-era indie, 70s Todd Rundgren and good old-fashioned sweet and sour heartache. Bristol, Tuesday 10; Nottingham, Wednesday 11; Hebden Bridge, Thursday 12; Glasgow, Friday 13; touring to 19 April Wiki With his leftfield hip-hop collective Ratking on hiatus, Wiki, AKA Patrick Morales arrives in the UK in support of last year’s No Mountains in Manhattan debut (there have been mixtapes, obviously). A multi-layered celebration of New York City, it features prominent rappers from the five boroughs including Ghostface Killah, Your Old Droog and Lakutis. Manchester, Wednesday 11; Liverpool, Friday 13; touring to 18 April MC Sheila Jordan Sheila Jordan, the quietly startling 89-year-old singer, was on radio in her native Pennsylvania by 14, won bebop genius Charlie Parker’s praises, and has been a celebrated jazz vocalist for six decades. She visits London and the Gateshead jazz festival with pianist Pete Churchill’s trio and a string quartet.

Orchestra Chineke!’s debut in 2015 was one of the last events in the QEH before it was closed for refurbishment, and now they give the opening concert in the renovated space. Anthony Parnther conducts a programme that opens with Britten’s The Building of the House Overture; it also includes Beethoven’s Fourth Symphony and the premiere of Daniel Kidane’s Dream Song. Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1 Monday 9 April Jack Quartet This new programme from the US’s leading new-music string quartet is typically wide-ranging, with works from the new world – Amy Williams’s Richter Textures and Marcos Balter’s Chambers – alongside two from British composers: Julian Anderson’s Third Quartet (a world premiere) and Brian Ferneyhough’s Dum Transisset. Wigmore Hall, W1, Wednesday 11 April The Gender Agenda The London Sinfonietta present an evening devoted to the provocative music-theatre of Philip Venables. Hosted by “anti-drag queen” David Hoyle, The Gender Agenda is described as a parody gameshow, highlighting issues of gender equality. It is followed by Venables’s Illusions, which combines live music with video in a wickedly funny, often scabrous tirade. Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1, Thursday 12 April The Marriage of Figaro Irish National Opera made its debut last month with a revival of Adès’s Powder Her Face, but Patrick Mason’s production of The Marriage of Figaro will be its first bespoke show. Jonathan Lemalu is Figaro with Tara Erraught as Susanna. National Opera House, Wexford, Friday 13; Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, 17 to 21 April AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Monet &amp; Architecture The radiance and life of Monet’s art is almost beyond compare, so a chance to see 75 of his paintings is not to be sniffed at. They won’t be the most familiar, either, as this exhibition surveys the little-noticed theme of his fascination with buildings. The paintings of Rouen Cathedral and the Venice skyline are among his most profound. The National Gallery, WC2 Monday 9 April to 29 July Bumped Bodies Sarah Lucas and Rebecca Warren are among the artists offering uneasy views of our relationships with our bodies in this exhibition taken from the ISelf collection. Warren’s sculptures of independent striding female legs (pictured) typify its surreal perspectives on the human form. Others featured include Tony Cragg and Enrico David. Whitechapel Gallery, E1, Tuesday 10 April to 12 August Linder: The House of Fame This haunting odyssey through multiverses of history and imagination is a mind-boggling delight. Linder started her career making collages for the Buzzcocks in the heyday of punk and still practises it with poetic vision. She has created a show that is a vast collage of her enthusiasms; my favourites include demonic drawings by the architect Inigo Jones and lingerie masks by Linder herself. Nottingham Contemporary, to 24 June America’s Cool Modernism: O’Keeffe to Hopper Charles Demuth’s visionary painting I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold is an American icon. It combines the complex energy of cubism with a bold eye for the modern world that anticipates pop art. This and other classics make for an eye-opening journey through the art of the jazz age. If you thought Jackson Pollock was the first modern American artist who mattered, think again. Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, to 22 July Victorian Giants: The Birth of Art Photography The genius of Julia Margaret Cameron (work pictured) stands out in this exhibition about the first photographic avant garde. Cameron, Lewis Carroll, Lady Clementina Hawarden and Oscar Rejlander were friends who shared ideas and even models. All were vivid image-makers but the depth and reality of Cameron’s portraits set her apart. National Portrait Gallery, WC2, to 20 May JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows The Last Ship It may not have been a hit on Broadway but Sting’s musical about the demise of shipbuilding has come home to the north-east in triumph and now sets off on a nationwide tour. Director Lorne Campbell provides a new book and creates a rousing evening full of heart and song. Northern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne Saturday 7; Liverpool Playhouse Monday 9 to 14 April; touring to 7 July Palmyra In this superb two-hander from Bertrand Lesca and Nasi Voutsas, the stage ends up covered in smashed crockery, which can be read in many ways. The obvious one is as a metaphor for the destruction of the ancient Syrian city, but it is also a playful, powerful examination of how relationships can break down and turn destructive. Battersea Arts Centre, SW11, Tuesday 10 to 14 April; touring to 9 June Secret Life of Humans This devised show is inspired by Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and the life and death of Dr Jacob Bronowski, who popularised science with the 1973 TV series The Ascent of Man. It’s a bold and daring show that melds fact and fiction to fine effect, and is stuffed with big questions about what it is that makes us human as well as our ability to solve the challenges we face as a species. The New Diorama Theatre, NW1, Tuesday 10 April to 5 May Frogman Curious Directive is a pioneering company and its latest show makes innovative use of virtual reality technology in the service of storytelling. Casting the audience as the jury in a court case, the show takes us back in time to 1995 on the Great Barrier Reef where teenager Ashleigh has gone missing. A recreation of childhood and the way memory is deceptive, this is a bold piece of theatre. Not all of it works, but it is always interesting in the way it folds VR into the experience. Shoreditch Town Hall, EC1, to 14; touring to 28 April The Birthday Party It is your last chance to catch up with Ian Rickson’s fine revival of Harold Pinter’s play, delivered both with menaces and comedy. Zoë Wanamaker is a joy as Meg, the wittering boarding-house landlady whose attempts at throwing a birthday party go badly wrong when two thugs disrupt the celebrations in search of the guest of honour, a show-stealing Toby Jones. The Harold Pinter Theatre, SW1, to 14 April LG Three of the best ... dance shows Ballet Central The always excellent graduate company embraces a typically ambitious range of contemporary and classical work for its annual UK tour, combining extracts from, among others, Matthew Bourne’s Sleeping Beauty, Wayne McGregor’s Far and Christopher Gable’s Cinderella, plus Black Swan, a new work by Jenna Lee. Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds Monday 9 April; touring to 14 July English National Ballet: Voices of America Kudos to Tamara Rojo for persuading William Forsythe to choreograph his first new ballet for a British company in 20 years. This celebration of the US ballet tradition also features Aszure Barton’s Fantastic Beings (pictured) and Jerome Robbins’s Cage. Sadler’s Wells, EC1, Thursday 12 to 21 April Cowpuncher The QEH celebrates its reopening with Holly Blakey’s swaggering, subversive take on the world of cowboy movies. Created in collaboration with composer Mica Levi, Cowpuncher uses the archetype of the outlaw to celebrate outsiders and transgressives everywhere.

The latest snapshot of the economy from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply found that services – which account for almost 80% of national output – registered virtually no growth in March. While the damage to the economy is not expected to be permanent, Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the the severe cold snap would have affected overall growth in the first three months of 2018. “The UK economy iced up in March, suffering the weakest increase in business activity since the Brexit vote amid widespread disruptions caused by some of the heaviest snowfall in years. As a result, first-quarter economic growth will likely have been adversely affected,” Williamson said. He said the economy was on course to have expanded by 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the previous quarter. He added the weather-related slowdown in March was unlikely to deter the Bank of England from considering an interest-rate rise at the meeting of its monetary policy committee in May. The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index is a closely watched guide to the wellbeing of the economy, and showed that service sector activity slipped from 54.5 in February to 51.7 last month. A reading above 50 represents growth, but the expansion in March was the weakest since July 2016, the month immediately after the EU referendum. The report said there was anecdotal evidence that unusually bad weather had disrupted business operations and contributed to subdued consumer spending in March. In addition, firms also reported that Brexit-related uncertainty was putting the brakes on growth. Service sector firms said there had been a sharp rise in costs during March, with the rate of inflation the strongest for three months. Higher input prices were attributed to greater staff salaries, rising utility bills and increased raw material costs, particularly of food and drink. Economist James Smith at ING Bank said: “Several bouts of snow over recent weeks mean we’ll have to wait until next month to see if the latest dip in the UK PMI signals something more sinister. Whilst we suspect this [dip] will prove temporary, we don’t expect an imminent acceleration in economic growth either. The consumer squeeze – while past its worst – looks set to persist, with real incomes set to remain relatively flat. With consumer confidence not far off post-Brexit lows, we expect the economy to continue struggling to regain full speed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/15/world-cup-stunning-moments-josimar-charms-the-world-at-mexico-86","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"World Cup stunning moments: Josimar charms the world at Mexico 86 | Rob Smyth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/15/world-cup-stunning-moments-josimar-charms-the-world-at-mexico-86","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/15/world-cup-stunning-moments-josimar-charms-the-world-at-mexico-86","fields":{"headline":"World Cup stunning moments: Josimar charms the world at Mexico 86","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In the summer of 1964, England took part in the Little World Cup in Brazil. It was a simple four-team league involving Portugal, Argentina and the hosts. England finished joint-bottom with Portugal. In their first match they were plugged 5-1 by Brazil in Rio. They commiserated with a night on the town, and were staggering around Copacabana beach the following morning when they were challenged to a game by some local kids. It was an embarrassing mismatch: the England team, two years away from winning the Big World Cup, got absolutely slaughtered for the third time in 18 hours. Admittedly it was 12 v seven, and the seven had quaffed a few performance-diminishing substances the night before. But the story, told in Jimmy Greaves’s Don’t Shoot the Manager, reflects an eternal truth about Brazilian football: that there are brilliant, natural talents on every beach corner. The ultimate symbol of that is Josimar, the two-hit wonder of Mexico 86. No World Cup has ever produced a better collection of goals – if you do only one thing with your lunch break today – and Josimar scored two monsters against Northern Ireland and Poland. He might as well have come straight out of the thin Mexican air. Nobody outside Brazil had heard of him; he wasn’t even in the Panini album. He wasn’t just unknown – he was also uncapped and unemployed when he was called up to the Brazil squad at the last minute after the first-choice right-back Leandro pulled out. Four players missed a curfew but only one, the playboy winger Renato Gaúcho, was thrown out of the squad by the manager Telê Santana. Leandro, whose head was a mess at the time, pulled out in a kind of guilty solidarity. Josimar had not played a game since mid-March, when his Botafogo contract expired. He was cooking and looking after his pregnant wife when he received a call telling him he was going to Mexico. In the best traditions, he thought it was a joke, politely said thank you and got on with his day. An hour later he received another call telling him where and when to report. Édson Boaro, the back-up for Leandro who was now first choice, got injured after 10 minutes of the second match against Algeria. Josimar was not on the bench but he did replace Edson in the starting line-up against Northern Ireland six days later. He was strikingly tall for a full-back and formidably built, with a sinewy frame and thighs made of oak. Brazil were 1-0 up with four minutes to go to half-time, keeping the ball with some lazy passing in Northern Ireland’s half. “Josimar … Júnior … Elzo … Alemao,” said BBC commentator John Motson, capturing the rhythmic groove of Brazil’s possession as Alemão played the ball square to Josimar. “Well, Careca and Casagrande are waiting for a cross.” They’re still waiting. Josimar pushed the ball in front of him, sprinted on the spot in excitement at what he was about to attempt, and put his whole being into a shot. It was a ridiculous distance from which to shoot - 30 yards out and a long way to the right of centre – but the ball swooshed wickedly and arrowed past Pat Jennings into the far top corner. The celebration was almost as iconic as the goal. Josimar went off on a mini lap of honour, both arms raised in the air, his face a picture of giddy disbelief. Years later, Jennings was asked by a small boy at a Q&amp;A what it was like to be chipped by Josimar from 35 yards. “Son,” he said. “Your idea of a chip and my idea of a chip are two different things!” For a full-back, a goal like that is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. So Josimar did it again four days later, rampaging through the Poland defence to batter the ball home from an absurd angle. It was the second goal in a 4-0 win that took Brazil into the quarter-finals, where they lost to France on penalties after a classic 1-1 draw. Even though he only played three games, Josimar was included in Fifa’s team of the tournament, the only Brazilian apart from the centre-back Júlio César to make the XI. Botafogo re-signed him, and the media adopted him. “UM HERÓI DESEMPREGADO” (THE UNEMPLOYED HERO) was the headline of a feature in Placar. He also won an informal award as the most beautiful player of the tournament. “I’m just like coffee,” he said. “The ‘blackie’ that satisfies everyone.” The fairytale soon became a cautionary tale. Josimar, like so many Brazilian footballers from poor backgrounds, was allergic to overnight fame. His life was tipped downside up and he surrendered to a hat-trick of vices: booze (especially whisky), cocaine and womanising. Soon after Mexico, he started to make different kinds of headlines. He ended up in prison after hitting a prostitute who racially abused him when he tried to negotiate a cheaper price for an orgy that had already happened. A few years later, he threw his wallet out of the window when being chased by police; it was later found with three grams of coke in it. His brother, a cocaine addict, was also shot dead in a favela. Josimar was one of the first bad boys of Brazilian football, a status that rankled. “Maradona and Edmundo were given second chances,” he said in a 1995 interview. “Why not me? Nobody ever proved anything against me. I only liked a bit of whisky.” Many sportsmen never recover from their lowest point; Josimar never really got over the high of Mexico and his career drifted to nothing. In 1988 he almost went to Dundee United (the mind boggles at the thought of the relationship between Josimar and Jim McLean) and he was offered to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United (the mind boggles, etc) before having a shambolic spell at Sevilla. He did play a significant part in Botafogo’s legendary Campeonato Carioca victory in 1989, and was a bit-part player in Brazil’s victorious Copa América squad a month later. He won the last of his 16 caps in November 1989. Those two goals in Mexico were the only ones he scored for Brazil. Josimar eventually found his way back on the rails with the help of the great right-back Jorginho. He embraced Christianity and now lives in the north of Brazil. He is still bitter about all the racism, the fake friends and his treatment in the press. His recent interviews suggest the internal tug-of-war between denial and regret is unresolved. He is more fondly remembered abroad than in Brazil, where he is a curiosity in the national team’s lavish history. The rest of the world only really saw Josimar at Mexico 86 and then in the greatest theatre of all, the imagination. We assumed he was roofing 30-yarders every week. If the World Cup is our dream holiday, once every four years, then Josimar was a helluva of a holiday romance. Globalisation, the internet and Football Manager have long since stripped football of its mystery. Josimar is a joyful lament for the past. His name – and what a name, by the way – evokes the innocence of ignorance, before the internet bred know-it-alls in more ways than one. There was a mythical quality to Josimar’s goals. You would see them once in a blue moon – on a grainy home-made VHS that you had lovingly labelled ‘DON’T TAPE OVER’, perhaps, or if Grandstand had a feature on great long-range goals. YouTube has changed our memories of our memories, and probably softened some of the Proustian magic of his goals. But his association is as powerful as ever. Norway’s best football magazine is called Josimar; there’s even a Scottish graphic designer who named his business after his Brazilian muse. Along with Salvatore Schillaci at Italia 90, Josimar is surely football’s greatest one-tournament wonder. He is also often included in the list of lost talents. If anything he was the opposite, a good but not great player whose brief career peak was perfectly in sync with the apex of football’s four-year cycle. Brazil has millions of talented unknowns, sure – but few left a mark on the football world like Josimar.

This is the age of expected goals and big chances, of statisticians sitting behind laptops and pundits sitting in front of touch screens looking for definite reasons to explain why results happen. The discourse has changed and can be illuminating. Equally, it can be needlessly complicated and corrosive. Because, at its heart, football is just how Bill Shankly described it: “terribly simple”. Yes, there are laws and regulations but none so overbearing as to wreck the flow of a game should those involved be in the mood to put on a show. It is easy to follow and, crucially, open to being affected not only by talent but emotion. Which brings us on to what occurred at Anfield on Wednesday evening. In case you missed it, Manchester City were hammered. The best team in the country, champions-elect no less, reduced to wrecks by rampant hosts, and if one image summed up the torment it was that of Pep Guardiola striding to the edge of his technical area midway through the first half and gesturing to his side to stay calm. Liverpool were 2-0 up; soon afterwards they scored again and there was nothing City’s manager or players could do about it. How did this happen? Most will point to Liverpool excellent display as the principal cause. Quite right, too. But something else was also at play, an inexplicable, intangible force. How do I know? Because I helped create it. Much was made about Anfield’s atmosphere in the buildup to this Champions League quarter-final. Almost as soon as the draw was made, Liverpool supporters took to Twitter to proclaim how the noise and colour of a European night at the home of European royalty would prove too much for their visitors from across the M62. In turn, City supporters rolled their collective online eyes and dismissed Anfield’s legendary atmosphere as a myth. One even suggested, with dripping sarcasm, that those “flags will really intimidate David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne”. I’m not going to lie, that particular tweet riled me, mainly because I know some of the people who fly those flags and have seen first-hand what they can help generate under Anfield’s lights. The standout occasion remains that 2005 Champions League semi-final second leg against Chelsea. Anfield hadn’t rocked so hard since David Fairclough scored against Saint-Étienne in 1977 and you could see Chelsea’s players – who, it should be remembered, had been crowned champions a few days earlier – struggling with the intensity of it all. John Terry was reduced to tears and later described the atmosphere that evening as the best he has played in. After Chelsea came victories against teams such as Internazionale, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund, and while it would be foolish to suggest it was purely, or even largely, the Anfield atmosphere that got Liverpool over the line, neither should the role of the home crowd be dismissed out of hand. Anfield’s European din may be overly hyped but the fact it is so often talked about, by neutrals as well as Liverpool fans, means it must be rooted in something felt and feared. It was certainly felt on Wednesday, no more so than in Block 305 of the Kop. Frenzied on the most mundane of occasions, it turned practically feral up there. I got to my seat just before 7pm and the singing had started. As kick-off got closer it got louder and more furious, and by the time the fella who stands to my left turned up wild with adrenaline I knew it was going to be one hell of a night. Mohamed Salah’s opening goal was the cue for bedlam. Bodies flew this way and that, hugs were given as well as received, and the noise became deafening. City kept probing but they were clearly rocked. At the opposite end of the ground, meanwhile, the away fans appeared shellshocked. We did warn you, lads. Given the senseless attack that took place on City’s team bus before kick-off, this was not a night for all Liverpool fans to feel proud, and each and everyone of us should be aware that despite having a 3-0 lead to take to the Etihad Stadium next week, this tie is not over. For now, however, Liverpool supporters should, in the main, feel chuffed with their team and themselves. This was a collective triumph – one spurred on by the other. Anfield at its best. And to any non-Reds reading this with increasing cynicism, allow me to ask this: why not take at least a modicum of pleasure from the possibility that a group of supporters can make a difference to their team’s display? Surely that is something to cherish in a climate where figures, financial as well as statistical, increasingly rule supreme. I don’t know about you but I didn’t get into football to know about agents’ fees and xG trends. I did so because, at the age of eight, the sport took a grip of me in a way I could hardly explain. There was a intangible magic I wanted more of and it’s that which keeps pulling me back in. What a night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/06/welcome-to-the-new-tax-year-heres-the-main-changes","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-06T06:00:24Z","webTitle":"Welcome to the new tax year - here's the main changes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/06/welcome-to-the-new-tax-year-heres-the-main-changes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/06/welcome-to-the-new-tax-year-heres-the-main-changes","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to the new tax year - here's the main changes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The new tax year begins on Friday with a bigger than usual set of changes to income taxes, personal allowances, pensions, buy-to-let taxation and dividend taxation. Here’s what to expect. Personal allowance The amount you can earn without paying income tax rises from £11,500 to £11,850, which works out as a tax cut of £70 for most people. Income tax The starting point for paying 20% basic rate tax will be £11,850, while 40% tax will start on earnings above £46,350 (up from £45,000). Scotland It’s different in Scotland. The £11,850 personal allowance is the same, but the first £2,000 of earnings after that are taxed at 19% rather than 20%. After that, it’s 20% tax until your earnings hit £24,000, when it rises to 21%. Then above £43,430 the rate is 41%. Both have an upper rate above £150,000; in England it’s 45%, in Scotland 46%. National insurance Will be charged at 12% of income on earnings above £8,424, up from £8,164 until you are earning more than £46,350, after which the rate drops to 2%. It’s the same in Scotland. Auto-enrolment Pension contributions start racking up from this week. From Friday workers must pay a minimum of 3% of salary into a pension (up from 1%), while the employer contribution rises from 1% to 2%.

A Sun “exclusive” suggests the Spaniard could be moved on to make way for the Chelsea midfielder Willian this summer, with José Mourinho apparently to eager to sign his former charge after an attempt to do so last year came to naught. Contracted to Chelsea until 2020, Willian would cost United at least £30m; the same price Chelsea paid to Shakhtar Donetsk when they signed him five years ago. With Antonio Conte expected to leave Stamford Bridge sooner rather than later, Roman Abramovich’s “people” are busy sounding out potential replacements. Already being touted as a potential successor to Arsène Wenger at Arsenal, Monaco’s Portuguese boss Leonardo Jardim is now being linked with Chelsea, who would have to pay a £6.5m release clause to prise him from his current employers. “I have never stayed long in my previous roles because I have always pushed myself to go higher,” said Jardim last year. “This idea has not changed, I would only leave here for a club of greater dimensions. I have received offers but few clubs have the right profile; barely a dozen in Europe.” Fabinho is another man who could be headed for the Monaco door marked “Do One” and the 24-year-old midfielder is rumoured to be a target of both Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain. With FC Köln on the verge of being relegated from the Bundesliga, Monaco are also monitoring the German side’s winger Leonardo Bittencourt but could face stiff competition from Tottenham Hotspur in the scramble to secure his services. Southampton also look destined for the drop but should the goal-shy Saints secure their Premier League survival under Mark Hughes, they’ll celebrate by signing the Barcelona striker Paco Alcácer. Having failed to make much of an impression at the Camp Nou since signing from Valencia for £30m two years ago, the 24-year-old is ready to call it quits and move on to pastures new. Having just been shortlisted for the Championship Player of the Season award, it’s no surprise that Fulham midfielder Tom Cairney is a player in big demand. One of several who has excelled in Fulham’s push for promotion, the Scottish international is turning heads at both Leicester City and Newcastle United. Besiktas playmaker Oguzhan Ozyakup will be a free agent in June and is expected to move to Everton, who are having to fend off interest from West Ham as they talk turkey with the Turkish international’s agent. Elsewhere on Merseyside, Liverpool are mulling over a move for the Gent winger Moses Simon. The 22-year-old is also a target of Brighton and Newcastle. Having had reassurances from Mo Salah that the groin injury that forced him off the Anfield sward during Liverpool’s demolition of Manchester City on Wednesday night is nowt but a niggle, Jürgen Klopp will be equally pleased to hear speculation that Real Madrid have cooled their interest in Liverpool’s Egyptian maestro. Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski is apparently Los Blancos’ goal-getter of choice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
