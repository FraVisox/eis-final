A lone woman sits in an office looking aghast at an image on a computer screen. It’s a live link to the sun in closeup. We know this because the screen says “LIVE LINK”. It also says “TOP SECRET”, which seems hopeful given that the sun isn’t something you can just pop in a drawer so no one will see it. But no matter. Her desk is strewn with files also stamped with “Secret”; the soundtrack groans ominously. Behold the pre-apocalyptic cop thriller that is Hard Sun (Saturday, 9.35pm, BBC One), written by Luther creator Neil Cross, in which Earth is overheating and environmental catastrophe is unavoidable. Cross has said he was inspired to write the series by Five Years, the Ziggy Stardust-era David Bowie song that imagines a five-year countdown to the end of days. So far, the news that humanity is up shit creek without a sun hat has only spread as far as a small band of spooks, but even MI5 hasn’t bargained for two angry cops ready to blow their secret sky-high. Make way, then, for DCI Rule Breaker (Jim Sturgess) and his new partner, DI Troubled Past (Agyness Deyn). While Rule Breaker helps himself to the spoils of criminal activities, and breaks up a slow afternoon at the office by shagging his dead ex-partner’s wife, Troubled Past inevitably has her own secrets, mainly related to her house burning down; she currently lives in a hotel. The pair don’t trust each other, which is why Troubled Past has a secret attic room dedicated to her partner and where, surrounded by photos and Post-It notes, she burbles novel-esque observations into her smartphone for the benefit of those sleeping in the stalls (“At times, DCI Hicks seems anxious, scared even. He doesn’t seem to me like a man with nothing to hide”). That’s an attic above her hotel room, by the way. Presumably, prior to booking she did a search on TripAdvisor: “Top 10 hotels with hidden attic spaces unknown even to the cleaning staff and accessible through a ceiling tile.” But I digress. Despite the atomising buildings in the title sequence, this isn’t so much about the physical effects of a global meltdown as the human impact, though don’t be fooled into expecting a mordantly sweet drama reminiscent of Don McKellar’s Last Night. Instead, Cross serves up over-caffeinated histrionics and blood-soaked set-pieces: less than half an hour in and Deyn has stabbed an intruder in the face with a fork, been thrown across a patio by a gas explosion, slapped down Sturgess’s cackling colleagues and uncovered a hacktivist security breach after a man is chucked off a high-rise balcony and impaled on a tree. Hard Sun isn’t entirely bad; it just doesn’t try to be good. The premise is an intriguing one, but Cross is under the impression that any gasping implausibility can be papered over with mad expositionary dialogue or, that failsafe contextual device: sitting a character down to watch the news. There are some undeniably pulse-raising moments – a standoff between the cops and spooks in a residential street is deftly executed – but these are neutralised by myriad stupid ones, most of which feature characters drawn from Cop Shows for Dummies. It’s a tragedy that the end of the world is nigh, truly it is, but the sooner this lot are incinerated the better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/03/history-empire-pride-guilt-truth-oxford-nigel-biggar","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T18:20:34Z","webTitle":"The history of empire isn’t about pride – or guilt | James McDougall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/03/history-empire-pride-guilt-truth-oxford-nigel-biggar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/03/history-empire-pride-guilt-truth-oxford-nigel-biggar","fields":{"headline":"The history of empire isn’t about pride – or guilt","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is something ironic about an Oxford theologian being portrayed as persecuted for arguing that Britain should be proud of its imperial past, when 59% of the population agree with him. But it’s no laughing matter. Oxford’s Ethics and Empire project, announced last month by Prof Nigel Biggar, has drawn widespread concern from historians of all stripes. And, as expected, it attracted some fierce criticism from academics. An open letter from 58 Oxford scholars of empire registered disagreement with the project’s aims and preconceptions. I was its principal author. Co-signatories included world-renowned professors and younger researchers doing cutting-edge work in the field. Predictably, the subsequent media furore ignored the issues at stake. We were attacked for denying freedom of expression to views we oppose – when in fact we expressly affirmed it – or for holding “unbalanced”, prejudiced views of the history we have spent our professional lives studying. It’s unsurprising that once again, “experts” who argue from evidence against the national-populist mood should be vilified in the rightwing press. It’s also dangerous, and not only for universities, to dismiss critical history in favour of a rehabilitation of imperialism as a morally justifiable enterprise, serving a sense of national pride. Equally unhelpful is the assertion that if we’re not proud of the empire, we must feel guilty about it. History is not about how people feel. For 40 years, scholars of empire have reassessed and reinterpreted what imperial rule, colonial settlement, conquest, administration, and decolonisation have meant in different periods across the world. Empires have been nearly ubiquitous in history, much older than nations. Colonial empires provided the matrix of the modern world in the 19th century, and their effects still influence the shape of the world and the division of privilege across it today. To evaluate so complex a process by moral measurement – how much suffering was offset by how much “progress”? – is, for most historians, irrelevant as well as inadequate. Equally inadequate and irrelevant is the preoccupation – almost an obsession for the Brexit-Britain right – with the role of empire in an integrating “island story” of plucky white British patriots and globalisers. Even at the height of the Victorian empire, some figures who are now held up by empire nostalgics as inviolable national icons, most notably Cecil Rhodes, were criticised by their compatriots as acting more in their own than in the national interest. When Rhodes, already censured by a parliamentary select committee, was proposed for an honorary degree at Oxford in 1899, there was vocal protest from 92 academics (none of whom were Corbynistas.) Britain, like France, the United States, the Netherlands, Japan, Russia, Germany and Italy, does need a public debate about the realities and legacies of its imperial past. We need a fuller public understanding of what Britain’s empire was, and how its aftereffects have influenced Britain’s multi-ethnic, multi-confessional society, its inequalities and injustices as well as its commonalities and opportunities. That debate should be equitable, rational and based on all the available evidence. It should not be about apportioning blame, instilling guilt or recovering pride. We also need to see that history as part of a larger, longer, global history of empire, not as something peculiar to us. It’s important in understanding our collective present that we know what forces shaped it. But historical understanding is about recapturing the sense of things done by, and done to, other people at other times. It’s not about us, and how we feel about it is entirely irrelevant. • James McDougall is associate professor, fellow and tutor in modern history at Trinity College, Oxford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/03/major-security-flaw-found-intel-processors-computers-windows-mac-os-linux","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T14:24:58Z","webTitle":"Major security flaw found in Intel processors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/03/major-security-flaw-found-intel-processors-computers-windows-mac-os-linux","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/03/major-security-flaw-found-intel-processors-computers-windows-mac-os-linux","fields":{"headline":"Major security flaw found in Intel processors","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A security flaw has been found in virtually all Intel processors that will require fixes within Windows, macOS and Linux, according to reports. Developers are currently scrambling behind the scenes to fix the significant security hole within the Intel chips, with patches already available within some versions of Linux and some testing versions of Windows, although the fixes are expected to significantly slow down computers. The specific details of the flaw, which appears to affect virtually all Intel processors made in the last decade and therefore millions of computers running virtually any operating system, have not been made public. But details of the fixes being developed point to issues involving the accessing of secure parts of a computer’s memory by regular programs. It is feared that the security flaw within the Intel processors could be used to access passwords, login details and other protected information on the computer. “Modern operating systems rely upon Intel’s chips to provide some essential security services – but if a flaw has been found then the operating systems themselves will need to be updated to do the job that they believed Intel’s chips were doing properly,” said independent security expert Graham Cluley. The fixes involve moving the memory used by the core of the computer’s operating system, known as the kernel, away from that used by normal programs. In that way, normal programs, including anything from javascript from a website to computer games, cannot be manipulated to exploit the hole and gain access to the protected kernel memory. But implementing the fix is expected to significantly affect the performance of the computer, making some actions up to around 30% slower. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it was aware of the issue and that patches were being produced. While normal computer users could see performance problems, the security flaw also affects cloud servers, with Amazon, Microsoft and Google all expected to have to fix the bug with similar performance-reducing patches. The exact severity of the flaw has not yet been publicly disclosed, but the lengths being taken by the various operating system developers to fix something indicates that they view it as a serious problem that apparently cannot be patched with a small update. “The good news is that it sounds as if this flaw has been known about (but kept quiet) for a couple of months. The bad news is that users will once again have to install a security update, and businesses are likely to have to restart thousands of computers to apply the fixes,” said Cluley. More details are expected to be divulged as soon as the end of this week, along with fixes for operating systems. Intel did not respond to request for comment.

It sucks the political oxygen away from the issues we should all be discussing: like low wages, insecure jobs and the housing crisis. It is a rallying cry for a noxious alliance of anti-immigrant demagogues and regulation-stripping free marketeers. The bigotry, xenophobia and racism stirred up by the official leave campaigns injected an ugliness into British politics which never dissipated, and left hate crimes surging. And, frankly, Brexit is just mind-numbingly, painfully, excruciatingly dull. So yes, if there was a big red button to make it all just go away, I’d enthusiastically push it. Yes, as a socialist, I had profound reservations about the current incarnation of the EU, and even considered the case for leave. I dismissed the argument because of persuasive pleas from European leftists to stand together to reform and change the EU, and because it was clear that a hellish anti-immigration crusade beckoned. And so, alongside the Another Europe Is Possible alliance, I passionately campaigned against the Brexit juggernaut. Then the vote happened, and we lost. There seemed to be two conclusions that fateful night. One, challenge the bigotry, authoritarianism and intolerance of the Tory Brexiteers. And two, try to reconcile a bad result with the country’s future. Which brings me to the “stop Brexit” campaign. Many decent and honest people are committed to reversing the referendum result. They fear a completely unnecessary national tragedy is befalling Britain, driven by myths and lies, and believe economic turmoil and national isolation await. It is perfectly legitimate to seek to democratically challenge a referendum result. But it is difficult to see how the current strategy, communication and leadership of this cause achieve anything other than doom it to failure. First off, I’m not convinced by the campaign’s aim, and here’s why. Some stop Brexiters recite, almost as a mantra, that the referendum was only advisory (despite the government sending a pamphlet to every household in Britain promising them that the government “will implement what you decide”). If the referendum result was simply cancelled, it would be regarded as a coup against democracy not just by leave voters, but by many remainers. Faith in democracy may never be rebuilt – “more people voted for Brexit than for anything else in British history and the establishment thwarted it”, the refrain would go. It would surely be the greatest shot in the arm for the radical right in British history – not least because the result was in part due to a sense of resentment against a contemptuous political elite. Alternatively, a second referendum could easily be framed as the establishment holding votes until it got the right result. It would mean an even more bitter campaign than the last, leaving deeper national divisions than ever. Either the last result would be reconfirmed, with rightwing Brexiteers more triumphalist and intolerant than ever; or – if remain scraped a narrow victory – furious Brexiteer demands for yet another referendum would be impossible to resist. Would it be best of three? Furthermore, a focus on overturning the referendum surely risks abandoning the debate over what sort of Brexit deal Britain negotiates to the Tory extremists. Then there’s simple political maths. If Labour committed to overturning Brexit, the party would haemorrhage many of the 3 million or so of its voters who backed leave, losing seats as a consequence. Perhaps it would win a sliver of the 7% of Britons currently supporting the main stop Brexit party, the Liberal Democrats: though even that paltry gain would be in urban remain seats already held by Labour. Indeed, if preventing Brexit is such an inherently appealing prospect, why the derisory level of support for Vince Cable’s party? The consequence would surely be a decisive Conservative electoral victory, enabling the party to implement the most true blue of Tory Brexit deals, and continue everything from austerity to the failure to build affordable homes. I’m genuinely open to having these arguments rebutted by stop Brexiters: actually, I’d like to be persuaded. But their campaign seems unable to learn from the failures of the official remain movement in the referendum, which was seen by many as an establishment push for the status quo in an era when millions feel angry and disillusioned. Its prominent spokespeople – Tony Blair, Nick Clegg and unelected peers – simply cement the negative images of what was, after all, a failed campaign, however unfair that might seem to the most devout supporters. A successful movement would have to win over a significant chunk of leave voters, and remainers resigned to the vote. But leavers are often dismissed en masse as racist and ignorant – which, again, does little but confirm their views. Even remainers who believe the vote has to be accepted – and polling suggests there are millions – are beyond the pale to the most committed stop Brexiters. To have any chance of success, they need a completely different strategy. First, the messenger matters, not just the message. For many leave voters, a thwarted Brexit would be an establishment coup against the democratic will of the people. Having discredited and deeply unpopular politicians, or unelected peers, pushing for this surely reinforces these views. Second, if stop Brexit presents itself as a defence of the status quo – at a time of popular ferment – it will fail: it should combine its signature policy with radical demands. Third, it should launch itself as a grassroots, populist insurgency: rather than hosting EU flag-waving marches in remain citadels, it should hold mass public meetings and leafleting campaigns in leave areas, focusing on a positive case directed at those who are not enamoured with the EU (which is most people, including many remain voters). Its aim should be to shift public opinion so dramatically that calls for a new referendum become unanswerable. Instead, it seems that too many stop Brexiters are making the same mistakes some leftists have traditionally made: looking for traitors, not converts; defined by what they are against, not what they are for; purist; cult-like; treating the wider public as politically backward; angrily dogmatic; yelling at people on Twitter. No, I’m not convinced by their case as things stand, and can’t see clear answers to the questions I pose. A Labour-managed Brexit that doesn’t shred our links with the EU and turn Britain into a low-regulation tax haven still seems preferable. But the case to stop Brexit does deserve to be made, and deserves to be made well. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/03/the-spin-steve-smith-don-bradman-betteridges-law","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T12:43:13Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith, Betteridge’s Law and the mythology of Don Bradman | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/03/the-spin-steve-smith-don-bradman-betteridges-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/03/the-spin-steve-smith-don-bradman-betteridges-law","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith, Betteridge’s Law and the mythology of Don Bradman","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Statistical brilliance and context It’s an old Fleet Street adage that any headline ending with a question mark is best answered with a ‘no’. It’s called Betteridge’s Law, after the journalist who made it famous, though it’s old enough now that no one’s sure who coined it. It’s not an absolute rule but a handy little tool, and one you may need the more you read about Steve Smith. Smith’s form in the first four Ashes Tests, with two hundreds, a double, and another fifty, has pushed him up to second in the ICC’s all-time batting rankings, beyond Brian Lara and Denis Compton, past Garry Sobers and Viv Richards, ahead of Jack Hobbs and Len Hutton. The only man in front of him now is Don Bradman. The rankings are designed to measure the height of player’s peak rather than how long he sustained it. The algorithm says Bradman reached his at the end of India’s tour of Australia in 1948, when he made 185, 13, 132, 127*, 201, and 57* in successive innings. That pushed his rating up to 961. No one else in history has ever made it above 950. But Smith has just reached 947. And the comparison has become irresistible. Steve Smith, The New Don Bradman? asked Sport24; is Steve Smith the best since Donald Bradman, wondered the BBC; and ABC ran with: Is Watching Steve Smith Like Watching Don Bradman in his Prime? Smith has been brilliant for four years now, apparently since he made a spontaneous decision to add a back-and-across trigger movement to his batting during the Ashes back in 2013. His average since is 75, in 46 Tests, and he’s been top of the rankings the past two years. English fans can be forgiven for thinking the trigger story is just a ruse Australians put around to disguise the deal Smith did with the devil, just like the one Robert Johnson did down at the crossroads by the Dockery plantation one night in the 1920s. A Faustian pact to make him the best in the world. Because, like so much of the Ashes in winter, all of this still feels like a fever dream, something you imagined while you were half asleep on the sofa with the radio on. It’s Marley’s ghost. The work of an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of underdone potato. Steve Smith, sometime leg-spinner, old overseas pro at Sevenoaks Vine, a man with a home-schooled batting technique who made his Test debut playing at No8 in one innings and No9 in the other, has grown up to become the best batsman of his time, the next best, they say, to Bradman. Take a look at the scorecard of Smith’s first Test, at Lord’s in 2010 during that odd little series against Pakistan at the beginning of their exile. There were three great batsmen in that Australian team. Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Mike Hussey. Now Smith has become better than any of them. You could hear the scepticism among the old English pros just a couple of years ago. “I didn’t think he was a great player and I still don’t think he’s got a great technique,” said Graeme Swann in 2015. Back then Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson both spoke about how vulnerable Smith would be batting at No3. Now Ponting himself says that Smith could yet become the “best batsman in history”. He told ABC radio that Smith is “well and truly on track to do that”. Which is where Betteridge’s Law comes in. As good as Smith gets, he can never be better than Bradman. Because Bradman is barely human. Seventy years after his last Test, 17 years after his death, he has become a mythological figure. The idea that he was a player like any other in that he had his own flaws and failings is more remote than ever. Arguments across eras are catnip for cricket fans. And you can go round and round saying that Bradman, unlike Smith, only had to play in two sets of conditions, English and Australian, and against four teams, England, West Indies, South Africa and India. And that Smith, unlike Bradman, has the advantage of playing on covered pitches, with modern kit and strength and conditioning techniques. But beyond those insoluble back-and-forths, there’s a bigger truth. Bradman’s standing is, always will be, unsurpassed. Not because of his statistical brilliance, but because of the context of his career. Bradman played in an era when Test cricket had cultural primacy that it has long since lost. As Thomas Keneally wrote about his Sydney schooldays, if “the only history we were taught was European. Poetry cut out after Tennyson. If we spoke of literary figures, we spoke of Englishmen. Cricket was the great way out of Australian cultural ignominy for, while no Australian had written Paradise Lost, we knew Don Bradman had made 100 before lunch at Lord’s.” Keneally’s quote is part of the lore, the Bradmania, along with all the other songs and stories. When the former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser visited Nelson Mandela at Pollsmoor Prison in 1986, the first thing Mandela asked him was “can you tell me, is Donald Bradman still alive?” When Mandela visited Australia in 2000 he explained “in the 30s and 40s, at least in our country, we regarded Sir Donald as one of the divinities, so great was he and such an impact he made”. Bradman, like Babe Ruth, George Best, Muhammad Ali, was bigger than his game. You may as well measure Smith against Nelson’s column. • This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

Prince William and Kate Middleton had Ellie Goulding perform at theirs (giving her first album a huge boost, and Ellie something to talk about in interviews other than jogging), so there’s a lot to live up to. Inevitably, Ed Sheeran has already volunteered, but surely that would be too obvious? Meghan Markle might look like your cousin’s nice girlfriend who says she’s into “alternative stuff you probably don’t know” then names Maroon 5’s Songs About Jane album as an example, but she actually has good taste. A playlist on her now-defunct lifestyle blog The Tig last year featured Janelle Monáe, Dragonette and Crystal Fighters and she introduced it by writing: “When the air is filled with positive vibes, there’s no winter cold that can block out the warmth of happy hearts.” Something she might want to remember for the future. Of course, it’s not all blog-friendly pop: last month, Sophie Ellis-Bextor claimed she’d met Markle several times and she “loved” her 2001 ode to club-based crime, Murder on the Dancefloor. Harry’s musical proclivities are slightly more eclectic. In 2010, producer Artwork claimed that Hazza was a huge dubstep fan. “He was well excited when he was introduced to Skream; he put his hand out and said: ‘Hello Skream, nice one!’,” said Artwork. Which is unexpected. But when actor Dominic West joined Harry on a charity walk, he reckoned he was more into Power Trip: “Harry has a terrible selection on his iPod: hardcore thrash metal.” Could Municipal Waste finally get that royal wedding invite they’ve so clearly been angling for all this time? To be fair, Harry is posh, white and in his early 30s, so is genetically predisposed to being the type to put his tie round his head and fist pump to the Killers’ Mr Brightside; plus he went on that very well-publicised trip to Vegas, so definitely has Pitbull on his “big tunes 4 the lads” Spotify playlist. But let’s get real: it’s going to be Adele, isn’t it? She mirrors that perfect mix of internationally famous and down-to-earth the royals are getting with Meghan. Plus, her back catalogue won’t scare the Queen and, because she’s mates with Beyoncé, she’s used to mixing with royalty.

A healthy baby, no sooner had she arrived than her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, sent a message to her husband, the radical writer William Godwin, at work in rooms nearby, to come and meet his new child. Wollstonecraft, the author of The Vindication of the Rights of Woman, did not hold with long confinements; the introductions having been made, she intended to rest only for a few more hours. The following evening, she planned to join him for dinner as usual. Back at home, however, Godwin found himself waiting and waiting downstairs. All was not well, after all: the afterbirth had not come away and, shortly before two in the morning, the midwife, Mrs Blenkinsop, asked him to get help. An hour later, he returned with the man who would ultimately kill his wife, Louis Poignand, a licentiate in midwifery at the Royal College of Surgeons. Poignand removed the afterbirth bit by bit with his unsterile hands, thus giving his patient the infection from which she would die 11 days later. It was a horrible end: so much vomit and shit and blood, though the animal detail that most lingers in my mind is the fact that, the baby having been sent away to safety, puppies were brought in to drain off Wollstonecraft’s milk. Is it possible to trace the “weird nativity” of Shelley’s celebrated novel Frankenstein, which she would begin writing only 18 years later, all the way back to this horror show? The poet Fiona Sampson believes that it is, seeing in her description of the creature’s birth – guttering candles, rain pattering at a window, a lifeless thing lying at a man’s feet – details that better suit a deathbed scene. But even if you think this a stretch (so many influences were upon Mary as she set about magicking, at the behest of Byron, what was supposed to be “a ghost story”, not least the fact that she was by then a mother herself), there is no doubting the impact of Wollstonecraft’s death on her life. It runs like a thread through everything she does, and everything she is, and while Sampson’s sense of this may sometimes be a touch 20th century – her recourse to what “the psychologists” have to say can be wearing – it is also the chief virtue of her daringly swift and enjoyably irreverent retelling of Shelley’s life. At the heart of her biography lies a paradox, which is that its engine is powered by absence and loss. Even when the action is at its most frantic, Sampson never loses sight of the gaping void below. After Wollstonecraft’s death, the grieving Godwin unwittingly destroys her reputation with his (rather too honest) memoir of her unconventional life, after which, in 1801, he marries his neighbour, that mistress of reinvention, Mary Jane Clairmont. His family now swells to include not only his new wife, Mary, and her half-sister, Fanny Imlay, (Wollstonecraft’s daughter by her lover, Gilbert Imlay), but Clairmont’s illegitimate children, Charles and Claire, too; soon, moreover, there will be another baby, William. Mary and Claire, born a few months apart, are best friends. Mary and her new stepmother, however, are soon at odds. She will come, somewhat unfairly, to loathe her, seeing her as meddler and a barrier to her father. It is a busy household and a precarious one (Godwin is forever in debt). No wonder, then, that at 16 the clever and precocious Mary is susceptible to the escape route that is love. She falls too quickly for Percy Shelley, a new associate of her father, her heart dashing towards him, her ears hearing only what they want to, and they elope, crossing the Channel by night, so eager are they to get away. But what’s this? Mary’s stepsister is, it seems, also in tow. Is she a chaperone? A confidante? Or is she just another pawn in Shelley’s game of Free Love? Mary Jane dashes to France hoping to save her reputation – she knows her daughter will be collateral damage once the elopement is made public – but it is no good. Claire decides to stick with Mary and Percy, like glue. Sampson is hard on Claire, soon to be the lover of Byron, by whom she will have a daughter; I prefer Daisy Hay’s more sympathetic depiction in her 2010 book Young Romantics. It seems pitiless to describe her repeatedly as a “man’s woman”, given the way the world worked then. But perhaps there’s no time, here, for spare understanding. So much is happening. The trio cross Europe, only to have to return, broke, to England. Mary has a baby girl, who dies, and then a son, William (he will soon die, too, as will her daughter, Clara; only her fourth child, Percy, lives into adulthood). Fanny Imlay (more collateral damage) kills herself, as does Shelley’s wife, Harriet. Throughout it all, Mary is stoic, sealed off, her emotions seemingly cauterised. Her hopes lie with Shelley and Shelley alone, and her focus is on him, by which I mean, mostly, on his philandering, which she affects not to notice. Does she even care that when he marries her, it’s only a means to help him get custody of his children by Harriet? It is against this backdrop that Frankenstein, begun in Byron’s villa on Lake Geneva, is completed, a book born, perhaps, of unconscious displacement. But while Sampson’s life is published to mark the novel’s 200th anniversary, she has relatively little to say about it now (what I like most about her book is her willingness to play about with time, a corollary of her reluctance ever to detour from exciting events). Mary walks away from her literary fame once her tale is out in the world, returning with Percy and Claire to Italy, and so does Sampson, temporarily. Her subject’s fatal attraction, after all, is not for reviews or the admiration of her peers. It’s for charisma and her husband still has plenty of this, his self-absorption and infidelity apart. And so the whirl continues. When Percy drowns in 1822, his boat lost in a storm off the Ligurian coast, it comes almost as a relief: at last, you think, Mary will return to herself. But, no. Her grief is “hyperbolic”, for now he can be the man she always dreamed of: unimpeachable beyond the grave, his heart, recovered from the pyre on which his body was burned, kept in a silk purse about her desk. Her widowhood, rightly foreshortened on the page by Sampson, will be long and strange, inhabited until her death in 1851 by ghouls, rip-off merchants, a hateful father-in-law and an unimpressive son. What did she feel when she saw Richard Brinsley Peake’s production of Frankenstein on the stage in London in 1823? Sampson thinks she sounds girlish when she tells Leigh Hunt: “I found myself famous!” To me, though, she seems as cool as ever: a woman merely going through the motions. Her life was far more wretched than that of the monster she created and, for this reason, she was always able to keep it in perspective, dull yellow eyes and all. • In Search of Mary Shelley: The Girl Who Wrote Frankenstein by Fiona Sampson is published by Profile (£18.99).

The supporter involved in the altercation has been identified by West Ham and faces a ban if found to have made the alleged comments. The incident happened just after Livermore was substituted during West Brom’s 2-1 defeat at the London Stadium and it is understood that the Midlands club say they have witnesses to corroborate the midfielder’s account. West Brom issued a statement on Wednesday in which they said Livermore had moved to confront a fan after hearing a comment about the death of his son. They offered their backing to the player. “The club would like to think that all right-minded football supporters could understand this reaction which did not result in any physical exchanges before Jake was led away to our dressing room,” the statement said. “Jake is an outstanding young individual who has the total support of everyone at the club and he has made it clear he considers this statement to be an end to an unhappy incident. “Albion were very appreciative of the swift response by the officials of West Ham in dealing with this matter and are more than happy to leave any further action they deem appropriate in their hands.” Livermore spoke to members of West Ham’s football operations team before leaving the stadium and the London club want to maintain an open dialogue with the England international. His evidence will help them decide what action to take. The Football Association has been in touch with the clubs and with Livermore and all parties have until 6pm on Thursday to respond. It is understood that the governing body could take a sympathetic view towards Livermore if it concludes there were mitigating circumstances. West Ham said in a statement that Livermore had decided not to take the matter to the police but that their own investigations would continue. “West Ham United can confirm that the individual involved in an altercation with Jake Livermore during last night’s match against West Bromwich Albion was immediately identified and removed from London Stadium,” the club said. “After the game concluded, West Ham United officials liaised with West Bromwich Albion, Jake Livermore himself and the Metropolitan Police to commence a full investigation into the incident. “The player has today confirmed he does not wish to make this a police matter. However, given the nature of the allegations, the club will continue to investigate before taking the appropriate action.” Livermore ended up being escorted down the tunnel by John Carver, Albion’s assistant manager, after stewards had intervened. Alan Pardew, Albion’s manager, was not aware at the time why Livermore reacted in the way that he did but suggested that the player must have been “provoked severely”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/03/alcohol-can-cause-irreversible-genetic-damage-to-stem-cells-says-study","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"Alcohol can cause irreversible genetic damage to stem cells, says study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/03/alcohol-can-cause-irreversible-genetic-damage-to-stem-cells-says-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/03/alcohol-can-cause-irreversible-genetic-damage-to-stem-cells-says-study","fields":{"headline":"Alcohol can cause irreversible genetic damage to stem cells, says study","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Alcohol can cause irreversible genetic damage to the body’s reserve of stem cells, according to a study that helps explain the link between drinking and cancer. The research, using genetically modified mice, provides the most compelling evidence to date that alcohol causes cancer by scrambling the DNA in cells, eventually leading to deadly mutations. During the past decade, there has been mounting evidence of the link between drinking and the risk of certain cancers. “How exactly alcohol causes damage to us is controversial,” said Prof Ketan Patel, who led the work at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. “This paper provides very strong evidence that an alcohol metabolite causes DNA damage [including] to the all-important stem cells that go on to make tissues.” The study builds on previous work that had pinpointed a breakdown product of alcohol, called acetaldehyde, as a toxin that can damage the DNA within cells. However, these earlier studies had relied on extremely high concentrations of acetaldehyde and used cells in a dish rather than tracking its effects within the body. The latest work showed that acetaldehyde slices through DNA, causing permanent damage, if the effects of the toxin are not neutralised by two natural defence mechanisms. The first tier of defence clears away the acetaldehyde and the second repairs the DNA damage. By genetically “knocking out” these two layers of defence, scientists were able to show DNA damage accumulating until cells eventually stopped working entirely. The study revealed that DNA damage was exacerbated when mice lacked the first tier of defence – a protective enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), which prevents potentially toxic build-ups of acetaldehyde. About 8% of the world’s population, mostly those of East Asian ancestry, have an inherited deficiency in ALDH2 (sometimes known as the flushing mutation), which could explain the high prevalence of oesophageal cancers in countries such as China. The study, published in the journal Nature, focused on stem cells within the blood, which the body relies on to continually supply fresh blood throughout life. Blood cells were singled out because they can be multiplied readily, allowing the DNA to be sequenced more easily, but the scientists believe that the effects of alcohol could be similar in other cell types. In mice that lacked both natural defences against alcohol, their ability to produce fresh blood was completely destroyed after being given diluted alcohol for ten days, the study found. Sequencing the genome of the stem cells showed that their DNA had been scrambled to the point that the cells no longer functioned. “Our study highlights that not being able to process alcohol effectively can lead to an even higher risk of alcohol-related DNA damage and therefore certain cancers,” said Patel. “But it’s important to remember that alcohol clearance and DNA repair systems are not perfect and alcohol can still cause cancer in different ways, even in people whose defence mechanisms are intact.” The team now plan to investigate why drinking is linked to certain cancers but not others. Alcohol consumption causes around 4% of cancers in the UK, or around 12,800 cases each year. Just one pint of lager or a large glass of wine a day significantly increases the risk of mouth, throat, oesophageal, breast and bowel cancers. But there is no evidence that drinkers are at a substantially increased risk of blood cancers, say experts, despite the new findings showing that drinking can alter the DNA in blood stem cells. “Actually the blood system has a very stringent quality control mechanism to get rid of anything that is damaged,” said Patel, adding that this might explain why alcoholics tend to become severely anaemic. It is possible that the body’s defence mechanisms against acetaldehyde are weaker in other tissues. Prof Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, a stem cell biologist at the University of Cambridge, said the findings were very important: “This is beautiful work which puts our finger on the molecular basis for the link between alcohol and increased cancer risk and stem cells,” she said. Prof Linda Bauld, an expert on cancer prevention at Cancer Research UK, which partly funded the research, said: “This thought-provoking research highlights the damage alcohol can do to our cells, costing some people more than just a hangover. “We know that alcohol contributes to over 12,000 cancer cases in the UK each year, so it’s a good idea to think about cutting down on the amount you drink.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/gardens-abeliophyllum-distichum-hellebores-seed-packets","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T11:00:50Z","webTitle":"Gardens: what to do this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/gardens-abeliophyllum-distichum-hellebores-seed-packets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/gardens-abeliophyllum-distichum-hellebores-seed-packets","fields":{"headline":"Gardens: what to do this week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Plant this Find the bright yellow of forsythia flowers a bit too gaudy?

The £5,000 that came with the award meant the young author could afford tickets to the Amazon to research a new novel, The Explorer – a book that has just landed her the prestigious Costa children’s books prize, won in the past by giants of the genre from Roald Dahl to Philip Pullman. “I was not making a fortune from my fiction,” she explains. She was also doing a master’s and then a PhD at Oxford and some teaching. “I would love to say I was starving in a garret. All Souls College has several butlers. I was not suffering,” she says. “But I knew I wanted to write a book set in the Amazon. I’d wanted to go since I was tiny. I read Willard Price and this fabulous book called The Lost City of Z [by David Grann], and then this glorious book by Eva Ibbotson, Journey to the River Sea.” So she and her then boyfriend flew to Brazil and from Manaus “we took a little boat, and then a smaller boat, and then an even smaller boat which was only big enough for three people, down a tributary of the Amazon. It remains the most staggeringly beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life. It was just astonishing.” A guide took them into the jungle, showed them ways to survive – how to eat cocoa moth grubs, find pineapples, catch piranhas and tarantulas. “We spent quite a lot of time hiking through the rainforest itself, which was beautiful and fascinatingly discombobulating. It shakes you a little bit, to be so aware of being somewhere which is not your element. Our guide said: ‘Point west’, and usually I would be able to do that from the sun. And then he said, after about 10 minutes of walking, which was a bit more frightening, ‘Point to where the boat is.’ And I was in absolutely the wrong direction.” It was that sense of being utterly lost that gave Rundell the idea for The Explorer, in which four children find themselves alone in the Amazon after a plane crash. They eat grubs, rescue a baby sloth, climb trees, build a raft, and discover a lost city deep in the jungle. It has the feel of an instant classic – adventurous, engrossing and packed with fantastic characters, from the five-year-old who keeps wandering off into the trees and making his big sister panic, to the brilliantly eccentric explorer they stumble across. The Costa judges called it “a glorious read and a timeless voyage of wonder” when they announced its victory earlier this week. The author, who is now 30, sat down to write her debut novel the day after she turned 21, when she woke up with a hangover. It became The Girl Savage, the story of a girl growing up half-wild on an African farm, who is sent to boarding school in England. It draws on Rundell’s own wild, free childhood in Zimbabwe, and her devastation when her family moved to Belgium when she was 14. She started the novel as she began the seven-year prize fellowship at Oxford’s All Souls College. This is awarded after what has been called the world’s hardest exam, involving 15 hours of papers and a viva. The final test, in which students are given a page with one word at the top and told to write about it for the next three hours, is probably what clinched the fellowship for Rundell. She got “novelty”. “There I was writing about Jacques Derrida, and Christmas crackers, and I had also looked up the word ‘novel’ in the OED the night before and I remembered the first use of it, and I think it would have given the impression that I knew the first use of all words,” she says. “Getting into All Souls is such a wild long shot that it was like a game. It was really fun.” So she spent her early 20s in a heady mix of academia and children’s fiction. The Girl Savage was acquired by Faber while she was still 21, “in a sort of whirlwind”. Rooftoppers, which won the Blue Peter book award as well as the Waterstones, followed The Girl Savage and drew on the Shakespeare paper she was teaching undergraduates. It opens with a baby floating in a cello case in the middle of the Channel, and Rundell describes it as “a play on Twelfth Night to an extent, in that her mother disguises herself as a boy to go on a ship, and then washes up on a foreign shore”. It also drew on her own, rather unusual hobby of roof walking. A climber since childhood – “I’ve always loved up high” – Rundell heard about the tradition of rooftop climbing when she arrived at Oxford as an undergraduate. Climbing the roofs at All Souls, she found an old bottle, and it sparked the idea for a story about children living on the roofs of Paris. The Wolf Wilder, about a girl and her mother who teach tamed wolves how to be wild in the forests of Russia, followed, written while she completed a master’s that focused on palaeography, forgery and John Donne. Her PhD was on “Renaissance literature more broadly, how Donne interacted with it, how people who came after Donne forged and imitated and alluded to and were inspired by his work”. Combining fiction and academia meant she would often wake at five, work on her novel until nine, take a shower, then focus on academic work until around six in the evening, and then work on the novel until midnight. “You know when your eye starts twitching because you haven’t slept enough? I had that for about a year.” But she was young, and she loved the teaching, despite only narrowly topping her students in years. “I think probably when you’re 19 someone who’s 24 looks quite old.” Writing children’s books was initially a choice Rundell made because she felt it could be a training ground for her as an author. “I didn’t feel that I had been an adult for long enough to write something as good as I wanted it to be,” she says. “My great hero growing up was Jane Austen and I wanted to write something both big and compact in the way she does, and I was aware that that was so beyond my capabilities that I thought children’s fiction would be a place where I could learn how to write. And now if anyone said that to me I would be livid, the idea that children’s fiction is a place where you learn and move on, I think that is entirely mistaken. But that was how I started.” In the manner of the very best children’s authors – and Rundell’s books do feel like novels that will be read for years to come – she also has that pitch-perfect recall of childhood. Perhaps, she ponders, because growing up in Zimbabwe, “it was so sunlit”. School finished at midday, and she and her friends would run barefoot through the afternoons, her mother “willing to let us take risks that I understand now as an adult would have taken a huge amount of toughness and courage on her part”, she says. “I have these memories of building a raft out of two logs and poling ourselves across this lake and teasing each other there were crocodiles. There’s a kind of raw and heady joy to being alone as a child with no adult supervision. I know that’s really hard to recreate if you live in certain cities but in Zim it’s not hard, you just go and run.” She also spent much of her time reading, particularly during her ninth and 10th years, when the foster sister her parents were caring for was dying. “I spent a huge amount of time escaping the world reading, and I think it is no coincidence that I write for the age that I was when that happened,” she muses. It was “deeply sad. Big and sad and difficult and new and profoundly painful … It was the saddest I had ever been. It’s young to discover death. What happens is you circle your wagons and draw the people you love closer and the things you love closer and for me that was books.” She remembers those days with “immense clarity … One of the things I hated most about being a child was being talked down to. I found people’s estimation of children, not just me but children in general, to be lacking, and so I wanted to write stories that would not suggest that children were not complex … The only time that kids fully understand the world they inhabit is when they read, the rest of the time the world is so large and so frayed at the edges,” she says. When she sat down to write The Girl Savage, she made a list of the things she had been “obsessed with” as a child, “like clockwork and new inventions and mud pies and water scorpions and fruit picking”. Her interests still colour her writing nine years on, from the tightrope walking and roof walking that inspired Rooftoppers, to her “obsession” with flight, which makes its way into The Explorer. She’s been learning to fly a plane from a “slightly dilapidated airfield” in Zimbabwe, and adores it, “the feeling of the air peeling away from you, the ground dip and yourself rise”. The prize fellowship at All Souls is over, but, missing the academic side of her life, Rundell now has another fellowship at the college. She has a room there, but lives in Borough, London, and is very definitely making a living from her children’s books – although she has a few other strings to her bow. A play she wrote for a friend who is a director, Life According to Saki, won the Best of Edinburgh award last year and has transferred to New York. She has had a novel for adults “quietly on the backburner for eight years”, and is also in the middle of a non-fiction title about Donne’s poetry and life for Faber. She’s loved Donne since childhood, and is determined to convince the rest of the world to feel the same way. “I have always loved poetry in the way you love swimming in the sea or running or eating,” she says, quoting a line from Margaret Edson’s play Wit, that Donne “makes Shakespeare sound like a Hallmark card”. With dreams of writing another play, that adult novel bubbling under and a picture book – her second – in the works, Rundell is also finding the time to take flying trapeze lessons. It’s all in aid of her new children’s novel, but she won’t say any more. “I have probably lost some of the things I had at 21 but gained others,” she says. “Roald Dahl always spoke about never forgetting what it was to be a child, it was so close to the surface of his skin, and my childhood feels very deeply imprinted on my blood.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/03/peru-alberto-fujimori-pardon-victims-state-terror-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T08:01:10Z","webTitle":"'Act of treason': Fujimori pardon reopens wounds for victims of Peru's state terror","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/03/peru-alberto-fujimori-pardon-victims-state-terror-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/03/peru-alberto-fujimori-pardon-victims-state-terror-protests","fields":{"headline":"'Act of treason': Fujimori pardon reopens wounds for victims of Peru's state terror","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the darkest days of Peru’s internal conflict, Melissa Alfaro hoped to transform her country through journalism. At 23, she got her first full-time job at the left-leaning weekly Cambio, but her dreams were cut short as the Peruvian state under the then president, Alberto Fujimori, fought terror with terror. Alfaro was returning to the magazine’s office after a morning covering congress on Thursday 10 October 1991 when she stopped off to pick up the mail from the porter. Moments later her colleagues heard an explosion. “They found her dead. She had opened a letter bomb which had blown up in her face. It destroyed her,” recalls her mother Norma Méndez, 71, weeping at the memory. An investigation found that the explosive gel used in the bomb was used exclusively by the Peruvian military and matched the material used in a string of attacks on leftwing figures they accused of sympathising with rebels. But Méndez holds one man responsible for her daughter’s murder: Fujimori. Like many others in Peru, she was forced to relive her trauma when the country’s current president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, granted a humanitarian pardon for the former strongman. The Christmas Eve announcement has prompted a wave of outrage: tens of thousands marched in Lima against the pardon under which Fujimori, 79, was released less than halfway through a 25-year sentence for corruption and authorising death squads. Many Peruvians believe Fujimori should never have been pardoned, not just because of the gravity of the crimes for which he was convicted but because of the many more alleged human rights violations for which he never faced trial – and probably never will. “There are many cases linked to Fujimori’s anti-subversive policy which have not been considered – and for which Fujimori would have responsibility as an indirect perpetrator,” said human rights lawyer Gloria Cano. Fujimori fled to Japan in 2000 amid growing evidence of rigged elections and rampant graft, but he was arrested during a trip to Chile in 2005, and extradited two years later to face trial. Finally, Méndez believed she would get justice for her daughter’s murder. But Fujimori could only be tried for the cases linked to his extradition, including the two most notorious death squad killings: the 1991 Barrios Altos massacre in which 15 people including an eight-year-old child were shot, and the 1992 kidnap and murder of nine university students and their professor. Fujimori’s pardon – seen by many as a backroom deal struck to protect Kuczynski from impeachment on corruption charges – consisted of a humanitarian pardon on health grounds and a presidential pardon which, in theory, lifts all possibilities for future prosecution. But Fujimori could face a further human rights case due to a technicality, said Cano, who represents the families of six farmers who were tortured and killed in Pativilca, a rural village, in 1992. The Pativilca case was opened in February 2017 after Chile’s supreme court added the case to its extradition file. It must stay open for 24 months, raising the possibility that a judge could require Fujimori to attend a hearing – and thus revoke the presidential pardon. Fujimori’s pardon has no precedent for the international court of human rights, said Diego García-Sayán, a former justice minister. “It is the first time someone convicted of grave human rights violations has been granted a humanitarian pardon in the more than 30 years of the court’s existence,” he said. For Méndez, Kuczynski’s pardon was an “act of treason”. The only person charged over her daughter’s murder was an army captain who admitted in 2004 to preparing the letter bombs, but was later released when the case did not come to trial. So although Fujimori was never tried for her daughter’s murder, his sentencing in 2009 brought her “some comfort”, she said. “Now this New Year feels like 1992 all over again,” she said. “We lived those 10 years [of Fujimori’s government] in terror. If you were against the government you were a terrorist,” says Méndez. After her daughter’s murder, troops would park outside her family home and ask neighbours where they lived, she said. To make matters worse, as more evidence of death squad killings under his command emerged, Fujimori pushed through an amnesty law in 1995 which exempted military personnel from imprisonment or prosecution over human rights crimes during the preceding 15 years. Now Méndez cradles a placard which she carried at last week’s the protest, bearing a black and white photo of her daughter. “Before she left the house that day she told me: ‘Mamá, I will always be with you.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27401","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T00:00:05Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,401","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27401","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27401","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,401","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27402","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T00:00:33Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,402","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27402","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27402","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,402","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/07/i-should-hate-it-but-i-dont-albert-schloss-manchester-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘I should hate it, but I don’t’: Albert’s Schloss, Manchester – restaurant review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/07/i-should-hate-it-but-i-dont-albert-schloss-manchester-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/07/i-should-hate-it-but-i-dont-albert-schloss-manchester-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"Albert’s Schloss, Manchester: ‘I should hate it, but I don’t’ – restaurant review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Albert’s Schloss 27 Peter Street, Manchester. (0161 833 4040). Meal for two, including drinks and service: £50-£80 If you didn’t pay proper attention, you might dismiss Albert’s Schloss as Dante’s third circle of hell, only with less glamour. Or, even worse, as akin to a beer warehouse on a Friday night in Guildford. This is not casual prejudice towards the drinking culture of Guildford. It’s pre-meditated prejudice. I once spent a Friday night with the Surrey police, watching them crowbar drunks into vans. If I breathe deeply I can still smell the sick, overlaid by the dizzying waft of Lynx Dark Temptation. Yes, Albert’s Schloss on Manchester’s Peter Street is a barn. It has beer taps like the cockpit of a 747 has switches, and enough bar length for one of those aircraft to use as a runway. The music is so loud it could dislodge a filling and there’s a photo booth in the basement for when you need pictorial evidence of something you’ll regret in the morning. And boy do they lay on the Germanic schtick. The waiters aren’t wearing lederhosen and slapping each other’s thighs manfully, but they might as well be. The drinks list includes slogans like “Haus of Martini: Superior Trinken.” There’s a cocktail of vodka and strawberry liqueur with bubble gum syrup called the Wilder Kaiser, which is entirely uncalled for, and an awful lot of faux wood panelling. There are skis nailed to the walls, and burning log fires in the middle of stone tables. They sell a salted caramel schnapps. The menu is full of pictures of Teutonic castles. If a Manchester friend hadn’t implored me to go – “You’ll want to hate it, but you’ll love it” – I would have made the sign of the cross and scuttled away in search of a gloomy cicchetti bar. But he was right. Albert’s Schloss is brilliant, and it’s not just the booze, or the blistering music from the Sunday Best Jazz quintet, or the 9ft 7in drag queen impersonating Joan Crawford. Although obviously all of those things helped. I do love a drag queen who really puts her back into it. It’s the cooking. Because they needn’t have bothered. They could have called up some dismal food service company, signed a contract based on massive volume and opened the delivery doors. The kitchen could have been nothing but the ping of microwaves and the fizz of the deep fat fryer. Instead they’ve gone for it, building a bakery section producing terrific loaves of crisp crusted sourdough, and a white full of smoky cheese and ham, as well as knock-offs of cronuts – they’ve put a K on it – which are better than anything I’ve tried from Dominique Ansel. Granted, the menu is eclectic: a confit duck leg here, a bit of hummus there. An “Alpine Pizza” topped with nduja and chorizo stretches the definition of mountain food but perhaps that Albert gets around a bit. Croquettes are made with ham and cheese, the latter described as “Alpine. Many things on this menu are – we’ll take their word for it. These are crispy shelled, golden and pouting gusts of hot cheesy, piggy air at you as you bite in. Their sausages are made by a local butcher and are an impressive piece of work. The bratwurst is tight skinned, meaty and peppery in all the right places. It reaches from one end of the plate to the other. We have ours without bun, but with potato salad that has just enough bite and vinegary edge to stop it slipping into sludge. There is a crunchy sauerkraut and a big puddle of sweet savoury mustard. The £13 price tag is a lot for one sausage, less so for this complete plateful. From the Alpine Cook Haus list comes the Schweinshaxe at £16 and it’s the best Schweinshaxe I’ve had since the one with which I comforted myself in Munich 25 years ago, after having lunch with a neo-Nazi. He told me I should go back to where my sort came from. I said: “What, Harrow on the Hill?” He looked baffled. Enough about bigots: it’s a long-roasted pork knuckle, with enough meat on it to serve two of me or three of you. It’s a monumental plateful, as in you could use it as a headstone when the time comes. The crackling is crisp and plentiful, the meat soft, the gravy rich, the red cabbage almost as good as my late mother’s. It really is as sustaining a plateful as anything I’ve had in a real Bavarian bier hall. A skin-on fillet of pearly hake gives its all to a heap of Provençal lentils. A toasty beurre noisette sends everything on its way. Of the sides, it’s the sformato, a loaf of truffled mashed potato, with a burnished top of toasted cheese, which is the winner. As in, it completely defeats us. It’s food to get you through a siege, in a good way. There are lighter things, too: finely sliced Brussels sprouts with cranberry and chestnuts, for example, or charred branches of tenderstem broccoli with black olive aioli. With this I’m supposed to tell you I drank beer, and I did have a glass of a lemony weiss bier at the bar, but it was a well-priced Gavi di Gavi that got me through. We are seated next to a pastry display which we suspect has been out all day. Still, I order one of their kronuts, a peanut butter and raspberry jam job. It is a model of the kind: all crispy, friable and fried golden pastry, sugared within an inch of its life. It is generously filled. Better, by which I mean it could stand comparison with anything coming out of Britain’s grandest kitchens, is their burnt Alaska. It is served at a perfect temperature so your spoon doesn’t hit a boulder when you get through the gorgeously singed meringue. Inside is soft raspberry sorbet, at the bottom a crisp base. Bravo. We have clearly over ordered; you could fill your boots for £25 a head. And all of this is delivered to our table with grace and wit, by a young woman called Emma who has this job nailed. Every service at Albert’s Schloss must be like the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan (only without the blood loss). She doesn’t miss a beat. At the other end of the hall Sunday Best Jazz hit their mark on stage, the drag queens parade and the crowd starts dancing on the benches. I really should hate it. I should want to be anywhere but here. But I don’t. Albert’s Schloss is a class act. See you there for the cabaret next Tuesday. Jay’s news bites Few restaurants come with cabaret thrown in, but Alan Yau’s Park Chinois on London’s Berkley Street does. Styled after a 1930s Shanghai supper club, you can eat serious Chinese food, while listening to very good jazz. The Peking duck is exceptionally good. At £98 it’s also exceptionally expensive. But hey, the jazz is free. Kinda (parkchinois.com). Honest Burgers, which has grown from one Brixton outlet to a 24-strong chain, has invested £600,000 in a butchery unit so it can make its own burgers. With LTTC (less than thoroughly cooked) accreditation, their burgers can be served rare. It’s now supplying five of their south London restaurants (honestburgers.co.uk). Just after my review of Stevie Parle’s Palatino went to press came news that his first restaurant, the Dock Kitchen in London’s Ladbroke Grove, has closed after eight years. It started as a one-week pop-up in the showroom of furniture designer Tom Dixon and stayed there.

The piece, published by the BBC, rehearses the debates over tuition fees, student satisfaction, sky-high vice-chancellor salaries, and the universities minister’s recent criticism of free speech at our institutions of higher education. To be fair to the BBC’s education correspondent, he doesn’t appear to have an agenda but his diagnoses betrayed the same lack of familiarly of structural and operational realities that have so weakened the criticisms made by Andrew Adonis and Simon Jenkins. We might have hoped for more substantial critique from the minister, but Jo Johnson’s most recent pronouncements, on two-year degrees and on the troublesome debates embroiling students around freedom of speech have been disappointingly thin on evidence and detail. They were so easily debunked that I am beginning to suspect that Johnson is more interested in catching the eye of the right-wing press – and the prime minister – than in constructing useful policy for higher education. The appointment to the board of the Office for Students of Toby Young, a journalist with dubious and poorly supported views on diversity and eugenics, appears to follow a similar pattern. As we know from the rancorous process of the Brexit referendum and its aftermath, the views of politicians don’t need to fully embrace the complexity of difficult issues to inflict real and lasting damage. It is sufficient to build a superstructure of assumption and bombast around a kernel of truth. And there are enough kernels of truth in the questions raised over the past several months to make these dangerous times for the future of our universities. The only recourse is to come out fighting. Fortunately, there is plenty to fight for and plenty of ammunition, as is made clear in A University Education, a new book by David Willetts, one of Jo Johnson’s predecessors as minister for universities. Willetts may seem an unlikely ally to some, since he was the architect of the policy of trebling tuition fees that has troubled student groups so much and university vice-chancellors so little, at least according to the simplistic narratives spread in much of the press. But Willetts’s consistently thoughtful approach to higher education has earned him the respect even of his political opponents. Academics and students out of sympathy with his reforms will need to read his book and engage with his arguments if they are to build a case to challenge them. A University Education begins by sketching out the historical and geopolitical development of universities and provides a useful corrective to the more romantic notions about their purity and independence. From the foundation of the first one in Bologna in 1088, these institutions have always been subject to powerful internal and external influences. Though university self-governance remains a vitally important characteristic, it has always been tensioned against national interests. Thus Oxford emerged after Henry II banned English students from travelling to Paris; the research PhD, invented in Germany, was imported first to the US and then to England in reaction to the fear of competition; and the universities in Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol and Sheffield were founded– once the government had overcome the 600-year-long opposition of Oxford and Cambridge – with the support of local industrialists keen to harness research and education to their commercial interests. Government support for university expansion since the 1960s has been motivated in large part by recognition of the value that graduates bring to the nation and the national economy. With such a complex evolution, it should come as no surprise that modern universities have multiple functions, some of which are still changing and which therefore remain – rightly – contested in open debate. Universities retain a clear role as repositories of knowledge and culture, and as institutions that provide space and time for deep reflection and critical analysis of the societies in which they are embedded. They also serve to educate and to train students for employment, tasks that Willetts argues should not be seen as in opposition. Universities should also be engines of social mobility though it is questionable how well our “top” universities do that. And, following the original German model, universities in England play a major role in research and innovation, even if their connections to the wider economy could be more joined-up – issues that the Industrial Strategy and UKRI, the UK’s new super-research council, are aiming to tackle. Universities are also increasingly required to make themselves relevant to the country and their local communities, through public engagement and impact assessments, duties that have been brought into sharper focus by the evident disconnect between academics and regions of the UK that voted to leave the EU. The job of balancing this mix of missions is made more difficult because of the swirl of politics and ideology. How much should universities seek to change the societies in which they operate? What is the optimal balance between research excellence and providing a rich educational experience for students? Where does free speech end and hate speech begin? All these questions and more Willetts discusses with considerable care and attention to detail. One of his main preoccupations is to lay out a defence of his reform of university funding by shifting more of the burden from the public purse to students. It was a radical move, with attendant risks, but one that has not so far reduced the numbers of students from low socio-economic backgrounds, though the jury is still out on the impact of the recent replacement of maintenance grants with loans. Willetts builds a detailed case, arguing that the policy reversed the sharp decline in per-student funding that had accompanied the expansion in student numbers since the 1990s, and claims that lifting the cap on student numbers has finally delivered on the 50-year-old promise of the Robbins Report of enabling any qualified student to attend university. In support of this claim, he points to the significantly lower proportion of students from poor backgrounds attending university in Scotland, where university places are still rationed by the Scottish administration. Of course, this case remains controversial. Willetts bemoans his failure to win greater public support for his reforms, due in part to the difficulties of communicating the income-contingent aspect of the repayments and his contention that the fact that the government will pick up any debts still unpaid after 30 years is a feature and not a bug. My concern remains that there is little to stop future administrations from changing the terms of the loans to shift even more of the cost on to graduates. Willetts maintains that any such adjustment, which would affect the public-private balance of university funding, is a proper matter for democratic debate. If so, that is a debate that universities need to participate in more vocally – and more intelligently, if they are not to be painted as simply protecting their own interests. To that end, Willetts’s proposal in the book that universities might buy their own graduates’ loans (at an appropriate, subject-dependent discount) and thereby be incentivised to ensure that their students are properly equipped for their future careers and to support them over the longer-term, is worth consideration. It raises all sorts of questions – not least of financial sustainability and the risk of perverse incentives – but, as on fee reform, opponents will have to tackle these ideas with the same level of sophistication that Willetts has brought to the argument. Willetts’s book is not without its flaws. He mentions but remains rather coy about his disputes with the Home Office on including students in immigration figures, the misspending on alternative degree providers that happened on his watch, and the catastrophic impact of his reforms on part-time university education. I wanted him to dig deeper. His book came too late to directly address the re-eruption of the debate over higher education funding at the general election and the subsequent brouhaha over vice-chancellors’ remuneration. These issues have played well in the popular press and put universities on the back foot. It is difficult to present yourself as an engine of life-changing social mobility when some universities chiefs are pulling in nearly half a million pounds a year (supplemented in a few cases by generous sinecures for overseeing a pension fund that is seriously failing university staff). But it is not as simple as Adonis or Johnson seem to pretend. Adonis, an architect of higher fees under Labour, and Johnson, who has pushed for ever-greater marketisation of higher education driven by the entry of private, for-profit providers, have been less than forthcoming about the existential threats that these pose to universities. In an increasingly competitive world, it should be no surprise that institutions would compete vigorously for leaders prepared to shoulder the responsibility not just for success, but for survival. There is a case for some restraint and university chiefs should themselves be making it. Adonis may have been making the running but he is on thin ice. He has resorted to appeals to public duty, but not answered questions on his own role in approving higher salaries for the chief executive of HS2 Ltd – a public company. His stance lacks consistency and he has so far failed to come up with credible alternative policies. Nor, for that matter, has the Labour party. The question about duty is nevertheless perfectly valid and one that must be faced – particularly if we cling, as many academics still do, to the centrality of the university as a force for good in the modern world. Are our institutions being bent out of shape by market forces? Willetts would contend that throughout history they have been shaped and reshaped by government, by industry, by international competition and by academics and students. So these arguments are not new, but universities – as communities of scholars and students – should be determined as never before to drag this fight to a higher level. @Stephen_Curry is a professor at Imperial College. He writes here in a personal capacity. In the spirit of the argument presented here, the authors readily concedes that this article is far from complete but it’s also already too long.

When I was two years old I opened up a table lamp and ended up blowing up my hand. I had to have various skin grafts and operations until I was 16. I still remember the smell. I never got to ride my first bike. Straight after my dad bought me it I was diagnosed with Perthes’ disease. I had to wear callipers for two years, but when they came off I went into sports in a big way – I swam for the school, won gymnastics awards and ended up playing as a winger for Arsenal Ladies.

A week later he sent a photo to my fan club – he’d had it made permanent! That was about 32 years ago, so what must he think now? I had bodyguards at the peak of my fame, mainly for the teenage boys desperate to see me. They’d push up against the shop doors before they’d opened and they’d be crushed up and going through the glass windows. My dad taught me the quickest way to disarm a man. It certainly came in useful with David Cassidy when he attacked me in a toilet. There was the knee first, then an elbow to the face. I knew the 1989 Brit Awards were going to be a disaster from the start. Even in rehearsals everything was going wrong. What was I supposed to do? If it says on the autocue “Ladies and gentlemen, The Four Tops!” and Boy George walks out, that’s not my fault. It was the most memorable Brits ever, though, and definitely the most rock’n’roll! Sniper fire sounds a lot like hail. I got caught in it while in Bosnia with the troops. I was told I was in a bullet-proof car, but there’s nothing scarier than hearing bullets flying off the roof. I had to decide whether to lie down or sit up. I decided I’d sooner get a bullet in my bum than my neck. I never imagined in a million years that my partner would suddenly be told she had terminal cancer. We made sure Myra [Stratton, who died in 2015] did everything she ever wanted to in the time she had left. The one that tickles me is that she always wanted to go to Ibiza, so we flew out to a proper rave three weeks before she died. Sex matters to me if I’m in a relationship. But if I’m not then it’s not really important. Making peace with my dad was important. We hadn’t spoken for a decade because he’d stolen from me [she sued her father and former manager Patrick for embezzlement]. But Myra told me to go and see him in the morgue, because she knew in my heart I’d forgiven him. I kissed him goodbye, slipped him a little letter and told him I still loved him. I still feel very kiddish. If I take my mum out to a hospital appointment and I’m in my baseball cap and tracksuit, the staff can’t believe I’m 51. I think it’s because I’m generally a happy person.

A relatively small protest on 28 December, in Mashhad, Iran’s second largest city, began a wave of seemingly spontaneous demonstrations that have spread across the country. Officials close to the moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, have blamed supporters of his rival, hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who has his base in the city, for starting the protests. Initial chants of “death to Rouhani” soon gave way to harsher slogans targeting the foundations of the Islamic republic, such as “death to the dictator”, in reference to the country’s Raisi-allied supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Who is protesting? The protests, stronger in the provinces than Tehran, appear dominated by members of the working class under-25s who have suffered the most under Iran’s sluggish economy. Observers say the partial lifting of sanctions that followed Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with the west delivered uneven economic benefits to the country. “Middle class fortunes have improved somewhat following the nuclear deal … On the contrary, members of the working class … [have been] very vulnerable,” said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, the founder of the Europe-Iran business forum. What are they calling for and who do they blame? While the protests may have begun over economic grievances, they soon took on a political dimension. Chants have both called on Khamenei to step down and voiced opposition to Iran’s regional policy, including “Let go of Syria, think about us” and “I give my life for Iran, not Gaza, not Lebanon”. Videos posted on social networks show some protesters chanting nostalgic slogans in support of the deposed monarchy and late shah. The tone of the slogans has troubled many reformists, who are critical of hardliners in the Iranian establishment but do not urge the overthrow of the Islamic republic. Another contributing factor could be that although Rouhani was re-elected in a landslide victory last year, with nearly 25m votes, he then took a conservative path and failed to deliver on promises to change the country. How bad is the economy? Inflation is at 12% – albeit down from 40% at the start of Rouhani’s first term in 2013 – and unemployment is high. Youth unemployment is about 40%, more than 3 million Iranians are jobless and the prices of some basic food items, such as poultry and eggs, have recently soared by almost half. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, this is “despite the promise of Hassan Rouhani that the 2015 nuclear deal would help to create jobs and improve people’s living standards”. How do the protests compare to what happened in 2009? The protests are the biggest challenge to Tehran’s leaders since 2009, when the disputed re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to months of unrest amid a bloody crackdown. The protests are bigger in the provinces than in 2009, of a scale rarely seen since the 1979 Islamic revolution, but in Tehran they are so far smaller than the mostly middle class protests of 2009. Most chants during 2009 featured slogans in support of the opposition leaders under house arrest, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, but in the recent protests their names are seldom heard. What do the protests mean for Iran’s reformists? Reformists, silenced and relatively marginalised for over a decade by hardliners, are puzzled how to react. Most senior figures within the reformist camp have remained mute, troubled by calls for regime change, while a number of reformist commentators have come out asking the ruling system to allow peaceful demonstrations but expressing concerns that the recent protests are becoming too radical. Ironically, the ruling establishment now would need the help of the reformists to contain the growing unrest – but some have been sidelined and others, particularly the younger ones, discouraged by a lack of political reform under Rouhani. How has the state handled the protests so far? In the early days of the protests, the authorities largely held back but as the unrest continued and an intervention from Rouhani failed to calm public anger, security forces have taken on a harsher line. According to latest official figures, at least 21 people have died, including a number of security guards, and since Saturday, at least 450 people have been arrested in Tehran alone. Hundreds more have been arrested in provinces. Protesters say they have been hit by teargas but in sharp contrast to their handling of previous unrest, authorities have allowed local media to report on the protests, although many still reflect the official line. A limited number of foreign media still operating in Iran are also allowed to report. What could happen next? It is too soon to say if the protests will continue or peter out as the authorities step up their crackdown. In 2009, months of bloody crackdown ultimately prevailed. As the protesters do not have a leader, many say they lack strategy. Others say Rouhani may capitalise on the unrest and urge the hardliners to open up the political atmosphere, while pessimist reformers think the hardliners have now found a pretext to undermine Rouhani and the moderates, consolidating their power before any vacancy opens for the next supreme leader. Are foreign powers meddling? Iranian authorities have been quick to blame the unrest on foreign powers, accusing Saudi Arabia of direct involvement and claiming Donald Trump’s tweets, which have welcomed the protests, as evidence of enemy involvement. But there is little evidence so far to show that the unrest is being driven from outside, even though Washington and Riyadh have not been shy to say explicitly that they favour regime change and have been doing all at their disposal to purse it. Exiled groups, such as the People’s Mojahedin Organisation of Iran, which is not popular inside Iran, and monarchists, have seized upon the moment and welcomed the protests. One of Iran’s most outspoken MPs, Mahmoud Sadeghi, however, said he had urged the interior ministry not to link protests with foreign powers and instead improve the economic situation, open up state television to diverse opinions and lift restrictions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/03/apple-leads-race-to-become-world-first-1tn-dollar-company","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Apple leads race to become world's first $1tn company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/03/apple-leads-race-to-become-world-first-1tn-dollar-company","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/03/apple-leads-race-to-become-world-first-1tn-dollar-company","fields":{"headline":"Apple leads race to become world's first $1tn company","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The race is on to become the world’s first trillion-dollar company, with all eyes fixed on tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Financial commentators and investors predict 2018 will herald the first firm with a stock market valuation of $1tn (£738bn) or more, if technology share prices continue to rise as strongly as in 2017. Apple is leading the way, with a market valuation of $869bn on Tuesday, a figure arrived at by multiplying the company’s share price by the number of shares in circulation. The Californian firm that transformed mobile communications, music and photography with the iPhone is $140bn ahead of Alphabet, which has a market value of $729bn. Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1997 when its founder, Steve Jobs, retook the helm, would require a 15% increase in its share price to tip over the $1tn threshold. Apple’s shares increased by 47% last year. The shares were up 1.8% to $172.26 at the close of trading in New York on Tuesday after a dip in the last couple of weeks. Barron’s, the US investment magazine, declared on its cover last week that Apple would hit the $1tn valuation this year and that “we don’t think the peak [of Apple’s rise] is near”. Apple earned revenue of $229bn in its latest financial year, and made profits of $48bn – roughly as much as Microsoft and JP Morgan combined. David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners, which manages $25bn worth of funds, told Barron’s: “You have to go back to Rockefeller and Standard Oil to find a company so dominant in a business so large. Other companies settle for unit sales or revenues, but in many quarters, Apple collects more than 80% of gross profit across the smartphone industry.” George Salmon, an equity analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said markets were forecast to continue their boom in 2018 and that it was “just a matter of time” before one of the big US tech stocks tipped over into a trillion-dollar company. “With Facebook, Google and Amazon attracting an ever-increasing number of eyeballs on screen, the US tech sector has more than played its part in the global stock market rally,” Salmon said. “However, it’s Apple, one of the older tech giants, that’s in pole position to break through the $1tn barrier.” Ian Forrest, an investment research analyst at the Share Centre, said the creation of a trillion-dollar company was “inevitable”. “It may not happen this year, if we have a correction [fall in stock markets] but it is certain to happen over the next five years,” he said. Microsoft is in third place with a valuation of $664bn, but some analysts reckon that the online retail juggernaut Amazon is far more likely to take the crown as the first $1tn company because it is growing so quickly. Amazon is the world’s fourth most-valuable company with a market capitalisation of $566bn. Amazon’s shares increased in value by 58% last year, turning the company’s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, into the world’s richest man with a net worth of $99bn. His fortune increased by $34bn last year. On just one day in October, Bezos’s fortune increased by $10.3bn, when Amazon posted profits much higher than expected and the company’s shares spiked. Facebook, which floated on the stock market less than six years ago, is in fifth place, with a valuation of $520bn. Shares in the social network rose 56% last year. The world’s top five companies are collectively worth $3.35tn – more than than gross domestic product of the UK and every other country on Earth bar the US, China, Japan and Germany. The huge increase in valuations came after global stock markets ended 2017 at record highs, as share prices benefitted from President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and continued quantitative easing from central banks. Many analysts expect global stocks to continue to rise in 2018, which would be the ninth consecutive year of gains for the US S&amp;P 500 index. However, some are concerned that shares are overvalued and warn of a “correction”. Other market analysts and financial experts predict Amazon could beat Apple to the $1tn title. Stephen Mitchell, head of global strategy for Jupiter Asset Management, said it was “definitely a possibility” that a trillion-dollar company could be created this year. “In the tech sector sales are growing and profits are growing, and most of them [the big US tech companies] have got a huge amount of cash,” he said. “However, I think it probably will not be Apple, I don’t think 2018 is going to be a vintage year for them. It looks as if they have overpriced the iPhone X. You’ve got to look at Google, Microsoft and Amazon. I would say it’s most likely to be Google.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/jan/04/to-understand-our-post-brexit-and-trump-world-we-need-academic-inquiry-harris-beider","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T07:30:08Z","webTitle":"To understand our post-Brexit and Trump world, we need academic inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/jan/04/to-understand-our-post-brexit-and-trump-world-we-need-academic-inquiry-harris-beider","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/jan/04/to-understand-our-post-brexit-and-trump-world-we-need-academic-inquiry-harris-beider","fields":{"headline":"To understand our post-Brexit and Trump world, we need academic inquiry","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If the last 18 months have taught us anything, it’s that we live in an age of volatility and scepticism. As we enter 2018, the establishment is under pressure, and we’re not just talking about politicians and the media. As academics we find ourselves in the dock of public opinion too, accused of being experts with no relevance in the real world. But in a real world where misleading slants around political events often take hold in the press, and where social media users opine in echo chambers and fall victim to onslaughts of fake news, ours is a community whose influence in challenging the prevailing narratives through research is becoming more important than ever. It’s heartening to see universities and academics are realising that they have fallen behind on some real world issues. A new initiative led by Oxford University engaging with leading research institutions across Europe, recently identified a cohort of future research leaders to “think for themselves but not about themselves” in coming up with solutions for the social malaise affecting post-Brexit Europe. The same thinking could be applied to understanding the Donald Trump presidency and what it means for the US. Trump was brought to power by the “rust belt” in midwest America, an area that had been largely ignored by politicians and academics. This echoed the way in which neglected, post-industrial northern English communities voted for Brexit. Both communities were caricatured in the press as a white working-class lumpenproletariat out of step with countries pressing to be diverse, cosmopolitan and modern. Over the past two decades, white working-class communities have become reduced to a ridiculed “chav” stereotype assumed to be a febrile but uniform sub-species that supported extreme and racist political movements. Yet work on both sides of the Atlantic – including my own – has shown that much of this simplistic, negative narrative, which took firm root during the EU referendum campaign and the 2016 US presidential race, is not grounded in reality. My work on white working-class communities is drawn from my experience growing up in inner-city Birmingham. As one of three students of colour at my comprehensive, my expectation was of a life of racist abuse. This was the reality – but so was the openness of white working-class kids and their families who became my friends. My most recent study – The Other America: white working class views on belonging, change, identity and immigration – was based on participative fieldwork in five cities across the US. Working alongside community organisations, we secured 415 interviews. This gave us a depth and richness of data that challenged conventional wisdom on the white working class. The survey represented this group not as an angry brigade of racists, or indeed as consistent Trump voters. Many described him as the lesser of two evils compared to the other candidate, Hilary Clinton, who they saw as representing a political elite that ignored their interests. They deplored the language Trump uses to describe women and ethnic minorities. The respondents were an informed stratum of the population who questioned classic definitions of the working class based on income and university education, seeing themselves as connected instead through shared values. They are a group as diverse as any other community, and many were keen to engage constructively with communities of colour. The resounding message was that people felt they were voiceless, struggling and unrepresented, travelling in a social mobility slow lane compared to other demographic groups. In this context, the rise of Trump was not a surprise – just as research on white working-class communities exposing the extent of divided Britain could have predicted Brexit better than some of the media and pollsters. It’s right that rage against the establishment is not directed solely at elites in the media and government. An unpleasant truth is that we as universities and academics can also be part of the problem, often appearing to be cut off from the world around us. In addressing societal questions – such as prevailing cultural narratives around white working-class communities – in a radical and practical way, we’re reframing the conversation, and advancing the type of knowledge that informs decision-making and influences socio-political change. As academics, our resolution for 2018 should be to question received wisdom and follow the people rather than expect them to follow us. • Harris Beider writes in a personal capacity Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Doctors at private hospitals held protests on Tuesday while their counterparts in public facilities wore black armbands in opposition to the proposal, part of a sweeping overhaul of medical governance. Aimed at addressing a severe shortage of doctors, particularly in rural areas, the bill would allow people who dispense Siddha, Ayurvedic and other traditional Indian remedies to practise medicine after taking a course, the length of which is yet to be decided. A similar law already in place in Madhya Pradesh state licenses traditional healers to dispense and prescribe 72 medicines after taking classes for three months. The Indian Medical Association has criticised the plan, saying it will “lead to an army of half-baked doctors in the country”, according to the association’s president, KK Aggarwal. “The government is giving sanction to quackery,” he said. “If those doctors make mistakes and people pay with their lives, who is going to be held accountable?” SS Uttre, the president of the Maharashtra state medical association, said the proposal would dilute medical education and provide a “back-way entry into medicine”. He added: “We are going to oppose it tooth and nail.” Although India has more than 400 medical schools producing tens of thousands of high-quality graduates annually, the country has about 12 doctors, nurses or midwives per 10,000 people – less than half the World Health Organization benchmark. Thousands of graduates each year prefer to take their skills to the US or UK, or are drawn to well-paid jobs in the burgeoning private health industries of big cities such as Delhi or Mumbai. As a result, research three years ago found more than 2,000 primary health centres around the country lacked even one doctor to treat patients, with shortages of surgeons and specialists even more acute. Many Indians turn instead to traditional remedies such as Ayurveda – treatments prepared according to recipes from ancient Hindu texts – or to “quacks” who present themselves as doctors but lack any medical qualifications. About 57% of purported Indian doctors are thought to fall into the latter category. Similarly, according to a 2014 study, traditional healers already carry out clinical care in as many as one in three primary health centres in rural or tribal areas. To address the shortage, state and federal governments have experimented with licensing non-specialist doctors to carry out caesarean sections or administer anaesthetics. Village social workers and “quack” doctors have also received formal training in basic medicine, while under a health ministry proposal, traditional healers will soon be permitted to deliver babies, carry out non-invasive abortions and treat certain noncommunicable diseases. Ayurveda, yoga and other traditional practices have been championed by the current government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, which in 2014 established a ministry to promote alternative remedies. At least 65 Ayurvedic “hospitals” have been established in the past three years, with more planned. Rules for rigorous testing of Ayurvedic products have also been relaxed or waived, despite the concerns of medical scientists who say there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use in clinical settings. Another state, Gujarat, has sought to alleviate the doctor shortage by equipping some children with stethoscopes and allowing them to administer Ayurvedic treatments for “minor diseases” to their classmates. The government bill under scrutiny also proposes to scrap the doctor-run Medical Council of India and replace it with a new organisation overseen by health officials and free of the taint of corruption allegations, which have dogged the council. Doctors’ groups say the proposed changes are undemocratic and shift power from medical professionals to regulators who are without experience in the field. Medical groups said they would return to work after the government agreed to send the bill to a standing committee in parliament for further examination. Uttre said doctors would fight the proposal for bridging courses in any form and appeal to the supreme court if necessary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/04/how-make-perfect-broccoli-stilton-soup-cheese-shallots-stock-cream","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"How to make the perfect broccoli and stilton soup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/04/how-make-perfect-broccoli-stilton-soup-cheese-shallots-stock-cream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/04/how-make-perfect-broccoli-stilton-soup-cheese-shallots-stock-cream","fields":{"headline":"How to make the perfect broccoli and stilton soup","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So entrenched is broccoli and stilton in my canon of classic soups – well up there with the likes of tomato, minestrone and chicken broth – that I’m slightly taken aback not to find it in Lindsey Bareham’s comprehensive collection A Celebration of Soup, or indeed in any of the other books I have on the subject. The vegetable section yields similarly slim pickings, with not even a passing mention in Nigel Slater’s Tender, and nary a sniff in Jane Grigson’s Vegetable Book, either. Broccoli and cheddar soup is relatively common in the United States, but I wonder whether the stilton number was popularised by the New Covent Garden Soup Company, which burst on to the market in the late 80s with soup that didn’t come in a tin, and certainly not in oxtail flavour. Its broccoli and stilton version made quite an impression on me as a child. Whoever’s responsible, it’s a stroke of creative genius – the rich, salty cheese bringing out the pleasingly bittersweet flavour of the broccoli – and the perfect final destination for any odds and ends of stilton that might be lingering after Christmas. Vegetable soup is very January. Vegetables Nigella Lawson uses “frozen broccoli; actually, frozen organic broccoli, if that makes you feel better. In fact, this is better when made with frozen, and more convenient for an impromptu standby.” As someone with severely limited freezer space, frozen broccoli is a new one on me, and though it does cook more quickly, I don’t think the flavour’s quite up to scratch. Frozen might pass muster in a supporting role, but here, I’d strongly advise sticking with fresh. Don’t discard the stalk, as chef Sally Abé of the Harwood Arms seems to, but do add it before the florets, as Caroline Hire’s recipe for BBC Good Food magazine recommends, so it has the chance to soften properly. It’s all going to be pureed, but overcooked florets seem to taste mushy. Lawson’s is the only recipe that doesn’t read as if it’s been written in a time of severe brassica shortage: you need enough of the stuff to balance the richness of the cheese, so be generous, it’s not particularly expensive at this time of year. Hire also adds celery, leek and potato to her soup, giving it a hearty texture but a more generic vegetable flavour that detracts from the broccoli itself. That said, blue cheese has a natural affinity with the sweetness of alliums, whether shallots, as Abé suggests, spring onions and garlic, as in Lawson’s recipe, or plain old yellow onions, as in Hire and Brian Turner’s versions, though I’d choose shallots, the sweetest of the bunch, for preference. Whatever you use, soften them slowly in butter to help bring out this quality. The cheese This soup would work with just about any blue cheese, though you might need to adjust the quantity to achieve the same effect with milder, creamier varieties. A thrifty friend offers a tip about freezing the ends of blue cheese as one might do with parmesan rinds, then deploying them to add extra flavour (note, she cuts off the rind before consigning them to the freezer, which seems wise), and fishes them out before serving. The liquid Lawson makes her soup with vegetable stock; Abé, Turner and Hire use chicken, but I’m intrigued by a leek and stilton recipe of Mary Berry’s that has a white sauce base, thinned with a little stock, variety unspecified. However, because – unlike Berry – I’ll be pureeing mine. I don’t think it needs thickening with flour, or Hire’s potato. Milk gives the dish a more neutral base than stock alone, which can, particularly if you use good stuff, be rather rich. Abé and Turner, with cheffy disregard for waistlines, stir in a large glug of double cream, with the latter whisking in an egg yolk, too – delicious if you’re intending to serve this in tiny elegant portions for a dinner party, but it does preclude consumption in the kind of quantities I like with this soup. Aromatics and garnish Berry infuses the milk with nutmeg and bay leaf. As with Lawson’s thyme, the bay doesn’t come through, but a sprinkle of nutmeg – always a good friend to blue cheese – proves an excellent idea for a garnish: better than red chilli or chives, which look prettier than they taste. This is a dish that chooses comfort over style. And sometimes, in the depths of winter, that’s just what you need. Perfect broccoli and stilton soup (Serves 4) 2 tbsp butter 2 shallots or 1 small onion, finely chopped 800ml chicken or vegetable stock 600ml milk 800g broccoli 200g stilton, crumbled Nutmeg, to garnish Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat and add the shallots. Fry gently until soft and golden. Meanwhile, cut the broccoli stalks into smallish chunks, then add to the pan with the softened shallots, fry for a minute, then pour in the stock and milk. Bring to a simmer, then cook until the stalk is beginning to soften (how long will depend on the size). Meanwhile, cut the head into small individual florets. Once the stalk is almost tender, add the florets to the pan along with most of the Stilton, keeping a little back for garnish. Stir well, bring to a simmer, cover then cook for about 5 minutes, until the cheese has melted and the florets are soft. Allow to cool slightly, then puree until smooth. Taste and season if necessary, then divide between bowls and top with the remaining cheese and a good grating of nutmeg.

At Picos de Europa (pictured above) we had the tail end of a storm causing some dramatic clouds and fiery colour. The actual appearance of the sun in this case is not important; the effect that it has on the clouds is where the drama is. It’s a good idea to pinpoint the perfect time to shoot by using a smartphone app such as Sun Seeker to determine sunrise and sunset times for your exact location. Get higher for an aerial cityscape Low winter light and a moody black sky light up the famous coloured houses of Reykjavik. Taken from the bell tower of Reykjavik’s cathedral, Hallgrímskirkja, this is a great “set the scene” shot for a travel series. It was taken with an old point-and-shoot, and slightly underexposed to increase the drama of the sky and make the colourful houses stand out. Try an unusual angle Seljalandsfoss is one of the most-photographed waterfalls in south Iceland. The slippery wet path to the back of it gives an unusual perspective. Pop a 10mm fish-eye lens on to your camera and the result is remarkable. The setting sun lights up the wall behind this stunning cascade only a few times in the year. October, when this shot was taken, is a good time to try. Include a person in your landscape This moody, dark winter light gives a sense of drama to the ice by bringing out its fine texture and colour. The photographer in the background appears to sink into the waves, giving an illusion of being almost as one with his subject. This effect is achieved with the camera on a tripod, and a three-second exposure with a six-stop ND filter. Use a local guide In wild, remote areas, try go out with a local. In West Greenland, our Inuit musher and his sled team afforded us some great shots of the dogs in action plus some spectacular landscapes in places we could never have reached by ourselves. The “antique light” preset in Adobe’s Lightroom software was used in post-processing to give a timeless feel to this image, which was actually shot in the early afternoon on our way to the Inuit settlement of Oqaatsut. Consider using black and white Until recent times, the Konyak tribesmen of Nagaland, in north-east India, were notoriously fierce headhunters. In these images, their strong, uncompromising faces are lit by bounced light from the outside. They gain strength in monochrome through high contrast, boosted clarity and selective B&amp;W colour mix in Lightroom. These portraits were taken with a f/1.8 85mm fixed lens at ISO 2500. Mystify your subject Ladakh, north-west India, is a mystical Buddhist land with outstanding landscapesdotted with monasteries, stupas and prayer flags. I believe the strength of this image, taken in dull light during a sandstorm, is its sense of mystery. The three stupas in soft focus are a classic shape and do not need to be sharp for recognition, even though they are actually the real focus of this image, with the prayer flags simply a frame. The decision to develop this in black and white allowed for simplicity without the distraction of brightly coloured prayer flags. Shoot in the ‘afterglow’ This makeshift footbridge in Assam is the only way for local people to cross a section of the Brahmaputra river. As the sun dropped behind the horizon, a wonderful afterglow lasted for around 20 minutes, lighting the water and silhouetting the running children. Locations such as this need to be well-researched to pinpoint the time of day when the light will be at its optimum for photography. Consider back lighting The direction of light is so important in photography. Backlighting can be tricky to handle exposure-wise, but can make for some stunningly different images if you get it right. Soft back lighting from the setting sun gave this Assamese tea picker an ethereal glow amid the blurred backdrop of trees. This effect was achieved by zooming into the subject at 300mm with an aperture of 5.6. Send some prints These children are on the remote river island of Majuli, in Assam, backlit by the evening sun.

Milton Keynes hospital admitted it was under “extreme and sustained pressure” because of the “very high” number of patients turning up and needing to be treated as medical emergencies. “We are seeing very high numbers of very sick patients in the emergency department and fewer patients being able to be discharged – many because they also remain in need of acute care. Staff are working under incredible pressure to look after the patients in our care. I cannot overstate that. We are doing our best in extraordinarily difficult circumstances,” said the hospital’s chief executive, Prof Joe Harrison. Milton Keynes has opened what it said was “an unprecedented number of escalation [extra] beds in order to provide care for acutely unwell patients” and it is asking sick people to avoid their A&amp;E unit and seek help elsewhere, “unless it is a genuine emergency”. Dr Richard Fawcett, a consultant in emergency medicine at the Royal Stoke hospital, tweeted on Tuesday: “As an A&amp;E consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust I personally apologise to the people of Stoke for the 3rd world conditions of the dept due to #overcrowding.” Many other hospitals have been struggling to cope since Christmas during the cold weather. “Everyone is busy. Many people are talking about massive queues in corridors. And there’s more flu around than usual,” said Prof Chris Moulton, the vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), which represents A&amp;E doctors. “It’s clearly not just a few isolated hospitals that are having problems. It’s pretty much spread throughout the whole NHS,” he added. The higher than usual prevalence of flu, especially cases of the influenza A strain, which has caused havoc in Australia and New Zealand in recent months, was “very concerning [because] it’s respiratory illness that tips the NHS over the edge in the winter”. Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine (SAM) and a consultant at a hospital in the north of England, worked on Monday from 8am until 7pm. He was then called back to work at midnight because so many patients needed help, and stayed until 4am. The SAM represents doctors who care for patients admitted to hospital as medical emergencies but who do not need surgery. “The position [across the NHS] is as bad as I’ve known it,” he said. “Big issues are currently nursing staffing levels, with extra beds being opened around hospitals to cope with winter surge and not enough nurses to go round. This is the same for doctors and therapists. Diagnostic facilities in hospitals will be swamped – a vicious circle of increased need causing longer delays in whole system,” he added. The Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham came under such pressure on New Year’s Day that patients were waiting up to six hours to be seen, much longer than the four-hour maximum that should apply. The hospital said it had been “extremely busy”. Many hospitals are buckling under the strain despite intensive NHS-wide planning for a winter that bosses have long feared would be particularly difficult, including measures such as creating extra beds in hospitals and hiring “step-down” beds in nursing homes to help. Tracy Bullock, the chief executive of Mid Cheshire hospitals NHS foundation trust, tweeted that, in her 34 years working in the NHS, she had “never seen anything like this. Relentless and staff have been brilliant”. Dr Taj Hassan, the president of the RCEM, warned that patient safety could be at risk because urgent and emergency care is “a system under acute or chronic distress”. One hospital doctor, Chris Turner, tweeted: “It’s 0400 and I’ve been lying awake for the last hour worrying about how we manage the department when my shift starts in 12 hours time. The last time the job felt so impossible for me was Mid-Staffs. This can feel like a personal failure to staff; it’s not, it’s a system fail.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/08/when-the-scientific-secrets-perfect-timing-daniel-pink-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T09:00:06Z","webTitle":"When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing review – timely guide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/08/when-the-scientific-secrets-perfect-timing-daniel-pink-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/08/when-the-scientific-secrets-perfect-timing-daniel-pink-review","fields":{"headline":"When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing review – timely guide","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In 2011, two Cornell researchers, Michael Macy and Scott Golder, began an unusual project. They gathered approximately 500m tweets that had been posted by more than 2 million users in 84 countries over the previous two years. Then they subjected these tweets to careful analysis. The sociologists’ aim was straightforward. The pair wanted to measure how people’s feelings varied from morning until night and, by using an analysis program called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), they attempted to measure the emotional states revealed by individuals in the electronic texts they sent. The patterns that were uncovered were striking. Macy and Golder found that with remarkable consistency – and regardless of time of year – people’s positive emotions rose in strength as the morning progressed and then fell significantly in the afternoon, before climbing back in the evening. “Whether a tweeter was North American or Asian, Muslim or atheist, black, white or brown, it didn’t matter,” Daniel Pink tells us. “Across continents and time zones was the same daily oscillation – a peak, a trough and a rebound.” In other words, regardless of culture or differing daily rituals, our moods follow a rigorous pattern that is “crucial, unexpected and revealing”, according to Pink who believes the quality of the decisions we make are closely linked with their timing. Essentially, morning is a good time for coming to a judgment and afternoon is bad, he argues, backing the claim by quoting many other studies that show people tend to perform better in the morning and worse in the afternoon. “First our cognitive abilities do not remain static over the course of the day. And second, these daily fluctuations are more extreme than we realise,” writes Pink, who describes his book as not so much a how-to manual for making the most of our lives but a “when-to” guide. As to the cause of this phenomenon, Park points to the fact that when we wake up, our body temperature is relatively low and then starts to rise. That rising temperature gradually boosts our energy level and alertness which in turn “enhances our executive functioning, our ability to concentrate, and our powers of deduction”. As the morning progresses, the more focused and alert we become, until we reach a peak after which our energy levels decline and our alertness decreases, only to be restored in early evening. This trend has important consequences, it should be noted. In schools, for example, where computers are limited in numbers, children are often given standard tests in shifts – some in the morning and some in the afternoon. That timing skews assessments of pupils. In one Danish study, children’s results for the afternoon shift were significantly lower than for those being tested in the morning. The difference was similar to children whose parents had slightly lower incomes or less education. “Timing wasn’t everything but it was a big thing,” says Pink. This tendency is not universal but varies among individuals, however. There are larks who do particularly well in the morning and owls who perform better later in the day. According to Pink, the former are more likely to be born in autumn and winter, while the latter tend to have birthdays in spring or summer. It is intriguing stuff written with a light, assured touch by Pink, an expert on motivation and management who is at pains to stress that modern science shows that scheduling and careful timing of our daily routines is crucial to our wellbeing. Much of this advice is common sense. On the other hand, it is reassuring to be told, with confidence, that naps and leisurely daily walks are “not niceties, but necessities”.

In an attempt to prevent children from developing poor health and becoming obese, parents have been advised to be more strict with their eating habits. We asked you to share your tips on how you are trying to manage your children’s snack intake. Here’s what some Guardian readers said. ‘Try not to offer kids sugar as a treat’: Maria Karanika-Murray, 42, Nottingham We have fruit, veg or cheese as an after school snack. It’s a good time and opportunity to offer something healthy or introduce new foods to my son because he’s hungry and distracted when walking back home with friends. Kids also learn to view sugar as a treat – we teach them that. I try not to offer sugar as a treat and expect that the grandparents will respect that. We might as well teach them to get excited with fruit! Kids tend to eat only as much as they need to. I noticed early on that if my son is not hungry he will not ask for treats or may even refuse pudding. That’s a good habit that we often unlearn as we grow up. Eating well and enough is more important than finishing your plate. Perhaps the question is not how to limit the snacks our kids eat but rather how to teach them to understand and like good food. That means variety, regularity, and good habits for the whole family. ‘They get only one snack but they get to choose’: Amber, Germany We get the kids to pick their own snacks by reading the labels and being aware of e-numbers and glucose fructose syrup. Our rule is that they get one and that’s it. They choose which one they want and have an agency of sorts. We all know exactly how successful prohibition is ... ‘Don’t take young children into supermarkets!’: Madeleine Westall, 61, Isle of Man and Scotland Don’t take young children into supermarkets! Don’t buy what you don’t want them to eat and try and stick to your rules – no crisps means no crisps even at Christmas, and don’t eat what you don’t allow your kids to eat! I would say that setting good examples when children are young will yield rewards in the long run, but be prepared for a dip in their teens when they eat all sorts of crap. I think we should bring back school health professionals to help parents of primary-school-age children, as well as get dental professionals into schools to give talks. ‘The main rule is not having the same snack two days in a row’: Neil Welsh, Hampshire We keep a list of snacks that the kids can have on the fridge. They can have two snacks per day from the list as stepping stones between breakfast, lunch and dinner (but not within one hour of a meal). The main rule is that they are not allowed to have the same snack two days in a row which helps keep their snacks varied. Once a snack is gone it gets crossed off the list until it is replenished at the next shop. ‘We try and have only one time of the day when sugary snacks are allowed’: Gary M, 29, Yorkshire Outside of special occasions (like birthday parties etc.) we typically have one time of day where sugary snacks are allowed: immediately after dinner. After doing this for years now, our little one doesn’t seem to ask for extra sugary snacks or drinks outside of this time, and because it’s so tightly integrated into our schedule she rarely gets upset when she’s told that she needs to wait until after dinner if she does ask (often when in a supermarket or shop where these treats are on display). Try and stick to a schedule. We’re all creatures of habit and like any routine it’ll take time to adjust to. But once you’re there, you’ll be surprised how quickly your little one starts to keep you in check! Lastly, you should try to demonstrate the behaviours you want to see in your children. It’s no use telling them they can’t have a packet of crisps or some chocolate, if you yourself are indulging."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/05/secret-happy-family-life-successful-household-kindness-intimacy-shared-meals-phone-free","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T13:29:13Z","webTitle":"For a happy family life, think free-form jazz | Tim Lott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/05/secret-happy-family-life-successful-household-kindness-intimacy-shared-meals-phone-free","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/05/secret-happy-family-life-successful-household-kindness-intimacy-shared-meals-phone-free","fields":{"headline":"For a happy family life, think free-form jazz","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I am coming to the end of my time as a Guardian Family columnist, so I thought I would use my final contributions to summarise what I have discovered or pondered over during the last four years – a few principles worth thinking about if you hope for a functional family life. First, relax and do what you think is right. There are as many views about parenting, marriage and children as there are unpulled Christmas crackers in Nigel Farage’s house. Most of these received truths have the perishability of organic fruit. Family life is less like mathematics and more like free-form jazz. Feel at liberty to improvise. Be kind. If there is a simple secret to relationships, it is probably this. However, not too kind. You can do as much damage by being overindulgent as by being neglectful. Your children are your children, not your friends. Their positive judgment of you is good to have, but it is not a necessity. Learn to communicate. “Learn” is the operative word: most people think they already know how to do so. They open their mouths and words come out, then the targets of those words signal that they have heard them. However, real communication is an art and an acquired skill. It involves observation, honesty and a commitment to understanding, including self-understanding. You have to listen to silences, watch body language, unconscious cues, signals that the sender may not even be aware of dispatching. You have to read between the lines – including those imperceptible ones marking boundaries within. Under the umbrella of communication lies negotiation. To have a successful relationship you have to realise you are probably as wrong as you are right. Your partner almost certainly has a point. To work together, in good faith, to find common ground is the only hope for a healthy marriage. However, negotiating with children is optional. As a wise parent once said, “I don’t negotiate with terrorists.” In these days of heightened tension between the sexes, don’t hide behind gender stereotypes. If you believe your problems are down to your partner being a misogynist pig or a ball-busting virago, you are trying to make the problem go away by name-calling because you are unwilling to face it. Keep things in perspective. It isn’t worth getting upset about who left the toothpaste lid off. You’re all dust in the long term. Maintain intimacy. There are a number of practical methods for doing this. Don’t buy a big house. People are always trying to extend the size of their living spaces, but smaller spaces bring people together. Cyberspace also threatens intimacy. The personal freedoms of tablets, phones and PCs are leading to the decay of family commonality. Find times to switch them off. All of them, together. And have at least one meal a day as a family. Respect one another. The moment you lose respect for your partner, and see no prospect of regaining it, you should seriously consider your options. Respect is non-negotiable. You don’t have to have respect for your children – they’re children, after all, so they may have to make do with love and care. But you must make sure they respect you, and giving them some respect in turn is the best way to make that happen. Finally, and perhaps most importantly – you’re not as powerful as you think. And you are going to fail as a parent – everyone does – but less than you imagine. Children are independent beings and make their own choices and interpretations. There’s culture, there’s nature, there’s nurture and there’s how each individual child chooses to interpret what’s coming at them. That last part, you have no control over. So don’t beat yourself up too much – or pat yourself on the back too much, either. You’re a fragile link in a long chain of causality. @timlottwriter"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/02/man-found-dead-canary-wharf-construction-site-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T12:14:14Z","webTitle":"Man found dead after fall at Canary Wharf construction site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/02/man-found-dead-canary-wharf-construction-site-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/02/man-found-dead-canary-wharf-construction-site-london","fields":{"headline":"Man found dead after fall at Canary Wharf construction site","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police are investigating after a man fell to his death on a construction site in London’s banking district.

Commuter routes with £100-plus increases include Liverpool to Manchester (up £108 to £3,152), Maidenhead to London (up £104 to £3,092) and Elgin to Inverness (up £100 to £2,904). The average fare increases of 3.4% and season ticket increases of 3.6% are the biggest since 2013. The Department for Transport said price rises were capped in line with inflation and would help improve the network. Since 2007, rail passengers have picked up the bill for system improvements after the government decided taxpayers as a whole should pay less via subsidies. Guardian readers have been telling us how the rail fare increases affect them. ‘My season ticket is now more than my half of my mortgage repayments’ ‘People always have to stand, with queues in the morning to get a ticket’ I was paying £16.55 for a daily return ticket which covers my journey on c2c and one tube journey to Old Street. This daily ticket has now gone up to £16.95. This is the biggest increase since I moved back to England in 2014 when I was paying £15.90. I pay £5.50 a day to park at the train station. It has increased by £1 on Saturdays. I will now be looking at using the local bus service which is cheaper and saves me around £60 a month, but it also takes longer meaning I don’t get home until gone 7.15pm. c2c have upped their prices but have not upped their services. Just look at the Twitter responses they get. Trains are cancelled, trains of [fewer] carriages than they should be, meaning people always have to stand, queues in the morning to get a ticket. H Wright, 25, Benfleet, Essex, marketing assistant ‘It’s now more than my half of my mortgage repayments’ My fare’s risen by 3.6%, which is about £175. I have a 25-minute walk either side of my commute as I can’t afford bus or tube on top of the rail fare. I recently brought my first house in Chatham with my partner, following 12 years renting in London. We were sick of paying so much in rent, and had a really bad landlord. Despite both having above-average salaries, the only place we could afford to buy that was commutable was Medway so we decided to relocate and give it a go. However, my season ticket is now more than my half of the mortgage repayments and it is hard to get a seat both in the morning and evening. I am fortunate that my employer offers interest-free season ticket loans or the annual ticket would not be an option for me. The worst thing is that you know that the cost will only increase, and the trains at the same time will only get more crowded. Holly Chadd, 32, Chatham, works for a trade union ‘Is this fair for a 20-year-old earning £3.60 an hour?’ I catch the train Monday to Friday at 8.30am and 5.21pm from Saltburn to Middlesbrough [and back], a 25-minute journey. I already could barely afford my £77.60 monthly return ticket on my wage, but my ticket has now increased by £1.90, making it £79.50. Is this fair for a 20-year-old earning £3.60 an hour? Older generations often make remarks about financial independence towards younger people, but how can I be expected to be such a thing now? I am just thankful I have parents who support me, for now. Charlotte Cate, 20, apprentice in digital marketing ‘I’ll have to walk two miles to station as I can’t afford to pay for parking’ My fare has gone up £20 per month. A standard class season ticket from Didcot or Oxford with zone 1-6 Underground costs £569.50 each month. I take the bus to the station because it’s cheaper than parking. Great Western has introduced new trains on our route that are supposed to ease congestion and be electric. They’re running on diesel because of well-documented overruns with electrification work. In theory the new, longer 10-carriage trains have more seats. But in practice there’s still overcrowding because passengers boarding a crowded carriage can’t walk the full length of the train to find a seat. The 10-carriage train is two five-carriage sets joined together, so you’re limited to five carriages. So what? Well, the trains are too long for the platforms too. So not all the carriages are accessible. If only seven are, and four of those are first class, then everyone else is crammed into three carriages. My train timetable has changed so that my bus and train miss each other by a couple of minutes and I’ll now have to walk two miles to station as I can’t afford to pay parking. I guess this is a problem for me alone.

The Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI barometer of factory sentiment showed an average of 57 in the three months to December, in the strongest reading since the three months to June 2014. While the gauge dipped to 56.3 last month from 58.2 in November, it remained firmly above the 50 level indicating expansion. The latest PMI figures show activity and new orders expanding throughout the past 17 months in the UK, as firms reported increasing production in response to new orders and the launch of new product lines at home and abroad. The jump comes as British factories benefit from a rise in economic growth in the eurozone and the wider world economy. The single-currency bloc reported a record rate of expansion in its manufacturing sector on Tuesday, with a PMI of 60.6 – the highest level since the survey began in mid-1997. The UK survey found British manufacturers experiencing the strongest growth from the production of partly finished goods bought by other firms to piece together finished products, such as car bonnets or the flour used in bread. That may reflect increasing demand for goods made in the UK required by European manufacturers, which may have a fragile future as Britain negotiates its exit from the EU from the end of March next year. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has previously said that the UK “doesn’t so much export to Europe [but] through Europe” as the supplier of components to final goods that are exported beyond the continent – a sign of the EU’s importance for British manufacturers. However, ministers hope the UK can grow exports to the rest of the world. Britain recorded an increase in exports to non-EU countries at a faster pace than to EU markets in the three months to October, according to the most recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, earlier months this year showed falling sales to the rest of the world, against robust growth to the EU. British households are finding their spending power clipped by rising prices and sluggish wage growth, which is likely to have a knock-on effect for manufacturers. The pound’s weakness since the Brexit vote has led to a surge in the cost of importing food and fuel to the UK, pushing up prices on the high street and leading to a slowdown in spending. The figures showed 54% of firms said they expected to increase production over the course of 2018. The rise in new orders is testing the capacity of manufacturers, while also leading to job creation, according to the survey of executives at more than 600 industrial companies. Companies have seen rising export requests from the US, Europe and the Middle East, as the world economy enjoys a sustained acceleration. The OECD estimates a growth rate of 3.6% for global GDP in 2017, up from 3.1%, helped by the recovery in the eurozone and sustained expansion in China. The boom in global growth is helping to drag along the UK manufacturing sector, although economists at Barclays warned the PMI figures may indicate a waning share of world production from British firms. “Particularly telling is the growing gap between manufacturing momentum in the UK and the EA [euro area],” they said. The PMI survey gives an early indicator for economic growth before the release of official data from the ONS. Although the surveys have pointed to stronger growth from manufacturers than ultimately revealed by the official figures, factory production has been a bright spot for the economy in the past year. The latest figures show car factories helped to drive the country’s manufacturing production to its longest period of growth in 20 years, helping the economy grow at a rate of 0.4% in the three months to September. The ONS said production – which groups manufacturing with the smaller activities of mining, power generation and oil and gas extraction – contributed 0.2 percentage points to GDP in the third quarter. Economists at Goldman Sachs believe Tuesday’s manufacturing PMI helps to suggest a growth rate of about 0.5% in the final three months of the year, which would be the strongest quarter of the year. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/03/sue-grafton-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T15:18:24Z","webTitle":"Sue Grafton obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/03/sue-grafton-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/03/sue-grafton-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Sue Grafton obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sue Grafton, who has died aged 77, was a trailblazing writer of American detective stories. Her 25 novels featuring the private eye Kinsey Millhone, which began with A is for Alibi in 1982 and extended through the alphabet to Y is for Yesterday (2016), established the hard-boiled female detective as a viable alternative to the males who had dominated the genre. Millhone, an ex-cop and twice divorced, was a tough character, but in Grafton’s hands she also had a deep understanding of the effects on people of the crimes she investigated. This reflected Grafton’s major influence, Ross MacDonald, whose Lew Archer novels were marked by their relative lack of violence and their sharp perceptions of life in southern California. Grafton set her books in a Californian city called Santa Teresa, a fictionalised version of Santa Barbara, whose name she borrowed in homage to MacDonald. Her influence on writers was immense, not only through Millhone but also on a personal level. The crime writer Meg Gardiner, a big fan, said: “With every page I wished: Kinsey Millhone, be my friend. Beyond that [she] showed me how a female series heroine could work ... I thought: Yes. Give me more. And let me learn to write fiction that aspires to be as good.” The novelist Jeff Abbott had a similar reaction: “Kinsey was a different kind of character,” he said. “She was modern. She had problems like mine, like living between pay cheques and sometimes spending too much time alone; a rich inner life. A lot of the story was about her life, in addition to the case she was trying to solve.” Much of Millhone came from Grafton’s own experience. She was born in Louisville, Kentucky, where her father, Chip Grafton, was a bond lawyer who also wrote detective novels under the name CW Grafton, and her mother, Vivian (nee Harnsburger), was a teacher. Both were alcoholics, and from an early age Sue was left to look after herself. After a year at the University of Louisville, she transferred to Western Kentucky State Teachers College (now Western Kentucky University), where she married James Flood and had two children. The relationship ended quickly. After her mother’s suicide in 1960 she returned to graduate from Louisville in 1961. She dropped out of graduate school after marrying again – to Al Schmidt – and followed her husband to Santa Barbara. There she worked in office jobs while writing in her spare time. She had begun her first book at 18, after the pleasant shock of reading Mickey Spillane’s Mike Hammer novel, I, the Jury. “After Nancy Drew and Agatha Christie, what a revelation!” she said. “It may have been the moment when the spirit of Kinsey Millhone first sparked to life.” But her initial three books went unpublished, and it wasn’t until 1967 that her fourth, Keziah Dane, became the first to reach the public domain. That was followed by The Lolly-Madonna War (1969), a story of feuding families in the Appalachian hills, which was adapted into a film called Lolly-Madonna XXX (1973). Despite a strong cast with Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Jeff Bridges, Randy Quaid, Gary Busey and Season Hubley, the film died. Nonetheless, Grafton’s work on its screenplay led her to spend the next 15 years screenwriting – primarily in television movies, although after writing the teleplay for the 1981 movie Nurse, starring Michael Learned, she developed it into a series that ran for two seasons. Asked once about the prospect of her own novels being adapted for the small screen, she had quipped: “I would never let those clowns get their hands on my books,” though B is for Burglar and D is for Deadbeat were adapted as TV movies in Japan. In the late 1960s her second marriage ended in a protracted divorce and custody battle so brutal that she would jot down notes of ways to kill her husband, which later found their way into her novels. She married Steven Humphrey, a philosophy professor, in 1978. They collaborated on teleplays, including two Agatha Christie adaptations – A Caribbean Mystery, starring Helen Hayes as Miss Marple, and Sparkling Cyanide, with Anthony Andrews as Tony Browne, both airing in 1983. Eventually the couple split their time between Santa Barbara and an estate in Louisville, with Humphrey teaching at universities in both cities. A is for Alibi had been published in 1982. Grafton had written seven books before that, but had destroyed the manuscripts of the five that were not published. Alibi’s success meant she gave up writing for the screen. She had conceived Millhone as a series character and had been fascinated by writers who used connected titles, such as John D MacDonald’s colours in the titles of his Travis McGee novels, or the days of the week in Harry Kemelman’s Rabbi series. But the inspiration for Millhone’s alphabet titles came from Edward Gorey’s Gashlycrumb Tinies, in which 26 children suffer ghastly ends in alphabetical order. All her titles followed the A is for ... pattern, apart from the 24th, called simply X. As early as 1991 Grafton had announced that the final book in the series would be called Z is for Zero, but after Y is for Yesterday she became ill with cancer and was unable even to begin that last novel. Her family ruled out further adaptations of her books or any use of ghostwriters to continue the Millhone series. She is survived by Steven, and by three children, Leslie, Jamie and Jay, from her previous marriages. • Sue Taylor Grafton, author, born 24 April 1940; died 28 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/jan/06/secret-teacher-unbalanced-curriculum-sats-assessment-children-art-music-languages-sidelined","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"Secret Teacher: subjects like art are being sidelined – but they matter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/jan/06/secret-teacher-unbalanced-curriculum-sats-assessment-children-art-music-languages-sidelined","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/jan/06/secret-teacher-unbalanced-curriculum-sats-assessment-children-art-music-languages-sidelined","fields":{"headline":"Secret Teacher: subjects like art are being sidelined – but they matter","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s Monday afternoon and I’m teaching a class of 10- and 11-year-olds French. Last week they wrote a set of descriptive sentences about animals and today they’re going to turn their descriptions into picture books. “Once you’ve finished with your sentences, you’re going to illustrate them to reflect what you’ve written,” I tell the class. Silence. “Any questions?” A hand pops up. “Do we have to draw the pictures? Can’t we just write the sentences?” “You need to draw the pictures as well. You’re making a picture book, remember?” “But I can’t draw, Miss.” A ripple of agreement spreads around the room. Heads shake. One boy goes under his desk and refuses to come out for 10 minutes. I spend the lesson encouraging and cajoling them to give it a try. The trouble is, they’re right. Most of them can’t draw. Their illustrations wouldn’t look out of place in a reception classroom. Cats, cows, pigs and mice all appear the same – round heads and bodies drawn with four stick legs poking out. And it isn’t just this particular class. With few exceptions, the pattern is repeated in every year group that I teach. According to the primary national curriculum, we should be teaching children to become “proficient in drawing”. So what’s going on? When I share my observations with the key stage 2 leader, she shakes her head. “There just aren’t enough hours in the day,” she says. And that’s the end of that. It’s not just art. Music is sidelined too, as are languages. Children are removed from French lessons for extra reading and writing interventions; school productions are shelved due to lack of practice time; opportunities for drama are reduced to the odd English lesson. I get why it’s happening. Teachers are under pressure to improve outcomes for reading, writing and maths, particularly in year groups where Sats are the only tool for assessing children. I’ve been in that position myself, forced to make changes to timetables I’d rather not. Before I became a primary modern languages teacher I taught year 6. Every January I would sit down with my colleagues and take a red pen to the timetable I’d carefully crafted in September, replacing music with extra comprehension or swapping French for additional spelling sessions. In a recent NEU (then the NUT) survey, 97% of the union’s teachers agreed that Sats preparation did not support children’s access to a broad and balanced curriculum, saying the time taken to prepare children for assessment in maths and English has squeezed out other subjects and activities. The problem doesn’t stop when our children leave primary. The proportion of 15- and 16-year-olds taking subjects like music and drama has fallen to its lowest level in 10 years. The study of modern foreign languages at GCSE is also in decline. I feel strongly that our schools are missing a trick. Feversham Primary in Bradford recently made headlines for its focus on teaching the arts, particularly music, which has led to improved pupil outcomes. The fact that the school’s approach has made the national newspapers is enough to tell us it’s unusual. The problem is that adopting a revolutionary approach such as this is a risk that, facing budget cuts and Ofsted scrutiny, most headteachers are not willing to take. Improving outcomes aside, I worry about the message we’re sending our children when we push arts and languages into the background. I worry we’re creating a gulf between children whose parents can afford to take them to private music lessons, language clubs or the theatre, and those whose access comes mainly through the school curriculum. But more than all this, I’m reminded of an Einstein quote – the one that says that if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will spend its life thinking it is stupid. There are children who struggle to read but come to life on the stage. There are those who just can’t concentrate in other lessons but will sit and paint for an hour without leaving their seat. If our schools are only interested in children’s progress and attainment in a limited range of subjects, how can we ever hope to build on the potential of those whose strengths lie elsewhere? The trouble is that creativity, increased confidence or a love of the arts aren’t easily measured through standardised tests, data analysis or league tables. Maybe that’s why, ultimately, certain subjects are sidelined. Perhaps I’m idealistic, but this is an issue that bothers me. It should bother my school leadership and government too.

The government-funded Stasi records agency confirmed this week that it had had to halt an €8m (£7m) project to digitally reassemble the contents of 23 bags stuffed with torn-up documents detailing the activity of the secret police, because the scanning hardware it was using was not advanced enough. Over the 40-year existence of communist East Germany, the state security ministry built one of the most tightly knit surveillance states in recent history. The Stasi, short for the Ministry for State Security, created a vast web of full-time agents and part-time snoops, with some historians calculating that there was one informant per 6.5 citizens. After German reunification in 1990 an archive was set up to allow the system’s victims to access their records, but not before stacks of paperwork were shredded or ripped up by hand to cover up the regime’s activity. While there are no official figures on the volume of destroyed records, researchers estimate that 10-40% of the archive’s contents may be lost to history. Since the early 1990s workers employed by the agency have managed to piece together more than 1.5m pages of destroyed files by hand, shedding light on East Germany’s use of doping in sports, links between the Stasi and West Germany’s Red Army Faction terrorist group, and the persecution of writers critical of the regime. The reassembled files brought to light the story of a young Austrian theology student who shopped several fellow students to the Stasi after they had confided in him their plan to escape across to the west. As a reward, the informant was handed a professorship at the University of Jena. Until 2015, the Stasi records agency outsourced some of the manual puzzling work to the federal refugee agency in Bavaria. But workers have struggled with files that were torn up more than four times. “Once you have nine snippets per A4 sheet of paper, the human brain really can’t keep up,” said Dagmar Hovestädt, the spokesperson for the Stasi records agency. A so-called ePuzzler, working with an algorithm developed by the Fraunhofer Institute and costing about €8m of federal funds, has managed to digitally reassemble about 91,000 pages since 2013. However, it has recently run into trouble. For the last two years, the Stasi records agency has been waiting for engineers to develop more advanced hardware that can scan in smaller snippets, some of which are only the size of a fingernail. The ePuzzler works by matching up types of paper stock, typewriter fonts, or the outline of the torn-up page. It has struggled with handwritten files that were folded before being torn, leaving several snippets with near-identical outlines. The ePuzzler has also required human assistance to feed in paper snippets and check over the completed jigsaw puzzle, further slowing down the process. “We currently don’t have a scanner that we can work with,” said Hovestädt, adding that her agency was hopeful that technological progress would allow the archive to resume reassembling destroyed records this year. The Stasi records agency said its attempt to virtually piece together the history of a surveillance state was without a precedent in the world. “We are dealing with a research project that requires us to develop a technology entirely from scratch.” In the meantime, a small team of manual puzzlers continue their work of matching up more crudely ripped files by hand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/19/lets-move-to-finnieston-glasgow-no-lampshades-cocktails-in-jam-jars","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T16:30:28Z","webTitle":"Let’s move to Finnieston, Glasgow: ‘You’ll struggle to find a lampshade in the modish new nitespots’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/19/lets-move-to-finnieston-glasgow-no-lampshades-cocktails-in-jam-jars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/19/lets-move-to-finnieston-glasgow-no-lampshades-cocktails-in-jam-jars","fields":{"headline":"Let’s move to Finnieston, Glasgow: ‘You’ll struggle to find a lampshade in the modish new nitespots’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What’s going for it?

But he’s part of a wider trend","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The words “outcry as YouTube star posts video of dead body in Japan” are so ludicrous, almost nonsensical, that they may as well have come from a random 2017 headline generator. Unfortunately, they don’t. Logan Paul, a 22-year-old vlogger, has been castigated across the internet for publishing a video showing the body of a suicide victim in Aokigahara, a forest near Mount Fuji notorious as a site for multiple suicides every year. Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul (no relation) told Paul he should “rot in hell”; even Piers Morgan described him as a “sick, twisted, heartless little prick”. Paul’s YouTube channel has over 15 million subscribers, so it’s no surprise that a number of fans are already attempting to explain away his behaviour, many with the hashtag #Logan_you_are_forgiven”. These fans are in the minority, though, and rightly so. Filming the body of a victim of suicide and posting it online for all to see is unforgivable behaviour – refusing to give the victim any dignity in death, completely disregarding the distress it may cause their loved ones, failing to take into consideration the millions of young viewers exposed to the scene, and displaying a very disturbing lack of empathy in the process. His excuse? He was trying to “raise awareness”. That’s obvious nonsense. Media guidelines on reporting suicide are clear: the Samaritans’ guide on reporting standards plainly state that outlets must “exercise caution when referring to the methods and context of a suicide” – a point that includes not giving too much detail on specific methods. Dignity and decency aside, Paul’s video clearly fails to live up to these standards. But there is something in his use of “raising awareness” that speaks to something beyond this single incident. Awareness raising came into its own in 2017, with decades’ worth of campaigns by mental health charities and activists finally gaining mainstream attention. So far, so good: it’s undeniable that testimonies from those with long-term mental health conditions have started to massively destigmatise elements of mental illness, depression and anxiety, particularly. But, somehow, “awareness raising” became a behemoth. In recent months I’ve had coffee shop windows and soap packaging exhort me to “be aware” of mental illness, and it’s even been used in workplaces across the country as a way to improve the “efficiency” and “productivity” of workers – not quite the stigma-busting change of heart that many of us had in mind when we first started campaigning for awareness. The primary goal of much visible mental health activism became “raising awareness”, and it completely dominated the media: articles, books, TV shows all firmly focused on the idea of breaking down stigma. The actual day-to-day realities of people with chronic mental illness were seemingly unimportant – it didn’t seem to matter what they needed or how they felt, just as long as we knew they were there. The politics of mental health – the impact that austerity has on the lives of mentally ill people, as well as poverty, racism, lack of access to services – have broadly been ignored in favour of simply encouraging people to “talk”. It’s now reached the point where “awareness raising” is used to excuse all sorts of problematic behaviours. Hundreds of articles are published every year making sweeping, unverified statements about mental illness and giving potentially dangerous advice; the NME’s unapproved use of Stormzy as a poster boy for depression was apparently an attempt to “raise awareness of an issue that we’ve been inspired to talk about following your comments”; and Theresa May claimed that her government would “reduce stigma” while simultaneously placing services under obscene pressure via unrelenting cuts to the NHS. Paul’s claim is a similarly transparent attempt to get himself off the hook – to excuse his despicable behaviour and, probably most pertinently for him, to prevent the loss of his 15 million YouTube subscribers. But though his excuse is undeniably galling, it’s also now par for the course. “Awareness raising” is so ubiquitous a phrase that it has been rendered utterly meaningless. Genuine awareness raising – thoughtful, responsible testimonies from people living with mental illness or disability – is invaluable. But when a term can be so easily utilised to justify even the most horrifying behaviour, it’s probably time we found a new one. • Emily Reynolds is a freelance journalist based in Berlin In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Prior to her frontline involvement in politics she had been a war reporter, Pulitzer prize-winning author, and professor of global leadership and foreign policy at Harvard. She has a lead role in The Final Year, a forthcoming fly-on-the-wall film documentary about the last 12 months of Obama’s administration. It was quite emotional for me as an outsider to watch The Final Year – I can’t imagine how it must feel for you. When did you first get to see it? I saw versions of it as early as last spring. But then, I was more looking at it with an eye to “Oh my God, I look so tired.” It wasn’t until I saw it with an audience for the first time in Toronto that I really watched it. I was pleased that the film was not being taken as a movie about diplomacy, but about wider questions. It is about people trying to make the world a little better and not always succeeding and getting up and trying again. You were a very tight team in the Oval Office, it seems. Are you all still close? People are off finding their paths. Some colleagues have decided that their path is to go back where they went to high school and run for office from there. For myself, I am working on a memoir that is targeted at young people. That involves being a bit removed from what I would like to still be working on, which is solving problems in the here and now. How do you go about replacing the intensity? It’s a bit like being a professional athlete who retires: you have to find meaning in the next phase. But I guess for me it has been like being an athlete who retires and finds the sport itself no longer exists. It is not like I am quibbling with the direction of the diplomacy of this administration. They are not doing any diplomacy. You are often cast as the conscience of Obama’s foreign policy – was that a role you wanted? I couldn’t become un-blunt. If I wanted credibility in a meeting, I would go to a place first and talk to dozens of people, just like I did when I had a reporter’s notebook. But was I the conscience? Barack Obama has his own conscience. He wanted someone who could speak to that part of him, a very large part of him. The film dwells a little on you trying to juggle your role with the pressure of having young children. How hard was that? My husband and I had both of our kids while I worked at the White House. Like for anyone, they kept me honest. They helped me not to take myself too seriously, but always try to take the enterprise seriously. In the film, you cry at a citizenship ceremony when you recalled your own arrival in the States from Ireland at the age of nine. Can you remember what that felt like? For my book, I found some letters I sent to my grandfather. I had a lengthy correspondence with him – he died in Ireland at 101. But they say, you know, “I got a new watch last week. If you hit the left button, the face lights up blue. Love, Samantha.” Still, there is no doubt I loved America, and I felt there was something in the water: that if you could dream it then you had a chance of being able to do it. I never felt held back by being an immigrant. Everyone was an immigrant or the son or daughter of an immigrant. Your mother, who brought you and your brother over on her own, must have been an inspiration… Big time. As you get older you look back and think: what would it have been like for her to do that in her 30s? She had to redo a lot of her training as a doctor, start over. Among other things, she taught me the value of being a storyteller. Being at the UN was a bit like trying to get heard at an Irish dinner table. You had to have a story to tell. In the film, 2016 election night has never looked more shocking than at the party you organised to welcome Hillary as the first female president. It must be tough to watch that now… Almost everyone who sees it has some version of that experience. But it’s true not everyone was so dumb as to invite the 37 women ambassadors to the UN and Gloria Steinem to their party along with a documentary film crew… How long did it take you to recover? It was tricky, because I remained in position until 20 January. I had to get things done, a list of political prisoners to try to get out of jail and so on. It was all complicated by the fact that the incoming administration wanted to conduct its own foreign policy while we were still conducting ours. A very dangerous thing, and a horrible feeling. A year on, is it as bad as you feared? It’s much worse. But the checks and balances are working, to a degree. We are in the process of redefining what America is: it is not just the nation that pulls out of the Paris agreement, but also our mayors and governors who remain committed to it. It is not just a president who would ban transgender people from the military, but also the courts which are blocking those executive orders. On a personal level, do you see it as the closing chapter of your career at the heart of politics? I think once you have tasted public service at that level, you want to do it again. Whether I will have the opportunity to do so, I don’t know. President Obama had this line about history zigging and zagging, progress not going in a straight line. Every time I hear that now I think: “OK, maybe enough zigging. I think it’s probably zag time now.” The Final Year is in cinemas and on iTunes from 19 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/04/paolo-conte-zazzarazaz-uno-spettacolo-darte-varia-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T18:15:02Z","webTitle":"Paolo Conte: Zazzarazáz – uno Spettacolo d'Arte Varia review – gravel-voiced Italian still full of surprises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/04/paolo-conte-zazzarazaz-uno-spettacolo-darte-varia-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/04/paolo-conte-zazzarazaz-uno-spettacolo-darte-varia-review","fields":{"headline":"Paolo Conte: Zazzarazáz – uno Spettacolo d'Arte Varia review – gravel-voiced Italian still full of surprises","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With his growled, languid voice and a songwriting style that veers from chanson to jazz, tango and blues, Paolo Conte is Italy’s answer to Jacques Brel, Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen combined. He celebrates his 81st birthday this month, and this four-CD box set is a reminder of his extraordinary, still-continuing career. It starts with the new, pained and half-spoken Per Te, with backing dominated by his own piano and by accordion, and then switches to the gently swinging Sotto Le Stelle Del Jazz, and the thoughtful, languid but jaunty 1981 hit Madeleine.

Moreover, Woods can shift gear between jigs and reels, free funk, Balkan dances and ambient electronics without sounding undecided, as can his long-time partners, including double bassist Andy Hamill and guitarist Mike Outram. Woods’s folk roots are immediately declared in the skipping, pitch-sliding soprano sax melody of Queen Takes Knight, but the jazz connections are also plain in Rob Millett’s glowing, Gary Burton-esque vibraphone sound, and in Outram’s restrained, sporadically wailing chord work. Some tracks teem with funky melodic chases between instruments, some are mournful and mysterious (such as the Bonfire Carol, the only traditional song); Metamorphic is a world-music marimba groove with a penny whistle theme; Pantagruel is a Celtic hop; Firelight is a lovely wood flute ballad set against Hamill’s harmonics and purring chords. It’s understatedly emotional and warmly personal music."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/03/patients-association-charity-attacks-ministers-over-nhs-winter-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T13:08:22Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt defends decision to postpone non-urgent NHS surgery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/03/patients-association-charity-attacks-ministers-over-nhs-winter-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/03/patients-association-charity-attacks-ministers-over-nhs-winter-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Hunt defends decision to postpone non-urgent NHS surgery","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has defended plans to postpone non-urgent surgery until the end of the month, amid growing criticism of the government’s response to the NHS winter crisis. Hunt said the decision was made to allow “a planned, methodical, thoughtful” approach. He also apologised to patients who had faced upheaval, saying: “It’s absolutely not what I want.” Speaking to Sky News, he said: “What is different this year compared to last year is that last year we had a lot of operations cancelled at the last minute. A lot of people were called up the day before their operation and told: ‘I’m sorry, it can’t go ahead.’ “And we recognise that it is better, if you are unfortunately going to have to cancel or postpone some operations, to do it in a planned way … Although if you are someone whose operation has been delayed I don’t belittle that for one moment and indeed I apologise to everyone who that has happened to.” He thanked NHS staff for their “heroic” job, saying they were working “beyond the call of duty”. Hunt’s remarks come after growing criticism from charities and opposition MPs of the government’s response to the worsening situation in hospitals this winter. Dr Anthea Mowat, the chair of the British Medical Association representative body, said: “What is happening in our A&amp;Es is symptomatic of pressures across the entire system … Short-term fixes, however well-meaning, will only get us so far. Each winter the pressure on the NHS worsens, and politicians are not taking the long-term view needed to ensure the NHS can keep up with rising demand.” The Patients Association attacked ministers for the pressure the health service was under. John Kell, the charity’s head of policy, said politicians’ decisions had left the NHS in its current situation. Kell said: “Ministers must be accountable for this winter’s crisis. The policy decisions that have left the NHS in this position are taken by the government, and it is ministers who are directly accountable to parliament, and to patients when they vote at elections.” His criticism came as Theresa May praised NHS workers for doing a “fantastic job” under pressure and insisted that the service had been better prepared for winter than ever before. On Tuesday, pressure on English hospitals prompted the government to tell them to take unprecedented measures to try to stabilise the service. This included extending an existing ban on non-urgent surgery until the end of the month and deploying consultants in A&amp;E units to assess whether patients really were emergency cases. Kell added: “Objectively, the NHS’s performance and offer to patients are stronger now than they were 15 years ago or more, but the experiences of patients at times like this do not reflect that. Ministers must not allow the NHS to slide backwards in its 70th anniversary year to the point where its improved performance in the later 2000s seems like an isolated peak.” He said patients were losing out, with a growing number treated on trolleys in corridors. Sarah Wollaston, the former GP and Conservative MP who chairs the House of Commons health committee, said May and her cabinet colleagues needed to “get a better grip” of the problem. The prime minister, on a visit to homeowners who had benefited from stamp duty reforms in Berkshire, paid tribute to NHS staff and pledged operations would be rescheduled “as soon as possible”. She said: “Can I say a huge thank you to NHS staff for their hard work. They work hard and do a fantastic job for us, day in and day out, all year round, but obviously there are extra pressures in winter. “They’re doing a fantastic job and their dedication is ensuring that people are getting treatment that they need.” She added: “The NHS has been better prepared for this winter than ever before. We have put extra funding in. “There are more beds available across the system. We have reduced the number of delayed discharges of elderly people who would otherwise have been in NHS beds rather than in social care. But I recognise for those people that have had their operations postponed this is disappointing, it’s frustrating.” Jonathan Ashworth MP, the shadow health secretary, said: “Yet again Theresa May reveals how entirely out of touch she is. She will next be trying to lecture patients that ‘nothing has changed’ … Instead of burying her head in the sand … [May] needs to explain why she has allowed underfunding and cuts to health and social care to continue. As Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said this morning, the government needs to get a grip.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27397","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T00:00:14Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,397","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27397","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27397","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,397","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/jan/08/doing-social-care-differently","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T08:27:05Z","webTitle":"We need to talk about doing social care differently | Paul Burstow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/jan/08/doing-social-care-differently","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/jan/08/doing-social-care-differently","fields":{"headline":"We need to talk about doing social care differently","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A new year and a new minister will pick up the social care reform baton. But how far will they get before they pass it on or drop it? This year offers little prospect of short-term relief for the social care sector. I hope I am wrong, but the absence of any new funding in the November budget makes further cash unlikely. That means all eyes will be on the green paper and the 2018 budget to pave the way for a sustainable funding settlement. While 2017 saw greater public awareness of social care, there remains little understanding of the sector. Most people don’t know that social care is means tested or where it ends and the NHS begins. Before any funding reform can succeed, the veil of ignorance must be lifted. But funding for what? In 2018, the debate about social care must be more than a question of funding and who pays. Of course the money matters, the current offering from our state-subsidised system is limited, offers little innovation, compromises quality and is focused on task at the expense of relationships and connection. In 2018, we need to talk about doing care differently. A new report by Independent Age is clear that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. But, whatever the solutions, it should be less about what services are on offer and more about people having meaning and purpose in their lives. This shift of focus does not need new laws; the Care Act 2014 enshrined a new organising principle for adult social care: the promotion of individual wellbeing. The power of connection Let me introduce you to Andrew*, who is 66 and recently retired. Since his wife died two years ago, he has lost contact with his friends and started to drink excessively. Andrew was seeing his GP about his back pain. The GP asked him to see a link worker at the practice who used a social prescription to refer him to John, a local area coordinator. The GP also referred Andrew to a volunteer-led older men’s peer support network to help him reduce his alcohol use. Andrew discussed his goals with John and how he could work with others to achieve them. This led to him being introduced to Scott, a person with a disability who shares Andrew’s passion for the local football team and wants someone to go to matches with. Andrew started going out more and drinking less. On a cold winter’s day, Andrew slipped on some ice and broke his hip. He had a successful operation but worried he would struggle to get going again. Before being discharged from hospital, Andrew met a social care discharge coordinator to discuss his mobility, social and care needs on returning home. This reassured him that he would be able to get around his flat safely. He also met John to revisit his goals and how he was working with others to find support, which included getting daily help from a micro enterprise providing homecare, supported by Community Catalysts. Scott was also in touch, and met him on the day he got home, continuing to visit weekly. After six weeks, Andrew felt much recovered but still hadn’t been able to do much walking and was worried about becoming isolated from friends at the football club. Encouraged by John, he registered for a buddy walking group, who met him at his front door twice a week and walked him to a local cafe, which helped him build up his strength and was a chance to meet new people. At the heart of this story is an important truth that should inform the future of social care. Connectedness, purpose and reciprocity have been vital to Andrew’s recovery. One thing we must do as a society is encourage people to plan for their later lives. We can all bolster our resilience and stay in control and connected. That means ageing and the language around it can become more aspirational and empowering. And we must tackle ageism; although banned by acts of parliament, it remains rife in public discourse. We need to take a long view and government should create financial incentives for us all to be more literate and engaged about how we age. The Treasury orthodoxy that care is a deadweight cost must be challenged. Social care is an engine of economic growth; its value to our economy is significant and growing. It’s part of a policy debate about family life, economic growth and the sort of society we want to live in. Let’s hope that 2018 will see social care in the headlines for the right reasons; recognised for the vital contribution a functioning system can make to the quality of life for millions of citizens and to the prospects of a post-Brexit UK plc.

We’re also looking at misappropriated Shakespeare “quotes”. To join in you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. I knew that many people don’t vote. I should have asked why Guardian columnist Rafael Behr wrote about how he wished he asked more questions about why nonvoters came out to vote during the EU referendum, the Scottish independence referendum and Labour’s 2015 leadership contest. ‘Ignoring nonvoters was worse than lazy’ It was a thing we noticed early in the indy ref. People going round the doors and finding not the usual apathy but an interest in participating from people who had never voted before, often not on the register or not even knowing there was a register. So there’s two things: do people feel their vote will count? When they do, it seems they do want to vote. It was not indifference stopping them, it was thinking it pointless. But also, nobody had really asked why so many folk were never even registered. Every vote matters, because every voice does - and if votes are not sought, their voices are dismissed. People can end up feeling it is not just that their vote makes no difference, but that they themselves don’t matter. So Rafael is right that ignoring nonvoters was worse than lazy - it sent a powerful negative message, and campaigners learned a valuable lesson from the effort to counter it. Tenthred ‘I’m going via the wing’: fed-up Ryanair passenger takes the emergency exit Readers have been joining the discussion under the story about a passenger leaving through an emergency exit and sitting on the wing of the plane, after he became frustrated at having to wait. ‘Is the charge cheaper than sitting inside the plane?’ Anybody know what Ryanair charges for opening the over-wing emergency exit and sitting on the wing? Is it cheaper than sitting inside the plane? LemusLemus ‘Shnibble’, ‘gunzle’, ‘dolltalk’ – share your family’s invented words Author and literary critic, Caroline Baum, has written about the made-up words that bid families and friends together, with many readers sharing their own experiences below the line. ‘We use the word ‘woozle’ to mean sleepy/tired’ Our family uses “woozle” as a noun (as in, “Are you a woozle?” to a small child needing a snooze), as a verb (as in “I’m woozling off here, need to get to bed”), and as an adjective (as in, “Are you feeling woozly? Time for a nap?”). I think there must be some A A Milne behind it all somewhere. My son coined “sandy shrimp” for the kind you get in a basket in a pub, when he was four, and that has stuck too. Susanna Singer Alas, poor Owen Wilson, your TV ad Shakespeare quote is made up More linguistic invention of sorts next, as theatre critic Mark Fisher writes a blog on a Shakespeare quote used in a TV advert over Chistmas. He calls it “pure bunkum”. ‘I always thought the top misattribution was “O what a tangled web we weave”’ Well, that’s bizarrely confidence-shaking. I’m 60 years old, I have a BA in English and a Masters in Shakespeare Studies, and I’m now doing a PhD in early modern drama – and this is not only the first time I have ever heard that quote attributed to Shakespeare, but also the first time I have ever heard anyone say it at all. I always thought the top mis-attribution was “O what a tangled web we weave”, which at least sounds vaguely Midsummer-Night’s-Dream-ish. But “People are usually the happiest at home”? Not even on his very worst day. Holofernes That comment provoked this response: That’s where you’ve been going wrong. You’ve been studying what Shakespeare wrote, not what he didn’t write.

Confusion grows over traditional British passport colour","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s been a debate to rival that surrounding the famous white and gold or black and blue dress. Just what colour were the old British passports? Since the government announced their post-Brexit return, it has preferred to refer to them as an “iconic” navy blue. But on 30 December, the Home Office went as far as to issue a rebuttal to news stories criticising the colour of the new design. “The colour of the new passport will be returning to its previous navy blue,” the statement says. “The image alongside our announcement … is a mock-up produced for illustrative purposes before the final design is completed. The colour will be navy blue and the design embossed in gold.” The statement goes on to say: “Since its introduction in 1921, there have been a few variants of that navy blue colour but it has never been black, as some commentators have suggested.” However, all that effort has been undermined by the online application process for obtaining a British passport. The form asks applicants if they have previously held a British passport. Then they are asked to specify whether it was “a dark red passport” or “a black or blue passport”. Elsewhere on the gov.uk website, users are advised to “follow the process for getting a first adult passport if the last passport you had was an old black or blue passport”. The new passport design will replace the present one from 2019. The current burgundy colour is recommended, but not mandated, by EU rules. Croatia, for example, issues EU passports in blue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/04/sinne-eeg-dreams-review-stunt","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T18:45:02Z","webTitle":"Sinne Eeg: Dreams review – lustrous tones and alert improv from Danish star","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/04/sinne-eeg-dreams-review-stunt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/04/sinne-eeg-dreams-review-stunt","fields":{"headline":"Sinne Eeg: Dreams review – lustrous tones and alert improv from Danish star","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The news that Sinne Eeg is a much-admired jazz vocalist in Denmark might not grab many front pages, but the prizewinning 40-year-old is a genuine original and her stock is growing.

Eeg suggests an earthier Diana Krall in the deft timing of her bluesy ballad The Bitter End; glimpses Betty Carter in the surefooted scatting of Head Over High Heels; boldly presents her own title track as a wordless vocal against Colley’s rich pizzicato (followed by Christoffersen’s rolling, Jarrett-like groove), and sensitively avoids mawkishness in a wistful tribute to emotion-numbed orphans in Aleppo.

She stuck with it despite its very different premise and it has since become the pop sci-fi staple that cannot die. Unfortunately, the stereotypes associated with Trekkies persist: gross, mouth-breathing, socially inept dorks who, while aficionados of Star Wars and Marvel and video games have achieved mainstream acceptability, remain in the proverbial parental basement, perennially acne-ridden and laden with involuntary celibacy. Forgive me if I sound defensive, but Star Trek is something I’ve loved for years and while I recognise it’s “just a TV show”, it’s helped me get through a number of rough patches in my life. I don’t claim to be the biggest (or most knowledgable) expert in the world, but as a regular panel moderator at Trek conventions and host of Engage: The Official Star Trek Podcast, I’ve interacted with a great number of extremely passionate fans. So believe me when I say: #NotAllTrekkies. The vast majority of well-integrated-into-society fans who, sure, may know a few phrases in Klingon, are usually self-aware (and self-confident) enough to shrug off the “Get a life” epithets that were first hurled our way by (twist!) William Shatner himself on Saturday Night Live in 1986. Moreover, the Star Trek parody film Galaxy Quest is adored by most Trekkers, as its ribbing is gentle, its admiration for our enthusiasm is sincere and, importantly, the story of “real” Star Trek-like actors beamed up into an actual interplanetary adventure is gripping and hilarious. Most Trek parodies go over well, especially the references and in-jokes that Seth MacFarlane has incorporated into his work for years. MacFarlane’s bonafides were proven last year when he launched The Orville, a curious show that is, let’s face it, the most expensive fan film ever made. The best way to describe The Orville is to picture Seth and his buddies watching an old The Next Generation episode while getting high on a couch, and not just shouting jokes but somehow entering the show, man! That sort of strangeness is what drives the plot of the just-released Black Mirror episode USS Callister. And trust Black Mirror to take a typical Star Trek homage and make it dark. I should say that as an episode of television (or short feature, or whatever you want to call 74 minutes of well-produced, mid-budget entertainment distributed via Netflix), USS Callister is quite good. The performances are captivating, the premise is sharp, the twists are good and, as with most of Black Mirror, there is a disquieting effect that comes from gazing directly at such bleak, dark human impulses. The problem is that it pins its hideousness on a defective, angry Trekkie. At first he seems sweet and shy, but beneath the facade he is worse than the monster from Room. Jesse Plemons is the co-owner at a software company that has designed a futuristic, immersive VR multiplayer game. He’s the egghead engineer, and his slick, bullying partner (Jimmi Simpson) is the face of the operation. His day at the office is a barrage of slights and disses, and we initially feel quite sorry for him. But the joke is on us. When he goes home each night he plugs into a personalised version of the game and (just like Lieutenant Reg Barclay in the The Next Generation episode Hollow Pursuits) his co-workers all adore him in a simulated environment. And that simulated environment is a just-this-side-of-legal-fair-use replica of Star Trek. The twist is that “Space Fleet” is not a simulated environment. Plemons’ “Captain Daley” takes DNA from the co-workers who have wronged him (which, we’ll learn, can sometimes be women who just got noticeably creeped out by his staring) and he uploads a digital clone into the sealed game matrix. They are real and there (or at least feel that they are), and Daley, quite aware of his new forced playmates’ anger and fear, is brutal and cruel. Props to writers Charlie Brooker and William Bridges for knowing their deep lore Trek – this goes beyond photon torpedoes and warp drive. When Daley brings the new girl (Cristin Milioti) to the ship, he punishes her by “removing her face” just like the powerful man-baby Charlie Evans did in Charlie X (season one, episode seven.) But the suggestion that inside every Trekkie lurks a closet sadist is just a little bit insulting. The episode’s twist pulls the rug out from “sympathy for the dweeb,”, becoming instead a showcase of very toxic online male behaviour – what if the omnipotent imp Trelane from The Squire of Gothos (season 1, episode 17) were a gamer? While I personally don’t know one end of a joystick from the other (do they still use joysticks?) I recognise that multiplayer chatter can notoriously be cesspool. However, I also know that the vast majority of players are just normal people engaged in a harmless leisure activity and not harassers and trolls. Further, Daley is shown as a complete sexual novice. When his co-workers “re-appear” in the simulation, their sex organs are smoothed over, as with an action figure. This is maybe just a joke about obsessive nerds and their dolls, but it’s also a further dig at perceived Trekkie social ineptitude. All this said, it’s still pretty amazing that this 50-year-old show (which has an amazing new iteration you should be watching) continues to get used as a trope. Black Mirror’s version of the costumes, sound effects and flickering panels are really top notch. And when I eventually get to live out my dreams of being Captain of a Federation starship, I can assure you I won’t be such an ass about it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/04/habibi-funk-007-an-eclectic-selection-of-music-from-the-arab-world-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"Habibi Funk 007: An Eclectic Selection of Music from the Arab World review – pleasingly odd","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/04/habibi-funk-007-an-eclectic-selection-of-music-from-the-arab-world-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/04/habibi-funk-007-an-eclectic-selection-of-music-from-the-arab-world-review","fields":{"headline":"Habibi Funk 007: An Eclectic Selection of Music from the Arab World review – pleasingly odd","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Those drawn to world music often seek the exotic and the alien, but Jannis Stürz, the German crate-digger behind the Habibi Funk label, seems to explore the vinyl troves of the Arab world in search of the familiar.

But if there’s one way to maintain the illusion that the holiday isn’t quite over, the Winter Sprinter is it. As it has almost every January since 2000, this bleak-midwinter festival presents a dozen bands of varying shades of semi-fame. Currently overseen by Fika Recordings, after lengthy stewardships by the Track and Field and Fortuna Pop! labels, it’s an escape hatch for people intrigued by the news that members of the Wave Pictures and Slow Club have combined to form tonight’s headliners, the Surfing Magazines. Fans of the wry and rueful: this is your natural home. Tonight’s lineup is all-male and guitar-based, though within that framework, each act offers something different. Opening trio Jessica’s Brother’s shambling nerdcore is clearly a passion project intended to please only themselves. Good for them. Vocalist Tom Charleston and drummer Jonny Helm bicker about whether Charleston’s guitar is in tune; Charleston defiantly croons, “I’m just a lazy singer.” Their pivotal number Polstead Instead, loosely based on the 1976 Jonathan Richman track New England, is a jingling rush that would have headed John Peel’s Festive 50 in another life. Former Weather Prophet Pete Astor has brought his own audience, whose battered-but-still-standing appreciation mirrors his. His patch is literate melancholy filtered through wispy vocal cords, and he has the years and the authority to do it justice.

Staff at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) park confirmed the birth after hearing distinct high-pitched sounds from Victoria’s maternity unit, which remains closed to visitors to ensure privacy. The news of the birth comes 24 hours after a polar bear cub at a Berlin zoo died aged 26 days, and the RZSS admitted that the first three months would be perilous for the newborn polar bear. Una Richardson, the park’s head keeper responsible for carnivores, said: “While we are absolutely thrilled, we are not celebrating prematurely as polar bear cubs have a high mortality rate in the first weeks of life due to their undeveloped immune system and the mother’s exaggerated need for privacy, with any disturbance risking the cub being killed or abandoned.” New-born polar bear cubs are blind and weigh little more than a guinea pig. They only open their eyes when they are a month old and are entirely dependent on their mother, feeding on fat-rich milk to grow quickly, weighing about 10-12kg by the time they leave their den. The cub may yet turn out to be twins because Victoria dislodged a video camera in the den and so keepers are relying on external audio equipment to detect signs of life. The cub’s first cries were heard on 18 December but the park does not expect it to leave the den and appear in public until late February or March, depending on the caution of its mother. The keepers are taking a radically “hands-off” approach to minimise disturbance for mother and cub, only visiting the enclosure to check the water outside the den is not frozen. Mimicking conditions in the wild, the keepers fed Victoria so she increased her weight from 290kg to in excess of 470kgs in the autumn before stopping her food in late October. In the wild, polar bears can live off their fat reserves for six months and Victoria will next be offered food – in the form of several carrots – at the end of this month. If it survives, the cub is likely to trigger a visitor boom for the Highland Wildlife Park. When London Zoo unveiled its first captive-born polar bear cub in 1949, visitor numbers increased from 1.1 million to more than three million the following year. Knut, the orphaned polar bear cub rescued from his mother by keepers at Berlin Zoo, became a global sensation in 2007, generating between €5m and €10m from visitors and merchandise. But Knut was said to have become addicted to having an audience, had to be separated from his keeper and died prematurely, aged four, of a rare autoimmune disorder known as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at RZSS Highland Wildlife Park said the park would be very wary of intervening in any way if Victoria was struggling to rear her cub. “We would certainly prefer not to hand-rear because they are so bright that we can end up with a cub that’s not the most balanced individual and thinks it’s a little furry human as opposed to a polar bear,” he said. Richardson said he was confident there would be no repeat of “Knut mania” with thousands of visitors in potentially stressful close proximity to the young cub when it emerges in the spring. “The enclosure that the female and cub have access to is by anyone’s standards enormous. The public are only at one end of it. Even if the viewing area was jam-packed with visitors the bears have a huge amount of space where they can step back from visitors.” Of the criticism that it is cruel to keep such a large and intelligent animal in captivity, Douglas Richardson said: “The way polar bears were kept in the 1980s was not appropriate – we were dealing with big, intelligent animals in barren, hard environments. We’ve changed it dramatically.” The animals have grassy, tundra-like conditions rather than the concrete pens of old. Douglas Richardson added: “There’s a lengthening list of species where we are thankful we had a robust captive population so we’re able to augment a fragile wild population. I’m not saying that genetically augmenting the polar bear wild population will be an easy or even possible option but if we don’t have a robust captive population we will not have that option.” The Born Free Foundation said that British zoos should not be breeding polar bears but only providing sanctuary for captive bears rescued from cruel conditions in zoos overseas. According to the charity, captive polar bears display very high levels of abnormal behaviour and infant mortality. Will Travers of the Born Free Foundation said: “This isn’t going to make an iota of difference for the 24,000 polar bears in the wild. The more time and effort we spend on this, the less time and effort we spend on putting these things right by doing something about climate change. “There’s something really quite sad that we are using words like ‘living collections’. Are we a magpie species that collects exotic wildlife from four corners of the planet and puts it on postage stamp-sized pieces of land and goes and looks at it? It’s not the 21st century I want to be part of.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/03/iranians-counter-protests-week-unrest","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T12:47:53Z","webTitle":"Thousands of Iranians join counter-protests after week of unrest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/03/iranians-counter-protests-week-unrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/03/iranians-counter-protests-week-unrest","fields":{"headline":"Thousands of Iranians join counter-protests after week of unrest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thousands of pro-government counter-protesters have taken to the streets of Iranian cities after nearly a week of unrest. Footage broadcast on national television and images published by state news agencies showed a high turnout in pro-establishment rallies, in cities that have seen turbulent scenes since Iran’s biggest demonstrations in nearly a decade began on 28 December. State television aired a rally from Ahwaz, the capital of Khouzesan province, which showed thousands of people marching on a long bridge connecting two parts of the city, while holding up pro-regime placards and chanting in support of the establishment. It broadcast similar footage from Ilam, also in the west of the country, as well as from Arak, in the centre of Iran. The semi-official Fars news agency, affiliated to the elite Revolutionary Guards, forces involved in the crackdown on protesters, described the rallies as “the revolutionary outburst of Iranian people against lawbreakers”. The commander of the Revolutionary Guards said on Wednesday it had deployed forces to three provinces - Isfahan, Lorestan and Hamadan, where most of the casualties have occurred - but claimed the anti-government protests were over. “Today we can announce the end of the sedition,” said Mohammad Ali Jafari. “A large number of the trouble-makers ... have been arrested and there will be firm action against them.” During violent clashes between protesters and the security guards, in a week of demonstrations that has seen both sides becoming increasingly confrontational, at least 21 people have lost their lives – mostly protesters but also some security guards, according to officials. Iranian authorities have claimed that the protests, which began over economic grievances before taking a political turn, have been hijacked by the country’s foreign enemies. The theory has also been repeated by some figures within the reformist camp, who are critical of Iran’s rulers but wary of regime change. Anti-government protests continued for a sixth consecutive day in provincial cities on Tuesday evening, whilst Tehran was relatively calmer, with a heavy presence of riot police. Mohammad, a protester from Karaj, a city just west of the capital Tehran, told the Guardian that the protesters had clashed with the security guards in its Gohardasht neighbourhood on Tuesday evening. “A lot of basij militia used electric shockers to confront protesters, and arrest them – I saw them filling at least six buses full of those detained,” he said. The protester claimed the security guards also damaged public properties to find a pretext to step up their crackdown. This could not be independently verified – the authorities have made similar accusations against protesters. “People are fed up with unemployment and being poor. There is no job security,” he added. “The protesters don’t have a leader, it’s a leaderless movement, and I call it the movement of the hungry, the starved people.” Milad, from Shahinshahr, a city in the province of Isfahan, which has seen violent clashes in recent days, said people were unhappy with the way the city was run. “There’s a deficit in the city’s budget because of mismanagement and the authorities have instead cut down public salaries,” he said. It is not possible to compare the size of the crowds at the anti-government protests with the counter-demonstrations approved by Tehran. No independent journalists are permitted to film the anti-government protests, while Iranian authorities have on similar occasions bussed in supporters.Major European countries have resisted pressure from the US president, Donald Trump, to sign a joint statement condemning the Islamic Republic, but have instead issued separate statements warning the Iranian government to allow peaceful protests and not resort to mass arrests. Iran’s mission to the UN has accused the US ambassador, Nikki Haley, of shedding “crocodile tears” for the Iranian people. EU states are concerned that Trump is trying to use the demonstrations as a vehicle to place further pressure on the EU to abandon its support for the Iran nuclear deal signed by Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama in 2015. The EU remains convinced Iran is complying with the terms of the nuclear deal, but continued US-imposed sanctions, mainly on banks, are making it hard for Iran to gain the expected economic benefits from the deal. Trump is eager to see the deal abandoned, and sees the protests as a means of resisting what Washington sees as Iranian expansionism in the Middle East. Trump on Wednesday pledged support for Iranians trying to “take back” their government. “You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!” he said, without offering any specifics on what or when that might be. Nevertheless, faced by reports that more than 400 protesters have been arrested, European leaders have become more vocal in their criticisms. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, on Tuesday and called for restraint, his office said. Macron also decided to postpone this week’s planned visit to Tehran by the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, which was intended as a precursor to a visit by Macron himself. Macron’s office said the French leader underscored that “fundamental rights including freedom of expression and freedom to demonstrate must be respected”. Rouhani in turn asked Macron to take action against a Paris-based Iranian opposition group called the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (the People’s Mujahideen Organisation of Iran, PMOI), which he accused of fomenting the recent protests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/jan/04/nhs-under-threat-new-model-of-care","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T12:34:09Z","webTitle":"The NHS is under threat.

Only a new model of care will save it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The NHS will celebrate its 70th birthday this year. Last month, Jeremy Hunt credited the Tory party for its formation. History tells a different story. The National Health Service was introduced in 1948 by Clement Attlee’s Labour government. The Conservatives consistently voted against it. Before 1948, the have-nots feared ill health. Not for the reasons you or I fear it, but because they had no means to pay for treatment. Harry Leslie Smith has educated us all on how the fear of ill health gripped the poor before the creation of the NHS. The creation of a universal healthcare system, free at the point of use, was Britain’s greatest post-war achievement. But the NHS made an error from the start: building services around treatment rather than prevention. We see the ramifications of this today. By seeking to treat ill health rather than tackling its causes, successive politicians have lost sight of the path to securing an affordable NHS. Today, soaring levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes have strained the treatment model to breaking point. Moreover, too much unnecessary surgery and prescriptions of statins and antidepressants, for example, place avoidable strain on the service. Quick fixes are prioritised over the promotion of light exercise or a clampdown on junk food corporations. Poor town planning, weak infrastructure and poor quality housing fuel health problems that ultimately cost the NHS billions that it does not have. Last year turned out to be the annus horribilis I predicted. There was a continuation of the poor strategic thinking that has dogged the NHS since 1980. Rising inflation rendered any extra money pledged by Phillip Hammond as futile, and NHS managers needed funding commitments earlier in the year so they could plan for this winter. But it came too little and late to make much difference. Thus, we are set for a repeat of what the Red Cross last year called a “humanitarian crisis”. The NHS has entered the worst winter crisis of its 70-year history. A shortage of doctors, nurses, beds and care packages for elderly patients means that black alerts, trolleys in corridors and dangerous safety levels for patients are at a peak. NHS England has cancelled tens of thousands of hospital operations, which will create the biggest backlog in the health service’s history. A&amp;E services are in a permanent state of chaos. What was once confined to winter is now an all-year-round occurrence. Despite Hunt’s boasts, mental health services are still woefully underfunded. The closure of more than 4,000 mental health beds since 2010, and a similar reduction in the number of psychiatric nurses, have not been reversed. Hunt has yet to match his words with deeds. GP services are also in a perilous state. A pledge to train more doctors in 2017 will not yield dividends in this parliament. GP vacancy rates and rural practice closures remain high. GPs spend taxpayers’ cash more efficiently than any other part of our NHS; more investment in the training of GPs and cash for surgeries would reduce pressure on the acute sector. Social care services are in a state of paralysis. The £2bn pledged in the budget to reverse £5bn of cuts to social care funding is nothing more than a sticking plaster. The funds will do nothing to alleviate pressure on GP services and A&amp;E departments. For now, we rely on the heroic efforts of six million unpaid carers to maintain a flailing social care system. The fear of getting ill that gripped Britain in the past has returned. The principle of a universal healthcare system free at the point of use is broken. This government has ushered in a creeping reduction of universality, through the demonisation of ill people and the incremental rationing of care. Denying surgery to those who smoke or are obese is the thin end of the wedge; hip, knee and cataract surgery are all increasingly rationed and, in April, the NHS launched a consultation to end the provision of painkillers and basic vaccines. This would see a return to the pre-1948 system. The NHS must move from a treatment model of care to one of prevention. Decisions made at the health service’s inception created the problems we see today. Social care was never integrated with the NHS, and domiciliary care has always been left to a mixture of private companies and local councils. The NHS’s unique strength has always been that its large purchasing power and economy of scale make it more economically efficient than its international comparisons. But a lack of joined-up thinking fails to make the link between people aged over 75 presenting at A&amp;E departments and cuts to social care funding. Our political discourse has not helped. Pressurising councils to freeze council tax at the height of austerity has compounded problems. And how can Hunt’s performance in 2017 be rated? All the key indicators within the NHS worsened, with waiting lists reaching 10-year highs. Hunt’s continued refusal to embrace prevention as the care model of the future is lamentable. History will record that he oversaw a massive increase in NHS cash being handed to non-NHS providers. Billions of pounds of health service funding have passed to non-NHS providers under the Tories. That sum will continue to grow. We must prepare for another tough year for the NHS. Expect more lawsuits from private healthcare providers when they lose out on juicy contracts. Expect more uncertainty as the government equivocates on the importance of overseas healthcare professionals. Expect more privatisation, rationing and cuts to our health system. As long as Hunt remains in charge, expect warm words but little else. Our NHS needs a new model of healthcare. It needs proper transparency and accountability. If politicians are to remain involved at the heart of the NHS, then it should be to ensure it gets the funding it needs, not to ready it for an insurance-based system.

The IHS/Markit construction PMI saw a slowdown in growth for the first time since September. All eyes will now be on the UK services figures due out on Thursday to get a clear snapshot of how the country’s economy performed in the final month of 2017. Earlier there was positive news from Germany, with the jobless rate at a record low of 5.5%. Better than expected Christmas trading from Next lifted the retailers’ shares and gave investors hope for the whole sector’s festive performance. But the rise in Next shares was not enough to lift the UK market out of the post-holiday doldrums, with the FTSE 100 slipping back and forth from postive to negative. The index is currently up 0.13% but European markets have turned in a better performance and Wall Street has opened higher. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. The record breaking run on Wall Street continues, at least as far as the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are concerned. The S&amp;P is up 0.11% and Nasdaq 0.15% better at the open, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.02% higher in early trading. The pattern of a rise in European markets and a slight dip in the FTSE 100 continues. Markets appear to have shrugged off any worries about the new regulatory regime - Mifid II - which comes into effect today. Mike van Dulken and Henry Croft at Accendo Markets said: Global equities are generally positive as investors calmly digest the impact of the vast MiFID II regulation taking effect across the globe, while trading volumes gradually return following the New Year. German stocks are outperforming as the US dollar rebounds from its lows, denting Euro strength to aid the region’s exporting names, while the flat FTSE 100 comes as a result of GBP/USD weakness offsetting GBP/EUR strength. Reuters has a report on the new rules: The rollout of new rules on Wednesday that aim to make European Union financial markets safer and more transparent has been glitch-free so far, though disruptions cannot be ruled out, the EU’s markets watchdog said. The new regime shines a spotlight on the inner workings of stock, bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to provide detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions. Big banks spent an estimated $2 billion collectively last year to upgrade IT systems to prepare. “What we can see for our part, is no glitches so far,” Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), told reporters. “It will be the first time we have a complete overview of all financial instruments in the EU.” European stock and bond volumes were light in early trading. “So far [there is] no difference compared to a regular day,” said Markus Huber, a trader at City of London Markets. “Volume isn’t expected to be massive or back to normal either due to not everybody being back from holidays, and not much going on in regard to major news or economic data.” ...The new rules, known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), were delayed by a year to give banks, asset managers and exchanges more time to get ready... Market nerves were eased by ESMA announcing measures just before Christmas to give companies more time to comply with some key requirements. Oil is edging higher again, helped by the output caps from Opec and Russia and concerns about the protests in Iran. Brent crude is currently up 0.63% to $66.99 a barrel, having earlier climbed as high as $67.08. Here’s our story on the UK construction figures, from Richard Partington: Britain’s construction industry is its least optimistic for five years amid fears over Brexit and an economic slowdown, according to a survey. Despite some pockets of strength as building firms won the most work for several months in December, the balance of companies expecting a rise in output levels over the next 12 months was the weakest recorded since mid-2013, according to the Markit/Cips UK construction PMI. The gauge of sentiment among executives at 170 construction firms fell to 52.2 in December from 53.1 in November – worse than forecast by City economists – although still remained above the 50 level indicating expansion. The dip in the PMI reflected falling volumes of commercial work, offset by growing numbers of housebuilding projects. The prospect of greater workloads led firms to take on staff and buy materials at the fastest pace in two years over December. Strength in the housebuilding sector is likely to please government ministers trying to fix the country’s housing crisis, after the Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year in the budget. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, also ploughed an additional £10bn into the help-to-buy loan scheme and cut stamp duty for most first-time buyers. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said support from the government “should keep housebuilding motoring along” in 2018, although warned construction output overall was likely to flatline. The full report is here: And here’s more from IHS Markit’s economist on the construction data: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A construction sector slip did little for either the FTSE or pound this Wednesday morning. Like Tuesday’s manufacturing figure, the most recent construction PMI fell short of expectations, coming in at 52.2 against the 52.8 forecast and the 53.1 seen in November. While neither of December’s PMIs have been disastrous, there’s nevertheless a slight whiff of disappointment that the robust levels seen in November couldn’t last a bit longer. All this helped edge cable into the red, though even with a 0.2% decline the pound is still circling a 3 and a half month high against the dollar; against the euro it fared better, rising 0.1% as its rival gave back some of its recent growth (the euro’s also down 0.3% against the greenback). The FTSE, meanwhile, strained to keep the right side of the red/green divide, the index struggling to shake its sluggish start to 2018 despite the newfound – if fragile – sense of optimism in the retail sector following Next’s surprisingly solid Christmas figures. As for the Eurozone indices, with the euro taking a breather from the vertiginous climb seen in the last few weeks the DAX and CAC attempted to right yesterday’s wrongs. Both the German and French indices rose 0.6%, allowing them to cross 12900 and 5300 respectively. The pound is holding up fairly well despite the weaker than expected UK construction data, with sterling down 0.18% against the dollar at $1.3562. But with underwhelming manufacturing figures on Tuesday following by these construction numbers, all eyes will be on the service sector data on Thursday for more insight into how the UK economy ended the year. William Anderson Jones, head of UK corporate dealing at RationalFX, said: Despite forecasts expecting an unchanged figure of 53.1, Construction PMI underwhelmed analysts after falling to 52.2 on the back of weaker housebuilding and a decline in commercial building. The pound was holding near yesterday’s highs against a weak dollar in the early hours of trading this morning as investors awaited the data, but the currency appears to have been able to shrug off the weak figures. Following yesterday’s unexpected dip in Manufacturing PMI and today’s weaker Construction data, investors will be looking for signs to help strengthen confidence in the UK’s economic outlook. As one of the strongest indicators of the health of the economy at the end of last year, analysts will be directing their attention to the release of Services PMI later this week. The markets could see a more notable reaction from sterling depending on the strength or weakness of the services sector, and following less than promising signs from data released so far, investors may be bracing themselves for some volatility should figures point to Brexit-based pressure on the economy ahead of a crucial year for negotiations. Back with the construction PMIs, Balraj Sroya, sales trader at Foenix Partners, said: After a subpar PMI figure from the manufacturing industry yesterday that slipped from four-year highs, today’s construction PMI print followed suit, missing forecasts coming out at 52.2. While both sets of PMIs were above the crucial 50 level showing expansion in the sector, there was still doubt that stellar figures would be reached once again. Today’s figure is weighed down by the moderate downturn in commercial projects combined with stagnated expansion in the home building sector. However, investors are still forecasting an increase in construction activity throughout 2018, which fuels views that the UK economy saw an unexpected slowdown at the end of 2017 and is expected to get back on track shortly. Tomorrow services PMI is being released, which is the largest sector in the UK and investors along with the Bank of England will be looking closely to see if this is a turning point for the UK economy and whether or not 2018 will be as prosperous as many think. The FTSE 100 has drifted lower after its initial gains thanks to UK retailers, and is now off 0.01%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE has continued to flounder on the second trading day of 2018, even though the US, Asian, and mainland European markets have pushed higher. The disappointing UK construction PMI forms the second disappointing UK PMI survey is as many days, with the pound drifting marginally lower as a result. Unfortunately, the weaker pound has done little to help the FTSE, which has been dragged lower thanks to yet another poor showing from the miners thanks to ripples in the recent gold and copper resurgence story. The UK services PMI reading is due on Thursday morning, and a third disappointing survey would provide yet another reason to sell the pound. More reaction to the UK construction data. Here is Investec’s chief economist Philip Shaw: Max Jones, Global Corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: A downbeat PMI in December capped off a difficult year for construction firms. The great unknown is what this year holds and how the economy will react to the next phase of the Brexit negotiations. In the second half of last year, many construction businesses focused on shoring up their balance sheets, putting them in the best possible position to invest and ride out any turbulence. Looking ahead, there are several trends we expect to see play out in 2018, some a continuation of developments in recent years. Some firms will invest in tech and automation, helping a sector that is still quite old-fashioned to transition to a more productive future. Meanwhile, contractors will continue to focus on developing specialisms with an increasing reliance on fewer, bigger-spending clients in key sub-sectors. Another expectation is that we will see businesses make smaller, targeted acquisitions to fill in gaps in their expertise. But it is unlikely that a mega-merger is on the cards because of the inherent risk in combining balance sheets and order books. Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit and author of the IHS Markit/CIPS Construction PMI said: The UK construction sector achieved a moderate expansion of business activity at the end of 2017, although the recovery remained uneven and slowed overall since November. Construction companies indicated that another strong contribution from house building helped to offset subdued civil engineering activity and reduced volumes of commercial work. Total new orders picked up at the fastest pace for seven months in December, which provides a positive signal for construction workloads in the short-term. Resilient demand and forthcoming project starts also led to greater job creation and the strongest increase in input buying for two years. However, construction firms indicated that longer- term business confidence is still relatively subdued, largely reflecting concerns about the domestic economic outlook. Exactly 37% of the survey panel forecast a rise in construction activity over the course of 2018, while around 11% anticipate a reduction. As a result, the balance of UK construction companies expecting growth in the year ahead remains among the weakest recorded by the survey since mid-2013. Here’s IHS Markit’s chief business economist: Growth in Britain’s construction sector slowed down last month after forecasts of an unchanged figure. The December construction PMI came in at 52.2, down from a five month high of 53.1 and the first slowdown since September. Weaker growth in housebuilding and a fall in commercial building combined with slower infrastructure work to bring about the decline. But the new orders index rose from 52.9 in November to 53.1, according to IHS Markit, the highest since May 2017. Germany’s unemployment figures have beaten analysts’ forecasts. The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 29,000 to 2.44m, compared to estimates of a 12,000 decrease. The jobless rate was unchanged at 5.5% after November’s reading was revised down from 5.6%. Here is our report on the Next figures. Sarah Butler writes: Next has raised hopes for the retail sector by revealing a better than expected Christmas, with strong online sales offsetting a fall at its high street stores. In a trading statement, the clothing and home chain said sales rose 1.5% in the 54 days to 24 December. A fall of 0.3% had been forecast. Shares in Next, the first major retailer to report on festive trading, jumped almost 10% in early trading. Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark-owner Associated British Foods were also up, rising about 3%, on hopes that they may also have fared better than expected. The retailer upgraded its profit expectations for the year to January by £8m, to £725m, after sales benefited from the colder weather in the run up to Christmas. Profit guidance is now between £718m and £732m and performance will depend on the clearance sales in January. Next said that all its growth came online, where sales rose 13.6%. The chain’s high street stores suffered a 6.1% slump. That pattern is expected to be repeated across the retail sector as companies including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams, John Lewis and House of Fraser next week reveal how they fared over the most important part of the trading year. The full story is here: Now for a quick look at our favourite cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is currently up nearly 3% at $15,083, continuing its New Year rebound. Naeem Aslam at Thinkmarkets said: Bitcoin has bounced back up after a Wall Street Journal report showed that a venture firm (which has a track record on betting on big firms like Airbnb and SpaceX) has been accumulating bitcoin and the fund may be holding approximately $20million worth of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has crossed above the 15K mark, an important resistance level broken, and this opens the floor for Bitcoin to move towards the 20K mark (as long as it stays above 15K). Helped by Next’s better than expected Christmas update, the FTSE 100 has opened higher, while European markets are also making a positive start. Next is up nearly 10%, while Primark owner Associated British Foods and Marks and Spencer are both around 3% better. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.11% while Germany’s Dax has opened 0.4% higher ahead of the country’s employment data and France’s Cac has climbed 0.2%. Here’s Alistair Davies of Investec on Next: Expect some share price relief that Christmas wasn’t as bad as expected and no further downgrades. However, we would caution against reading too much across to other retail stocks – the reality is that even though Next’s Christmas numbers are better than expected, the company has still had a tough Christmas. More on Next. The retailer has raised its full year profit forecast for 2018 after better than expected sales in the run-up to Christmas, with cold weather boosting demand for winter clothing. It now expects full year profits of £725m, up from its previous guidance of £717m but below the £790m it made the previous year. And it did warn of continuing challenges, not least from subdued consumer demand thanks to the squeeze on real incomes. The company’s shares are expected to open higher after the update. But analysts at Beaufort Securities were unimpressed, issuing a sell note following the update and pointing out a profit downgrade for 2019: Next is an interesting beast, very cash generative, decent balance sheet (net debt of circa £950m), growing on line sales but declining sales in its shops. This morning’s sales news is positive although nothing like a reversal of Next’s long term high street decline. And the outlook statement is less positive, with FY19 profit guidance of £705m (down 3% on FY18 to Jan) and free cash (for divis and share buybacks) of £525m versus a market cap of £6.57bn. Here are the opening calls for European markets from IG: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After Tuesday’s unspectacular UK manufacturing data - Britain’s factories saw a slowdown in December but the performance was described as “solid” - comes the latest snapshot of the country’s construction industry. Analysts are expecting an unchanged figure from November’s 53.1. Also coming up are German unemployment figures which are forecast to show an improvement from November. Elsewhere the oil price has slipped back after the Iran protests pushed Brent to a peak of $67 a barrel on Tuesday, its highest level since May 2015. And European markets are expected to open higher in the main after Wall Street hit new records, although the FTSE 100 is forecast to be fairly flat. The strength of the pound against the dollar is likely to undermine the leading UK index, packed as it is with overseas earners who benefit from a weaker sterling. There are also some positive trading figures from Next for the Christmas period, the first indicator of how the high street performed over the festive period.

Bannon, speaking to author Michael Wolff, warned that the investigation into alleged collusion with the Kremlin will focus on money laundering and predicted: “They’re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.” Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, reportedly based on more than 200 interviews with the president, his inner circle and players in and around the administration, is one of the most eagerly awaited political books of the year. In it, Wolff lifts the lid on a White House lurching from crisis to crisis amid internecine warfare, with even some of Trump’s closest allies expressing contempt for him. Bannon, who was chief executive of the Trump campaign in its final three months, then White House chief strategist for seven months before returning to the rightwing Breitbart News, is a central figure in the nasty, cutthroat drama, quoted extensively, often in salty language. He is particularly scathing about a June 2016 meeting involving Trump’s son Donald Jr, son-in-law Jared Kushner, then campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York. A trusted intermediary had promised documents that would “incriminate” rival Hillary Clinton but instead of alerting the FBI to a potential assault on American democracy by a foreign power, Trump Jr replied in an email: “I love it.” The meeting was revealed by the New York Times in July last year, prompting Trump Jr to say no consequential material was produced. Soon after, Wolff writes, Bannon remarked mockingly: “The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor – with no lawyers. They didn’t have any lawyers. “Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.” Bannon went on, Wolff writes, to say that if any such meeting had to take place, it should have been set up “in a Holiday Inn in Manchester, New Hampshire, with your lawyers who meet with these people”. Any information, he said, could then be “dump[ed] … down to Breitbart or something like that, or maybe some other more legitimate publication”. Bannon added: “You never see it, you never know it, because you don’t need to … But that’s the brain trust that they had.” Bannon also speculated that Trump Jr had involved his father in the meeting. “The chance that Don Jr did not walk these jumos up to his father’s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero.” Special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed last May, following Trump’s dismissal of FBI director James Comey, to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election. This has led to the indictments of four members of Trump’s inner circle, including Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges; Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. In recent weeks Bannon’s Breitbart News and other conservative outlets have accused Mueller’s team of bias against the president. Trump predicted in an interview with the New York Times last week that the special counsel was “going to be fair”, though he also said the investigation “makes the country look very bad”. The president and his allies deny any collusion with Russia and the Kremlin has denied interfering. Bannon has criticised Trump’s decision to fire Comey. In Wolff’s book, obtained by the Guardian ahead of publication from a bookseller in New England, he suggests White House hopes for a quick end to the Mueller investigation are gravely misplaced. “You realise where this is going,” he is quoted as saying. “This is all about money laundering. Mueller chose [senior prosecutor Andrew] Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy. Their path to fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr and Jared Kushner … It’s as plain as a hair on your face.” Last month it was reported that federal prosecutors had subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, the German financial institution that has lent hundreds of millions of dollars to the Kushner property empire. Bannon continues: “It goes through Deutsche Bank and all the Kushner shit. The Kushner shit is greasy. They’re going to go right through that. They’re going to roll those two guys up and say play me or trade me.” Scorning apparent White House insouciance, Bannon reaches for a hurricane metaphor: “They’re sitting on a beach trying to stop a Category Five.” He insists that he knows no Russians, will not be a witness, will not hire a lawyer and will not appear on national television answering questions. Fire and Fury will be published next week. Wolff is a prominent media critic and columnist who has written for the Guardian and is a biographer of Rupert Murdoch. He previously conducted interviews for the Hollywood Reporter with Trump in June 2016 and Bannon a few months later. He told the Guardian in November that to research the book, he showed up at the White House with no agenda but wanting to “find out what the insiders were really thinking and feeling”. He enjoyed extraordinary access to Trump and senior officials and advisers, he said, sometimes at critical moments of the fledgling presidency. The rancour between Bannon and “Javanka” – Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump – is a recurring theme of the book. Kushner and Ivanka are Jewish. Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, is quoted as saying: “It is a war between the Jews and the non-Jews.” Trump is not spared. Wolff writes that Thomas Barrack Jr, a billionaire who is one of the president’s oldest associates, allegedly told a friend: “He’s not only crazy, he’s stupid.” Barrack denied that to the New York Times."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/05/we-must-reverse-the-outcome-oriented-educational-monster-we-have-unleashed","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T18:00:02Z","webTitle":"We must reverse the ‘outcome oriented’ educational monster we have unleashed | Cathy Davidson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/we-must-reverse-the-outcome-oriented-educational-monster-we-have-unleashed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/we-must-reverse-the-outcome-oriented-educational-monster-we-have-unleashed","fields":{"headline":"We must reverse the ‘outcome oriented’ educational monster we have unleashed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We are in the midst of a serious epidemic of scapegoating our youth. Enter the search term “millennial” and one is presented with a flood of punditry that diagnoses college students as “excellent sheep” who are so gobsmacked by Google and so “spoon-fed” by doting parents that they can no longer cope with difficulty or perform complex mental operations. I disagree. With over three decades as a college professor, I believe it’s time educators proposed a more accurate pathology of the problems facing youth today and offered a better cure. First, let’s reconsider who these supposedly coddled students really are. When I ask beginning students when they first realised they were creatures of history, not simply independent actors, they routinely name the 2008 global financial crisis. They would have been 10 or 12 when the world’s leaders appeared on their TV screen to deliver the unprecedented message that the fortunes of corporations, nations, and individuals had vanished overnight. Fast forward to the present and the United Nation’s International Labour Organization (ILO) warning that some 75% of the world’s workers are now employed in temporary, contingent jobs or in unpaid family jobs. Millennials and their younger siblings know difficulty. They were reared on it. No college generation in recent times has faced greater global challenges or an educational system more in need of redesign to prepare them for these challenges. Because of an irresponsible older generation’s abdication of support for higher education as a public good, students in many countries today pay higher tuition and leave with greater debt than ever before. No generation since the second world war has had to face more real and present danger from resurgent fascism, the possibility of nuclear holocaust, or environmental collapse, compounded by powerful leaders determined to deny these realities. Students are warned that the “robots are coming” but offered an educational system that seems designed not to combat the robots but to turn students into poor facsimiles of them. Increasingly, we are shrinking educational opportunities for our youth worldwide, robbing them of the creativity of the arts, the critical thinking of the humanities and social sciences, and reducing all knowledge to test scores, despite repeated workforce studies stressing the importance of deep learning. The trend is to use standardised tests as the entrance to university and therefore to a middle-class future, even though we have ample research, extending back to the Hermann Ebbinghaus memory experiments of the 1880s, about the evanescence of knowledge crammed for the purpose of test-taking. It’s not just students. Throughout the world, teachers and professors are increasingly judged not by how well their students think or what they understand in deep and complex ways but how well they do on these tests. So “teaching to the test” is a survival mechanism for teachers too. It’s oversimplification all the way down. In short, the “problem” with university students today isn’t the students but the educational liabilities we’ve saddled them with. We have schooled them to believe formal education is where intellectual creativity and complexity go to die. Yet, in my experience, I find that students today remain admirably resilient, clear-eyed, and even optimistic about their ability to face and solve the difficulties of the world they have inherited. Why is my experience so different from that of many of colleagues? One reason is that I have restructured my courses to support and challenge students not as content memorisers but as content creators – a skill they have mastered outside of school and that is far more predictive of future success than test scores. We know, from surveys conducted by the world’s library associations, that this generation does more voluntary, non-required imaginative reading than any other since surveys began after the second world war. Publishers would be in bad shape without a category of literature that barely existed in pre-internet days, the young adult section. We know how much time they spend on line interacting, modding, and remixing content. These are useful skills in the world we live in so I build my courses around them, rather than dismissing them as superficial. Whether I am teaching a traditional literature course or one focusing on new technologies, digital literacy, and information systems (my two areas of specialisation), I deconstruct the passivity and mindlessness of traditional schooling and challenge my students to take responsibility for their learning by using active, engaged learning principles from Maria Montessori,John Dewey, Paulo Freire, bell hooks and Audre Lorde. My students work hard, but they see that they are learning skills they will rely on long after the course grade is in and the diploma issued. They take the lead in designing our syllabus, using one another and the internet as constant resources to collaboratively work through challenging problems together. They analyse and even design our assessment methods and conduct rigorous peer review of one another’s work before approving it for publication to an open, free website. They take pride in making an original contribution to public knowledge. As a lifelong educator, I believe the problem of students today lies in us not in our youth. It is our job to reverse this “outcome oriented” educational monster we have created. We need to design a “new education” that encourages students not just to cram for reductive tests but to succeed in the harrowing world we have bequeathed to them. • Cathy Davidson is a distinguished professor of English and directs the Futures Initiative at the Graduate Center, CUNY"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/04/coral-reef-bleaching-the-new-normal-and-a-fatal-threat-to-ecosystems","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T19:00:03Z","webTitle":"Coral reef bleaching 'the new normal' and a fatal threat to ecosystems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/coral-reef-bleaching-the-new-normal-and-a-fatal-threat-to-ecosystems","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/04/coral-reef-bleaching-the-new-normal-and-a-fatal-threat-to-ecosystems","fields":{"headline":"Coral reef bleaching 'the new normal' and a fatal threat to ecosystems","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Repeated large-scale coral bleaching events are the new normal thanks to global warming, a team of international scientists has found. In a study published in the journal Science, the researchers revealed a “dramatic shortening” of the time between bleaching events was “threatening the future existence of these iconic ecosystems and the livelihoods of many millions of people”. The study examined 100 tropical reef locations across the world, analysing existing data on coral bleaching events as well as new field research conducted on the Great Barrier Reef after the longest and worst case of bleaching caused by climate change killed almost 25% of the coral. “Before the 1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of, even during strong El Niño conditions,” said lead author Prof Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. “Now repeated bouts of regional-scale bleaching and mass mortality of corals has become the new normal around the world as temperatures continue to rise.” The study found that time between bleaching events had diminished five-fold in the past 30 to 40 years, and was now too short to allow for a full recovery and was approaching unsustainable levels. While mass bleaching events used to occur about once every 27 years, by 2016 the median time between them had shrunk to 5.9 years. Only six of the 100 sites had escaped bleaching. “Our analysis indicates that we are already approaching a scenario in which every hot summer, with or without an El Niño event, has the potential to cause bleaching and mortality at a regional scale,” the paper said. Globally, the annual risk of severe and moderate bleaching had increased by almost 4% a year since the 1980s, from an expected 8% of locations to 31% in 2016. The Western Atlantic remained at highest risk but Australasia and the Middle East saw the strongest increases in risk of bleaching. Hughes said he hoped the “stark results” would prompt stronger action on reducing greenhouse gases. In May scientists warned that the central goal of the Australian government’s protection plan was no longer feasible because of the dramatic impact of climate change. Friday’s paper also determined the link between El Niño and mass bleaching events has diminished as global warming continues. Prior to the 1980s mass coral bleaching on a regional scale was “exceedingly rare or absent” and occurred in localised areas stretching tens of kilometres, not the hundreds of kilometres affected in recent times, the paper said. These local bleaching events were largely caused by small-scale stressors like unusually hot or cold weather, freshwater inundation or sedimentation. Then global warming increased the thermal stress of strong El Niño events, the paper said, widening the impact of individual bleaching events. Now, they are occurring at any time. “Back in the 80s it was only during El Niño events that waters became hot enough to damage corals and induce them to bleach,” co-author Andrew Baird, a professor at James Cook University, told Guardian Australia. “But now it’s 30, 40 years later and we’re seeing those temperatures in normal years.” Baird said it was difficult to know if the current conditions were reversible but “the window to address it is diminishing”. “It’s impossible to know if this is the end of coral reefs but it might be,” he said. “We really need to get on top of climate change as soon as possible.” There have been several large-scale and devastating mass bleaching events in recent years. The 2015-16 event affected 75% of the reefs studied by the researchers, who said it was comparable to the then unprecedented mass bleaching of 1997-98, when 74% were affected. “Interestingly one of the first papers that effectively drew attention to the issue – back in 1999 – suggested that by 2016, 2017, 2020, we would be seeing bleaching annually,” Baird said. “That’s pretty close to what’s happening unfortunately. “Some of these earlier works were quite prescient in their prediction and unfortunately we didn’t pay enough attention back then.” The study follows a discovery late last year that 3% of the Great Barrier Reef could facilitate recovery after bleaching – a finding the researchers at the time suggested was akin to a life-support system but small enough not to be taken for granted. On Friday scientists announced that a major outbreak of coral-eating crown of thorns starfish had been found munching the Great Barrier Reef in December, prompting the Australian government to begin culling the spiky marine animals. The predator starfish feeds on corals by spreading its stomach over them and using digestive enzymes to liquefy tissue. “Each starfish eats about its body diameter a night, and so over time that mounts up very significantly,” Hugh Sweatman, a senior research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science told ABC radio. “A lot of coral will be lost,” he said. The crown of thorns were found in plague proportions in the Swains reefs, at the southern edge of the Great Barrier Reef, by researchers from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The authority already killed some starfish at Swains reefs in December and said it would mount another mission in January. There have been four major crown of thorns outbreaks since the 1960s in the Great Barrier Reef but it recovered each time because there were always healthy populations of herbivorous fish. The outbreaks are usually triggered by extra nutrients in the water but the reason for the current outbreak was unclear, Sweatman said.

In bike-unfriendly Britain, even if your commute is short enough, this can sometimes be a tricky prospect. But if it works out, the benefits – to your health, to your wallet, to your general sense of wellbeing – can be astonishing. There’s plenty of practical advice out there for the novice cyclist. If you’re among 2018’s new intake, I’d like to instead propose five of what could be termed more philosophical or attitudinal thoughts about your new commute. Feel free to disagree or add your own ideas below. This isn’t ‘exercise’ to be endured, it’s everyday Too much of the modern-day focus on physical activity views it as some sort of penance, the price one pays to eat cakes, or a punishing routine to compress your body into some sort of socially-acceptable mould. This strikes me as missing the point. The best ways of being physical, for me, fall into two different categories. One is through everyday movement, something that integrates into your everyday life, as was the case for the vast majority of people before desk-bound working became the norm. The other category is being physical for the sheer pleasure of it, for the joy of movement, speed, momentum, the rush of breeze against your face. This is “exercise” as experienced by most young children; sadly, it’s something most people forget about in adulthood. The great thing about commuting by bike is that it can fall into both. It can often be quicker than alternative methods, and is certainly the most reliable beyond walking, and before you know it, you’re cycling because it’s easier than not doing so. And yes, there will be days when the rain lashes down, the wind howls and the cars speed too close. But even then you’re moving, you’re active, you’re very obviously, vividly, sensorially, moving under your own steam. That is to be celebrated. Don’t feel pressured to ride quickly One of the problems of the UK’s predominantly feral road traffic is that cycling can feel perilous. This in turn means the dominant biking demographic tends to be younger people, predominantly men, and often cycling enthusiasts, who ride confidently and sometimes at speed. So long as they’re thoughtful towards others there’s nothing wrong with this. But such a cycling environment can come with an implied pressure to keep up – at its worst it can involve fit young men on road bikes tutting at those who go more sedately. Ignore them. Go fast if you want, as long as you’re lawful, safe and considerate. But if you want to dawdle, then do so. Meander, idle, potter, pedal at a regally slow cadence while admiring the unfolding panorama. If you’re in a town or city, half the time you’ll catch up with the speeders at the next red light anyway. Civilised cycling has space for all levels of speed and commitment. Don’t let the head-down-go-for-glory brigade shame you into believing anything else. Ride whichever bike you want (as long as it’s safe) When I first started cycling as an adult – a slightly rash decision to give up a secure-if-dull graduate job to become a cycle courier – I knew virtually nothing about bikes, and thus bought a ridiculously impractical machine, a clunky and moped-weight mountain bike with vast, knobbly tyres that probably doubled the rolling resistance. No matter. I still pedalled it eagerly around London, earning an initially meagre wage that rose as I learned the trade. Plus, the sheer mass of the bike got me fit very quickly. And when I became more interested in bikes I bought a better one, a process which escalated over the years to the point that I now own six bikes, one bike frame and a quarter-garage full of wheels, spare parts and tools. Now I’m not saying everyone should start on a clunker, or a rusty wreck, and I’d urge every new cyclist using a second-hand bike to get it checked over by a shop, or at least a knowledgeable mate. A newer machine, if affordable, can be easier for the novice, needing less regular fettling. My only point is this – just because every cyclist on your commute rides a shiny hybrid or a balsa wood-weight road bike, don’t feel you have to. Use a Dutch bike festooned with basket, chaincase, skirt guard and gigantic, clanging bell, if you want. Go for an e-bike if the hills or distance are daunting. Borrow a bike to try things out if that helps. Just get riding, and see what suits you. The weather is your friend. Honestly There is a much-quoted adage among cyclists, which seems to have originated with the guru of Lakeland hiking, Alfred Wainwright, which decrees that there is no such thing as bad weather, only the wrong clothes. With all due respect to Wainwright, that’s sometimes bollocks. Even in tepid Britain, the rain can occasionally be sufficiently tropical and persistent to permeate any layers. And I have yet to encounter bike clothing which can counter a headwind. The good news is that not only is truly awful weather rarer than you might think, but – in a strange sort of way – getting an occasional soaking or buffeting is part of the joy of bike commuting. For one thing, it keeps you in constant, visceral touch with the changing seasons. You won’t feel the first, joyous whisper of spring sunshine on your cheek in a car. It also means that when conditions do turn glorious, you have all the more reason to enjoy it. Even to feel a bit smug. Finally, remember this: if it’s dark and blowing a storm, you can always not use the bike. No one gets a medal for cycling every day. If you don’t like local cycling conditions, agitate for something better It is a common myth that when you start cycling you are somehow inducted into a community, a homogenous mass who are all somehow responsible for each others’ infractions. Nonsense. You just use a bike as one of what are probably many means of transport. That said, if you are dispirited, or scared, by riding conditions or driver behaviour on all or some of your route, it can be worth letting those in power know about it. Drivers are famously good at lobbying politicians; many stand guard over each individual on-street parking space or inch of lane space like it is their sacred birthright. Cyclists can be less active. So it’s worth letting those with influence, whether councillors, MPs or officials, know that people on bikes have a view. You might not get the UK turned into Utrecht overnight. But if no one speaks up, things will never improve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/05/mark-billingham-dont-finish-any-book-not-enjoying","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T09:59:09Z","webTitle":"Mark Billingham: ‘I  don’t finish any book I’m not enjoying.

An advance copy of a novel that is published later this year. A chilling slice of contemporary folk horror that will make you think twice before venturing into that friendly looking Cornish pub. The book that changed my life/the world The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle. Read out loud to me when I was 13 by an eccentric maths teacher who got bored during his own lessons. It’s the reason I write detective fiction. It’s also why I can’t add up. The book I wish I’d written The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett. Fizzing, fat-free prose, and still a stunning read almost 90 years on from its publication, this is the novel that pretty much kick-started the hardboiled movement. Chandler and others went on to perfect the style, but it was Hammett’s ball they were running with. The book that had the greatest influence on my writing Having won the Whitbread prize for Docherty, William McIlvanney surprised and even dismayed many in 1977 when he chose to write a crime novel. How very dare he?! The seminal Laidlaw proved once and for all that genre and literary fiction were not mutually exclusive and inspired an entire generation of crime writers. The book I think is most under/overrated The Death of Sweet Mister by Daniel Woodrell is the tale of Shug Atkins, a friendless, overweight 13-year-old, growing up fast and hard in a dirt-poor Missouri town in the Ozarks. A dark and often brutal tale, with passages of heart-stopping tenderness and an unworldly tone I’ve yet to encounter anywhere else, from a superb writer who deserves a far bigger readership. The last book that made me cry/laugh The most recent volume of Danny Baker’s autobiography, Going on the Turn made me do both. The book I couldn’t finish I don’t finish any book I’m not enjoying.

While I’m not exactly ashamed, should I find myself caught up in a discussion about the works of Jane Austen, I might have to shuffle quietly away … The book I most often give as a gift Though best known as a writer of dark crime fiction, John Connolly’s The Book of Lost Things is a funny, terrifying and deeply moving story about childhood and the transformative power of stories themselves. The book I’d most like to be remembered for Let’s hope it’s one I’ve yet to write, but right this minute, I’d be happy if it was any of them. • Mark Billingham is a 2018 Quick Reads author.

Since the release of Simon Stevens’ Five Year Forward View in 2014, we have been told how the patient is at the centre, with care closer to home, “no decision about me without me”, but have watched as services get more difficult to access despite the wondrous efforts of the workforce, both NHS and in the care sector. Lack of funding and being forced to “make savings” have been the mechanism that has caused the crisis, but the fragmentation and outsourcing that followed the Health and Social Care Act of 2012 have been expensive and damaging too. Those costs and inefficiencies will not go away with the introduction of ACOs but the role of multinational health businesses will be much enhanced by their involvement as “partners” at the heart of the fixed budget “complete care systems”. They will be influential in decisions about who qualifies for healthcare and who will be told their needs are social care and therefore means tested. They will shape the pattern of subcontracting and the percentage of NHS funding going to private providers. We also need to know much more about how the technology-based improvements are to be paid for. Most of the suppliers are the same companies getting their feet under the table of the ACOs. Almost certainly, private finance will be used, despite what we know of the horrendous long-term costs of PFI. I understand that Jeremy Hunt intends to use secondary legislation to give a legal framework for these changes, thereby sidestepping the scrutiny of parliament. The framework will be company and competition law so the new bodies will be protected by commercial confidentiality and not subject to FOI. Indeed, when it comes to accountability of the ACOs, it may eventually be to shareholders, not patients or parliament. The crowd-funded legal challenge to this legislation is still short of its target and readers may well wish to contribute. There is also an early day motion, which needs more MPs to sign up so that a debate can be forced. Sue Vaughan (retired GP) Little Melton, Norfolk • My experience of current commissioning arrangements in the NHS is that the authorities are hardly accountable to the local population at all. Public meetings are almost always either preceded or followed by private meetings in which all the important decisions are taken. They are obliged to consult local people, but not to pay any attention to what they say, and the public are almost never given options on which they can vote. They are currently accountable to the secretary of state but even this potential safeguard will be lost if independent accountable care organisations are established, and there is an obvious danger that money currently allocated to health services will be siphoned off locally to provide better education, transport, housing, and social services as Bruce Keogh mentions. Challenges in the courts will hopefully ensure that this possibility is properly examined in addition to privatisation issues. Dr Richard Turner Beverley, East Yorkshire • In his article defending plans to introduce American-style accountable care organisations into this country, Professor Bruce Keogh says some people may question the funding model of the NHS. But, with all due respect to him, it is not clear that he supports the NHS funding model himself. He talks about a commitment to a taxpayer-funded service and a service that is free at the point of use, but does not mention the third pillar of the NHS model, the fact that doctors nurses and ancillary staff are paid directly by the government, not by Richard Branson or the CEOs of some American healthcare conglomerate. Is Professor Keogh happy to see the trend to private provision in the NHS continuing and increasing? Brendan O’Brien (retired GP) London • So Bruce Keogh is yet another apologist for the atrocious and dysfunctional Tory government that we are lumbered with, unlike Lord Adonis who has been prepared to air a few home truths in his resignation. Keogh is attempting to justify the government’s “privatisation by stealth” policy but most of us NHS users are far from convinced. How long before Virgin Care and the other money-grabbing contractors realise that they have overbid on their contracts and plead for a government bailout which will doubtless on past history be provided? Of course, another Virgin-branded company has already honed its skills in wriggling out of contracts that are not proving sufficiently profitable, ie Virgin Trains East Coast.

Stoke’s chairman, Peter Coates, is thought to be reluctant to dismiss Hughes but, along with officials at the club, has become increasingly alarmed by the team’s slump in form, with their latest loss coming against Newcastle United at the Bet365 Stadium on New Year’s Day. The 1-0 reverse ended with home supporters booing the team and calling for the manager to be sacked. Hughes was defiant after the game and in particular when defending his decision to rest a clutch of first-team players for the weekend trip to Chelsea in order to make sure Stoke were as strong as possible for the visit of Newcastle. Stoke lost 5-0 at Stamford Bridge and then, two days later, Hughes’s gamble well and truly backfired against Rafael Benítez’s men, who arrived in the Potteries having won just twice away from home all season. “Who else is going to do it?” Hughes replied when asked about his future on Monday and that is a question Stoke’s board is asking themselves. There are no obvious candidates to take over should a change be made and that could ultimately save Hughes, who replaced Tony Pulis as manager in May 2013. Stoke travel to Coventry City on Saturday in the third-round of the FA Cup before facing Manchester United, one of Hughes’s former sides, at Old Trafford in the Premier League on 15 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/2018/jan/05/unbuilt-highways-urban-development-roads-nowhere","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T07:30:06Z","webTitle":"Unbuilt cities: the outrageous highway schemes left as roads to nowhere","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jan/05/unbuilt-highways-urban-development-roads-nowhere","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jan/05/unbuilt-highways-urban-development-roads-nowhere","fields":{"headline":"Unbuilt cities: the outrageous highway schemes left as roads to nowhere","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Of all the mistakes made by city planners in the postwar era, the passion for highway construction has to be one of the most foolhardy. After the early success of systems like the autobahn and freeways, cities everywhere were carved up to make way for giant roads, crashing through neighbourhoods and creating opportunities for “comprehensive redevelopment”. This was considered progress, a necessary part of entering the modern world. But some strange things happened – the most damning being that these new roads didn’t reduce traffic at all. Instead, they induced demand, clogging up almost as quickly as they were built. As time went on, communities began rejecting the plans and fighting back against the bulldozers, halting development in its tracks and kickstarting the modern conservation movement. Finally, the knockout blow was the oil crisis of the 1970s which put an end to many big plans. Looking back, we can marvel at how outrageous some of these and later schemes were, and the traces they left behind. Lower Manhattan Expressway The classic evil mastermind of road building is Robert Moses, the New York official who planned and built huge amounts of infrastructure, but destroyed many tight-knit communities in the process. Included in his grand plans was the Lower Manhattan Expressway (Lomex), which would have sliced directly through the Lower East Side, evicting nearly 2,000 families. A vigorous local campaign from the early 1960s involving urbanist Jane Jacobs managed to hold off and eventually cancel the project, saving the neighbourhood from the wrecking ball. But Lomex has since become a source of nostalgia through the plans by architect Paul Rudolph, showing vast brutalist housing blocks snaking along and above the roads. Spadina Expressway In 1968, Jane Jacobs moved from Greenwich Village to Toronto, but didn’t slow down on her activism. She quickly learned that her new home was to be demolished for the Spadina Expressway, which would join the city centre to the growing suburbs. Jacobs was involved in the campaign to halt it – a battle partly between those who had moved out and who stood to benefit, and those who still lived in the centre and were at risk of having their communities physically destroyed. By the time the anti-road campaign won, a short stretch of the expressway had been completed, but the neighbourhoods in its path were spared. Marina Freeway Holding a claim to being perhaps the world’s shortest working highway, the most westerly portion of California State Route 90 was originally part of a giant road planned to cut right across Los Angeles, the spiritual home of the traffic jam. Again, the strength of community resistance meant that the plans were reduced until all that was constructed was a short spur a few kilometres long. It held the dubious honour of being named the Richard M Nixon Freeway for a few years in the early 1970s. Fitzrovia Masterplan The UK government’s Buchanan report of 1963 looked at the US and wondered what was going to happening to British cities as car ownership took off. Proposing a variety of different systems for accommodating traffic in towns, they demonstrated a wild plan to flatten much of Fitzrovia in London and create a hexagonal network of major roads, with new offices and residential spaces stacked above. It never happened, but it became a blueprint for redevelopment across the country in the following generation. Glasgow Inner Ring Road Glasgow was the UK city perhaps most gouged by highway planning, with a remarkable stretch of the M8 motorway smashing straight through the tenements of Charing Cross, complete with “bridges to nowhere” and other infrastructural detritus. But what was built was less than half the original ring road plans that would have run through Glasgow Green and right past the 12th-century cathedral. The results of the first stages, complete by the early 70s, helped galvanise public opinion against the project. In the end the east and south sections were abandoned. Plan Pompidou Paris nearly suffered a repeat of Baron Haussmann’s boulevard gouging in the 1960s, as Georges Pompidou attempted to make the city “adapt to the automobile”. The banks of the Seine were turned into expressways, but many planned radial roads were thankfully left on the drawing board, and the right bank of the river is to be fully closed to vehicles in the future. Foreshore Freeway Bridge One odd monument down by the harbour in Cape Town is a set of two concrete flyovers that spring out of the Helen Suzman Boulevard before abruptly ending, leaving their swooping sections dangling in mid air. They are the remnants of a plan for the Eastern Boulevard Highway, abandoned in the late 1970s for lack of funds and demand. A symbol both of municipal hubris but also a local landmark, it was adorned with “The World’s Largest Vuvuzela” for the World Cup in 2010. North Western Expressway Planned from the early 1960s, the North Western Expressway was intended to run from central Sydney to the mountains in the west, but heated protests meant that only a few short sections were ever built, leaving most of the route an empty channel of land. One odd result was the massive Gladesville Bridge, at the time the longest concrete arch ever constructed, which forms part of the few kilometres of the road that was actually completed. Olimpijka Since the second world war plans had been afoot to construct a large-scale road that would run across Poland through Warsaw, linking the German and Russian borders. But it wasn’t until the run-up to the 1980 Moscow Olympics that work began, stopping due to lack of funds after only short sections were completed. The fragments became known as Olimpijka, and were a pilgrimage spot for urban explorers before eventually being destroyed when the road was finally completed as the A2 in the early 2010s. Borovsko Bridge Begun after the German annexation of Czechoslovakia, the Borovsko Bridge wasn’t completed until 1950 in the newly communist republic. The highway itself leading south from Prague was never finished, leaving the bridge marooned. Its huge concrete span was gradually submerged by a hydroelectric project, to the point where just the road surface stands above the water. A4 Netherlands Part of the highly developed Dutch road system, route A4 sweeps down from Amsterdam to the Belgian border on the way to Antwerp. It passes through Rotterdam where, embarrassingly, a cloverleaf junction lacks its fourth wing. To this day a 20km stretch of the route remains unbuilt, leaving a suspiciously empty patch of land between residential neighbourhoods waiting to be unified.

Off the field issues have drawn more attention than the play on the field – particularly the debate over kneeling and the national anthem—and football’s ever-present nemesis, concussions, remains one of the NFL’s biggest problems. Publicly condemned and legally liable for ignoring the long-term effects of brain injury, the NFL seems to have learned from its mistakes and has swiftly tried to respond, primarily through the implementation of a concussion protocol. The protocol, developed in 2009 and amended periodically over the past eight seasons, dictates the procedure for both the diagnosis and management of concussions. Now, the first, and perhaps most important rule of the concussion protocol stipulates that a player must be removed from the game immediately when a concussion is suspected. After examination by an independent neurological consultant – in the locker room or one of those fancy new pop-up tents on NFL sidelines – evidence of observable concussion symptoms should trigger removal for the duration of the game. Once a player “enters” the protocol with a diagnosed concussion, other rules dictate how a player can return to play or “exit” the program. However, several on-field mishandlings of head injuries have again put the NFL on the defensive. Most notably, the Houston Texans allowing quarterback Tom Savage to re-enter the game after suffering what seemed to be a concussion-related seizure on the field. Played out in front of horrified television viewers, the concussion detection system is designed to red flag such events, chiefly through the use of medical spotters in the booth to monitor video for possible concussion provoking hits. Events like helmet-to-helmet contact; players unable to walk or stand after hits; loss of consciousness; those are the incidents that observers are trained to watch for and if needed, alert sideline officials. Though Savage was eventually pulled after one series, an obvious sign of concussion was initially missed, highlighting the limitations of the NFL’s concussion protocol. Rightfully so, the criticism came quickly. As a result, what will happen, is a series of changes to the protocol. One of those changes will be the presence of an independent neurological expert at the league command center for every game. This official will have the ability to contact the sideline medical staff should they observe any signs or symptoms requiring further evaluation. An extra neurotrauma consultant, in addition to the two independent neurological experts already on very sideline, will serve as additional backup. What won’t happen, in a joint NFL-NFLPA ruling released Friday, is any disciplinary action against the Texans for the Savage incident. So will this fix the NFL concussion protocol? While these changes will address the detection of high-risk events, part of the problem, and one less easily addressed, has to do with the nature of how concussions can present. Symptoms from concussions – headaches, dizziness, confusion, etc – can be delayed anywhere from minutes to days, making sideline diagnoses untrustworthy. These delayed symptoms can lead players and teams to believe that a player hasn’t suffered a concussion, especially in the hurried, let’s-get-our-quarterback-back-out-on-the-field atmosphere of the NFL. “Symptoms are a big part of the assessment, and are inherently subjective,” said Christopher Giza, director of the UCLA BrainSPORT program. “Some athletes aren’t aware a symptom may be from a concussion; some athletes purposely hide concussion symptoms; some athletes aren’t thinking clearly enough to recognize the symptoms and sometimes concussion symptoms present in a delayed fashion.” According to Giza, in this way the concussion protocol is like other injury diagnoses, with a degree of uncertainty inherent to medicine. “However, concussion and sport-related TBI is very high profile, the stakes (in both money and health) are high,” he said, “so big sports like football can and to some extent should be held to a high standard.” The fact is that, no matter the effectiveness of a test, diagnosis is all the more difficult if players aren’t truthful about how their head feels. It’s because, in the absence of objective test, any concussion protocol relies on the motivation of the athlete to cooperate with evaluators. Research by the University of North Carolina’s Center for the Study of Retired Athletes found that over 50% of former NFL players surveyed had sustained a concussion at least once and did not inform team medical staff. In one high risk group, those that had sustained 10 or more concussion, 75% of players stated they had concealed concussion symptoms. The numbers were similar to those found in a survey of college football players, one that found that nearly 70% had not disclosed a concussion during their collegiate career, a staggering statistic. Unfortunately though, the NFL players may have reasons to downplay concussion symptoms, as there is evidence for a shorter career length and decreased performance after concussion. In fact, one study found that, three years after sustaining a concussion, 70% of players were no longer in the NFL. In stark contrast, only 43% of non-concussed players had been released by the same point. And while the first hit was to the head, the next was to the pocketbook, as those that had suffered a concussion made, on average, $300,000 less than those that hadn’t. Much of the attention has been concentrated on the diagnosis and treatment of head injuries but little has focused on the factors that increase risk. Several recent research studies indicate that, like any injury, external factors can play a role. Though research hasn’t connected an increase in concussions with the shortened recovery period of Thursday games or days of rest in general, there does seem to be an increase in head injuries in the second half of the season. Giza hypothesizes that likely contributors to this association may include late season player fatigue, more ‘on the line’ as teams position for the post-season, or colder game temperatures. The style of offense, namely how and how often a team passed, was also found to be a risk factor for concussion, primarily in those players most involved in the passing game. Wide receivers, tight ends, cornerbacks, and safeties all had more documented concussions. According to researchers, this may be because passing plays place athletes at higher risk for full speed impacts compared with running plays. Interestingly, the highest risk was with a passing attack that favored shorter routes across the middle of the field, rather than offenses that emphasized long passes. The researchers speculate that during cross-field routes the receiver and defender are more likely to be running at each other, rather than with each other, as with longer, more downfield, routes. That means more high-speed collisions and a higher risk of head injury. Whether these changes to the concussion protocol will make a difference in the long-term health of players is an answer that may take years to obtain. Yet, given the complexity of concussion testing, perhaps it’s unfair to condemn the NFL. However, the future of the NFL may rely on that answer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/02/dont-neglect-angolan-mine-clearance-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T18:36:35Z","webTitle":"Don’t neglect Angolan mine clearance pledge | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/02/dont-neglect-angolan-mine-clearance-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/02/dont-neglect-angolan-mine-clearance-pledge","fields":{"headline":"Don’t neglect Angolan mine clearance pledge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK public has again demonstrated its support for the eradication of landmines (Princess Diana’s landmine crusade to get £400,000 boost, theguardian.com, 29 December).

The suffering of Angolan communities was central to drawing the world’s attention to the horror of landmines in 1997, but the country has been woefully neglected by the international donor community. A 90% drop in funding to mine clearance in Angola in the last decade has left a skeleton capacity dependent on the US, which has not yet joined the Ottawa treaty banning anti-personnel landmines. The Landmine Free 2025 campaign estimates that just over seven times the current level of international support is needed to achieve Angola’s 2025 mine-free goal. The generosity of the British public has offered a lifeline. But a step-change in funding from states will be needed over the next eight years to find the additional £170m needed to clear Angola’s minefields. With international funding for landmine clearance counting for only 0.2% of overseas aid, the sums needed are easily within the reach of international aid budgets. It is time for treaty states to choose to keep their promises, follow the UK’s example and fund the clearance of forgotten minefields.

The American director and screenwriter has many in his. The one he specifically has in mind is his first child, born only two weeks before he flew over for the London film festival last autumn. It’s the first thing he mentions when I step into the room and ask how he is. “I have a new daughter,” he beams expansively, and I almost expect him to hand me a celebratory cigar. “Two weeks. A tiny human.” What’s she called? “Thanks for asking,” he says, but will only tell me off the record. Suffice to say, it’s a rather poetic and very Greek name. Payne’s own family background is Greek, and so is his wife, Maria Kontos, whom he married in 2015, and who is described on some websites as a “philologist”. That means, Payne explains, that she studied language and history at university. Colleagues of mine who have interviewed him in the past warn me that he can be a little frosty and distant, but becoming a father for the first time at 56 seems to have put him in a highly affable mood. How does it feel being away from his daughter so soon? “It’s just for two days, it’s fine. It’s lovely to check in on her and watch her sleep and hold her when she’s crying, and it feels so good when she stops crying, that kind of stuff.” At the same time, Payne has also had to attend to the other tiny humans in his life – the five-inch-high characters of his latest film, Downsizing. This dystopian satire is a departure from a director who has previously specialised in intimate, more or less realistic comedies of manners, often set in and around his native Omaha, Nebraska, often focusing on the crises of disillusioned American males. They include About Schmidt (2002), with Jack Nicholson as a glum insurance man facing retirement; the Hawaii-set The Descendants (2011); and 2013’s sublimely melancholic black-and-white tale of generational conflict Nebraska. Then there’s the work that cemented Payne’s reputation as a compassionate, insightful comic auteur, wine-themed buddy movie Sideways (2004) – a film no doubt cursed to this day by makers of merlot, a tipple famously despised by its hero. Downsizing is something entirely different – a large-scale, CGI-laced comic fantasy with a premise that demands we take the title literally. In it, Payne and Jim Taylor – his writing partner on most of his films – wonder what would happen if scientists developed a technology for shrinking humans to a fraction of their normal size. Surely this could solve our ecological problems – miniaturised people would only require a fraction of the resources that we currently consume. But Downsizing shows this utopian project promptly being debased by human nature and, more specifically, by American capitalism. Entrepreneurs quickly learn to pitch miniaturisation as a luxury lifestyle option and build bland suburban-style micro-communities in which freshly shrunk new arrivals can find all their needs catered for, from sports centres to teeny branches of Tony Roma’s restaurant, all under one dome (the film’s standout moment is a magnificently cheesy sales pitch performed by Neil Patrick Harris). The film’s Everyman hero, Paul, played by Matt Damon, soon discovers that small isn’t necessarily beautiful: paradise proves to be just a microcosm, quite literally, of the ills of the bigger world. One of the pleasures of Downsizing is the jokey earnestness with which it sets out its stall, establishing the imaginary science behind its big idea. For example, new – what do you call them? shrinkees? diminuees? – have to have their dental fillings removed before diminishing, so that their heads won’t explode in the process. Payne has claimed that he actually consulted experts on body shrinking; who knew there were such people? “The technology exists – all the patents have been bought by apparel companies,” he jokes, poker-faced. No, he says – there was some research involved, but only as much as was needed to make the film plausible. “I talked to a couple of physicists about what actually your body would be if you were 18 grams and 10cm tall. You could jump higher and probably live longer, and you could put popsicle sticks on your arms and probably fly a little bit, flap around. But I’ve got a movie to make, I’ve got other stuff to think about.” In fact, the other stuff he has thought about considerably exceeds the film’s initial brief – somewhat to the detriment of its satirical focus. Beyond the “modern Lilliput” concept, Payne and Taylor are anxious to pursue the darker implications of certain real-world political issues. The other key character alongside hapless hero Paul is a young Vietnamese woman named Ngoc Lan (Hong Chau); she is a disabled activist who has been downsized as a political punishment, and now belongs to the exploited and marginalised underclass, largely Asian and Latin American, who keep the US micro-communities functioning. She also, to rather queasy effect, brings about Paul’s conversion from complacency to redeeming awareness. If this political thread weren’t enough, the film also takes an apocalyptic turn in its concern with the melting of the icecaps and the imminence of planetary catastrophe. So after his series of intimate character comedies, did Payne feel it was time to make a major statement? “Not a major statement. Who the hell can make a major statement? But Jim Taylor and I, when we started conceiving this screenplay 10 years ago, certainly had the idea to make on some level a political film – not literally or directly political, but something with a metaphor that would allow us to open the gates to certain hideous elements going on in current society.” Still, Payne likes to play down any hint of solemnity. “The movie takes a very ridiculous premise and treats it very earnestly. That’s the ridiculousness of the film. “As long as the world is coming to an end, you might as well get a few laughs out of the deal – and make some money off it,” he adds with a knowing chuckle. He’s being ironic, of course – possibly with the uneasy foresight that no one would make that much money from this movie. Downsizing is his most expensive work to date – he tells me the budget, again off the record, naming a figure slightly higher than the $68m generally quoted in reports. However, the film – which has had reviews ranging from breathless raves to distinctly unimpressed scepticism – opened in the US just before Christmas, and at time of writing has only made a domestic gross of just over $18.5m, leaving Payne with a significant commercial flop on his hands. No doubt it didn’t help that his good-hearted hero was played by Matt Damon, whose clumsy comments in mid-December on the post-Weinstein sexual harassment debate made him an international bête noire just in time for the film’s release. In any case, I ask Payne, doesn’t it seem strange to make a film called Downsizing that’s all about reducing wastefulness, and yet to spend a huge amount of money making it? “If they don’t spend it on that, they’re just going to spend it on something else,” Payne grins. Downsizing’s budget is extravagant by his standards, he says, which is one reason it took so long to get financed; he originally hoped to make it right after the commercial breakthrough of Sideways. But the cost, he says, is “not unheard of by Hollywood standards. They spend $150m, $200m on tons of films all the time. This isn’t that outrageous. Curiously, the most expensive I’d made to date was About Schmidt – $32m. You couldn’t get that to make that movie today, but half of that was Jack Nicholson’s salary.” We talk about dystopias in film and literature, and I ask Payne whether he’s read certain classic science-fiction novels. I mention one in particular and he jots down the title. “Look at my ignorance,” he says. It may be jetlag or new-parent sleepiness, but he seems eminently relaxed. He’s rather professorial in manner, with a precise, poised style of speaking; this, combined with bushy salt-and-pepper hair on top of saturnine features, suggest that if he ever tires of directing he could have a nice sideline in playing slightly lofty academics or thoughtful, dry-humoured Democratic senators. Payne remains courteous, if visibly a little tense, when I mention my further worries about Downsizing – notably the role of Ngoc Lan, a fierce-minded, socially committed character who represents the film’s moral centre but is played by Hong Chau in a shrieky, abrasive manner that brings the character perilously close to racial stereotype. Chau – an American actor born in Thailand to Vietnamese parents – has three best supporting actress nominations for the role and has strongly defended the character, and her performance. Given that Payne was previously married to a woman of Asian origin – Korean-Canadian actor Sandra Oh, who appeared in Sideways – you might assume he would be sensitive about such dangers. Yet the portrayal struck me, I tell him, as uncomfortably cartoonish. “That’s too bad,” Payne muses. “Christoph Waltz – did you not find him cartoony too?” In Downsizing, the Austrian actor plays a roguishly corrupt Serbian wheeler-dealer – and the answer is, yes, his character is intensely cartoony. “I’ve read a couple of things – ‘Oh, it’s a stereotype’,” says Payne, “but I haven’t seen a character like hers in any other film. Ngoc Lan speaks like someone who never had formal lessons in English, and Hong Chau assures me that’s how her parents speak. Arguably she’s the character who has the most depth in the film – she was created and brought to life with a lot of tenderness. Anyway, I’m sorry you were uneasy with her.” There’s certainly something to be uneasy with these days when faced with big-budget Hollywood movies that aspire to make moral statements about the world situation – especially when the hero is a white middle-American male escorting us on the path to enlightenment. Does Payne think that audiences might become more suspicious of such statements in future? “I have no idea,” he says, then takes a few seconds’ pause for thought. “Don’t we look to the arts, though, to give us a weathervane, somehow? Chekhov said the role of the artist isn’t to answer the questions but just to formulate the questions. That’s all.” The dilemma is certainly not new in film history. As a Hollywood director in a classic comedy tradition, Payne is often compared to golden age auteurs such as Ernst Lubitsch, Frank Capra and Preston Sturges – and it’s a film by the last that comes to mind when discussing Downsizing. Sturges’s 1941 classic, Sullivan’s Travels, is about a director of light mainstream fare who yearns to make a hard-hitting drama about poverty and suffering. In the end, however, Sullivan comes to the conclusion that a film-maker’s job is simply to entertain. “I’ve always been a little on the fence about Sullivan’s Travels,” Payne frowns. “I appreciate that story, but it lets Hollywood off a little too easily: ‘It’s OK just to make people laugh, you don’t actually have to do anything thoughtful.’ I’m a little uneasy with that.” What makes Payne’s own movies so distinctive is that they’ve generally managed to be both thoughtful and highly entertaining, hitting a fine balance between acerbic humour and a melancholic regard for human fallibility. Sideways, with Paul Giamatti as a failed novelist and neurotic wine bore, is about accepting the reality of disappointed dreams; The Descendants confronts familial grief and loneliness; both About Schmidt and Nebraska deal with ageing, the latter telling a story of a cantankerous father with dementia (played by a magnificent Bruce Dern) and his long-suffering family. Payne’s first films established the tone, but in pointedly satirical mode. His somewhat raucous debut, Citizen Ruth (1996), starred Laura Dern as a fixative-addicted young working-class woman who becomes a pawn in the American war over abortion. The follow-up, Election (1999), with Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick, was about a male teacher developing a kind of lust-hate obsession with a ferociously ambitious high school student; it was massively acclaimed on release, although you can’t imagine its scabrous humour getting it funded in today’s more sexually delicate climate. Payne is often considered a quintessentially male director, although the women in his films – like the duo played by Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen in Sideways, or June Squibb as the mother in Nebraska – tend to be made of much tougher stuff than the men. He has also created memorable female protagonists, in Citizen Ruth and in his episode for the portmanteau film Paris je t’aime (2006), about a middle-aged American woman discovering the French language. “Thanks for bringing that up,” he says when I mention it. “I appreciate that you watched it.” Well, it’s a beautiful vignette, I say. “Not least,” he smiles, “because it’s only six minutes long.” Even so, we tend to think of Payne as one of cinema’s specialists in troubled maleness. How often do middle-aged men come up to him and say they identify with his characters? “The only time that happened a lot was on Sideways. A lot of film critics” – he pauses to chuckle – “came up and said, ‘We really relate to that guy’.” Payne’s take on the workaday travails and existential anguish of generally humdrum middle-class Americans is insightful and tartly compassionate, although detractors often see his films as mocking or contemptuous. It’s the perennial discomfort one feels when successful artists create fictional characters with failed lives: there’s always the worry that, on some level, they’re saying, “There but for the grace of God…” “That’s too bad,” says Payne when I put this to him, with a slightly defensive edge to his voice, as if answering an inopportune seminar question. “So Dostoevsky writing about Raskolnikov living in a threadbare garret is condescending to that guy, ipso facto? I don’t buy that.” Well, Dostoevsky lived in a few garrets himself. OK, so perhaps the question is, does Payne feel a moral responsibility to his characters with respect to the way he depicts their lives? “Honestly, I just make it up and do what feels right. We [meaning him and Jim Taylor] just follow our noses and do what feels dramatic and funny and touching and interesting.” His benchmark is the American cinema of the 1970s. “It’s not about failures, it’s about real fucking people. Because we’re not having ‘heroes’, as apparently it’s supposed to be in mainstream American cinema these days. We’re trying to make 70s movies about just people who are struggling and having real lives. And yeah, we kind of know the middle-class milieu – Jim and I both come from that, and it just feels real to us.” If there’s a consistency to Payne’s work, it partly stems from that milieu. He was born and raised in Nebraska, although ironically Nebraska, the film sometimes assumed to be his most personal statement, is his only feature not to carry a Payne writing credit. He has Greek ancestry on both sides: his father ran a successful family restaurant in Omaha, then worked for the Department of Commerce, while his mother was a university teacher of French and Spanish. Payne is a founding board member of a nonprofit Omaha cinematheque that, he proudly announces, has recently expanded, having absorbed “a neighbourhood movie palace – indeed, the cinema I grew up in, the Dundee. It’s essentially the same, but we’re adding a bookstore, a cafe and a micro-cinema, for more outre fare, in the lobby.” Payne lives part of the time in Los Angeles but remains strongly connected with his native city. “It’s a delightful, delightful city. I have a home there and I’m proud of it and my wife and I are probably going to move back there for a few years in the spring, and I’ve just never wanted to lose touch with it. And there is a way in which each [city] keeps me sane from the other.” Payne’s confirmed localism goes together with a literate streak of cosmopolitanism, belying the fact that – apart from Downsizing’s climactic flit to Norway – his features are all set in the US. He studied Spanish at Stanford University, and spent time in Spain and Colombia as a student. He also speaks Greek: “As Jews go to Hebrew school, Greeks go to Greek school. I always heard it in my home between my mother and her friends, but then after school you get picked up and taken to the church and you learn Greek – modern, not ancient.” Whatever he does next, Payne hopes to break his own mould: “I can’t wait to do something different.” He’d like to make films in different countries and in different languages, if only “to get away from the machinery of American film-making. And I mean literally human and hardware machinery. Say I just want to just shoot you and me talking – there are 30 trucks downstairs.” As yet, however, he doesn’t know what his next move will be: “I just want to focus on having a new baby for a minute, and then…” he pauses. “The sky’s the limit.” As for how he imagines first-time fatherhood will affect him as a film-maker, “I guess time will tell. I’m 56 and doing this for the first time. I hope that my sense of human experience is deepened, and that it shows up in the work. Like anything new that comes your way, it’s an opportunity to be a better person in general. “I hope to be a good example for this tiny human. That kind of stuff. What else is there?” Downsizing is released on 24 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/13/best-yoga-meditation-retreats-fitness-breaks-mind-body","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T07:00:51Z","webTitle":"The best yoga, mindfulness and fitness breaks for 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/13/best-yoga-meditation-retreats-fitness-breaks-mind-body","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/13/best-yoga-meditation-retreats-fitness-breaks-mind-body","fields":{"headline":"The best yoga, mindfulness and fitness breaks for 2018","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Yoga Bamboo Yoga, Goa, India With so much choice in India – the birthplace of yoga – it’s hard to know where to start.

Young acknowledged on Tuesday that the Department for Education’s (DfE) claim that he had held teaching posts at two of the world’s most illustrious institutions, Harvard and Cambridge, were not accurate. “I taught undergrads at Harvard and Cambridge and was paid to do so but these weren’t academic ‘posts’ and I’ve never made that claim,” he told the Guardian. Defending Young’s appointment to the newly set-up Office for Students (OfS) on Monday, the department told the Guardian that his “diverse experience includes posts” at the institutions. In a separate statement, it said he was a “teaching fellow” at Harvard and a “teaching assistant” at Cambridge. Young was a student at those institutions when he carried out the work. It was also claimed that Young had been appointed ahead of people who appeared better qualified for the role – including the former chief prosecutor for north-west England, Nazir Afzal. Afzal said he was the pro-chancellor of one university and the governor of another, as well as holding a series of other relevant qualifications, but he did not get an interview. “Clearly, I wasn’t what they were looking for! He was,” Afzal posted on Twitter. The Cambridge classicist Prof Mary Beard said that for the DfE to portray Young’s role as an academic post “does not help the debate”, though she stressed that she was criticising neither the composition of the OfS board nor graduates who carry out supervision duties. Her former colleague Prof Tim Crane said Young had “no significant experience in universities since those few years in the 1980s, and the DfE should not pretend that he has”. Crane, now a professor of philosophy at the Central European University in Budapest, also sought only to criticise the DfE’s characterisation of Young’s background. He told the Guardian: “I don’t think Young is necessarily unqualified for this position. Bodies like this typically contain people from many professional backgrounds.” Young agreed, saying: “It’s customary for the boards of regulators to include some people with direct experience of working in the sectors they regulate and some people with other kinds of experience and the OfS is no different. If it just consisted of university professors the sector could be accused of marking its own homework.” In an interview with the editor of the Spectator, for which he also writes, Young cited his work with students at schools that do not regularly send students to Oxbridge, as well as his positions as a Fulbright commissioner and the head of the New Schools Network, a government-funded charity that promotes free schools. The DfE has also faced severe criticism over the appointment from those who say Young wrote in support of employing eugenics to weed out children deemed less likely to have high IQs. Young said that criticism was a “little misleading”, saying the article, written for the Australian periodical Quadrant in 2015, discussed technological advancement in the area and argued that any future developments should be made available on national health services, rather than only making them available to the rich. Others said Young had also attacked the use of wheelchair ramps in schools, as well as other measures to improve inclusivity, in a 2012 Spectator article. “Schools have got to be ‘inclusive’ these days,” he wrote. “That means wheelchair ramps, the complete works of Alice Walker in the school library (though no Mark Twain) and a Special Educational Needs Department that can cope with everything from dyslexia to Münchausen syndrome by proxy.” Young said on Tuesday that he was “using ‘inclusive’ in the broad sense to mean a dumbed down, one-size-fits-all curriculum, rather than the narrow sense of providing equal access to mainstream schools for people with disabilities. “I’ve absolutely nothing against inclusion in that sense.” Others highlighted various comments Young has made on Twitter about women’s bodies, suggesting they render him unsuitable for public office. On Tuesday, he said he regretted the “sophomoric, politically incorrect remarks” he made on Twitter. “I hope people will judge me on my actions.” Labour’s shadow higher education minister, Gordon Marsden, was one of those criticising Young’s appointment as a “huge missed opportunity” to make sure the OfS reflected the “diversity of the sector it must regulate”. He said the announcement had been “sneaked out over the new year” in an effort to avoid proper scrutiny. The Department for Education did not respond to requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/how-to-grow-chilli","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T11:00:50Z","webTitle":"How to grow chillies | Alys Fowler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/how-to-grow-chilli","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/how-to-grow-chilli","fields":{"headline":"How to grow chillies","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Let’s face it, January is a dark and dastardly month: sowing most things is pointless. But the exception is chillies. Sure, the seed packages say sow in March, but you want to be potting them on by then. The longer you give chillies to grow, the more fruit they’ll reward you with. Chillies originate from central and south America, with the Andes the principal area. From this we can understand a few of chillies’ true loves: warm sunny days (no higher than 29C), cooler nights (no lower than 10C), and dry conditions. The ideal temperature for germination is 28C, and thus requires a heated propagator with a snug lid. Chillies don’t like to dry out at the early stages of germination, but don’t like to sit in damp conditions, either. Chilli seed is often slow to germinate, and fungus has plenty of time to attack and kill the seeds. I find a thin layer of vermiculite over the seed is often the solution: it remains moist, but has good air porosity, which should keep moulds at bay. If you don’t have a propagator, you can get away with a radiator shelf or warm cupboard as long as you move the seeds to a sunny windowsill the minute they germinate. Using warm water on young seedlings when watering makes a huge difference to the speed of growth. Chillies are hungry and will need repotting regularly in spring until they find their final growing spot. They have an expansive fibrous root system that loves to roam. Repot every time white roots appear in the drainage holes. If you want lots of fruit, grow undercover or in the most sheltered and sunny outdoor space, such as against a south-facing wall. Chillies are broken down into five groups: Capsicum annuum, which includes bell peppers, wax, cayenne, jalapenos and chiltepin; C. frutescens, which includes tabasco and Thai peppers; C. chinense (hailing from east of the Andes) which includes naga, habanero and scotch bonnets; C. pubescens, which includes the perennials rocoto peppers; and C. baccatum, which includes aji peppers. I have met many peppers that make me weep, but never one that I have disliked. Behind the instant kick are fruity, earthy, smoky, bitter and sweet notes. Chilli lists are rather addictive, so here are a few of the best: Sea Spring Seeds in Devon, which includes their own British-bred chillies; Simpson Seeds has impeccable taste, as does South Devon Chilli Farm. All three offer excellent plug plants. Finally, The Real Seed Company has interesting rocotos and even an outdoor ripening chilli, tried and tested in Wales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/04/cost-of-living-squeeze-dents-uk-house-price-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T09:47:00Z","webTitle":"Cost of living squeeze dents UK house price growth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/04/cost-of-living-squeeze-dents-uk-house-price-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/04/cost-of-living-squeeze-dents-uk-house-price-growth","fields":{"headline":"Cost of living squeeze dents UK house price growth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"UK house prices increased just 2.6% in 2017 while prices in London fell for the first time in eight years, according to the leading mortgage lender Nationwide. This followed an increase of 4.5% in 2016 and was the slowest rate of annual growth since 2012, as households constrained by falling real pay grew increasingly reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. Nationwide said price growth was likely to slow further in 2018, to around 1-1.5%, against a backdrop of subdued economic growth and continued pressure on family finances. The average price of a UK home was £211,156 in December, when prices rose by 0.6% over the month. Prices in London fell by 0.5% last year, making the capital the weakest performing region for the first time since 2004, as more buyers were unable to afford to buy a home in the capital. “In London and the south-east, affordability has become even more challenging, with more people priced out of the market or needing to borrow a greater multiple of their income,” said Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. Gardner said it would take a typical buyer nearly 10 years to save for a deposit to buy a home in London, with the average price of a property at £470,922 at the end of last year. Prices rose in every UK region apart from London in 2017. The biggest riser was the West Midlands, where average prices rose by 5.2% to £182,861. It was followed by the south-west, where prices increased by 4.8% to £239,576. Nationwide said low mortgage rates, high employment levels and a shortage of properties on the market had prevented a bigger slowdown in UK house price growth in 2017. The lender said the outlook for the housing market in the year ahead was uncertain and highly dependent on the outcome of Brexit talks and the UK’s economic performance overall. “How the housing market performs in 2018 will be determined in large part by developments in the wider economy. Brexit developments will remain important, though these remain hard to foresee,” Gardner said. “The UK housing market has been characterised by significant regional disparities in house prices in recent years and it is not clear how Brexit will impact these dynamics.” Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, said 2018 would be “a very challenging year” for the housing market, partly because buyers would be concerned about the potential for higher mortgage costs, after the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade in November and indicated that further increases were likely. “Housing market activity remains under pressure from squeezed consumer purchasing power, fragile confidence and caution over engaging in major transactions,” Archer said. “Potential house buyers are also likely concerned about the possibility of further interest rate hikes in 2018 following November’s increase. We see house prices rising by a modest 2% in 2018.” Household finances have come under renewed pressure since the Brexit vote, which drove a sharp fall in the value of the pound and pushed up the price of goods imported from abroad. That in turn has pushed up inflation, currently running at 3.1%, which is well ahead of the Bank of England’s 2% target and above current pay growth of 2.3%, signalling a fall in real pay. The Mortgage Advice Bureau said the housing market in 2018 was likely to be similar to the market in 2017, with first-time buyers – particularly in London – struggling to get on the housing ladder. It expects regional variations to continue this year, with prices rising faster in some areas than others over the next 12 months. Nationwide said the variation in regional affordability had increased in the past decade. Affordability improved in Wales, Scotland and the north of England, but the biggest improvement was in Northern Ireland following the sharp fall in house prices, which are still around 40% lower than they were in 2007, before the financial crisis took hold. Prices in London however are 55% above their 2007 peak, while those in the north and Yorkshire and Humberside are still lower than they were in 2007. Alex Gosling, founder of the online estate agents HouseSimple.com, said UK house price growth of 2.6% in 2017 showed the housing market was “fundamentally in a very healthy state”. “Considering that Brexit doom-mongers predicted that property prices would plummet after the Brexit vote and article 50 being invoked, the housing market has proved surprisingly resilient in 2017,” he added. “The major surprise was undoubtedly the slowdown in London house prices. It’s been 13 years since the capital sat at the bottom of the house price growth table, and since then we have seen prices surge to unprecedented and unaffordable levels.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/04/anything-to-report-korean-hotline-reopens-with-little-to-say-between-foes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T06:38:27Z","webTitle":"'Anything to report?': Korean hotline reopens with little to say between foes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/04/anything-to-report-korean-hotline-reopens-with-little-to-say-between-foes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/04/anything-to-report-korean-hotline-reopens-with-little-to-say-between-foes","fields":{"headline":"'Anything to report?': Korean hotline reopens with little to say between foes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"After almost two years of stony silence, perhaps it was to be expected that the first phone call between officials from North and South Korea was slightly awkward – and brief. The first cross-border chat since the countries’ hotline reopened on Wednesday offered little of political substance. But it was a breakthrough of sorts. The moment that officially ended their estrangement didn’t quite go according to plan, though. When South Korean officials at the border village of Panmunjom called their North Korean counterparts at 9am on Thursday, they must have experienced the same sinking feeling that followed the twice-daily – and unanswered – calls they have made over the past two years. The phone rang but no one picked up. Happily, it turned out that the faltering restart to what many hope will be an inter-Korean détente – starting with the North’s participation in next month’s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics – was just a matter of poor timing. In August 2015, North Korea turned its clocks back 30 minutes to GMT+08:30. That is half an hour behind South Korea, and the same standard time it had observed before Japan colonised the Korean peninsula in 1910. The explanation for silence at the other end of the line on Thursday was simple: North Koreans had yet to start work for the day. At 9.30am a North Korean liaison official returned the call. Asked by his South Korean counterpart if he had anything to report, he replied “No,” according to Yonhap news agency. He added: “If we have anything to tell you, we will contact you.” The perfunctory exchange has not dampened Seoul’s hopes that the reinstatement of the hotline – which had been dormant since February 2016 – will soon result in a face-to-face meeting. After the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, recently offered to discuss sending a delegation to the Pyeongchang Games, to be held 80km (50 miles) south of the country’s border, Seoul proposed a high-level meeting at Panmunjom, the setting for previous inter-Korean negotiations, next Tuesday. Pyongyang has yet to respond to the offer. If the talks go ahead they will mark the first high-level contact between North and South Korea since December 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/04/xi-jinping-tells-army-not-to-fear-death-in-show-of-chinas-military-might","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T04:59:43Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping tells army not to fear death in show of China's military might","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/04/xi-jinping-tells-army-not-to-fear-death-in-show-of-chinas-military-might","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/04/xi-jinping-tells-army-not-to-fear-death-in-show-of-chinas-military-might","fields":{"headline":"Xi Jinping tells army not to fear death in show of China's military might","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his status as China’s most dominant leader since Chairman Mao with another tub-thumping display of military brawn involving thousands of heavily armed troops. Speaking at a military assembly in the northern province of Hebei, Xi told about 7,000 service men and women they should fear “neither hardship nor death” as they implemented the Communist party’s orders. The military should “create an elite and powerful force that is always ready for the fight, capable of combat and sure to win in order to fulfill the tasks bestowed by the Party and the people in the new era,” added Xi, who was recently anointed one of modern China’s most powerful rulers. “As Xi Jinping announced his instructions, there was prolonged and thunderous applause,” the party’s official newspaper, the People’s Daily, reported in a front-page story, alongside a photograph showing Xi clad in combat fatigues and black leather gloves. The newspaper claimed troops had gathered in 4,000 separate locations across China to hear their commander-in-chief’s decree. Turning to the scarlet flag of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), they vowed to “resolutely obey Chairman Xi’s order”. The Global Times, a nationalist, party-run tabloid, called Wednesday morning’s mobilisation – the latest in a series of high-profile military reviews in mainland China and Hong Kong – a “landmark” event. “This is the first time since the founding of the country that instructions on military training have been directly issued by the chairman of the CMC [Central Military Commission], and it shows that improving combat readiness is now a strategic mission for the Chinese military,” Xu Guangyu, a retired major general, told the newspaper. The event comes amid rumbling fears of a potential conflagration over the border in North Korea. On Wednesday US president Donald Trump used Twitter to taunt the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and his “depleted and food-starved regime”. “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote.

This is how much they helped","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At the start of 2017 when researching my book on the wellness industry, I signed up to a heap of podcasts, including one that dropped three self-development, wellness and life hack-themed shows into my feed each week. Sadly, I had a busy year, and listened to none of them – until last week. While holidaying on the Victorian coast between Christmas and New Year, I decided to cram in as many as I could. The podcasts covered everything from jiujitsu to journalling to cell-enhancing IV infusions to ketosis to psychedelics. What wisdom did they hold for the new year? And if you try to listen to 75 self-development podcasts in 10 days, could you actually become a better person? These are the lessons I learned from my wellbeing podcast binge. We are being controlled by our dopamine centres Many of the podcasts touched on how our addictions and bad habits were derailing us from our intentions – including social media addiction, sugar, alcohol and drugs. What all these things have in common is that they trigger the production of dopamine in the brain and, much like lab rats on cocaine, we just keep pushing the buttons that will give us another dose of pleasure. This can be caused by constantly checking Facebook for likes, or finishing a whole pack of Doritos even when we’re not hungry. In The Upgrade by Lifehacker, Dr Robert Lustig was helpful when talking about how habit-forming products are made. “What’s happening is we are more and more using our lizard brain than our cognitive brain. How do we fight that?” he asks. Habit-forming products are being made in everything from tech products to biscuits. “They give you an itch, they give you the scratch,” he said. He advises a range of solutions all starting with a “C”. “Connect” in person – go off Facebook, it causes serotonin depletion. “Contribute” something that helps the world. “Cope” by getting enough sleep (get rid of screens in the room while sleeping), mindfulness, exercise (great in alleviating depression); and “cook”, so you can see what is going in your food. Discipline equals freedom There is something vaguely fascist about this slogan, but does it hold the key to succeeding in New Year resolutions, such as getting fit and losing weight? Guest presenting the Tim Ferris Show, former US navy Seal Jocko Willink speaks at normal volume and tempo until partway through the podcast, when he starts screaming and sounding very tough. “Here’s the reality,” he shrieks, “that idea isn’t going to execute themselves, that book isn’t going to write itself, those weights out in the gym aren’t going to move themselves ... Stop researching every aspect and debating the pros and cons – do it now. Get after it. Here. And now.” But how? “Put your workout clothes out the night before. Set your alarm for 4.30 and when the alarm goes off – get urpppppp.” Yes, you have to get up at 4.30am every day to do exercise. The advantage is that you will have more time in the day to do other things, and psychologically you will feel proud because hardly anyone else is up. Also, you are less likely to want donuts for breakfast – instead, says Willink, you’ll be craving “clean fuel” such as “bacon and eggs”. Further exercise advice on the podcast feed comes from basketballer LeBron James in “Succeass! How I Did It”. LeBron gets up at 5am and exercises a minimum five times a week (as well as playing actual games). Sometimes he works out at home, sometimes he goes to Pilates, sometimes he does a spin class. He mixes it up. Journal On the Kevin Rose show, author Tim Ferriss says the three habits common to a lot of successful people he interviewed in his book Tribe of Mentors were meditation, walking and keeping a journal. It’s hardly ironman stuff but it’s where ideas and innovative thinking come from, apparently. Ferriss, who podcasts a lot about supplements, talks about hooking himself up to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide IV, in an effort to get the energy he had in his teens and 20s. During his IV sessions he experienced short-lived violent organ pain. I’ll take journalling! The Asian Efficiency podcast devoted more than an hour to journalling. If you do it consistently it can have a major social and psychological impact, according to the podcast.Whether in a REAL book or via an app, writing in a journal can help you identify the habits you want to create and track your progress. They help you understand what is going on in your life, so the flight or fight response isn’t triggered. Instead, journalling gives you distance and perspective on things that are happening in your life. Infidelity is not the problem, something else is the problem On the Tony Robbins podcast, relationships expert Esther Perel talks about why people cheat. It is often not the infidelity per se that is the problem, but the issues that brought the person to cheat. Cheating can be used as an opportunity to help us understand intimacy and the other person’s expectations, she says. My feed also includes a number of episodes from Perel’s podcast Where Should We Begin. The show, which is a recording of an unhappy couple’s therapy session, is a revelation.. In an episode titled I’ve Had Better, infidelity occurred because the couple stopped communicating in a deep way, and the wife had buried resentments towards the husband that hadn’t even been voiced.

A White House statement released on Wednesday evening said that Trump had signed an executive order dissolving the commission. The president put the blame for the panel’s failure on the many states that refused to cooperate with it by handing over voters’ sensitive personal data including name, address, party affiliation and voting history to the inquiry. Trump said he had made the decision to spare taxpayers the legal expense of fighting legal battles against the recalcitrant states. In the statement he repeated the factual inaccuracy that drove him to set up the commission in the first place, saying that he was dismantling the inquiry “despite substantial evidence of voter fraud”. After he won the presidential election in November 2016, Trump claimed that at least 3m illegal votes had been cast – the same number by which he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. That claim has never been substantiated, and in fact studies have found that more people are struck by lightning each year or attacked by sharks than are accused of election fraud. The ditching of such a high-profile initiative will come as a blow to the vice-president Mike Pence who chaired the commission, and especially to Kris Kobach, the ideological mastermind behind the inquiry and the nationwide wave of voter suppression it has inspired. Kobach was cited as the source of Trump’s conspiracy theory about 3m fraudulent votes in 2016. Voting rights advocates responded with delight to news of the demise of the commission. Vanita Gupta, former head of the civil rights division of the justice department under Barack Obama, heralded the announcement as a “big victory”. Jonathan Brater, counsel with the Democracy Program of the Brennan Center, told the Guardian that this was a “victory for voters who will no longer be threatened with a violation of their privacy. After spending large sums of taxpayer money and using up months of public officials’ time this was shown to be nothing but a farce.” The Brennan Center was at the forefront of resistance to the commission’s work. It lodged lawsuits in Indiana, Texas, and Utah seeking to prevent voters’ personal data being handed over to the inquiry in breach of those states’ own privacy regulations. By the end, eight states refused to hand over any data at all to Kobach and his team, and a further 12 gave some data but only under very tight restrictions. Though voting rights campaigners were rejoicing on Wednesday night, this is unlikely to be the end of the battle. Republican-controlled state assemblies continue to push for a range of hurdles to voter participation, from introducing voter-ID regulations to restricting the number of polling stations in poor and largely African American neighborhoods. Trump also gave a strong hint that he has not given up the fight. In his statement, he said that he had “asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action.” The DoJ is also probing election officials in individual states for information about how they manage voter rolls. The move is seen as a possible opening gambit in a push towards nationwide voter purges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/04/labor-anthony-albanese-lambasts-peter-dutton-playing-to-the-crowd-melbourne-comments","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T02:31:11Z","webTitle":"Labor lambasts Dutton for 'playing to the crowd' over Melbourne crime comments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/04/labor-anthony-albanese-lambasts-peter-dutton-playing-to-the-crowd-melbourne-comments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/04/labor-anthony-albanese-lambasts-peter-dutton-playing-to-the-crowd-melbourne-comments","fields":{"headline":"Labor lambasts Dutton for 'playing to the crowd' over Melbourne crime comments","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese has fired back at Peter Dutton for “playing to the crowd” over the home affairs minister’s comments that Victorians were too scared to go out to restaurants at night because of youth gangs. On Wednesday Dutton said politicians needed to identify Melbourne crime problems as “African gang violence”. “The reality is people are scared to go out to restaurants of a night time because they’re followed home by these gangs,” he said, without providing any evidence. On Thursday Albanese accused the minister of dog-whistling. “I think Peter Dutton has a serious office as the minister for home affairs,” he said. Albanese added he had seen no evidence of “reluctance” from the public to venture outside their homes. “He needs to treat that great honour with the dignity and with respect and with the gravitas that it deserves. And playing to the crowd on Sydney radio, about Melbourne, doesn’t make much sense. “It doesn’t actually do anything to address the real issues of crime that needs to be addressed, but we also need to put these things in perspective. “What we have seen on the latest figures is actually a drop for the first time in a 12-month figure of crime, here in Victoria, we have also seen year-on-year a continuous decline in youth crime here in Victoria. And people like Peter Dutton need to stop playing politics with what are serious issues and require serious responses.” Stories about alleged crime gangs involving African youth, particularly from the Sudanese community, have been dominating Victoria’s media, led by the Herald Sun. Senior Victorian police, while acknowledging the state has a youth crime problem, have stayed away from labelling offenders as part of a “gang”, stating they lack the organised structure associated with such groups. But that didn’t stopped the headlines. Then on New Year’s Day the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, launched the federal government’s attack against the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, criticising the Labor leader for his “failure” to tackle youth crime and gang violence. On Wednesday Dutton ramped up the rhetoric while speaking to Sydney radio station 2GB, claiming Andrews’s “politically correct” agenda had let down the state’s police and judiciary. Victoria’s minister for youth affairs, Jenny Mikakos, stridently criticised Dutton, and the media for reporting his “bullshit” comments “unchallenged”. Expanding on the theme, Mikakos accused the Liberal party of employing US president Donald Trump’s tactics of “manipulating the media by making outrageous statements guaranteed to get a run and then using their trolls to whip up social media”. With a state election due in November, Albanese said it was time for solutions, not politics. “What matters here is the police’s view of these issues. There is no doubt that there is a disproportionate number of African youth as a percentage of the population have engaged in committing crime,” he said. “That needs to be addressed. The commonwealth government could make a contribution by actually not cutting the AFP funds, as they have. “The commonwealth government could make a contribution by not cutting new migrant services as they have, support for people to get into employment and addressing those issues. “And the police should be given every support that they require and I know that the Andrews government is employing 3,000 additional police here in Victoria, and it deserves better than having a Queensland minister on Sydney radio, talking about Melbourne from a distance, just in order to score a political point. “The commonwealth government doesn’t have an agenda, all they have is politics and that is why the Turnbull government is flailing around looking for an issue. Peter Dutton needs to be a part of solutions, not just yelling about issues from a far distance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/04/trumps-outburst-against-bannon-removes-any-shred-of-presidential-decorum","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T00:23:51Z","webTitle":"Trump’s Bannon outburst removes any shred of presidential decorum | Richard Wolffe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/04/trumps-outburst-against-bannon-removes-any-shred-of-presidential-decorum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/04/trumps-outburst-against-bannon-removes-any-shred-of-presidential-decorum","fields":{"headline":"Trump’s Bannon outburst removes any shred of presidential decorum","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The sight of Donald Trump squabbling with his former strategist Steve Bannon bears a remarkable resemblance to two ferrets negotiating the inside of a sack. It seems the two men who engineered the “populist” takeover of the White House are rather less popular with each other than they used to be one year ago as they prepared to misrule the world. First, let’s correct the record. You may have been living under the mistaken impression that Bannon was an influential figure in Trumpworld. This is probably because Bannon was chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign and was considered the most influential political adviser inside the West Wing in the first months of Trump’s presidency. You probably continued to delude yourself about Bannon’s sway even after he was pushed out of the White House when you heard Trump saying this in the Rose Garden less than three months ago: “Well, I have a very good relationship, as you know, with Steve Bannon. Steve’s been a friend of mine for a long time. I like Steve a lot.” Like so many things that leave Trump’s mouth and worm their way into your mind, this is plainly fake news. Because as we discovered from Trump’s own statement to the press on Wednesday (not a tweet, and not the Onion, either), Bannon was in fact a braggadocious nobody who failed in life and has now gone insane. “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,” Trump said. “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating 17 candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party. Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look.” Can you feel the burn, Bannon? You will when you realize you’re just a selfish fraud who betrays the workers while having no talent of your own. “Steve doesn’t represent my base,” Trump continued, before the playground brawl ran out of recess time. “Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It was the only thing he does well.” It’s one thing for Bannon, a notoriously undisciplined blowhard, to settle scores with Trump’s family and friends in the latest napalm-fuelled book from Michael Wolff (no relation). It’s entirely another thing for Trump, another notoriously undisciplined blowhard, to respond in kind. One man is a washed-out political hack. The other is the 45th president of the United States. But judging from the conduct of the latter, it’s often hard to tell the difference. You might think the trigger for Trump’s outburst was Bannon saying that the campaign’s meeting with Russian government intermediaries in 2016 was “treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit”. That meeting included Trump’s son, Donald Jr, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. But then again, you’d be wrong. The trigger for the outburst is in fact Trump’s trigger-happy nature. It was, after all, just one day after he bragged about being ready to launch his nukes at North Korea with a button that is so much bigger and so much more radioactive than Kim Jong-un’s. As Hillary Clinton put it so memorably, Trump is too easily baited to be anywhere near the nuclear codes. He’s also too easily baited to be anywhere near a press release. The last time someone nailed Donald Trump quite so exquisitely, it was during the closing phase of the Republican primaries, which Bannon obviously missed because of his own incompetence. Ted Cruz unleashed an awesomely honest analysis of the man who would go on to become president, describing his freakishly obvious pattern of projecting his own failings on to others. “This man is a pathological liar,” Cruz said. “He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies … In a pattern that is straight out of a psychology text book, he accuses everyone of lying. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it … The man is utterly amoral.” That was only 18 months ago, which translates in Trump time to 18 dog years. Now Cruz loves Trump’s positions on Jerusalem and net neutrality, and shares hilarious Obama-mocking cookies with his son. Trump himself continues to describe his own conduct whenever he seeks to trash his opponents. It is hard, but not impossible, to condemn Bannon for pretending to be at war with the media while spending your time live-tweeting cable TV and yapping with friendly anchors from Fox News or passing reporters from the New York Times. It is also hard, but not impossible, to accuse Bannon of losing his mind when you have clearly lost your own. What does the Trump-Bannon bust-up mean for us all? First, this must surely qualify as a Guinness world record end to our new year’s hopes for a return to sanity or normalcy in 2018. But at the same time as dashing our hopes, it also must fill us with glee at the likely resurrection of that other avatar of slash-and-burn Trumpism: Anthony “the Mooch” Scaramucci. For who but the Mooch would accuse Bannon of promoting himself (and sucking his own genitals) instead of serving the great leader? Scaramucci has been telling friends that Trump wants him back in the White House, which would be a wonderful new year’s gift to column-writers the world over. In the meantime, we have this unsubtle back-and-forth between the Mooch and the cookie-loving Donald Jr on Twitter after the Trump-Bannon bust-up. “Minus the foul language The Mooch pretty much nailed it,” said the president’s genius son. Minus the national interest and any shred of presidential decorum, this would be an epically incendiary turn of events. Let’s prepare for the worst and hope for the best in this early dawn of Trump’s new year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/04/ama-calls-for-zero-tolerance-for-p-plate-and-l-plate-drivers-using-electronic-devices","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T06:32:03Z","webTitle":"AMA calls for 'zero tolerance' for P-plate and L-plate drivers using electronic devices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/04/ama-calls-for-zero-tolerance-for-p-plate-and-l-plate-drivers-using-electronic-devices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/04/ama-calls-for-zero-tolerance-for-p-plate-and-l-plate-drivers-using-electronic-devices","fields":{"headline":"AMA calls for 'zero tolerance' for P-plate and L-plate drivers using electronic devices","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Michael Gannon, says learner and provisional drivers are not being unfairly targeted in the association’s paper on distracted driving. The paper, which was released on Thursday, describes a driving licence as “a privilege, not a right” and calls for P-plate and L-plate drivers caught using mobile phones or electronic devices while driving to lose their licence for up to one year. “Greater controls need to be applied to L-plate drivers to ensure they meet their supervised driver training requirements, are supervised by a competent and experienced driver, and comply with logbook regulations,” the paper states. “Zero tolerance of P-plate and L-plate drivers who use mobile or electronic devices, or breach any road rules, should be enforced.” Gannon said drivers of all ages were guilty of using their phones while driving. “The difference with P-platers is they hold a provisional licence and it can and should be taken away from them if they are not showing early on in their driving careers proper respect for the roads,” he told Guardian Australia. “We have made specific calls about early drivers not to pick on one sector of society but to recognise people first learning to drive develop habits that will continue through their lives. They’re not experienced.” While fines and demerit point losses are determined by state and territory governments, Gannon called on the federal government to show leadership on the issue through Coag. The federal transport minister, Barnaby Joyce, said he welcomed the position paper but said he was uncertain that targeting learner drivers was the correct approach, with such a measure to disproportionately affect young people. “I’m not going to start saying that we should be banning people or banning provisional drivers for a year,” he told the ABC’s AM radio program. “I think there is already a penalty process in place and I’m only too happy to speak to my other Coag ministers about what they believe is a good national approach to this. “What I can say is that the campaign of trying to get – and I think everybody at some point in time has been guilty of it – to get electronic devices that can distract you from your attention to the road away from you is terribly important.” There have been 66 road deaths over the holiday period. According to the position paper, driver fatigue is one of the top three factors contributing to road deaths. The government should consider how to develop and introduce legislation around driver fatigue, the paper said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/04/arsenal-arsene-wenger-unsurprised-farcical-decision-on-penalty-chelsea-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T00:20:43Z","webTitle":"Arsenal’s Arsène Wenger unsurprised by ‘again a farcical decision on a penalty’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/04/arsenal-arsene-wenger-unsurprised-farcical-decision-on-penalty-chelsea-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/04/arsenal-arsene-wenger-unsurprised-farcical-decision-on-penalty-chelsea-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal’s Arsène Wenger unsurprised by ‘again a farcical decision on a penalty’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger made the extraordinary claim that he knew beforehand his Arsenal team would be the victim of a “farcical” refereeing decision as he continued to rage against perceived injustice at the hands of officials. The Arsenal manager watched his team draw 2-2 against Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium – thanks to a last-gasp Héctor Bellerín equaliser – but he was fuming when the referee, Anthony Taylor, awarded a penalty for the visitors, even though there was contact from Bellerín on Eden Hazard. The Chelsea forward scored to make it 1-1. Wenger had been raging since the award of a controversial penalty against his team at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, which in effect cost them two points. He has been charged by the Football Association for a post-match altercation with the referee, Mike Dean – he faces a touchline or stadium ban – but he not only vowed to contest that but launched a fresh complaint. “We got again a farcical decision on a penalty but we knew that, as well, before,” Wenger said. “So we have to deal with that. It is very frustrating that we are still sixth. Our recent performances have been top-quality but you have to say we have not been gifted with luck. “I will contest my charge 100%. You can listen to every interview I did [after West Brom] and I stick to everything I said without any problem. I am 35 years in football. “I know what I say after the game. And I stand up for what I said, no problem,” he said. Wenger’s tone turned darkly conspiratorial when he highlighted how Tottenham Hotspur’s first goal in their win at Swansea City on Tuesday night had been offside while they also might have had Davinson Sánchez sent off. “The referees get away with you, with the English press, always, no matter what they do,” Wenger said. “You have watched the game last night. You couldn’t read a line about it today. So nothing will change. So we have to deal with that and to live with that. “It was the Tottenham game against Swansea but nobody talks about it. So that means nothing will change.” The Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte, said: “I must be honest, I didn’t see the penalty. We must have respect for the decisions of the referee. “There’s frustration for coaches but we must accept the referee’s decisions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/04/homeless-charities-windsor-crackdown-royal-wedding","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T14:18:01Z","webTitle":"Theresa May opposes Windsor council leader over homeless people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/04/homeless-charities-windsor-crackdown-royal-wedding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/04/homeless-charities-windsor-crackdown-royal-wedding","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May opposes Windsor council leader over homeless people","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has publicly challenged a call by the leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead for police to take action against rough sleepers in the town ahead of the royal wedding later this year. The prime minister, who is the MP for Maidenhead, said she disagreed with comments made by Simon Dudley on Twitter and in a letter to the Thames Valley police and crime commissioner. Dudley said “an epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy” in Windsor was causing concern and presenting “a beautiful town in a sadly unfavourable light”. Asked about the remarks during a visit to a hospital in Camberley, May said: “I don’t agree with the comments that the leader of the council has made. “I think it is important that councils work hard to ensure that they are providing accommodation for those people who are homeless, and where there are issues of people who are aggressively begging on the streets then it’s important that councils work with the police to deal with that aggressive begging.” Thames Valley police have made it clear that they do not view legal action against rough sleepers and people begging on the streets to be effective, and have called for a multi-agency approach to find solutions to the causes of homelessness and destitution. Homeless charities have also said that antisocial behaviour powers should not be used against people sleeping rough but local authorities should instead provide help and advice. In a letter sent this week to the Thames Valley police and crime commissioner, Dudley suggested that the 1824 Vagrancy Act and the 2014 Antisocial Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act should be used against rough sleepers and people begging on the streets. In tweets posted while he was on holiday in the US over Christmas, the council leader said that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding in May “will focus minds. Due to tourism, Windsor is different and requires a more robust approach to begging.” He also claimed that people begging for money were “marching tourists to cash points to withdraw cash”. Thames Valley police tweeted in reply: “We deal with reports of begging proportionately but we have not had reports of anyone being marched to cashpoints to take out money.” The police also said: “We need to protect the most vulnerable in society by working together but each agency must understand its own unique responsibilities. Housing is the responsibility of the council but it is better that agencies work together so people don’t become homeless.” Charities working with the homeless said recourse to the law was not the answer. “Stigmatising or punishing [rough sleepers] is totally counterproductive,” said Greg Beales of Shelter. People sleeping on the street were “often at their lowest point, struggling with a range of complex problems and needs and they are extremely vulnerable, at risk from cold weather, illness and even violence”. He added: “They desperately need our help, support and advice to move off the streets into safety and, eventually, into a home.” Paul Noblet of Centrepoint said: “Begging and rough sleeping are two distinct issues, and it is not helpful to conflate the two. “The best way to help rough sleepers is to get them off the streets and into an environment where they can access the long-term support they need.” The Brett Foundation, a charity in Maidenhead, said it was “deeply disappointed” to hear that Dudley had “sought action against the homeless people in the royal borough, rather than seeking action to help them”. Daniela Boyd-Waters, a trustee of the foundation, said: “While we understand that begging can be intimidating, our services and our experience with these extremely vulnerable people highlight even more that they need help.” She acknowledged that “they may not accept help at first, because of their mental health problems, their potential drug/alcohol addiction and, more often than not, their pride”. But, she added: “It’s time for the council and the local community to tackle homelessness together. And not just remove the problem, but address the root cause of it and provide top level support to those who need it most.” Under the Vagrancy Act it is a criminal offence to sleep rough or beg. There were almost 1,500 convictions under the law in 2016, the Local Government Chronicle reported. The Antisocial Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act replaced antisocial behaviour orders with criminal behaviour orders. Last year the charity Crisis, which supports homeless people, said councils were increasingly targeting rough sleepers with criminal behaviour orders. It said that “while enforcement can help people move away from the street if used for genuinely antisocial behaviour, it should never be used for rough sleeping by itself and must be accompanied by meaningful support and accommodation. Without that, it makes it even harder for rough sleepers to get help.” Crisis said that 56% of rough sleepers surveyed by the charity said the experience of enforcement orders had added to their feeling of shame at being homeless, and a third said that enforcement had just made them move elsewhere to sleep. The charity’s chief executive, Jon Sparkes, said: “People shouldn’t be targeted simply for sleeping on the street. In fact, homeless people are far more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators, and rough sleepers are 17 times more likely to be victims of violence compared to the general public. They deserve better than to be treated as criminals simply because they have nowhere to live.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/03/ben-morgan-gloucester","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T19:01:14Z","webTitle":"Ben Morgan: ‘I have not thought about England, I’m focusing on Gloucester’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/03/ben-morgan-gloucester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/03/ben-morgan-gloucester","fields":{"headline":"Ben Morgan: ‘I have not thought about England, I’m focusing on Gloucester’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ben Morgan has not played for England since the defeat by Australia knocked the hosts out of the 2015 World Cup and, as his 100th appearance for Gloucester looms, he is at the only Premiership club overlooked by the national head coach, Eddie Jones, for his Brighton training camp this week. Not that the No8, who has won 31 caps, is dreaming about international rugby after making his latest return from injury. Morgan is hoping to make only his fifth start of the season at Northampton on Saturday having recovered from a calf problem and been restored to the side in last weekend’s victory over Sale. “I have not thought about England,” says Morgan, who turns 29 next month and has been a busy father of two since a daughter, Florence, was born in October. “I am very much focusing on Gloucester: I love being in the shirt and hope to get more opportunities. If we are successful it will breed success elsewhere and, while we have had a good start to the season, we have not been delivering performances that we are totally pleased with. There is definitely more to come from us.” Johan Ackermann, the Gloucester head coach, did not react indignantly to the snub by England, pointing out that national squads evolve and are no longer down to selectorial whims after a player makes a dazzling club appearance. He has challenged his England-qualified players to play at a consistently high standard to attract Jones’s attention, an approach Morgan agrees with. “It is up to players here to make sure we are putting markers down every week and more and more will get international honours,” says the No8. “We have got to keep plugging away. We were probably underrated at the start of the season and people are now starting to look at us as a team. We do not look outside what we are doing here, going from week to week.” Morgan only just made the England squad for the last World Cup after breaking an ankle at the beginning of 2015. “The injury wiped me out for some time and, although I was playing again after nine months, it was another year before I started to feel good again,” he says. “We have just passed the halfway mark in the Premiership and I have not had much involvement. I am very much aware that the boys have been grafting hard. I am looking forward to making a contribution.” If he plays at Franklin’s Gardens it will be his 99th appearance for the cherry and whites, the club he joined from the Scarlets in 2012. While in Wales Morgan worked as a part-time plumber before making his professional breakthrough and during his most recent injury lay-off he has been future-proofing his career, setting up a new company with his father called No8 Scaffolding. As he puts it, “Rugby isn’t for ever.” For now, though, he is focused on Northampton, where Gloucester have won seven times in the Premiership. They have risen under Ackermann from a side used to wallowing in the nether regions to one pressing for a first appearance in the play-offs for 10 years, almost swapping places with the Saints, who are 10th in the table after October’s visit to Kinsgholm sparked their current run of seven successive league defeats. “The majority of our squad have been together for some time and have been through some awkward patches,” says Morgan. “We have shown more resilience this season: bad experiences make you tougher and we have developed a new mind-set and culture through people who have come in. Winning is a habit and in the Premiership it is a hard one to get into because it is so competitive: the teams that finish at the top do not change that much across four or five years, as Exeter have shown. “Northampton, unfortunately for them, have hit a bit of a sticky patch and we do not want to be the ones they find their form against. They have a good squad and will at some point turn it round. We have to make sure it is not against us.” Gloucester have, in the prolonged absence of Morgan and the Wales and Lions flanker Ross Moriarty, blooded a number of players in the back row this season, leaving Ackermann with a selection dilemma. “Our whole squad is extremely competitive and that is what you want,” says Morgan. “It is all about working hard and being hungry. I have not had to change anything in particular under Johan. It is a freer style of rugby: we are looking to have the back-rowers in the wider channels to give you more opportunity to have a few carries against backs. It is about workrate and energy, simple fundamentals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/04/who-could-succeed-david-attenborough-when-he-retires","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T12:00:14Z","webTitle":"Who could succeed David Attenborough when he retires?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/04/who-could-succeed-david-attenborough-when-he-retires","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/04/who-could-succeed-david-attenborough-when-he-retires","fields":{"headline":"Who could succeed David Attenborough when he retires?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"David Attenborough has again raised the idea of his retirement, should his work start to become “substandard”. In 2014, Wendy Darke, then head of the BBC Natural History Unit, stated that she could not see “one person” ever taking over from Attenborough, whom she described as “a legend and an irreplaceable one-off. He is a storyteller without match, so we would never attempt to fill his shoes.” His various roles, she suggested, were likely to be distributed among a number of presenters, who would reflect the “need to continue to innovate and diversify”. Some of these hosts, she hinted, might be drawn from different academic disciplines. Tantalisingly, though, Darke has since left her post, replaced by Julian Hector, and it is not clear whether the idea still applies. If Hector is sensible, it will. Attenborough – musing to Radio Times this week about how long his career might continue – expressed separate concerns about restricted mobility preventing filming or vocal deterioration affecting his voiceovers. Such a brand is irreplaceable, especially in a TV era properly questioning monolithic opinion: Lord Kenneth Clark, solo host of the 1969 BBC art overview Civilisation, will be replaced in this year’s remake, Civilisations, by a trio: Mary Beard, David Olusoga and Simon Schama. If a post-Attenborough portfolio were to be similarly split, here are the obvious – and less obvious – contenders. Chris Packham The non-alphabetical list of a dozen key presenters on the BBC Natural History site gives Packham second position after Attenborough, suggesting his status as vice-president in any straight succession race. A three-decade TV career from The Really Wild Show to Earth Live certainly gives him the presenting credentials to take over the frequent-flyer frontman part of the Attenborough portfolio. A recent thoughtful autobiographical film, Chris Packham: Asperger’s and Me, revealed an interesting hinterland. Liz Bonnin Born in Paris to Trinidadian and French-Martiniquan parents, then brought up and educated in Ireland, Bonnin has a strikingly broad background and an equally diverse TV CV. After starting on Top of the Pops and RI:SE, she put her degree in biochemistry and masters in wild animal biography to use in shows such as Bang Goes the Theory and Super Smart Animals. Last year’s BBC One hits Galapagos and Wild Alaska Live saw her confidently conquer the crucial Attenborough skills of getting close to creatures and rhapsodising over geographic spectacle. Kevin Fong The presenter of several editions of BBC2’s Horizon and the ITV show It’s Not Rocket Science! is another converted scientist. As a consultant anaesthetist for London’s UCL hospitals, Fong is unlikely to be available for long, remote shoots but, as a clever populariser, could be an attractive part of a post-Attenborough team approach. Lucy Cooke Inspired to study zoology by Attenborough’s landmark 1979 series Life on Earth – and taught at Oxford by the likes of Professor Richard Dawkins – Cooke has a useful double inheritance from the highest-profile science broadcasters of the times. Her TV work – including Amazing Animal Births on ITV and Nature’s Miracle Orphans for BBC One – is more sentimentally anthropomorphic than Attenborough’s approach, but she seems a likely part of any post-Attenborough strategy. Brian Cox It has been a recent BBC habit to move expert presenters from their core specialism to another, with Lucy Worsley and Simon Schama shifting from history to arts. BBC managers have intermittently hinted at a similar solution to filling the post-Attenborough hole. If so, the charismatic, accessible Lancastrian astrophysicist would be a good bet to shift his televisual gaze from the stars and planets to the Earth and sea beneath. Richard Mabey As a concession to his age and increasing frailty, some later Attenborough series, such as Blue Planet, involve him as writer-narrator rather than reporter. If this line of work were ever to continue without him – and Blue Planet is currently one of the most bankable franchises in TV – it seems most likely that a BBC selection committee would opt for Stephen Fry or Michael Palin. However, the 76-year-old Mabey would make a fascinating wildcard; he is one of our greatest nature writers, through dozens of books including Flora Britannica and Food for Free. Probably only he could contribute commentaries to match the gravitas and knowledge of Attenborough’s. Prince Charles A long shot, and likely to divide the audience. But, if the Queen carries on long past the retirement of her fellow nonagenarian Attenborough, an increasingly desperate Charles may eye a holding job as successor to another notable advocate for environmentalism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/04/syrian-groups-urge-un-boycott-of-putin-hosted-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"Syrian groups urge UN boycott of Putin peace conference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/04/syrian-groups-urge-un-boycott-of-putin-hosted-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/04/syrian-groups-urge-un-boycott-of-putin-hosted-conference","fields":{"headline":"Syrian groups urge UN boycott of Putin peace conference","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Dozens of Syria’s leading civil society groups have warned that a planned Russian-sponsored conference is seeking to bypass the UN-led peace process and will entrench President Bashar al-Assad in power. The 120 organisations inside the Working Group for Syria are urging Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, not to attend the conference set for the end of January, saying it would represent a “dangerous departure from the [UN-led] Geneva process”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is set to host a two-day Syrian Congress on National Dialogue in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, and is planning to send out over 1,700 invitations to Syrian groups, including to some members of the Syrian official opposition. Many opposition groups have already said they will not attend. De Mistura has not definitively confirmed whether or not he will attend, and said he is opposed to anything that cuts across the UN process. But de Mistura may not want to alienate Putin by boycotting the talks since he needs Russia to put pressure on Assad to show flexibility if the stalled UN talks are to make progress. The last round of talks ended in failure before Christmas as the Assad regime refused to negotiate and instead focused on chalking up continued military victories. The Working Group for Syria’s president, Bassam al-Kuwaitii, claimed the Sochi conference was designed to set up a process to ratify minor constitutional changes that will leave Assad in power prior to Syrian elections conducted on the same undemocratic basis as previous elections held by the regime. “The very fact that the congress is to have 1,700 attendees over two days shows that no genuine negotiations are planned,” he said. In a joint statement, the working group said: “Russia’s military intervention in Syria and its repeated use of the veto at the United Nations security council makes Russia a party to the conflict. Given its actions in Syria, Russia cannot be regarded as either a neutral mediator or a fair convener of a national dialogue process. The only process that is legitimate or credible is the UN-led process.” The working group’s fear is that de Mistura by attending the Sochi event will lend credibility to a process that will reject the long-established UN goal of starting a new constitutional era with the appointment of a fresh transitional government. The working group said it is critical that the UN continues to reaffirm the primacy of existing security council resolutions on Syria, “which established a clear sequencing for a credible political process, starting with political transition, followed by a constitutional referendum and free and fair elections”. Russia insisted that Sochi is a complement to the Geneva process, but has been less clear why it wants to start a new parallel process sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran. The Sochi conference is also seen as a diplomatic showpiece to demonstrate Putin’s ability to wield influence in the Middle East ahead of Russia’s presidential elections in March. But its preparation has also become bogged down in an increasingly open dispute between Turkey and Russia, two of the conference sponsors. Russia has given assurances to Kurdish People’s Protection Units that Syrian Kurds will be entitled to attend the conference, even though the exact status under which they would appear is unclear. Turkey fiercely opposes the attendance of the main Kurdish groups in Syria, saying the military forces are under the same command structure as those fighting for independence inside Turkey. In a further dispute with Russia, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, reaffirmed late last month Turkey will not countenance Assad remaining in power. He said: “It is definitely not possible to move ahead in Syria with al-Assad … How can we embrace the future with a Syrian leader who has killed nearly one million of his citizens?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/feb/07/weatherwatch-hard-times-in-the-bitter-winter-of-1947","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T21:30:09Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: hard times in the bitter winter of 1947","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/07/weatherwatch-hard-times-in-the-bitter-winter-of-1947","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/feb/07/weatherwatch-hard-times-in-the-bitter-winter-of-1947","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: hard times in the bitter winter of 1947","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I’m (just) too young to remember the big freeze of 1962-63, the hardest winter of the 20th century. But my late mother used to tell me about what she remembered as an even worse winter: 1946-47. There were two reasons why this winter was so tough. The second world war had ended less than two years earlier, and food rationing was still in force. Another reason the cold weather hit people so hard was that it came so late. December 1946 and January 1947 were chilly, but nothing out of the ordinary. But February 1947 was one of the coldest months on record. The effect on people was bad; for Britain’s birdlife it was catastrophic. Small birds need to eat between one third and one quarter of their body weight each day just to survive; and as the winter went on, their fat reserves were used up. So, when the freeze began, they were already at a dangerously low ebb. Finally, around the middle of March, the snow and ice began to melt and the weather returned to normal. But by then, tens of millions of birds were dead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-michael-wolff-book-highlights","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T20:37:47Z","webTitle":"Ivanka seeks the presidency – and other big claims from explosive new book","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-michael-wolff-book-highlights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-michael-wolff-book-highlights","fields":{"headline":"Ivanka seeks the presidency – and other big claims from explosive new book","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The publication on Wednesday of excerpts from a new book on the Trump administration, first by the Guardian and then by New York magazine, brought to light a host of explosive reports of internecine fighting and organisational chaos at the heart of the US presidency. Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, by the former Guardian columnist and Rupert Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff, will be published in full next Tuesday. In December, he told the Guardian that in his approach to researching the book he had been “not particularly hostile”. “That allowed me to get them to be relatively open,” he said. Among other things, the book reveals that former Trump campaign chair and White House strategist Steve Bannon believes an infamous June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and Russians offering incriminating information about Hillary Clinton at Trump Tower was “treasonous”, “unpatriotic” and “bad shit”. Bannon also reportedly believes that Donald Trump knew of the meeting and met the Russians involved – the president has denied this – saying: “The chance that Don Jr did not walk these jumos up to his father’s office on the 26th floor is zero.” Wolff also reports a conversation between the president-elect and Rupert Murdoch about immigration policy that allegedly led the media mogul to label Trump “a fucking idiot”. The revelations drew a remarkably forceful White House statement, in which Trump said: “When he was fired he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.” By any standard, Wolff’s book has had an extraordinary impact for an as yet unpublished work. Here are some other highlights: The president’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, reportedly made a deal about which of them would one day run for president. Wolff writes: “The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump.” Of Bannon’s activities after leaving the White House, Wolff writes: “Bannon was telling people something else: he, Steve Bannon, was going to run for president. The locution, ‘If I were president …’ was turning into, ‘When I am president …’” Wolff also writes that Bannon has courted top Republican donors, “doing his best, as he put it, to ‘kiss the ass and pay homage to all the gray-beards’”. Infighting among staff reportedly often featured a group including Kushner, Ivanka and the economics adviser Gary Cohn against a faction led by Bannon. Wolff quotes Richard Nixon’s national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, as saying: “It is a war between the Jews and the non-Jews.” Wolff writes that Thomas Barrack Jr, a billionaire who is one of the president’s oldest associates and was reportedly wanted by Trump to be his chief of staff, allegedly told a friend: “He’s not only crazy, he’s stupid.” On Wednesday, Barrack denied saying that. Asked by Fox News chief executive Roger Ailes what Trump had “gotten himself into with the Russians”, Wolff writes, Bannon answered: “Mostly, he went to Russia and he thought he was going to meet Putin. But Putin couldn’t give a shit about him. So he’s kept trying.” In discussing whom to appoint as Trump’s national security adviser, Wolff writes, Ailes promoted the former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, whom he reportedly called “a bomb thrower” and “a strange little fucker”. Bannon, however, reportedly counselled that Bolton’s moustache would be “a problem”. No one in the Trump campaign expected to win the presidency, Wolff writes, and most including Trump saw his run as leverage for careers in television or politics. Melania Trump, Wolff claims, was horrified by the prospect of victory. When on election night it became clear Trump could indeed beat Clinton and take the White House, according to the book “Melania was in tears – and not of joy”. The first lady’s communications director rejected that account and said: “The book is clearly going to be sold in the bargain fiction section.” Trump’s first Muslim travel ban, issued to chaos and protest at airports across the US, caused consternation among White House staff. Bannon reportedly said the ban was published late on a Friday precisely to anger and provoke liberals, “so the snowflakes would show up at the airports and riot”. Trump reportedly argued with the Secret Service over whether he could have a lock on his bedroom – “the first time since the Kennedy White House that a presidential couple had maintained separate rooms”, Wolff writes – and told housekeeping he would strip his own bed and leave his shirts on the floor. Wolff also says the president, who is known to fear being poisoned, told no one to touch his toothbrush. Kushner reportedly offered to marry the TV hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough – then lunch dates for Trump, now regular critics – because he said he was “an internet Unitarian minister”. Disloyalty among the president’s staff was reportedly mirrored by the president himself. Wolff says Trump called Bannon disloyal and scruffy, Priebus weak and short, Kushner a suck-up, press secretary Sean Spicer stupid and adviser Kellyanne Conway a crybaby. Jared and Ivanka, the president reportedly said, should never have come to Washington.

British racing insiders spent the day reacting to a report the collective debts of the group amount to over £1m, with one saying he saw that as a conservative estimate. A spokesman for the billionaire Qatari owners has admitted unspecified debts have been outstanding for months and offered a general apology to those affected. He insisted all sums would be paid in the near future, after the completion of what appears to have been a lengthy financial review. However, the trainers who looked after the scores of horses that carried Al Shaqab’s colours last year have heard such promises before. “We have had previous assurances, along the lines of: ‘Yes, it’ll be fine, please bear with us.’ This latest one does appear to be a little bit more concrete,” one said. Another of those involved claimed several trainers are now owed “significant six-figure sums”. He said: “There are not many businesses that could survive this kind of debt for any length of time and we are approaching the end of our tether.” One trainer has sent Al Shaqab’s horses back and will no longer train for the group. Another said: “It’s an unfortunate situation that has put us all in some difficulty. Obviously there must be money. They’re one of the richest states in the world. I don’t know what the problem has been. I’ve had to ask my bank to extend the overdraft.” However, not everyone has been made to wait. Two trainers reported Al Shaqab had paid them recently while Newbury, where Al Shaqab sponsors the Lockinge Stakes, said: “All of our commercial dealings have been satisfactory to us.” The fact Al Shaqab should have caused such a crisis for those it deals with is astonishing and likely to be a source of embarrassment to Sheikh Joaan, a member of Qatar’s ruling al-Thani family and a brother of the Emir, particularly since part of the aim of Al Shaqab was to promote Qatar overseas. A source told the Guardian the problem had been “a middle-management cock-up” and expressed the hope Sheikh Joaan would now step in to sort it out, his attention having been occupied by Qatar’s diplomatic crisis. Several other countries in the region have severed relations and imposed a trade embargo. That was specifically ruled out as a contributing factor to the debt problem by Khalifa al-Attiya, Al Shaqab’s general manager, said. “The blockade against Qatar had many consequences socially and politically but not for this situation,” he said. “This is purely an issue due to the financial review taking a longer then expected time. “We do apologise and it is not something we wanted to happen or take lightly. We are in the middle of restructuring the whole organisation.” He said all invoices would be paid “in the coming weeks”. While Al Shaqab have made themselves a difficult client for many, they are also valued as a rare source of top-class racehorses, just one of which might transform a trainer’s fortunes. For that reason most trainers are unwilling to end relations, even when their businesses have been undermined by slow payment. After only four years in the game Al Shaqab has owned the dual Arc winner Treve, the Guineas winner Galileo Gold and classy milers like Toronado and Olympic Glory. The British Horseracing Authority said: “While we would not comment on speculation surrounding individual cases, more generally the rules allow for the BHA to mediate on any dispute over unpaid training fees when a complaint is raised to the BHA and where a training agreement exists between the owner and trainer.” But it is understoodno such complaint has been made about Al Shaqab."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/03/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T21:00:11Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/03/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/03/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• An opinion piece said that people who do not pay the TV licence fee “still go to prison for the crime”.

Young? Ethnically diverse? Evenly matched between the genders? What about a typical Conservative party member. Retired? Middle class? Likely to be male? Next consider a typical Liberal Democrat and a typical Scottish National party member. If, overall, you have conjured up a group of people who are not at all similar to one another, new research suggests you have got it wrong. According to the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London, the people who join Britain’s political parties all have an awful lot in common, in spite of their partisan differences. The members of Britain’s four main parties are, in fact, all more likely to be male, to be middle class and to be older. Jeremy Corbyn may have rocked Glastonbury but the average age of Labour members (53) is not far off that of the Tories (57). Labour is the closest to gender parity, the researchers find, but they are just as white as the Conservatives, while all four parties are overwhelmingly middle class, especially the Tories and Lib Dems. With the obvious exception of the SNP members, they are all also more likely to live in London and the rest of southern England than the Midlands, the north, Wales and Scotland. These are uncomfortable findings for parties that claim to represent the nation as a whole, because it isn’t so. The party memberships have something else in common. On average they place themselves closer to the extremes – more leftwing in the case of Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP, more rightwing in the case of the Tories – than they place their own party or their voters. This is especially true of Labour and the Conservatives. But the findings therefore illustrate something else – that the gulf between the Labour tribe and the Tory tribe is particularly vast, and that most voters are closer to the middle. Think about that too. Political differences between the different memberships are stark. In most cases, the Tory members think one thing, while the members of all the other three parties think something at the other end of the spectrum. The differences between the three non-Tory parties are small – whether on austerity, redistribution, big business, and on social or moral questions too, including immigration. On all these issues, the gulf between Tory members and the other three parties is huge. That’s another finding with big implications. But the most urgently potent of these differences concerns Brexit. Members of Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP are as one in opposing tighter migration controls on EU citizens after Brexit, in wanting to stay in the single market and customs union and in supporting a second referendum on the Brexit deal. Most Tory members take the opposing position on every issue. The message of these findings is especially important for the Labour party. They show that Labour at the grassroots, members as well as voters, is overwhelmingly the anti-Brexit and soft Brexit party. More than 85% of Labour members want to stay in both the single market and the customs union. Add in the one-in-four Tory members who agree, plus the over 90% of Lib Dem and SNP members who share these views, and it seems a majority of all party members want to stay in both EU bodies. When MPs and peers return for a fateful Brexit-dominated parliamentary year next week, they can stand up for the country – and their members too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/03/rail-passengers-must-come-before-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T18:05:51Z","webTitle":"Rail passengers must come before profits | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/03/rail-passengers-must-come-before-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/03/rail-passengers-must-come-before-profits","fields":{"headline":"Rail passengers must come before profits","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s outrageous that Chris Grayling plans to bail out Virgin Trains East Coast by up to £2bn – Labour is absolutely right to stand up for passengers (Tom Watson calls on Chris Grayling to quit over ‘grubby’ East Coast rail deal, 31 December).

The alarm was raised only several hours later at the palace, known as the Palazzo Ducale in Italy, in central Venice at one end of Saint Mark’s Square. “We are clearly dealing here with two skilled professionals who managed to pull off their feat despite all the display rooms being fitted with technologically highly sophisticated [alarm] systems,” said the chief police commissioner, Vito Gagliardi. The Al Thani Collection comprises 270 pieces of Indian and Indian-inspired jewellery and precious stones, spanning 400 years from the Mughal period to the present. It was assembled by Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani and now belongs to Qatar’s ruling family. Forbes magazine has said: “There is no comparable collection on the planet.” The Venice exhibition was due to close on Wednesday, the latest stop in a tour that has brought the collection to the Grand Palais in Paris, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Metropolitan in New York and the Miho Museum near Kyoto, Japan. A spokesman for the collection, John Maxse, said it was in contact with Italian authorities and Venice’s Foundation of Civic Museums, which runs the Doge’s Palace. In a statement, the foundation said the stolen brooch and earrings were “contemporary pieces and consequently are of less historical value than other items in the collection”. Venice police said that since the items were unique they would be nearly impossible to sell on the market."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/03/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T21:56:23Z","webTitle":"Hectór Bellerín makes late amends for Arsenal after Chelsea comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/03/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/03/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Hectór Bellerín makes late amends for Arsenal after Chelsea comeback","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger strode purposefully towards the fourth official, Craig Pawson. The Arsenal manager was a long way from his technical area and there was steam coming out of his ears. His team were in the lead, thanks to Jack Wilshere’s goal, which, after all the midfielder’s injury misery, was a beautiful moment for him. But the referee, Anthony Taylor, had pointed to the penalty spot and all of Wenger’s conspiratorial pre-match fears had seemingly been realised. Wenger had railed against poor officiating against his team this season and Taylor always stood to be a central character. Wenger had clashed with him last January to earn a four-match touchline ban. There was no injustice here. Hectór Bellerín’s lunge at Eden Hazard inside the area was not just ill-advised, it was reckless. He caught Hazard’s foot, the Chelsea forward went down and, if the fall seemed exaggerated in real time, Taylor’s decision was vindicated with every replay. Hazard beat Petr Cech from the penalty spot and things came to look even more bleak for Wenger and Arsenal when the Chelsea substitute, Davide Zappacosta, rinsed the inexperienced wing-back, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, to cross for Marcos Alonso, who touched home in front of the flat-footed Shkodran Mustafi. Enter Bellerín, again. In stoppage time, at the other end. After Alonso had only half-cleared with a header, Bellerín crashed a half-volley goalwards and it was still rising when it ripped into the net. On this occasion, his timing was glorious. Arsenal did their best to throw it away. Not for the first time their patched-up back-line evaporated into the night sky and there was Álvaro Morata, running on to a simple long ball, with only Cech to beat. He could not do so – the goalkeeper stood up to make his most important save of the game – and Zappacosta rattled the rebound against the crossbar. Wenger looked shot to pieces at full-time, overtaken by the emotion, and he saw conspiracy at every turn. He wanted to talk about the spectacle and how entertaining it had been, which was certainly true. Why could we not discuss the football alone? In the next breath he was throwing around some pretty serious accusations about how he knew his team would be punished by the referee. Again. This was the latest harum-scarum Emirates Stadium ride – after the 3-1 loss to Manchester United and the 3-3 draw against Liverpool. The common denominator has been Arsenal’s defensive looseness and their desire to engage their opponents in a toe-to-toe slugfest. Wenger’s team have played with so little control and structure that it has been difficult to argue their wounds have not been self-inflicted. It would have been worse had it not been for Morata, who endured a torrid evening. The Chelsea striker’s first one-on-one chance came on 14 minutes after Calum Chambers had inexplicably ducked underneath Victor Moses’s hopeful punt forward and Mustafi had melted away. Suddenly Morata was in and he opened up his body for a side-footed finish. He botched it horribly. Morata would also shoot high after brushing past Chambers in the 68th minute. The angle was tighter than his other openings but it remained a glaring miss. Wenger’s hand had been forced by the injuries to Laurent Koscielny, Nacho Monreal and Sead Kolasinac, and his callow replacement back-line was jittery throughout. But Wenger is not the sort of guy to dwell on defending. His focus, as usual, was on what his team could create. They enjoyed a purple patch leading up to the midway point of the first half and they would have led were it not for the reflexes of Thibaut Courtois. He tipped Alexis Sánchez’s shot on to the inside of his right-hand post and watched the ball run across his line, kiss the other post and spin to safety. The Chelsea goalkeeper then saved from Alexandre Lacazette after the striker had spun sharply away from Gary Cahill. The thrills and spills were plentiful – together with the belly laughs. Maitland-Niles provided one of the latter when he clipped his own heel inside the Chelsea area on 16 minutes and went down. He was lucky to escape a yellow card. Wilshere, who was booked for a foul on Cesc Fàbregas, flirted with a second caution when he went to ground too easily from a challenge by Andreas Christensen. He might not have been on the field to score his goal – a thumping, first-time, left-footed drive. Hazard shimmered with menace while Fàbregas twice teed up Tiémoué Bakayoko before the interval with sumptuous passes. From the first Bakayoko saw Cech tip over while he did not read the second. Fàbregas shot high when well placed on 45 minutes but he was otherwise excellent. When he was substituted some of the Arsenal supporters rose to applaud him. Fàbregas played in Hazard early in the second half only for Cech to save while Courtois denied Lacazette at the other end. Mesut Özil had gone close before Wilshere bludgeoned Arsenal into the lead, after Rob Holding’s low pass had flicked off Morata. Lacazette promptly worked Courtois but the game would turn sharply on the Chelsea penalty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/05/2018-scientific-breakthroughs-quantum-computers-space","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T11:30:11Z","webTitle":"Will 2018 be a year of scientific breakthroughs – or frustrations? | Philip Ball","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/2018-scientific-breakthroughs-quantum-computers-space","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/2018-scientific-breakthroughs-quantum-computers-space","fields":{"headline":"Will 2018 be a year of scientific breakthroughs – or frustrations?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Quantum computers This will be the year when we see a quantum computer solve a computational problem that conventional computers can’t, using the rules of quantum mechanics to manipulate data, potentially making them much more powerful than classical devices. Many researchers think that the prototype devices built during the past year will soon be able to achieve “quantum supremacy” – the solution of a task that would take a classical computer an impractical length of time. This doesn’t mean that quantum computers are yet ready to take over the computer industry, but this will be the year that they start to become a genuine commercial proposition. Quantum internet Using quantum rules for processing information has more advantages than just speed. These rules make possible some tricks that just aren’t imaginable using classical physics. Information encoded in qubits (units of quantum information) can be encrypted and transmitted from a sender to a receiver in a form that can’t be intercepted and read without that eavesdropping being detectable by the receiver, a method called quantum cryptography. China has developed “quantum-capable” satellites that could ultimately host an international, ultra-secure “quantum internet”. Many experts put that at a decade or so off, but we can expect more trials – and inventions – of quantum network technologies this year. RNA therapies The announcement last month of a potential new treatment for Huntington’s disease, an inheritable neurodegenerative disease for which there is no known cure, has broad implications. The preliminary tests showed a lowering in the levels of toxic proteins in the brain, suggesting that the method might work for other dementia-related conditions. Gene-editing therapies Diseases with a well defined genetic cause can potentially be cured by replacing the mutant genes with properly functioning, healthy ones. That’s the basis of gene therapies, which have been talked about for years but have so far failed to deliver. The discovery in 2012 of a set of molecular tools, called CRISPR-Cas9, for targeting and editing genes with great accuracy has revitalised interest in attacking such genetic diseases at their root. But is the method safe enough for human use? Clinical trials kicked off last year, particularly in China but also in the US. It should start to become clear this year just how effective and safe these procedures are. High-speed X-ray movies X-rays are used to figure out the structures of biological molecules, an important element in drug design. A new “X-ray free-electron laser” in Hamburg, inaugurated in September, is the fastest and brightest of these sources of intense X-rays to date, capable of taking high-speed movies of such molecules in action. Two others in Switzerland and South Korea are starting up, too, and another at Stanford in California is getting an ambitious upgrade. As these instruments host their first experiments in 2018, researchers will acquire a new window into the molecular world. A hundred thousand genomes By the end of 2018 the private company Genomics England, set up by the UK Department of Health, should have completed its goal of reading the genetic information in 100,000 genomes of about 75,000 volunteers. Given so much data, it should be possible to identify gene mutations linked to cancer and to some of the many thousands of known rare diseases – information that could point the way to new therapies and drugs. Beyond the standard model The so-called standard model of particle physics, which accounts for all the known particles and forces in nature, was completed in 2012 with the discovery of the Higgs boson using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, at Cern in Switzerland. The trouble is, it can’t be the whole story. What’s now needed is some clue from particle-smashing experiments for how to extend the standard model: some glimpse of particles, forces or effects outside the current paradigm. Researchers were hoping that the LHC might have supplied that already – in particular, many anticipated finding support for the theory called supersymmetry, which some see as the best candidate for the requisite new physics. But so far there’s been zilch. If another year goes by without any chink in the armour appearing, the head-scratching may turn into hair-pulling. Crunch time for dark matter That’s not the only embarrassment for physics. It’s been agreed for decades that the universe must contain large amounts of so-called dark matter – about five times as much as all the matter visible as stars, galaxies and dust. This dark matter appears to exert a gravitational tug while not interacting significantly with ordinary matter or light in other ways. But no one has any idea what it consists of. Experiments have been trying to detect it for years, but all have drawn a blank. The situation is becoming grave enough for some researchers to start taking more seriously suggestions that what looks like dark matter is in fact a consequence of something else – such as a new force that modifies the apparent effects of gravity. This year could prove to be crunch time for dark matter: how long do we persist in believing in something when there’s no direct evidence for it? Return to the moon In 2018, the moon is the spacefarer’s destination of choice. Among several planned missions, China’s ongoing unmanned lunar exploration programme called Chang’e will enter its fourth phase in June with the launch of a satellite to orbit the moon’s “dark side” (which permanently faces away from the Earth, although it’s not actually in perpetual darkness). That craft will provide a communications link to guide the Long March 5 rocket that should head out to this hidden face of the moon in 2019, carrying a robotic lander and rover vehicle to gather information about the mineral composition of the moon, including water ice in the south polar basin. It’s all the prelude to a planned mission in the 2030s that will take Chinese astronauts to the lunar surface. Voyage to Mercury Exploration of the solar system won’t all be about the moon. The European Space Agency and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency are collaborating on the BepiColombo mission, which will set off in October on a seven-year journey to Mercury, the smallest planet in the solar system and the closest to the Sun. BepiColombo should provide information not just about the planet itself but also about the formation of the entire solar system. Mapping the brain It’s sometimes said that understanding outer space is easier than understanding inner space. The human brain is arguably the most complex object in the known universe, and while no one seems to be expecting any major breakthrough in our view of how it works, we can expect to reach next Christmas with a lot more information. Over the last summer the €10bn European Human Brain Project got a reboot to steer it away from what many saw as an over-ambitious plan to simulate a human brain on a computer and towards a more realistic goal of mapping out its structure down to the level of connections between the billions of individual neurons. One vision is to create a kind of Google Brain, comparable to Google Earth, in which the brain structures underpinning such cognitive functions as memory and emotion can be “zoomed” from the large scale revealed by MRI scanning down to the level of individual neurons. • Philip Ball is a science writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-steve-bannon-lost-his-mind","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T21:24:58Z","webTitle":"Trump hits back at Steve Bannon: 'When he was fired, he lost his mind'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-steve-bannon-lost-his-mind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-steve-bannon-lost-his-mind","fields":{"headline":"Trump hits back at Steve Bannon: 'When he was fired, he lost his mind'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump lashed out at his former chief strategist Steve Bannon on Wednesday, accusing him of having “lost his mind” after the one-time aide made explosive accusations against the president and his family in a new book. “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,” Trump said in a statement released by the White House. “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating 17 candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party.” Critics pointed, however, to a tweet issued on 17 August 2017, in which Trump wrote: “I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton – it was great! Thanks S.” Bannon was chief executive officer of the Trump campaign in its final three months and then White House chief strategist for seven months before returning to the rightwing Breitbart News. According to Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, Bannon told author Michael Wolff the Trump Tower meeting between the president’s son and a group of Russians during the 2016 election campaign was “treasonous” and “unpatriotic”. He also reportedly made a range of claims about the likely targets and results of the investigation into Russian election meddling by the special counsel Robert Mueller. In the book, which was obtained by the Guardian ahead of publication from a bookseller in New England, Wolff paints a picture of a White House in chaos, locked in internecine warfare with even some of Trump’s closest allies expressing contempt for him. In his statement, which was issued after New York magazine published its own extensive excerpt of the Wolff book, Trump said: “Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. “Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.” Wolff, a former Guardian columnist, told the Guardian in November that he had no agenda in writing the book but wanted to “find out what the insiders were really thinking and feeling”. He enjoyed extraordinary access to Trump and senior officials and advisers, he said, sometimes at critical moments. On Wednesday, one subject of conversations reported in Wolff’s book, billionaire Trump ally Tom Barrack, told the New York Times he had not made a reported abusive remark about the president. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said in a written statement that the book was “filled with false and misleading accounts” and was “trashy tabloid fiction”. At her regular briefing later, she said Trump was “furious” at and “disgusted” by Bannon’s remarks. “Going after the president’s son in an absolutely outrageous way is probably not the best way to curry favour with anybody.” She described the claim of treason against Trump Jr as “a ridiculous accusation” and pointed to an interview on CBS 60 Minutes in which Bannon had referred to allegations of collusion with Russia as a “farce”. She told reporters: “If anyone’s been inconsistent, it’s been him. It certainly hasn’t been the president or this administration.” She claimed that Trump and Bannon last spoke in early December. Asked if the former chief strategist was off the list for social invitations to the White House, she replied dryly: “Probably so.” Sanders claimed that Wolff had “never actually sat down with the president” while researching the book but just had “one brief conversation” of about five to seven minutes. She was also aware of just over a dozen interactions between Wolff and White House officials, “95%” of which were at Bannon’s request. “I know the book has a lot of things that are completely untrue,” she claimed. Stephanie Grisham, communications director for the first lady, rejected claims in the book that Melania Trump cried when her husband won the presidency. Donald Trump Jr also jumped into the fray, blasting Bannon in a series of tweets that blamed him for the election of the first Alabama Democrat elected to the Senate in more than a generation. “Thanks Steve. Keep up the great work,” Trump Jr said, replying to a reporter’s tweet about the swearing-in ceremony of Doug Jones. Bannon declared a “season of war” on the Republican establishment and has threatened to run disruptive primary challengers against incumbent senators. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the Alabama special election, in which the controversial Republican Roy Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, lost to Jones, demonstrates that Bannon’s anti-establishment candidates are unelectable. After Trump released his statement on Bannon, McConnell’s re-election campaign account tweeted a gif of McConnell grinning. Trump Jr added later: “Steve had the honor of working in the White House &amp; serving the country. Unfortunately, he squandered that privilege &amp; turned that opportunity into a nightmare of backstabbing, harassing, leaking, lying &amp; undermining the President. Steve is not a strategist, he is an opportunist.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/14/three-things-about-elsie-review-joanna-cannon","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T10:00:24Z","webTitle":"Three Things About Elsie review – the tricks of memory at an old folks’ home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/14/three-things-about-elsie-review-joanna-cannon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/14/three-things-about-elsie-review-joanna-cannon","fields":{"headline":"Three Things About Elsie review – the tricks of memory at an old folks’ home","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Joanna Cannon’s 2016 debut novel, The Trouble With Goats and Sheep, was that rare literary phenomenon: a bestseller, swiftly optioned for TV and spawning a devoted readership. But beyond that, it was to lead a new publishing trend, latterly described as “uplit”: fiction in which empathy and kindness drive the narrative and where protagonists exist on the periphery of society, at best overlooked and at worst rejected entirely. Cannon is now back with her second novel, which similarly explores the inner lives of society’s outsiders. Eighty-four-year-old Florence Claybourne is a resident at the Cherry Tree home for the elderly and is beset by both nostalgia and dementia: “My mind started to wander. It can’t help itself. It very often goes for a walk without me, and before I’ve realised what’s going on, it’s miles away.” She has fallen over in her room and as she lays on the floor waiting for someone to find her, she remembers the events of the past month: the arrival of a man at the home whom she is convinced is someone from her past, albeit someone who supposedly died many years before. But no one in the home believes her – neither staff nor fellow residents – bar Florence’s lifelong friend, Elsie, so Florence sets out to unravel her past and prove them wrong. Two of the “three things about Elsie” are revealed in the book’s synopsis and are teased out tenderly through Florence’s recollection of their friendship. The third is not disclosed until almost the end of the novel, although astute readers will probably have guessed it much sooner. In most novels, pre-empting a central plot twist spoils the reading experience, but here it is Cannon’s meticulously crafted characters who drive the story. Cannon’s previous career as an NHS psychiatrist infuses her writing. She treats her characters with immense care and compassion, inviting the reader not merely to be interested in them but to show them concern and empathy: “She always looked like someone who hadn’t had quite enough sleep, but had put on another coat of lipstick and enthusiasm, in an effort to make sure the rest of the world didn’t ever find her out.” Throughout Cannon’s writing, there is an intrinsic understanding of the quiet pain that accompanies loneliness: “There is a special kind of silence when you live alone. It hangs around, waiting for you to find it. You try to cover it up with all sorts of other noises, but it’s always there, at the end of everything else, expecting you.” In The Trouble With Goats and Sheep, Cannon wrote evocatively about the remarkable heatwave of 1976 and the curtain-twitching nosiness that comes with living in a semi-anonymous community. Here, she sympathetically captures the claustrophobia and enforced cheeriness of old people’s homes: “Between us, we would work out how many days it was until Christmas, and we would say how quickly the time passes, and saying how quickly the time passes would help to pass the time a little more.” In Three Things About Elsie, Cannon reaffirms her interest in the private tragedies of quotidian lives: “Elsie’s father left for the war and returned as a telegram on the mantelpiece.” Compassionate, thoughtful and tender, it is a novel exploring the pain of nostalgia and personal truths so painful we hide them even from ourselves. As Florence says at one point: “Everyone has words they keep to themselves. It’s what you do with your secret that really matters. Do you drag it behind you forever, like a difficult suitcase, or do you find someone to tell?” • Three Things About Elsie by Joanna Cannon is published by Harper Collins (£14.99).

It moves, gradually, towards a terrifying account of anorexia. And by the end one feels that perhaps it has been most of all a study of the relationship between a grandfather and granddaughter. I’m not sure it entirely holds together, but the disjunctions are part of what makes this courageous piece of work so memorable, strange and sad. It’s set, for the most part, on a single day somewhere in the Hampshire countryside, at the home of the ageing Robert. The family is gathering for his birthday, as it has gathered each May for the last 40 years. But at 80, recently widowed, Robert hasn’t much heart for celebration. He is wondering how he can get through the day without Hattie, the love of his life. And he finds himself willingly recalled to his former role as an intermediary in the negotiations that followed the Enniskillen bombing and led towards the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. It’s a hard day, too, for his granddaughter Kate, who must speak to her mother for the first time in years. At 25, vulnerable but surviving, she is continually conscious of how close she came to starving herself to death. Norris’s first novel, Five Rivers Met on a Wooded Plain, won huge acclaim. Its five characters were exhilaratingly various: an army wife, a security guard, a teenage boy, a widower and a rough-spoken flower seller with a sideline in drugs – their complex lives all converging at the same moment in Salisbury, with the cathedral spire rising above them. Norris’s great achievement was to make their voices work in harmony, like notes sounding together in a chord. Turning for Home again features alternating monologues. Robert and Kate narrate the same day from their separate vantage points, longing to understand and support each other but called away into their private preoccupations. The two voices are similar in tone, so that the chord they make is less surprising than in the first novel. This book is also a looser whole, and I missed the distinctive sense of place that shaped Five Rivers. But here again is the wistful lyricism that distinguishes all Norris’s work, the philosophical intelligence, and the acute, demotic empathy with people of diverse ages and in different kinds of trouble. Few young novelists have been so attentive to old age, yet considering our ageing population, the giant unsolved problem of how to care for the elderly and the complicated pain of seeing our relatives struggle on, the need for literary engagement feels urgent. In his 2014 play Visitors, Norris thought his way into the lives of an elderly couple, still in love despite their failing bodies and signs of dementia. In Turning for Home, Robert attests to the power of his long marriage in ways so moving that one wonders why as a society we are so much more eager to hear about young love than old. Robert is thinking about war as well as love. News has broken that transcripts are going to be released from the Boston tapes – the interviews with loyalist and IRA fighters recorded by researchers at Boston College in the early 2000s on the understanding that they would not be made public until after the death of the interviewees. Those who spoke knew it was dangerous to put their stories on record, whatever guarantees were given. So why did they do it? Robert thinks of those “old battered murderers speaking into their microphones” and asks why so many of us feel compelled to speak out the truth of our lives. Answers come from different strands of the novel: we are driven by shame and guilt, by loneliness and the urge to share what we know. Robert suggests that it’s a matter of “wanting the days of your life, and the acts of your life, to be known to have happened”. What we are reading is Robert’s narration of his own story, analogous to the Boston interviews and shaped by the same anxieties. Though she is very quiet, Kate, too, needs the acts of her life to be known. The politics of the IRA testimonies are held in tense juxtaposition with private stories of family and illness. The heart of the book, the part no reader will forget, is Kate’s account of her anorexia. Only a very brave writer would take on the voice of a woman remembering what she felt as she refused all nutrition. The result is entirely convincing and horrifying. The reader is left railing at a care system that seems powerless to help Kate, and brought up against distressing questions of medical ethics. Her father pleads day after day for her to be sectioned, which is the only way she can be hospitalised against her will. It’s clear that had he not been there, or had he not persisted, she would have been lost. Kate’s monologue is its own kind of confession, deeply concerned with the currents of self-incrimination and self-punishment in which she has been caught. As she tries now to open new kinds of relationship with her estranged mother, and with the two men she loves, Robert watches her across the lawn. “There ought to be truth and reconciliation,” he reflects, “in every stratum of the lives people live.” The book’s many parts are explicitly linked by this idea. More than direct statements, though, it is incidental moments that remain vivid in memory once the book is closed, small glimpses of unsuspected inner lives. Such scenes carry with them Norris’s plea that we take more notice of the people around us. The possibility of compassion gives the novel a restorative arc that rises up and over its tragedies. There is Aunt Laura, who “expresses love like a woodpecker, battering away”, covering her sadness with fuss about sandwiches; there is the old IRA man turning a whisky glass in his nervous hands; most of all there is a father in agony, cradling his grown-up daughter in a hospital chair, playing out a terrible modern pietà. • Alexandra Harris’s Weatherland is published by Thames &amp; Hudson.

Yet the statistics show that neither of these assumptions is correct. While the highest rainfall occurs from October to January, the driest months are usually February and March. February 1891 stands out as one of the driest months ever recorded, with just a couple of millimetres recorded across much of England – described by the Met Office at the time as “unusually deficient”. In London, it was the first month without significant rainfall since July 1800. Indeed, any moisture that was found in the capital’s rain gauges may in fact have been produced by condensation from early morning fogs, which were a regular feature of that month’s weather. The reason for the drought was the persistence of a high-pressure system over southern Britain for virtually the whole of the month, which led to fine, sunny and unusually warm weather. One observer in Hertfordshire noted the appearance of “sulphur butterflies” – brimstones – which usually hide away until the spring, but were encouraged to emerge early because of temperatures rising close to 20C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/15/a-long-way-from-home-peter-carey-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T07:00:49Z","webTitle":"A Long Way from Home review – Peter Carey’s best novel in decades","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/15/a-long-way-from-home-peter-carey-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/15/a-long-way-from-home-peter-carey-review","fields":{"headline":"A Long Way from Home review – Peter Carey’s best novel in decades","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Writers are by nature chameleons, with each new character a new disguise to take on, a fresh skin to inhabit. It shouldn’t surprise, then, that racial passing has such a rich literary history. Nella Larsen’s 1929 novel, Passing, is a near-forgotten classic, telling of two mixed-race women, Clare and Irene, who identify as white and black respectively. More recently, we’ve had Philip Roth’s The Human Stain, in which the African American Coleman Silk attempts to pass for a Jewish academic. Then there’s Francis Spufford’s Golden Hill, whose concluding revelation about one of the characters’ racial identities does what all good end-of-book twists ought to, shedding new light on the entire novel. A Long Way from Home, Peter Carey’s 14th novel, uses the story of a light-skinned Indigenous Australian who has been brought up white to address the country’s brutal history of racism. It seems strange at first that Carey – surely Australia’s greatest living novelist, even if he hasn’t dwelled there for decades – has taken so long to get around to the subject. In a recent interview in the Australian, he said that he’d always felt that it was not the place of a white writer to tell this tale. Then something changed: “You can’t be a white Australian writer and spend your whole life ignoring the greatest, most important aspect of our history, and that is that we – I – have been the beneficiaries of a genocide.” The novel is told in alternating first-person voices. Initially, we meet the petite Irene Bobs, a spunkily irrepressible young woman married to the equally diminutive Titch. Titch is genial, slightly useless and lives in fear of his domineering father, Dan. Titch dreams of running the local Ford dealership; after (yet another) stab in the back from his father, he has to make do with being the Bacchus Marsh representative of General Motors Holden. Irene loves her husband, loathes her father-in-law and longs for success on a grander stage. The second voice is that of the nervy and lankily romantic Willie Bachhuber, the fair-haired son of a Protestant preacher. Fleeing a seemingly faithless wife, Bachhuber turns up in Bacchus Marsh with a library of books and plasters his walls with maps of his beloved Germany. He becomes a regular and successful quiz show guest on a local radio station and a teacher at the town’s school (until a run-in with a belligerent student gets him fired). Bachhuber and Irene strike up a friendship over the garden fence, attracting the attention of the small-town gossips, particularly given Bachhuber’s name and teutonophilia – the book is set immediately after the second world war, and most Bachhubers, as Irene notes, would have changed their name to Hubert. Alongside the racial passing storyline (the tangled identities are unravelled late enough on that any further information would spoil an intricately engineered plot), there’s another engine to the narrative – Irene and Titch’s attempts to win the Redex Trial, a round-Australia motorsport rally. It allows Carey to paint for his readers a vivid portrait of the country as the intrepid “Bobses,” with Bachhuber roped in as navigator, battle their way through terrain as inhospitable as its taciturn inhabitants. It is interesting that Carey’s publishers promote this novel as his “late style masterpiece”; what kept striking me, at least at first, was how similar it was in style and substance to his earlier work. The conceit of the Redex Trial imbues the novel with the same sense of rollicking picaresque that we got in Oscar and Lucinda. There’s the same deeply felt engagement with the Australian landscape that we found in True History of the Kelly Gang: here be willy-willies and billabongs. The interweaving dual perspectives are a well-established Carey trope. The earlier scenes in Bacchus Marsh are painted with the same nostalgic glow as Illywhacker – Carey grew up in Bacchus Marsh and his parents ran a Holden dealership there. However, it is the character of Willie Bachhuber who brings something new to this novel. He’s a man who seems almost preternaturally sensitive to the horrors of this “murderous continent”. I couldn’t help thinking that Carey must have been reading WG Sebald: Bachhuber has the same ability to see historical violence written into the landscape. The second half of the novel goes by in a flash, with Irene and Bachhuber separated, their fates spiralling towards very different ends. It is striking that, Nella Larsen aside, the principal narratives of racial passing have been written by white authors. By following in this tradition, Carey has found a way to delve deeply into a topic that was previously morally unavailable, so that what starts out feeling like a typical, jauntily whimsical Peter-Carey-by-numbers soon becomes something more complex and powerful. At the end of the novel, Bachhuber’s son recognises that his father’s life had been spent wrestling with the problem of the ethical representation of a terrible historical wrong: how to “record the truth and keep the secret”. Carey himself has achieved exactly this, in his best novel in years, maybe decades. • A Long Way from Home by Peter Carey is published by Faber &amp; Faber (£17.99).

This year is the 70th anniversary of Britain’s most treasured institution. But it is eight years into a funding regime that has failed year after year to match the inexorable growth in demand. It operates on the very edge of viability. Any system-wide increase in need tips it over the edge. The contours of the winter crisis are familiar: the Christmas and New Year shut-down of supporting services – the GPs, community health workers and social services who help to keep people at home – coinciding with winter flu and cold weather always puts the NHS under pressure. Even in Scotland, where slightly higher funding per patient and much closer coordination between hospital and social care reduces problems such as bed-blocking, there are nightmare stories about long waits on trolleys and a service that shows painful signs of stress. Yet while the wretched experience of a system running off the rails is familiar, there is also something unusual going on here. First, more thought than ever went into avoiding another Christmas crisis – yet it has still happened. From July, conspicuous planning was underway. Instructions were issued to free up thousands of beds. Accident and emergency bosses were ordered to make detailed contingency plans. By November, however, it was clear they had not succeeded. A critical assessment by NHS Improvement reported that no more beds were available, because – again – of failure to provide more social care. It predicted a winter of woe. And while it is important to recognise that some trusts are managing well, it has duly arrived. No amount of planning can get around the hard fact that there is a shortage of capacity in terms of both beds and staff. Second, after the chancellor refused to release more cash for the core functions of the NHS in his autumn budget, NHS England began trying to manage a public debate about what it might have to ration. Although they are being undone as far as possible without actually repealing the legislation, it is now becoming clear how the ill-conceived Lansley reforms of 2011-12, which aimed to distance the NHS from Westminster, are resetting the politics of the health service. As an example, consider how Tuesday’s decision to suspend outpatient appointments and elective surgery for the rest of the month, and to suspend penalties for having mixed wards, was taken, not after crisis meetings at the Department of Health but by the new national emergency pressure panel. Consider, too, that the job of explaining the decision and insisting that there was no crisis because there was a plan fell to Professor Keith Willett, head of trauma care for NHS England, not to a politician. That meant that Theresa May was able to talk sympathetically about the “frustration” of having surgery cancelled. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, also apologised, saying it “is absolutely not what I want”. And while in a series of interviews he did accept the need for a “substantial” increase in funding to meet the challenge of an ageing population, he did not entirely remove the impression that the growth of autonomy in NHS England is being taken by politicians as a licence to talk about the state of the English health service as if it were an arms-length organisation. Spending decisions that ministers take in Whitehall are somehow distanced from their impact on the hospital ward. That is why the Patients Association demanded that ministers must be accountable. “The policy decisions that have left the NHS in this position are taken by the government,” it says. Ministers hope they can manage the NHS in a way that stops the funding crisis exploding into a national scandal. Yet neither NHS England, nor thinktanks such as the King’s Fund or the Nuffield Trust, believe it is possible to sustain world-beating levels of care on the existing budget. Waiting times at A&amp;E and for non-urgent surgery are set to grow. Local reorganisations, likely to mean closures of much-loved services, will provoke political uproar. Brexit could precipitate a further crisis in staffing levels; the expansion in numbers of doctors and nurses that is underway will take years more to arrive. Whitehall documents released last week record how in 1992 the then health secretary Virginia Bottomley appealed unsuccessfully to the Treasury for more money. The state of the NHS became a proxy for Tory neglect of the public sector that smoothed Tony Blair’s path to power in 1997. “Trouble ahead,” John Major minuted. Sometime between now and 2022, it looks as if it will be deja vu all over again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/04/farmland-could-be-turned-into-meadows-post-brexit-says-michael-gove","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T05:07:53Z","webTitle":"Farmland could turn into meadows after Brexit, says Michael Gove","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/farmland-could-be-turned-into-meadows-post-brexit-says-michael-gove","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/04/farmland-could-be-turned-into-meadows-post-brexit-says-michael-gove","fields":{"headline":"Farmland could turn into meadows after Brexit, says Michael Gove","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Farmers will get subsidies for turning fields back into wildflower meadows after Brexit, according to environment secretary Michael Gove. More than 97% of the UK’s wildflower meadows have been destroyed since the second world war and their loss has played a significant role in the falling numbers of bees, birds and other wildlife. In a speech to the Oxford Farming Conference on Thursday, Gove will make his clearest statement to date that the current subsidy regime – which largely rewards ownership of land – will be replaced by a scheme focused on supporting environmental benefits such as tree planting, wildlife and improving water quality. Currently 80% of the £2.6bn spent each year in farming subsidies is used for the “basic payment scheme” (BPS). Gove is expected to tell farmers at the conference: “Paying landowners for the amount of agricultural land they have is unjust, inefficient and drives perverse outcomes. It gives the most from the public purse to those who have the most private wealth.” Recent reports have highlighted a billionaire Saudi prince and wealthy British aristocrats as major recipients of subsidies. Instead, the environment secretary will say: “After a transition, we will replace BPS with a system of public money for public goods. The principal public good we will invest in is environmental enhancement.” He is expected to tell farmers a five-year transition period will be used to smooth the way to the new regime. Setting out what this will cover, Gove will say the government will design a scheme to support almost any landowner in “planting woodland, providing new habitats for wildlife, increasing biodiversity, contributing to improved water quality and returning cultivated land to wildflower meadows or other more natural states”. Gove, a prominent leave campaigner during the Brexit referendum, argues leaving the EU will allow the UK to improve environmental protections and has pledged green standards will not be weakened. However, many major conservation organisations including the National Trust, RSPB and WWF are concerned that some existing protections, which mainly derive from EU law, could be lost after Brexit. In October, the Greener UK coalition warned that the current EU withdrawal bill “rips the heart out of environmental law” by omitting the principles of precaution and that polluters should pay, and also by losing enforcement bodies. Gove has since promised consultations on these issues, which campaigners say must be published as soon as possible. But Greener UK also remains concerned that government plans do not fully transpose all EU environmental rules into UK law. Gove will be the first environment secretary to also attend the Oxford Real Farming Conference, which runs at the same time as the more traditional gathering. At the Oxford Real Farming Conference, Green Party MEP Molly Scott Cato will call for an end to the use of agricultural land as a tax shelter. “Gove must call time on the UK’s largest land owners who are using agricultural land to hide and shelter their wealth,” Scott Cato said. “Agricultural land offers generous tax breaks as it is exempt from inheritance tax after two years if it is actively farmed. The fact that the sale of a farming asset can be rolled over into a new business or acquisition offers further tax relief.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/07/walk-with-me-mindfulness-documentary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T07:50:05Z","webTitle":"Walk With Me review – making the case for mindfulness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/07/walk-with-me-mindfulness-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/07/walk-with-me-mindfulness-documentary","fields":{"headline":"Walk With Me review – making the case for mindfulness","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This observational documentary about Plum Village, a monastery in rural France, looks at the mindfulness espoused by Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh.

Along with beloved comedies like Portlandia, Nashville and New Girl, series like Veep, The Americans, Scandal and House of Cards – all of which involve the goings-on of the political caste and have, at some point or another, drawn comparisons to the current administration – will debut their final seasons this year, at a cultural moment when the fecklessness of Selina Meyer and the dealings of Russian counterintelligence groups no longer defy imagination. That the Trump administration contains echoes of both Veep and House of Cards is now an old adage, but both were some of the most zeitgeist-y shows of the era of Peak TV, and their departures leave a void. So, here are eight of the series concluding in 2018, some that are ending too soon and others well past expiration, and what to expect from their curtain calls. Veep Veep, whose star Julia Louis-Dreyfus has swept the last six Emmy awards for best actress in a comedy, will bow out with its seventh season, after its anti-heroine Meyer went from vice-president to president to, in hilariously tragic fashion, private citizen. While production on the last season was halted due to Louis-Dreyfus’ breast cancer diagnosis, it’s expected to return sometime in the spring, under the auspices of David Mandel, who took over the show when creator Armando Iannucci departed after its fourth season. What exactly do we want from the final season of one of the best comedies of the last decade? It seemed for a moment that Selina was done chasing after the Oval Office, having found a morsel of closure in her one-year presidency; but the season six finale suggested otherwise, as Selina announced her desire to run for a fourth time. That sets things up for a political showdown between former president Meyer and that “plus-sized homunculus” congressman Jonah Ryan: seeing the two face off, with current president Montez in the mix, too, would be a fitting finish for a series that in strange ways augured the election of tremendously stupid people to public office. “She’s no longer the president running for president. She’s a person who used to be the president and is now running for president, but that never worked out too well,” Mandel told Indiewire. “It didn’t work out for Teddy Roosevelt, and it has not worked out historically when one-term presidents have tried to run.” The Americans Critical darling The Americans, FX’s cold war period drama following two married KGB sleeper agents played by Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell, will begin its 10-episode sixth and final season in March, wrapping up a run that’s set to be remembered squarely in the canon of this decade’s television dramas. The fifth season was not as well-received as the four that came before it, but as this tale of Reagan-era paranoia comes full circle, you can expect showrunner Joe Weisberg, a former CIA officer himself, to pull off the finale. In the show’s timeline, 1985, the year Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union, is just around the bend. The show will inevitably grapple with what the political sea change back home means for Philip and Elizabeth, who at the end of season five elected to remain in the States rather than return to Russia. Season six will also expand on the story of their daughter Paige, who as she gets older is beginning to understand more about her parents’ extraordinary line of work. Showrunners Weisberg and Joel Fields told Deadline the series’ conclusion has been etched in stone for years now: “Our stories sometimes change a lot, we write pretty far ahead and we’ll have ideas written down in pretty extensive thoughtful form earlier on and then some will stay with us. The ending itself has stuck since the middle of season two.” Scandal In how many more directions can Shonda Rhimes jerk us before Scandal ends with its seventh season? It would be unwise to guess, since the ABC drama regularly provides as many plot twists in an episode as some shows do in a season. The role of crisis-management guru Olivia Pope was made for Kerry Washington, who through six seasons has done a real high-wire act of melodrama, weathering death, lies, affairs, national emergencies and, well, scandals. She’ll begin the final season as the president Mellie Grant’s chief of staff, but it would be foolish to guess where she’ll end up. All we know, at least from hints dropped by Rhimes, is that season seven will hold nothing back. “So, next year we are going all out. Leaving nothing on the table. Creating this world in celebration,” Rhimes said in a press call. “We are going to handle the end the way we like to handle the important things in our Scandal family: all together, white hats on, Gladiators running full speed over a cliff.” House of Cards House of Cards began filming its final season in October, before the revelations about Kevin Spacey’s alleged history of sexual predation were made public. And so, in a bold and costly move, Netflix decided to scrap the two episodes that had been filmed, plus several other episodes that featured Frank Underwood and were already written, in favor of rejiggering the final season around his wife, the president, Claire Underwood, played by Robin Wright. Although the wheels fell off House of Cards around season four or five, it was Netflix’s first certified hit as a streaming service and helped popularize the idea of binge TV. A Spacey-free finale season is not just the pragmatic move for House of Cards, but the right one, too: she didn’t become president until the very end of season five, but Claire Underwood has long been the more interesting and watchable half of television’s most cunning couple. The powers-that-be at Netflix have been tight-lipped about the series finale, but chief content officer Ted Sarandos said he hoped season six would provide “some closure to the show for fans”. Portlandia One of the great sketch-comedy shows of the past decade or so, Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein’s Portlandia, a Peabody Award winner in 2012, will air its eighth and final season beginning in January. Somehow, this show has yet to run out of ways to lampoon Portland’s hipster culture: remember The Deuce hotel, where each room comes with a complimentary turntable? From season one’s “Put a Bird on It” sketch to the great “Did You Read It?”, where Fred and Carrie play spitfire with their knowledge of recent New Yorker and McSweeney’s articles, the show’s satire is shrewd and often absurd, and will be hard to replace once it’s gone. With a sketch-comedy show, there’s a bit less riding on a season finale than with traditional episodic television, so Armisen’s said he and Brownstein are not planning “to make any big final statements” with season eight. “We tried to keep it like a sketch show and comedy, just because people watch it out of order. Our main goal is to keep it funny and entertaining and relevant, we stuck to that.” Nashville Through six seasons, the last of which premiered this January, Nashville has acquired something of a cult following, which helped salvage the show after ABC cancelled it in 2016. Afterwards, CMT picked it up for seasons five and six, with new producers at the helm and a revived fanbase. Part musical, part soap-opera, Nashville, which follows country music singer Juliette Barnes, played by Hayden Panettiere, is a fun jaunt, a countrified take on the high camp of Glee. And even though Connie Britton’s Rayna James – the former “queen of country” and rival of Barnes – was killed off in season five, the show has just enough oxygen left to croon for one more season. After fans helped give the show new life, executive producer Marshall Herskovitz told Deadline “we want to return the favor with a final season that celebrates all the joys and passions, twists and turns – and amazing music! – that made Nashville such an exciting journey for the last six years”. New Girl Following a three-year time-jump, the Fox sitcom New Girl (which, like The Big Bang Theory, feels like its been on air for a decade) will kick off its final installment in April after creator Liz Meriwether made a last-second push for an eight-episode seventh season. “I’m so passionate about this show. It’s been my life for seven years. I did feel really good about the end of season six, but I really wanted a chance to say goodbye to the show with a final season,” Meriwether told Entertainment Tonight. Starring Zooey Deschanel as the peppy teacher Jess, New Girl finished season six with a classic romcom flourish, Jess and Nick (Jake Johnson) playing revolving elevators to the tune of Lorde’s Green Light before the latter professes his love. Since the show so fittingly ended things for its central couple in what was thought to be a series finale, there’s reason to believe they’ll pull it off again in season seven, not just for Nick and Jess, but for Cece and Schmidt too. Love Judd Apatow’s Netflix romcom will bow out after its third season, which is set to premiere on the streaming service in early March. This show can be a charmer, exploring relationships through its prickly but endearing leads Mickey, played by Gillian Jacobs, and Gus, played by Paul Rust. After a great first season, Love lost a lot of steam in season two and, as its two leads finally got together, failed to keep pace with snappier, more progressive shows that explore the ups-and-downs of millennial courtship. Love doesn’t exactly reinvent the genre – its female lead is the typical wild child, her counterpart an affable nerd – but it still contains threads of truth among its many contrivances. Speaking about season three, Apatow said, “it’s our sweetest, funniest season and ends our story in a beautiful way”, so hopefully Love will get back to its season one heights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/04/tony-blair-timid-labour-risks-becoming-handmaiden-of-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T00:01:15Z","webTitle":"Tony Blair: timid Labour risks becoming handmaiden of Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/04/tony-blair-timid-labour-risks-becoming-handmaiden-of-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/04/tony-blair-timid-labour-risks-becoming-handmaiden-of-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Tony Blair: timid Labour risks becoming handmaiden of Brexit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labour will become “the handmaiden of Brexit” if it continues to prevaricate and be timid over the issue, Tony Blair has warned in a passionate call for the party he formerly led to oppose the government on leaving the EU. In a lengthy article published on his own website, coinciding with the release of a report from his political institute detailing the current state of play over Brexit, Blair reiterates his call for the British people to have the final decision on whether the withdrawal from the EU goes ahead or not. Describing 2018 as “the year when the fate of Brexit and thus of Britain will be decided”, Blair is open about his opposition to leaving the EU and argues that the 2016 referendum cannot be seen as binding as it contained no detail on what a post-Brexit future would involve. Much of the 2,300-word article lambasts the Conservatives’ plans on Brexit as contradictory and confusing, saying it is absurd for ministers to pretend the UK can replicate the benefits of the EU’s single market and customs union while accepting none of the rules. But he ends with a plea to Labour to “be on the high ground of progressive politics, explaining why membership of the European Union is right as a matter of principle, for profound political as well as economic reasons”. Blair argues that Labour’s current ambiguity on the issue is a tactical error as it means the party cannot fully attack Theresa May’s government for neglecting issues such as the NHS and policing amid an all-consuming focus on Brexit. The article criticises the “cake and eat it” phrases of people such as John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who has said that although the UK must leave the single market it can remain in “a single market”. “Far better to fight for the right for the country to rethink, demand that we know the full details of the new relationship before we quit the old one, go to the high ground on opposing Brexit and go after the Tories for their failures to tackle the country’s real challenges,” Blair writes. “At every PMQs nail each myth of the Brexit campaign, say why the Tory divisions are weakening our country – something only credible if we are opposed to Brexit, not advocating a different Brexit– and challenge the whole farce head-on of a prime minister leading our nation in a direction which even today she can’t bring herself to say she would vote for. “If we do leave Europe, the governing mind will have been that of the Tory right. But if Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the single market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour.” Blair has been a persistent critic of both Brexit and Labour’s decision to not oppose it, prompting questions as to whether interventions by such a divisive figure are helpful in promoting the remain argument. In an interview with the Guardian last month, Blair acknowledged that some people would “refuse, literally refuse” to listen to his arguments because of who he is, but argued that not many other public figures were stepping forward. Along with Thursday’s article, his personal thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, has published a 32-page report titled What We Now Know, chronicling what has been learned about Brexit since the referendum. In the article, Blair criticises the Brexit positions of some shadow ministers but spends longer detailing what he calls the contradictory and confusing positions of Theresa May, Boris Johnson and David Davis. He writes: “Think of it in this way. Suppose the English FA wants to arrange a football match with France. There are many things to negotiate about: the venue, the timing, the price of the tickets etc. But suppose the FA then said to their French counterparts, we also want to negotiate whether we have 15 players on our team not 11. The French would say sorry but you have the wrong address, talk to the rugby federation. Yet this seems to be the negotiating position of the government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/03/are-we-really-ready-for-self-driving-cars","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T18:05:09Z","webTitle":"Are we really ready for self-driving cars? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/03/are-we-really-ready-for-self-driving-cars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/03/are-we-really-ready-for-self-driving-cars","fields":{"headline":"Are we really ready for self-driving cars?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Amanda Blanc, Axa’s UK boss, lays too much of the responsibility for providing electric car charging infrastructure at National Grid’s door (Report, 1 January). Electricity privatisation removed National Grid’s obligation to plan provision of adequate generation capacity as the market was seen as a more efficient provider. National Grid is responsible for carrying energy from the generation companies to regional bulk supply points, where most of it is passed on to regional distribution companies’ infrastructure which feeds our homes and businesses. While the Grid will require reinforcement, additional supply points and consequent investment, the impact on the distribution networks is likely to be disproportionate; banks of superchargers will require cabling to industrial amounts of energy while slower and home chargers will add cumulative demands that may require reinforcement work at street level. Grid and distribution charges are moderated by Ofgem but on the basis that necessary capital investment costs are passed on to the customer, so there will be an impact on energy costs. The solution to Ms Blanc’s charging delays might be found in larger, shared tracked electric vehicles, using a continuous overhead power supply, which are available in much of Europe and sometimes at reasonable cost. Mike Brown Ponteland, Northumberland • Another Trojan horse is revealed by Amanda Blanc’s belief that “children born today will not need to learn to drive”. As with the consequences of Facebook, Google, Amazon et al, yet another human skill is set to vanish.

Eventually, a year after the premiere, he managed to secure a very limited cinema release. Those screenings sold out almost immediately. Ben Luxford, the British Film Institute’s head of audience, told me that one cinema chain thought Scientologists had bought up all the tickets as a protest, and that the screenings would be empty. But the seats were not left vacant – they were full of young people. The film industry had been caught unawares, but millennials had been binge-watching Weird Weekends on Netflix. The distributor hurriedly arranged a much wider release and the film went on to take $2.2m (£1.6m) at the box office, an impressive showing for an independent documentary release. Cinemas might have known to expect a big youth audience if they had looked to the plethora of bootleg Theroux streetwear created by DIY fashion companies such as Homage Tees and sported by Stormzy, or the “No Context Louis” meme account, or the student nightclub chain Propaganda, which released merch with an outline drawing of Theroux’s face, or “sleep tight Theroux the night” pillowcases. Theroux decorations were even a popular choice for student Christmas trees. When youth culture is discussed, it is always in terms of how divorced young people are from mass media: they stream TV, they pick and choose their political values rather than following a stringent ideology, they idolise Instagram influencers that their parents would never recognise. It might follow that stars of an older generation have lost sway with the young, but Theroux is part of a generation of public figures, in middle age and beyond, that are heroes to young Brits. The example most often trotted out is Jeremy Corbyn. In some ways, the 2017 general election followed the pattern of Theroux’s cinema release, with expert pundits ignoring that Corbyn had his image emblazoned on T-shirts and was filling up social media feeds, right up until the “youthquake” election result arrived. Corbyn’s age is part of his appeal: it is difficult to imagine hoards of Glastonbury-attendees chanting for the Labour leader if he was a slick thirtysomething. Like Bernie Sanders and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, Corbyn is attractive to young voters because he comes from a period when politics felt principled and high-stakes. Black-and-white photos of him in scruffy jumpers protesting against apartheid were as important to his success as anything in the Labour manifesto. When the Tories sought a response to Corbyn it was Jacob Rees-Mogg, a politician once nicknamed “the honourable member for the 18th century”, who became the likely candidate, his moral conservatism seen as more appealing than any fresher faces in the party. Across popular culture, there has been a shift in who is considered to be cool. Go to a Wolfgang Tillmans exhibition, a Paul Mason talk or a Sofia Coppola film and you might think you’d stepped into a student union (the enthusiasm for older people and things will likely extend to attendees’ fashion choices, too, with plenty of vintage sportswear last popular in the 80s and 90s: Ellesse, Kickers, Tommy Jeans). On Tuesday, everyone was fretting about the influence of Youtube stars on teenagers after vlogger Logan Paul filmed a dead body, but a 2016 Radio Times/YouGov survey of the people who were most admired by 13- to 18-year-olds gave top 10 placings to David Tennant, Brian Cox, Barack Obama and JK Rowling (although Emma Watson was at No 1). It’s not that you have to be going grey to appeal to the young. It’s just that the era when youth icons were roughly the same age as their fans – the Beatles, Kate Bush, the 80s alternative comedy boom, Joy Division, Oasis and Chris Evans – has come to an end. The age range of cool has broadened out a bit. Take Radio 1, which constantly strives to reach a young audience – yet a lot of their most credible DJs are pushing 40. Annie Mac, 39, not only hosts the station’s flagship new music and dance shows, but headlines Ibiza superclubs and runs nights across the country that are hugely popular with students and twentysomethings. She is young compared with David Rodigan, 66, and Annie Nightingale, 77, who both have shows on Radio 1Xtra. There are a number of reasons for this new-found respect for the middle-aged. People my age grew up with nostalgia TV blasted at us, constantly being told about the brilliance of the Stone Roses and The Young Ones until we started to accept it. But it goes deeper than that: I think we admire people who grew up before the internet age. In the past, coolness came from nonchalance, leather jackets and a sense of fatalism. Today, it comes from those who in some way feel disconnected from the endless content cycle, sponsored posts and hashtag engagement. People who are connected to something real: club nights of human beings gathered together, politics of principle, slow-burning documentaries that were once shown on old-fashioned telly. Authenticity now comes from existing in the physical world. You don’t have to be old to seem authentic, but the lives of people who grew up in a time before Facebook can seem almost fantastical to those of us who spent our childhoods behind computer screens. It’s why we adore the 80s nostalgia of Stranger Things, even though we never lived through the 80s; why the average age of Glastonbury headliners has been creeping up, from 25 in the 1970s to 41 today. It’s why the most talked-about show among millennials is Black Mirror, and why shows by Theroux, Charlie Brooker and Jill Soloway are so much more celebrated among young people than traditional youth drama. The way we access these people is more digital than ever. But that has only made their corporeal world seem more attractive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/03/no-cause-for-rejoicing-in-the-countryside","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T18:04:56Z","webTitle":"No cause for rejoicing in the countryside | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/03/no-cause-for-rejoicing-in-the-countryside","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/03/no-cause-for-rejoicing-in-the-countryside","fields":{"headline":"No cause for rejoicing in the countryside","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Your correspondent June Lewis (Letters, 29 December), having referred to Country diary, says that the country – by which I think she means the countryside and nature – is “carrying on happily”.

The 20-year-old has travelled to London to complete the move this week. Mavropanos is regarded as one of the best defenders to emerge in Greece in the past 10 years. He made his debut in the Greek Super League for PAS Giannina as an 18-year-old in November 2016 and has made 20 appearances for the team in all competitions. It is not thought the 20-year-old will challenge for a place in Arsenal’s starting XI and may be loaned out, possibly to a Bundesliga club, to gain more experience. Antonis Nikopolidis, the former Greece international goalkeeper who is the Greece Under-21 coach, told the Guardian he believes the young defender has what it takes to succeed in the Premier League. “He has a lot of potential,” Nikopolidis said. “He is young and very strong. His physicality is a big asset and essential for him to be successful in the Premier League. He’s a player who is constantly developing, and he has made tremendous progress over the last few years. “Apart from being very strong, he is also very effective in the air, relatively quick and a player with great personality. He is a work in progress and I am sure Arsenal will be able to develop him even more.” Greek defenders are in demand at the moment with Sokratis Pastastathopoulos (Borussia Dortmund), Kostas Manolas (Roma) and Kyriakos Papadopoulos (Hamburg) already established at top European clubs while Panagiotis Retsos joined Bayer Leverkusen for £15.75m, a record fee for a Greek player. Mavropanos is still young and Nikopolidis says he needs to improve to have a chance of playing for the Arsenal first team. “He must work hard on the tactical side of the game. It’s a totally different world waiting for him in England. He must improve – and will certainly do so – his control and his passing, and of course he needs to become much more efficient. “So far he has played a lot in a 3-5-2 formation, having two central defenders next to him and in a defensively minded team. At Arsenal he will face totally different situations so he must work very hard on this to succeed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/05/tweet-and-tell-turning-twitter-into-complaints-megaphone","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T14:25:28Z","webTitle":"Tweet and tell: turning Twitter into complaints megaphone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/05/tweet-and-tell-turning-twitter-into-complaints-megaphone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/05/tweet-and-tell-turning-twitter-into-complaints-megaphone","fields":{"headline":"Tweet and tell: turning Twitter into complaints megaphone","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There was plenty for rail passengers to be #angry about on Tuesday, with social media channels buzzing with complaints as the biggest rise in rail fares since 2013 kicked in. But come the end of the day Virgin Trains was apologising not for cancelled trains, overcrowded carriages or rocketing fares - but for being sexist on Twitter after a customer complaint went viral. Angry customers used to vent their fury with a letter to the company or an argument with an anonymous call centre worker, but Twitter is now a customer service megaphone where a careless word or tweet can generate a consumer backlash with the potential to inflict real damage on sales. “Social media is a minefield for brands,” says Allyson Stewart-Allen, chief executive of brand consultancy International Marketing Partners. “But they have to be on it because they are being talked about. They have to be part of the conversation.” This week’s squall blew up after Virgin Rail East Coast passenger Emily Cole contacted the rail operator via Twitter to relate an exchange with one of its train managers who she felt had been patronising and sexist, calling her “honey” after she complained. Rather than offer a straight apology, the firm’s official feed offered: “Sorry for the mess up Emily, would you prefer ‘pet’ or ‘love’ next time?” With Twitter and Facebook being used for both marketing and customer service these days it can be an uncomfortable ride for companies when the two world’s collide. Cole, who now has 255 followers on Twitter, was able to share her bad experience with Virgin Rail EC’s 149,000 other followers – and they then shared it with many, many more. With close to 40 million Britons using social media, many as their primary news source, the need to manage a company’s digital presence is creating thousands of jobs. There are currently more than 20,000 social media vacancies, according to UK job ad aggregator Adzuna, with more than 2,000 added this week. The advertised social media jobs attract an average advertised salary of £30,428. By comparison, there are 142,510 traditional customer service roles up for grabs – but they pay a lot less, with an average advertised salary of £25,961. As the pay levels indicate social media account managers need to be able to do more than speak emoji. Businesses want marketing and social media graduates who can multitask, managing multiple social channels, develop campaigns and manage nuts and bolts stuff such as web analytics. Doug Monro, co-founder of Adzuna, explains: “Social media managers need to be something of a jack of all trades: part marketeer and public relations professional as well as a customer services expert with an overarching role as ambassadors of the brands they represent.” The Newcastle baker Greggs has become a surprise social media sensation with 135,000 followers thanks to its lively feed of quirky news that marries popular culture with pasties. One popular hit turned the golden fur cape Rihanna golden wore to the Met Gala into a steak bake. It even had enough wit to turnaround a PR disaster in 2014 when the Google algorithm replaced the company’s logo with a fake one advising it had been “providing shit to scum for over 70 years”. The account is the work of just one individual based at its Newcastle head office. Greggs tweeter-in-chief prefers to remain anonymous, but said it required no specific training although being a “people person” helped: “My job is all about managing our social communities. Which is great as I love talking to customers. We work as a team to come up with the brand posts we share on social media. My favourite tweets are when we find funny things customers are saying about Greggs. Generally speaking, only enquiries that relate to a corporate issue require a sign off.” In the summer embattled Southern Rail also struck social media gold when it handed over its Twitter account to 15-year-old Eddie Smith who was on a fortnight’s work experience. Given it had already been labelled Britain’s worst performing train operator it had nothing to lose and weary passengers delighted in the schoolboy’s banter, which included batting away the suggestion he was a bot. “I’m a person, I’m 15 years old, I’m here, and I don’t think a Russian hackbot would like Doritos,” was his deft reply. Virgin declined to give the Guardian any details of its social media operation or the kind of training they receive. There is evidence, however, that businesses have begun to recognise the pitfalls of hiring inexperienced staff: according to website Totaljobs there was a 45% reduction in the number of social media internships listed in 2017. “Understanding the nuances of how to deal with dissatisfied customers is a skill,” explains David Clift, human resources director at Totaljobs. “Hence why we are seeing a rise in demand for candidates with experience of handling traditional customer complaints in the social media era.” Stewart-Allen says brands should make apologies the priority when things go wrong. She is critical, for example, of Dove’s response to the recent controversy about a Facebook advert that showed a black woman turning into a white woman. “I don’t think they made a sufficient apology for the mishap,” she says. “Social media is all about context, you have to get the tone right.” Striking the right tone (#sweet-tweets) *Virgin Trains once delighted its followers when it came to the rescue of a passenger who tweeted to say: “I’ve just had a reasonably large poo and there is no toilet roll left on the @virgintrains 19.30 train from Euston to Glasgow pls send help.” The train operator’s reply was swift: “Which coach? We’ll send someone down to you.” *Argos showed its street-speak credentials when a customer called Immy Badman tweeted to say he was having trouble geting a new games consol from a store in Manchester and was not entirely satisfied with the level of service being offered in store: “Yo. Wen u gettin da ps4 tings in moss side? Ain’t waitin no more. Plus da Asian guy whu works dere got bare attitude”, tweeted Immy. The Argos tweeters shot back: “Safe badman, we getting sum more PS4 tings in wivin da next week y’get me. Soz bout da attitude, probz avin a bad day yo”. *Dominos pizza received a plaintiff tweet from an unhappy customer: “Yoooo. I ordered a pizza and came with no toppings on it or anything. Its just bread. Dominos were immediately on the case, asking for details so they could fix the problem, when the customer tweeted a second time: “Never mind. I opened the pizza upside down”. *Sainsbury’s tweeters got into a long and fishy conversation when a shopper tweeted to say: “I tried to buy some battered fish from @sainsburys but it didn’t have a bar cod!” The supermarket replied: “Were there no other packs in the plaice, or was that the sole one on the shelf? Floundering for an explanation!” Not to be outdone the shopper responded: “I tried dropping you a line, but this whole situation is giving me a haddock. What are you going to do about it? Let minnow”. Sainsburys carried on: “If I am herring you right, you’re looking to eel our relationship. I’ll tell the store to find the shelf and fillet” And that wasn’t even the end of the conversation ... • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/04/tottenham-hotspur-v-west-ham-united-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T21:56:54Z","webTitle":"Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/04/tottenham-hotspur-v-west-ham-united-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/04/tottenham-hotspur-v-west-ham-united-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Some slapstick nonsense in the West Ham area as Spurs take turns to have a shy at goal. Some pinball. It could go anywhere! But the Hammers hack clear, and that’s it! The visitors earn a deserved point: what a defensive performance, and what a goal by Obiang. They couldn’t complete a preposterous smash and grab, though; Son’s equally sensational strike gives Spurs a little deserved something too, reward for all that pressure and possession. West Ham rise to 15th, while Spurs are three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool. A fine end to the festive programme. Happy new year, everyone! 90 min +2: Masuaku clears a bouncing ball and nearly hoicks Lamela into the stand as well. All fair. Hard but fair. 90 min +1: There will be four added minutes. Aurier curls one into the West Ham box from a deep position on the right. Llorente misses his header at the far post, but he’d pulled Rice to the ground anyway and that’s a free kick to take the pressure off. 90 min: Noble comes sliding in on Llorente, and that one earns a booking. Plenty of pushing and shoving, but it hasn’t been a dirty game. 88 min: The resulting corner comes to nothing. Carroll is then booked for booting the ball away in the time-wasting manner. Some possible controversy in the build-up to the Son equaliser, by the way: Moyes is of the opinion that Aurier had illegally crumped Lanzini back up the pitch to win the ball and start the move. It was certainly a hearty challenge. 86 min: West Ham respond by throwing Carroll on for Lanzini. And then they go on the attack, Ayew dribbling in the Ricky Villa style into the left-hand side of the Spurs box. He goes this way and that, and suddenly he’s one on one with Lloris! But it’s a tight angle and his chip is deflected by the keeper over the bar. Anything Obiang can do, Son can do better. Or at least just as well. From 25 yards, with nothing much on, he unleashes a majestic riser that nestles into the top-right corner at great speed! Adrian had no chance whatsoever. What goals we’ve seen tonight! 83 min: From the corner, Vertonghen has a whack from the edge of the area. It’s deflected out for another corner, from which Wanyama miskicks dreadfully from 12 yards. No matter, though, because Spurs soon come back at West Ham and ... 82 min: Kane nearly skitters clear down the right, chasing a long ball, but Rice sticks to him well. Kane can’t make the area for a shot, so settles for a corner instead. Before the set piece can be taken, Spurs make their final change, Llorente coming on for Davies. 80 min: Son dribbles down the left but his low cross is easily snaffled at the near post by Adrian. 79 min: Lamela tries to wriggle his way through a small gap down the inside-left channel. He nearly makes it, but ends up conceding a free kick. West Ham were seriously rocking before that stunning strike, but they’re back in shape now. 77 min: A free kick for West Ham out on the right. Lanzini hoicks it long. Out on the left, Obiang curls one back towards the right-hand post. Kouyate is clear on the corner of the six-yard box! But he completely fluffs his header, sending it in the wrong direction, bouncing off apologetically to the right of goal. What a chance to make it two goals from two efforts! 75 min: A contender for song of the season, as the West Ham fans trill: “One shot, we’ve only had one shot.” Spurs have had very many, by comparison. Their latest, by Eriksen, fizzes towards the bottom left from 20 yards but it’s easily gathered by Adrian. 74 min: Spurs make a double change: Dier and Sissoko off, Lamela and Wanyama on. 72 min: West Ham quite rightly celebrated that wonder goal with some passion, though they hadn’t cleared their heads by the restart. And soon Kane was just to the right of the goal, trying to get a shot away. Five West Ham players surrounded him, an ersatz version of that famous Belgium v Maradona photo from 1982. The ball squeaks through the pack and nearly goes in at the near post. But Adrian turns it round. The corner leads to nothing. This is an astonishing goal! West Ham take their first serious shot in anger. And what a shot! Obiang, 30 yards out on the left, cuts inside and decides to go for it. He sends a heatseeker into the top left, and nearly takes the net off. Lloris got across, too, but such was the power he had no chance of saving that. What a goal! Fair to say that had not been coming. 68 min: Spurs are getting closer and closer. Eriksen slips the ball forward, down the middle, to release Kane. The striker traps, turns and shoots, but Zabaleta slides in to block. The ball loops up for Alli, who tries to head home but sends the ball over the bar. Adrian gives him a wee clatter. Penalty? Nope, though you’ve definitely seen those. To be fair to West Ham, though, Kane was offside when receiving Eriksen’s pass, so two wrongs kind of make a right. 66 min: Eriksen’s turn to have a dig from distance. He cuts in from the left and looks for the bottom corner. Adrian smothers. 65 min: A knackered Hernandez, last seen running through quicksand, is replaced by Ayew. 64 min: Vertonghen takes a punt from 25 yards. The ball ricochets to Kane, bursting clear into the box down the inside left. He shoots from a tight angle. Adrian blocks. The flag goes up for offside, correctly. 63 min: Son curls a ball into the West Ham area from the right. Kane goes down at the far post as he attempts to connect. Zabaleta had an arm on his back, and Kane wants a penalty kick. He’s not getting it. It would have been generous, but you’ve seen refs award them. 61 min: Spurs respond with purpose, Kane very nearly getting on the end of a Davies left-wing cross, Eriksen taking a fierce low slam from the edge of the box, Alli heading another cross harmlessly wide right. 60 min: Some Spurs sloppiness in the midfield, as though it’s all too easy to boss that part of the pitch. Suddenly Hernandez is racing clear on goal! But he’s running through treacle, and easily chased down by Sanchez. For a second there, it looked as though West Ham were going to take a very saucy lead. 58 min: Space for Alli down the right. He powers towards the byline, past Rice, and pulls a low one back for Son, near the penalty spot. Son has time to get his act together, but rather scuffs his shot through a thicket of players and the ball rolls harmlessly into Adrian’s arms. A real chance. 57 min: Son loops a pass down the left and very nearly releases Kane, but Ogbonna steps across to deal with the situation, controlling, turning and lumping clear. That’s marvellous defending, with the super-hot Kane breathing down his neck. 55 min: Alli tries to juggle the ball past Reid on the edge of the box. Reid hacks the ball away but clips Alli’s high-kicking leg. It’s a fair coming together for a ball that’s there to be won, and though the Tottenham faithful scream for a penalty as Alli falls, the player himself makes no claim. Penny for Arsene Wenger’s thoughts, huh. 54 min: West Ham are quite happy to sit back and soak it all up. Why not? It worked for them in the first half. It’ll be interesting to see if they show any more ambition should they continue to frustrate Spurs. 52 min: This is all Spurs, up to the final third. West Ham own that bit of the pitch. Kane, the best part of 40 yards from goal on the left and getting a little frustrated, tries to replicate Robbie Fowler’s goal for Liverpool against Birmingham City in the 2001 League Cup final. Top marks for ambition. 50 min: More Spurs passing, hither and yon. But West Ham still hold firm. No gaps. Eriksen tries a chip down the inside-right channel, and very nearly finds the marauding Aurier, but the ball’s intercepted gracefully by Ogbonna. 48 min: Son stepovers his way down the left wing. He gets a yard on Kouyate, but then blasts a wild cross behind the goal. An end to a long period of patient Spurs possession. We’re back ... and they’re off again! West Ham get the ball rolling for the second half, their job only half done. It’s launched long and Lloris collects. “Martin Peters was a very good player but, ah ... dear old Jimmy was something special,” sighs Roy Everitt. Half-time viewing, courtesy of Mike Gibbons. “As it’s Spurs and West Ham, and the transfer window is open, a quick nod to the greatest swopsie transfer deal in English football history in March 1970. Martin Peters from Upton Park to White Hart Lane, and this fella - Harry Kane to the power of ten for any kids reading - in the other direction.” ... there’s nothing. The teams trudge off. In the stands, a rendition of I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles fills the air. The away fans a lot happier than the home support. 45 min: After a sleepy couple of minutes, Spurs wake up. Eriksen powers down the centre, exchanges crisp passes with Alli, and slams a shot goalwards from 25 yards. A deflection gives Adrian some work to do as the ball moves through the air. The keeper tips it over. Corner. From which ... 42 min: Hernandez over-elaborates in the middle of the park, allowing Spurs to tear en masse towards the West Ham area. But the visitors make sure there are no gaps in the middle, the attack slows down, and Alli eventually plays a forward ball to nobody. West Ham clear their lines. 40 min: Spurs ping it around a bit, but get nowhere. Eventually Sissoko tries switching play down the right but only succeeds in passing the ball straight out of play. A few frustrated groans from the home faithful. 38 min: Hernandez goes down very easily as he brushes against Vertonghen while attempting a fancy backflick. Vertonghen looks perplexed at the award of a free kick, which allows West Ham to load the box and hoick one in from the right. The set piece isn’t up to much, though. No drama. 36 min: West Ham launch another attack, Hernandez rolling a pass down the right for Lanzini, who has team-mates in the box to find. But instead of crossing, he cuts inside and considers shooting. Then doesn’t shoot. Then he considers shooting again. Eventually the ball’s taken off his toe. What a waste. Calmer heads, and West Ham could have worked Lloris once or twice in the past few minutes. But here we are. 34 min: A real chance for Hernandez, in the centre circle, to set Obiang free down the middle. Spurs sloppy in midfield and light at the back. But he claps his pass straight into Dier, the opportunity suddenly gone. Spurs go up the other end and nearly make West Ham pay big. Vertonghen, out on the left, wafts a gorgeous long diagonal ball to Aurier, rushing towards the West Ham box. Aurier rolls the ball across the face of goal. Kane, romping in, meets it, but only at full stretch, running it out of play to the left of goal instead of shooting. That would have been a lovely goal. 32 min: Spurs enjoy a lot of possession in the middle of the park. West Ham continue to hold their shape. Nothing more to report. 30 min: Spurs are turning up the heat again. First Son dribbles down the left in the baroque style and reaches the corner of the six-yard box, but can’t quite force a shot through. Then another wave of attack ends with Eriksen firing low, hard and not too far wide of the right-hand post. Adrian probably had it covered, but it was a decent effort from distance nonetheless. 28 min: Masuaku curls a ball into the Spurs area from a very deep position on the left. It seems to unnerve Lloris, who just about ushers it out of play to the right of goal without panicking. But had Hernandez taken more of a gamble on the run, that could have caused Spurs a little bother. The home side go straight up the other end and nearly score, Kane curling one towards the bottom right from the left of the D. Adrian meets it at full stretch, and the ball’s half cleared. Dier immediately dispatches it into Row Z. 26 min: West Ham are holding their defensive shape very well right now. Spurs probe about quite a lot, but they’re forced to turn back when they approach the final third. The home fans have fallen a little quiet as a result. 24 min: A little bit of space for Hernandez down the right, and a rare attack for West Ham. The Little Pea sends a roller through the Spurs area, but nobody in claret and blue has kept up with play, and so the home side mop up without much fuss. Spurs go down the other end, Alli making good down the left, taking advantage of a misjudged Reid interception. Alli fires one in low but it’s hacked clear purposefully by Ogbonna. 22 min: Son flicks a couple of passes down the left for Davies on the overlap. The first results in a cross that’s too deep, the second runs out for a goal kick. Spurs continue to enjoy a fair bit of space down this flank. “What Russell Hope forgot to mention was that David Cross scored four goals that day,” reports John Tumbridge. “I had too until he revived my internal pain.” 20 min: Corner for Spurs down the left. Eriksen’s dead-ball delivery is uncharacteristically flat, in both senses of the word, failing to beat the first man. West Ham clear their lines with a collective yawn. 19 min: West Ham have been second best so far, but not embarrassingly so. Spurs spend time in the middle of the park, knocking it around in the passive style. David Moyes will be happy enough with the way things are going. 16 min: Eriksen slips a ball into the West Ham area from the right for Kane. Faced with a tight angle, the striker smashes a ball across the face of goal, and it’s sliced into his own net by Reid. However Kane was offside. No goal. But there’s some better news for Spurs, relatively speaking, from 11 min’s Roy Everitt. “Actually, I’ve just checked and it was only 5-3, on 6 November 1976.” 15 min: Spurs pin West Ham back awhile. Aurier twists down the right and slips a ball into the box for Kane, on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. But Kane can’t turn and get a shot away, much as he tries. West Ham clear. 12 min: Ogbonna hooks a pass down the inside-left channel and isn’t a million miles away from freeing Lanzini. Too much juice, though, and it’s all the way through to Lloris. Still, the home side were snoozing a little there. Lanzini grimaces, knowing that was a half-chance to create something. 11 min: Another run by Son down the left. It doesn’t really come to much, but the Spurs forward is gettting plenty of space down this flank. “The only time I ever went to a West Ham v Spurs game was in the mid to late seventies,” writes Roy Everitt. “Being young and naive, it wasn’t until I was on the tube approaching Upton Park with a load of fellow Spurs fans that I realised I was basically wearing claret and blue. No harm was done, except to Spurs, who lost about 5-0, I think.” 9 min: Son and Zabaleta go high-kicking into a 50-50 about 35 yards from the Spurs goal. West Ham get the decision, much to Son’s annoyance. Lanzini lumps the free kick into a loaded box, but it doesn’t result in a chance and Spurs clear easily enough. 7 min: A lull. A strange rhythm to this game so far. “Notice how when Moyes mentioned the top teams, he made no mention of Manchester United?” asks Alan from Ireland. “Sly little dig there at his old club me thinks!” Maybe. Though it is possible the mere sensation of that club’s name on his lips would send him into toxic shock. Dark days. Best take no chances. 5 min: From the set piece, Adrian doesn’t give a good account of himself under a high ball. His fumble leads to another corner, but that one leads to nothing. Spurs have suddenly come on strong. 4 min: Dier and Eriksen triangulate down the middle, the latter nearly feeding Kane into the box. Adrian gathers. Spurs soon come again, though, with Son down the left. His low cross isn’t cleared by the miskicking Obiang. Kane tries to force the loose ball into the net from a tight angle. He gets it past the keeper but Rice heroically clumps it away from extreme danger, for a corner. 2 min: A fairly quiet start, apart from a rasping rendition of Bubbles coming from one corner of the famous old/new stadium. Plenty of time for this match to get going. And we’re off! Spurs get the ball rolling and then take it upfield. They hold onto possession awhile, then move it backwards, giving most of the team an early touch. The teams are out! Tottenham wear their famous lilywhite, West Ham their equally storied claret and blue. A rare old atmosphere at Wembley ahead of a big London derby, and here’s Spurs fan Russell Hope to whip it up a little more: “Just been reflecting on the GOOD OLD DAYS and my first Spurs-West ‘aaaaaam game. August 1981, Tottenham’s first home game of the season after the Ricky Villa cup final ... and we lost 4-0. I had quite a lot of wee thrown over me and was chased down the High Road afterwards by a group of exuberant eastenders. Modern football, eh? Ruined it all.” We’ll be off in a minute! Mauricio Pochettino’s turn. “It is hard to keep the momentum, but we have to give the team fresh legs. It is important for us to keep fighting for fourth; three points will be massive for us. It is true that we need to give Harry Kane a good rest, because he was feeling unwell, but hopefully today he is fully recovered and can play the 90 minutes. It will be perfect for us if we finish this game with three points and the perfect festive season. But the game will be very close and we must fight.” David Moyes is asked how sweet Andy Carroll’s late winner against West Brom tasted. “It was great for us, three important points at this time of the season. Andy has been injured and in truth, if we had our way, he wouldn’t even be on the bench today. Marko Arnautivoc is injured as well, he’s been really important for us, but not fit to play tonight. This is similar to playing against Arsenal, Manchester City or Chelsea, I think Tottenham are one of the top teams, the quality of players they have got. But we will have a go. We have to be compact and difficult to play against. We’ve done it in some games, hopefully we get back to that tonight.” Given the teams both played 48 hours ago, it’s something of a surprise that each manager has made only three changes to their starting XIs. Mauricio Pochettino calls up Harry Kane, Serge Aurier and Moussa Sissoko; they take the place of Fernando Llorente, Kieran Trippier and Erik Lamela, all of whom are named as subs. David Moyes drops Andy Carroll to the bench, while Marko Arnautovic and Aaron Cresswell have injury issues. Stepping up: Javier Hernandez, Mark Noble and Declan Rice. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Aurier, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Davies, Sissoko, Dier, Eriksen, Alli, Son, Kane. Subs: Trippier, Lamela, Wanyama, Vorm, Llorente, Dembele, Winks. West Ham United: Adrian, Reid, Ogbonna, Rice, Zabaleta, Kouyate, Noble, Obiang, Masuaku, Lanzini, Hernandez. Subs: Carroll, Ayew, Haksabanovic, Hart, Martinez, Quina, Makasi. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). It’d be understandable if both of these teams are feeling a little tired. Tottenham played in a tempest at Swansea just 48 hours ago. At the same time, West Ham were embroiled in a 94-minute tussle with West Bromwich Albion at the London Stadium. And now here they are at Wembley for one of the season’s big capital clashes. Is there no let-up?! Both sides will be feeling knackered yet content. Tottenham are on a three-game winning streak, having responded to defeat at Manchester City before Christmas by swatting aside Burnley, Southampton and Swansea City. Harry Kane, Mr 2017, hasn’t scored yet this year, but to be fair he only played 22 minutes against the Swans and still managed to set up Dele Alli with an exquisite assist. A win here will move Spurs to within a point of Liverpool in fourth, all set for another tilt at a Champions League spot. West Ham meanwhile have been buoyed by that dramatic late, late win over the Baggies, Andy Carroll, Mr 2018 as things stand, suddenly back among the goals. The Hammers have regrouped under David Moyes, and should they win this one tonight, they’ll rise to the heady heights of 11th. That may be asking a lot, seeing Spurs won 3-2 at the London Stadium back in September. Then again, West Ham emerged victorious by the same scoreline here at Wembley a month later, having launched one of the great League Cup comebacks. So good luck calling this one with supreme confidence. Whatever happens, there’s a fair chance we’ll be served up some entertainment. In their last six meetings, these two clubs have served up three 3-2s and a 4-1. During that time, it’s three wins apiece. Spurs are strong favourites, with West Ham 10-1 outsiders at your favourite turf accountant, but these lads are never the most predictable when they meet, so on with the show! Kick off: 8pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/04/beatles-promoter-tony-calder-dies-aged-74","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T10:45:58Z","webTitle":"Beatles promoter Tony Calder dies aged 74","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/04/beatles-promoter-tony-calder-dies-aged-74","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/04/beatles-promoter-tony-calder-dies-aged-74","fields":{"headline":"Beatles promoter Tony Calder dies aged 74","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tony Calder, the music manager who promoted the Beatles’ debut single Love Me Do, died on 2 January at the age of 74. Calder, who was born in Surrey, was hired by Beatles manager Brian Epstein to promote the band in the early 1960s. Soon after, Calder and Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham – whom Calder had met while working at Decca Records – formed a PR company called Image. It managed the Rolling Stones and promoted the Beach Boys. In 1965, Calder and Oldham founded the independent label Immediate Records, whose roster included the Small Faces, Rod Stewart and Fleetwood Mac. Immediate closed in 1970. Oldham was among those who paid tribute to Calder following his death, posting a message on Twitter that read: “A member of the family has left us.” In the mid-60s, Calder had a brief spell as a record producer, working with Marianne Faithfull on her singles Come and Stay With Me and This Little Bird, both Top 10 hits in the UK. In the 70s, he signed acts including the Bay City Rollers and Black Sabbath. In 1978, he began managing Eddy Grant. In his later years, Calder co-authored a biography of Abba with Oldham. As of 2007, he was working with Eddy Grant again as his business manager. Calder reportedly died in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital following a battle with pneumonia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/04/lily-cole-bronte-society-resignation-nick-holland","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T18:38:09Z","webTitle":"Lily Cole responds to Brontë Society row as member who quit is branded a snob","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/04/lily-cole-bronte-society-resignation-nick-holland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/04/lily-cole-bronte-society-resignation-nick-holland","fields":{"headline":"Lily Cole responds to Brontë Society row as member who quit is branded a snob","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lily Cole has responded to criticism of her appointment to the Brontë Society, asking that her work be “judged on its own merits” as one member’s decision to resign over her role was widely criticised as snobbery. The Brontë Society promotes “the Brontës’ literary legacy within contemporary society” and runs the Brontë Parsonage Museum in the Yorkshire village of Haworth, where the family lived. But there have been several clashes between modernists and traditionalists over the group’s position in the 21st century, with both sides fighting over how best to promote the Brontës to new readers. Cole, an actor and model who has a double first in History of Art from Cambridge, was chosen to be a “creative partner” in the society, as part of marking the bicentenary year of Emily Brontë’s birth. But in an online article and in a comment to the Times, Brontë Society member and author Nick Holland said he would resign over Cole’s appointment, which he called “rank farce”. “What would Emily Brontë think if she found that the role of chief ‘artist’ and organiser in her celebratory year was a supermodel?” Holland wrote on his website. “We all know the answer to that, and anyone who doesn’t isn’t fit to make the decision or have any role in the governance of the Brontë Society. “The very basic rule should have been that the person chosen for such an important role as creative partner is a writer. The drive now is for one thing – attracting a young audience. Being trendy is the ultimate aim, with the Brontës themselves relegated to the sidelines.” Holland said he could “no longer continue to be a member of a society whose leaders’ views are so opposed to my own ... It’s best that I leave the society now, before they announce James Corden as the creative partner for 2019, a year in which Patrick Brontë is being remembered, and Rita Ora as organiser for Anne Brontë’s celebrations in 2020.” Cole, who has worked on literacy campaigns, told the Guardian on Thursday: “Emily Brontë, whose extraordinary novel Wuthering Heights has stirred the world for over 150 years, published her work under an androgynous pseudonym: Ellis Bell. Writing in 1850, Charlotte Brontë explained why she and her sisters Emily and Anne all used pseudonyms: ‘We did not like to declare ourselves women, because we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice.’ “When I was asked by the Brontë Parsonage Museum to work on a piece to commemorate Emily Brontë’s birth I immediately thought of Emily’s pseudonym, and what that gesture represented. Why could a woman not publish under her own name? What was life like for women living in the UK in the 19th century? What circumstances would also give rise to a child being found abandoned in a city in the 18th century, as Heathcliff was? “Now I find myself wondering, fleetingly, if I should present the short film I am working on for the museum under a pseudonym myself, so that it will be judged on its own merits, rather than on my name, my gender, my image or my teenage decisions. I would not be so presumptuous as to guess Emily’s reaction to my appointment as a creative partner at the museum, were she alive today. Yet I respect her intellect and integrity enough to believe that she would not judge any piece of work on name alone.” Holland’s response to Cole’s appointment has been widely criticised, with several writers calling it snobbery online. “I’m sorry that some people have felt angry about it or against it,” Brontë scholar Samantha Ellis told the Guardian. “I think Lily Cole is a brilliant idea. With Tracey [Chevalier], Simon [Armitage] and now Lily, this move has been absolutely fantastic and brought loads more people to the Brontës and the parsonage. The Brontës were passionate, and that’s why people care so much about them. “Lily’s clearly passionate about the arts and I don’t see why she wouldn’t be a good advocate. I do think there is a whiff of misogyny about some of the statements made about Lily on Twitter and beyond. People must remember that the Brontës themselves were young women – I think it is interesting that the society chose a young woman.” Former Brontë Society president Bonnie Greer told the Times: “I don’t know what Lily Cole has to do with the Brontës but what did I have to do with them, other than loving Wuthering Heights? There has to be a balance and a mix. So if Lily Cole can open the museum, Emily Brontë etc to a new generation who can keep the whole show on the road, what’s wrong with that?” On Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Brontë Society was unable to confirm or deny if Holland had resigned due to data protection laws, but said: “The Brontës were trailblazers and it is one of the roles of the society to ensure that their lives and work continue to be of relevance and interest to modern society. Lily’s innovative projects in the fields of literacy, nature, storytelling and the environment are the perfect fit for Emily, and her originality and creativity will bring a fresh perspective to our 2018 celebrations.” Resignations and fights in the Brontë Society date back to the 1990s, with a £1m anonymous donation once withdrawn due to divisions between society members and leadership. In 2015, the then president Greer lambasted “malevolent lamebrains” and resigned, along with six council members, after a heated annual general meeting that saw Greer use her shoe as a gavel to keep order. At the 2016 annual general meeting, more fighting was reported, with former chair Alexandra Lesley blaming “a lot of bad behaviour” for her resignation, one member repeatedly “screaming” until he was threatened with expulsion and another saying she “felt like I had come into the Stasi” after reading the society’s new rules."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/04/teenager-arrested-over-fatal-new-years-day-stabbing-london-old-street","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T16:22:13Z","webTitle":"Man stabbed to death in east London on New Year's Eve named","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/04/teenager-arrested-over-fatal-new-years-day-stabbing-london-old-street","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/04/teenager-arrested-over-fatal-new-years-day-stabbing-london-old-street","fields":{"headline":"Man stabbed to death in east London on New Year's Eve named","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of the victims of a spate of fatal stabbings in London over the new year has been named by police as Taofeek Lamidi. Lamidi, 20, was repeatedly stabbed during an attack in Memorial Avenue, West Ham, on New Year’s Eve and a postmortem found the cause of death to be a knife wound to the heart. No one has been arrested in connection with the incident. He was one of four people stabbed to death in the capital within 15 hours, with two others killed on New Year’s Eve and one on New Year’s Day. DCI Mark Cranwell said: “Taofeek was repeatedly stabbed and was found lying in the street suffering horrific injuries from which he did not recover. Violent incidents such as this have no place on London’s streets and we are urgently following up a number of lines of inquiry to trace those involved and responsible. “We know that the victim was with a number of people at the time of the attack, and I urgently need to trace this group of young men.” Police also confirmed the identity of the victim of an attack on New Year’s Eve in Tulse Hill as Kyall Parnell, 17, from Thornton Heath. He had previously been named in newspaper reports. The first of the stabbings over the new year took place at 11.30am on 31 December, when an 18-year-old man was attacked in Enfield, north London. He died in hospital that evening. Lamidi was stabbed at about 7.30pm and was pronounced dead at the scene at 8.22pm. Parnell was attacked at about 10.40pm. On Thursday police arrested two 16-year-old boys in connection with the murder. A 20-year-old victim, who has not yet been identified, was stabbed during a house party at a flat near Old Street, central London, at about 2.35am on 1 January. An 18-year-old and a 19-year-old have been arrested on suspicion of murder.A 20-year-old man, who was also stabbed during the incident, was taken to a north London hospital, where he remains in a critical but stable condition. The three attacks on 31 December brought the number of fatal stabbings in London in 2017 to 80. Five men have been arrested in connection with the Enfield killing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/04/tibetan-activist-trial-china-inciting-separatism-tashi-wangchuk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T12:21:13Z","webTitle":"Tibetan activist put on trial in China for inciting separatism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/04/tibetan-activist-trial-china-inciting-separatism-tashi-wangchuk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/04/tibetan-activist-trial-china-inciting-separatism-tashi-wangchuk","fields":{"headline":"Tibetan activist put on trial in China for inciting separatism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Tibetan language activist who appeared in a New York Times video has been put on trial for separatism in proceedings dismissed as a “sham” by rights groups, a sign of increasingly hardline attitudes towards government critics. Tashi Wangchuk pleaded not guilty to the charges of “inciting separatism” during the four-hour trial in the western Chinese city of Yushu, where the state’s main piece of evidence against him was the nine-minute video, according to his lawyer, Liang Xiaojun. The activist was detained two years ago after appearing in the video where he criticised policies towards Tibetan language education, attempted to sue the local government and tried to entice China’s state broadcaster, CCTV, to report on his concerns. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted, and the judge said he would deliver a verdict at a later date. China’s Communist party-controlled courts have a conviction rate of more than 99%. Tashi had advocated for greater use of Tibetan in education, bemoaning the use of Mandarin for most instruction in classrooms where the majority of students are Tibetan. Many Tibetans view language policies as an attempt by the government to destroy their culture. In the New York Times video, he travels to Beijing and tries to file a lawsuit against officials in Yushu, but is ultimately turned away. “I want to try to use the People’s Republic of China’s laws to solve the problem,” he said in the video. Rights groups described the case against him as “ludicrously unjust”. Roseann Rife, East Asia research director at Amnesty International, said: “It is appalling that Tashi Wangchuk could face up to 15 years’ imprisonment simply for expressing his views in media interviews.” Exposing and criticising the suppression by government of Tibetan language and culture was a legitimate exercise of free speech, she added. “Labelling it as a form of ‘inciting separatism’ demonstrates how the Chinese authorities blatantly misuse this criminal charge to silence dissent.” The Chinese government has instituted harsh policies in its far western regions, home to millions of ethnic minority citizens, in an effort to quell dissent by force. Even peaceful calls for greater autonomy from Beijing – technically guaranteed under Chinese law – are often met with punishment. Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said: “All Tashi Wangchuk has done is peacefully advocate for constitutionally-guaranteed rights. If Chinese authorities consider that inciting separatism, it’s hard to tell what isn’t.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/nov/24/nicolas-roeg-dies-aged-90-dont-look-now-walkabout","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-24T14:58:34Z","webTitle":"Nicolas Roeg, director of Don't Look Now and Walkabout, dies aged 90","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/24/nicolas-roeg-dies-aged-90-dont-look-now-walkabout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/nov/24/nicolas-roeg-dies-aged-90-dont-look-now-walkabout","fields":{"headline":"Nicolas Roeg, director of Don't Look Now and Walkabout, dies aged 90","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Nicolas Roeg, one of Britain’s most admired and influential film-makers, has died aged 90, his family has announced. Roeg is best known for a run of acclaimed movies in the 1970s and early 80s, including horror Don’t Look Now, Australian outback drama Walkabout, The Man Who Fell to Earth (starring David Bowie), and Performance (starring Mick Jagger). He developed his own distinctive film-making style, usually involving puzzle-like, non-linear storytelling, lyrical visual imagery and challenging themes such as sex, death, horror and mental breakdown. His films rarely appealed to mass audiences, but often received critical acclaim, and went on to become cult classics. His influence has been acknowledged by film-makers including Christopher Nolan, Paul Thomas Anderson, Steven Soderbergh and Danny Boyle. “I’ve been told my movies are difficult to market,” Roeg told the Guardian in 2007. “It isn’t a horror film, it isn’t a thriller. Yes, there’s a love story in it but it could hardly be called a romance. People love things in boxes, classified a genre. But it’s just life. Life and birth and sex and love – they don’t necessarily all go together.” Before he took up directing, Roeg was a prominent cinematographer, working on features such as David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, Roger Corman’s The Masque of Red Death, Richard Lester’s Petulia and François Truffaut’s Fahrenheit 451. With no formal training, he worked his way up from the bottom. Born and raised in London, Roeg claimed he only entered the film industry because there was a studio across the road from his childhood home in Marylebone. After leaving school and completing his national service, he got a casual job at the studio in 1947, starting as a tea-maker and rising through the ranks from clapper-boy to focus-puller to camera operator. In 1968, having established himself as a cinematographer, Roeg paired with film-maker Donald Cammell for their joint directorial debut, Performance. The film was originally intended as a vehicle for Mick Jagger, who was at the height of his fame, but between Cammell’s mystical gangster-meets-rock star story and Roeg’s visual inventiveness, the end product was deemed too unconventional for release by the studio, and was shelved for two years, but became a counterculture hit. Roeg’s follow-up was equally unconventional: Walkabout, set in the Australian outback and starring a teenage Jenny Agutter and Indigenous Australian actor David Gulpilil (his screen debut). As with Performance, Walkabout was a commercial flop on release, but steadily grew in status and acclaim. It was 1973’s Don’t Look Now that gave Roeg his first genuine hit. A supernatural horror set in gloomy, off-season Venice, with Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie as grieving parents, it is a regular fixture in lists of the greatest British movies ever made. Roeg continued with a steady succession of unorthodox features, including sci-fi The Man Who Fell To Earth (which capitalised on Bowie’s otherworldly pop persona), psychological thriller Bad Timing (starring Art Garfunkel and Theresa Russell, the latter of whom Roeg married and cast in five more of his films), Eureka (starring Gene Hackman), Insignificance, and desert-island tale Castaway. After 1990’s uncharacteristic The Witches, based on Roald Dahl’s story and made with Jim Henson’s creature workshop, Roeg’s output became more scattershot and sporadic: minor erotic thrillers, short films and one final feature, Puffball: The Devil’s Eyeball, in 2007, and a memoir, The World is Ever Changing, in 2013. Having risen through the ranks and devised his own, unique film language, Roeg held firm convictions in cinema as a distinct art form. “Movies are not scripts – movies are films,” he said in a 2006 interview. “They’re not books, they’re not the theatre. It’s a completely different discipline, it exists on its own. I would say that the beauty of it is, it’s not the theatre, it’s not done over again. It’s done in bits and pieces. Things are happening which you can’t get again.” Roeg is survived by his wife, Harriet Harper, and his six children, Waldo, Nico, Sholto, Luc, Maximilian and Statten."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/04/cenk-tosun-join-everton-besiktas","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T22:53:00Z","webTitle":"Cenk Tosun may join Everton in time to face Liverpool, says Sam Allardyce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/04/cenk-tosun-join-everton-besiktas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/04/cenk-tosun-join-everton-besiktas","fields":{"headline":"Cenk Tosun may join Everton in time to face Liverpool, says Sam Allardyce","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sam Allardyce has said Everton are on the brink of signing Cenk Tosun and hope to register the Turkey international in time for Friday’s FA Cup derby against Liverpool. Everton have agreed a deal rising to £27m for the striker following talks with the Besiktas president, Fikret Orman, in London on Wednesday. Tosun has still to finalise a four-and-a-half year contract at Goodison Park and pass a medical but, providing both are completed before midday on Friday, the 26-year-old could feature in the Everton squad for the third-round tie at Anfield. “It is just personal terms now, the final stage,” Allardyce said on Thursday. “After long negotiations we are nearly there. He might even be registered before the FA Cup but securing the player is the most important thing because a lack of goals has been our biggest area of concern, and before I got here. With his pedigree and his age – we’ve not got many players in that elite age group in our squad – hopefully he will show he is good value for money. “If we get the transfer done and he comes and scores goals, it will be exceptional business. The club has searched high and low for a striker for a long time, since before I got here, and he was the one we focused on. He wants to come here.” The Everton manager is wary of risking Tosun’s fitness in the derby but admits his inclusion may be necessary against Liverpool due to the well-documented weaknesses in the team’s attack this season. “Possibly, but it all depends on his overall fitness,” said Allardyce. “We wouldn’t want to damage him just because it’s the FA Cup. There is a lot of mental energy that you burn when you are waiting for these moves to happen and the assessment will come from the medical and fitness staff. We just want to get the deal done first. There is a huge pressure on the lad and we hope he can handle it.” Allardyce, who expects to be without Michael Keane at Anfield due to a foot injury sustained in Monday’s defeat by Manchester United, admitted Everton’s belief that Ross Barkley will leave has not altered since his arrival as manager. He explained: “The club was resigned to losing Ross before I got here and I can’t see that changing.” Chelsea, who Barkley turned down on transfer deadline day in the summer, are understood to have approached Everton on Thursday regarding a January move for the midfielder. The England international is available on a free transfer in the summer but the current Premier League champions are considering paying a fee now to secure his signature. Earlier, the Besiktas president Orman confirmed the transfer of Tosun will be completed by the weekend. “Our interests and the player’s interests are important,” Orman said. “Cenk wants to join Everton. We want to do our part and we are working on a replacement. “The era of buy, buy, buy is over. This is the era of buy, add value and sell. A final deal has not been reached yet but we have an agreement over the price. The end is near. The transfer will be wrapped up by the weekend.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/04/16900-people-in-a-week-kept-in-nhs-ambulances-waiting-for-hospital-care","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T10:40:57Z","webTitle":"16,900 people in a week kept in NHS ambulances waiting for hospital care","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/04/16900-people-in-a-week-kept-in-nhs-ambulances-waiting-for-hospital-care","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/04/16900-people-in-a-week-kept-in-nhs-ambulances-waiting-for-hospital-care","fields":{"headline":"16,900 people in a week kept in NHS ambulances waiting for hospital care","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Record numbers of patients were forced to wait in the backs of ambulances last week as hospitals in England struggled to cope with demand for medical treatment as the NHS’s winter crisis began in earnest. In all, 16,900 people – the highest number this winter – were stuck in the backs of ambulances waiting to enter an A&amp;E unit to be assessed and treated in the week from Christmas Day to New Year’s Eve. Of those, 4,700 – again the most in any week this winter – had to endure a delay of at least an hour, according to NHS England’s latest figures, published on Thursday, on how the service is performing under the extra pressure that winter brings. Theresa May, on a visit to Frimley Park hospital in Surrey, apologised for delays to operations and hospital admissions, saying she recognised it was difficult for somebody who had had their operation postponed, and hoped procedures could be rescheduled “as soon as possible”. The prime minister said: “I know it’s difficult, I know it’s frustrating, I know it’s disappointing for people, and I apologise.” Her visit came after it emerged that tens of thousands of planned operations could be delayed for at least a month as the NHS deals with the most urgent cases. Hospitals in England also set another unwanted record last week with A&amp;E units forced to divert patients elsewhere because they could not cope a total of 39 times – the highest number this winter. The Liberal Democrats said the figures showed that the NHS’s winter crisis was deepening and blamed government underfunding of the health service. More than 20 NHS acute hospital trusts across England have been forced to declare a “black alert” – an official distress signal – in recent days. “These figures show the NHS crisis is worsening, with thousands of patients being stuck in ambulances outside A&amp;Es, and hospitals suffering from a severe lack of beds,” said Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader. “Every day seems to bring yet more bad news about the state of the health service. The blame lies firmly at the government’s door. Ministers refused to provide the funding top NHS officials said was necessary and now patients are paying the price.” Ministers should implement his party’s plan for an extra penny on income tax to raise an extra £6bn to improve the struggling health and social care systems, he added. Bed occupancy also rose again to worryingly high levels after it had dropped in the run-up to Christmas, when some patients were discharged so they could be at home. In all, 91.7% of general and acute hospital beds were full last week, up from 90.9% the week before and well above the 85% limit that hospitals are meant to stick to in order to reduce the risk of infections such as MRSA and C difficile and of patients suffering poor care. In the seven days to 31 December there were also the largest number of calls in a week to the NHS 111 telephone advice service. In all, 480,400 people rang seeking help, 21% more than in the previous week. The only good news for the health service in the latest statistics was that the average number of beds closed because of norovirus, the winter vomiting bug, fell to 880 from 1,026 the week before. However, NHS England’s summary of the latest situation stressed: “HThere has been a marked increase in recent weeks as to the number of reports of norovirus and they are now comparable with the five-year average for this week.” Flu is also becoming a problem for the NHS. There were seven flu-related deaths in the week to 24 December and 61 people admitted either to intensive care or a high dependency unit because of flu. Twenty-three people had died of flu in the last 11 weeks, NHS England said. On New Year’s Eve 12 hospital trusts reported 100% bed occupancy, the biggest total for several weeks. They included the Hillingdon hospitals in London, Basildon and Thurrock university hospitals, and the Queen Elizabeth hospital in King’s Lynn. Growing strains on the NHS will mean planned operations are delayed for at least a month as staff sift through the most urgent cases. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, apologised to patients in England on Wednesday for the wave of cancellations, saying it was “absolutely not what I want”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/04/schumann-quartet-review-salute-to-haydn-was-music-making-of-the-highest-order","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T13:39:22Z","webTitle":"Schumann Quartet review – fleetness, humour and dexterity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/04/schumann-quartet-review-salute-to-haydn-was-music-making-of-the-highest-order","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/04/schumann-quartet-review-salute-to-haydn-was-music-making-of-the-highest-order","fields":{"headline":"Schumann Quartet review – fleetness, humour and dexterity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Originally hailing from Cologne, the Schumann Quartet consists of three brothers – violinists Erik and Ken, and cellist Mark Schumann – and the Estonian-born violist Liisa Randalu. They recently held a residency at Schloss Esterházy in Eisenstadt, Austria, where Haydn was the Esterházy’s kapellmeister. Four of the composer’s quartets formed the programme for this captivating concert, which emphasised the often startling originality of Haydn’s contribution to the genre and the freshness and immediacy of the Schumanns’ playing. This was music-making of the highest order. They opened with the Quartet in G, Op 33, No 5. Haydn wrote it in 1781 after an intense period of operatic composition, and an air of theatricality hovers over its successive solos and ensembles. The slow movement is, in essence, an aria of lamentation for the first violin, its arching melody and closing cadenza sustained with beguiling poise and intensity by Erik Schumann. The subsequent scherzo, however, finds Haydn at his most impudent and experimental, pulling the listener off balance with rhythmic dislocations and jolting pauses, and the fleetness, humour and dexterity of the Schumanns’ playing was marvellously engaging. The D Minor Quartet, Op 72, which followed, is very different – a moody dialogue for four musicians, none of whom is given prominence. The almost instinctive sense of give and take that characterises the Schumanns’ playing was very much apparent in the meditative opening movement, in which instrumental pairings seem to form and dissolve in continuous interplay. The minuet was gracefully elegant, the adagio dark yet lyrical. The finale, almost alarming in its brevity, had wonderful elan. After the interval, the E flat Quartet, Op 17, No 3 was followed by Haydn’s last quartet, in F, Op 77, No 2. The two works are poles apart in scope. Haydn wrote the E flat Quartet primarily to show off the prowess of the violinist Luigi Tomasini, leader of the Esterházy orchestra. It is effectively a small-scale concerto, and the articulate grace and finesse of Erik Schumann’s playing was again paramount. The Quartet in F is a magnificent, even-handed work, embracing the lofty, the demotic and even the austere in the sparse duet between first violin and cello that opens the adagio. The Schumanns’ performance combined probing intensity with wit and energy, and a wonderful alertness to shifts of mood throughout. An outstanding evening, every second of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/jan/04/slender-man-horror-movie-trailer-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T12:35:20Z","webTitle":"Slender Man trailer: a mythical monster worth the wait?

Fat chance","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The rise of the Slender Man was an unfortunate period. An urban legend that rapidly spiralled out of control thanks to his supposed ability to prey on children and make them insane, the Slender Man ended up being cited as the motivating factor in any number of grisly, real events. He allegedly inspired stabbings, arson and an epidemic of suicide attempts on a South Dakota reservation. Most notoriously of all, two 12-year-old Wisconsin schoolgirls stabbed a classmate 19 times because they apparently wanted to become proxies for the Slender Man. Thankfully, the Slender Man was merely a blip, a weird instance of transient digital folklore that caused plenty of damage and then vanished. Except now it’s back, because Sony Pictures has made a film about the spooky old Slender Man! That’s fun, right? Not inappropriate or exploitative or irresponsible or anything like that. The Slender Man trailer has now appeared online. Fortunately, its last half is basically a compilation of all the film’s scariest bits, which I will now present to you so that you never have to spend money on this ridiculous dreck. 1. The bulk of the trailer essentially offers a swift run-through of all the Slender Man’s powers. The first of these is his ability to rattle doors. Which is quite scary, admittedly, but only if you also have an irrational fear of stiff breezes. 2. The Slender Man can also make people jerk their heads around quickly, increasing the possibility of minor whiplash. Fortunately for the Slender Man, there aren’t any no-win, no-fee personal injury lawyers in hell. 3. MAGGOTS. 4. I have to own up here: I don’t actually know what the Slender Man has done to this girl. She might be alive, or she might be dead. Those might be roots coming out of her face, or clumps of hair. They might be electrical cables for all anyone knows. Either way, what a rotter that bloody Slender Man is. 5. In 2014, when hysteria surrounding the Slender Man was at its peak, the following poem did the rounds online, underlining the impossible extent of his evil: “Beware the Slender Man and make sure the nurse checks / For when he’s inside you, you’ll deface some Perspex.” This scene is that poem made horribly tangible. 6. Oh, and the Slender Man will make you attempt suicide. You remember, just like the 103 real-life residents of the Pine Ridge Indian reservation who all attempted suicide in part thanks to the irresponsible spread of stories about a fictitious suicide spirit who shared several similarities with the Slender Man? Remember that? Anyway, cool scene. 7. The Slender Man will also make you stab yourself in the eyeball with a scalpel. For clarification, Slender Man the creature will make you stab yourself in the eyeball with a scalpel. Slender Man the movie will only make you wish that you’d stabbed yourself in the eyeball before sitting down to watch it. 8. ROOTS. 9. Finally, and most terrifyingly of all, the Slender Man will force you to don a Beppe from EastEnders blood beard. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Especially if you invested in the Slender Man film and expected to see any of your money back ever again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/10/no-one-ever-really-dies-review-pharrell-with-bells-on","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"NERD: No_One Ever Really Dies review – it’s Pharrell with bells on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/10/no-one-ever-really-dies-review-pharrell-with-bells-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/10/no-one-ever-really-dies-review-pharrell-with-bells-on","fields":{"headline":"NERD: No_One Ever Really Dies review – it’s Pharrell with bells on","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Self-titling your fifth album sends a signal. The glad tidings are that No_One Ever Really Dies is not one of those rock fusions NERD have made in the past just to prove how versatile the production duo of Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo (and their childhood friend Shae Haley) could be. NERD are not only back, for the first time since 2010’s Nothing album, then, but relevant – political, even, in marked contrast to their slinkier incarnations. You get the impression that, however huge a hit Happy was for Williams, there was a desire for him to make some beats that could in no way soundtrack a children’s film. There is a strong Yolo bent, redolent of Pharrell’s Skateboard P days, to No_One Ever Really Dies. One track, Don’t Don’t Do It!, even breaks into something like ska. This is a brash, busy party record with its eyes wide open, in which the NERD brand is thoroughly refreshed. Rhythms and visuals to the fore, the tracks that have emerged thus far are the album’s more ferociously direct. Featuring Rihanna rapping bars – a first – the lead-off, Lemon, cribs from trap and the kind of pristine dewdrop beats NERD, the Neptunes and Pharrell solo have previously deployed in their more minimal phases. Another A-lister, Future, is front and centre on the banging 1000 – a deranged new wave take on trap, whose rich video churns through recent riot footage, the Dead Kennedys (“Nazi redneck assholes fuck off!”) and some fierce formation dancing. By contrast, the equally fraught Rollinem 7’s hauls fellow funky elder statesman André 3000 out for a verse. The rest of the track listing barely finds time to catch its breath. The funky, sassy ESP, one of the relatively few guest-free zones, is begging to be a single. It is one of many tracks whose good-time sounds carry with them nods to recent times. The “mad ethnic” sample stitched into Lemon, cribbed from a Twitter video in which a New Jersey rapper called Retch films himself smoking a blunt and shouting out to Martin Luther King, surrounded by bemused white onlookers, recurs again on ESP. At the album’s first playback in California, Williams explained that the title of Don’t Don’t Do It! (which also features Kendrick Lamar) quotes the wife of North Carolina police shooting victim Keith Lamont Scott as she pleads with officers for his life, recording the incident on her phone. Musically, NERD are not short of things to say either. The only hitch is that sometimes, a surfeit of ideas all turns up on one song. Pairing Lamar with MIA is inspired, but their track – Kites – deserves to be a killer, rather than a kitchen sink overflowing with spare genres. Another fly in the ointment: it is unclear how much Chad Hugo (or, indeed, Shae Haley) was involved in No_One Ever Really Dies. It sounds – overwhelmingly – like Pharrell’s show. Ultimately, though, this is an album full of what another killer track – Secret Life of Tigers – calls “serotonin overload!” – a flow-state that not even a perky reggae track featuring Ed Sheeran (Lifting You) can dim."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/10/nigeria-biggest-market-balogun-lagos-lorenzo-vitturi-money-must-be-made","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T15:00:03Z","webTitle":"Chaotic capitalism: the human sculptures of Nigeria's sprawling Balogun market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/10/nigeria-biggest-market-balogun-lagos-lorenzo-vitturi-money-must-be-made","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/10/nigeria-biggest-market-balogun-lagos-lorenzo-vitturi-money-must-be-made","fields":{"headline":"Chaotic capitalism: the human sculptures of Nigeria's sprawling Balogun market","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"During a trip to Lagos in 2014, Lorenzo Vitturi visited Balogun market for the first time. “I knew it was one of the biggest street markets in Africa,” he says, “but nothing prepared me for how overwhelming it was. The crowds of people on the narrow streets, the products on display, the noise, the colour, the chaotic energy. I knew I had to take photographs there, amid the sensory overload of what is, in effect, a city within a city, with tens of thousands of people passing through it every day.” What most fascinated Vitturi was the contrast between the human drama of the vast, sprawling market and the eerie emptiness of the 27-storey brutalist office block that loomed over it. Built in 1987, Financial Trust House was once the thriving hub of Nigeria’s financial sector. But as the market grew inexorably around it, the bankers and traders moved elsewhere. “Save for the owner’s office, all 27 floors are empty,” says Vitturi. “The real estate value of the building has fallen dramatically, but he is still holding out for some kind of miraculous redevelopment.” Three years on, Vitturi has created a dramatic photobook that captures the curious dynamic of Balogun market: the cacophonous streets and the silent semi-derelict building. In 2014, in his acclaimed book Dalston Anatomy, Vitturi captured the edginess of Ridley Road market in London’s east end as it held out against gentrification. Money Must Be Made is a similarly imaginative evocation of a place that defies straight documentary. Instead, Vitturi has applied the same hybrid approach: ornate, posed studio portraits of locals are juxtaposed with striking laser-cut collages and sculptural installations made from the brightly coloured products on sale: plastic buckets, woven mats, chairs, hats, bowls, beads, umbrellas, footballs and fabrics of every hue. Here and there, we are given a glimpse of a bustling street, with garish products filling the frame and objects piled high in teetering pyramids, as people jostle for space in the cut-and-thrust of street-level Darwinian capitalism. Venice-born Vitturi, who now lives in London, is a graduate of Fabrica, the Benetton-funded visual research centre in Treviso. He worked as a set painter for Tinto Brass, the Italian director of such “erotic” films as Caligula, and at Rome’s legendary Cinecittà Studios. Vitturi describes his images as “posed but not overly staged”. In Lagos, unable to find space to shoot amid the swirl of the market, he isolated his subjects in a makeshift outdoor studio in the courtyard of the office block. Their often ornate styles of dress and the objects they carry become part of an elaborate human sculpture, a metaphor for the market itself. “These people have to survive by their creativity as well as their entrepreneurial skills,” says Vitturi. “Every day, the sellers construct these extraordinary sculptures, using a limited space to pile up their wares in the most precarious ways. There is so much creativity in such a compressed space. The results are often close to my own aesthetic. That was something I wanted to reflect in the book.” The only breathing space in the ongoing dazzle of colour comes in the middle section, in which Vitturi shifts his gaze – and his approach – to the ghostly interior of Financial Trust House. Suddenly we are in a world of monochrome greyness: rooms filled with the detritus of a once-thriving place; discarded corporate signs and computer parts covered, like everything inside the building, in a layer of Saharan sand. The vivid human drama outside seems a world away from the Ballardian atmosphere within, where an aura of postapocalyptic emptiness prevails. “It struck me early on that the place was almost the opposite of Ridley Road,” says Vitturi, “not just in scale, but in the sense that the street traders in Balogun are not just resisting gentrification, but had defeated it by expanding to meet the demands of their customers.” The subtext of Money Must Be Made is even more complex than that, though. Nearly all the goods now sold in Balogun are cheap imports from China. “Even the traditional Nigerian fabrics have been copied and are being sold back to the people who originally created them,” says Vitturi. “Virtually everything I picked up had a label that read, ‘Made in China.’ In Balogun, you are confronted with the unstoppable surge of global capitalism.” What made him choose such a brutally descriptive title? “Money Must Be Made was one of several quotes I selected from the interviews I did with traders. I hired a local calligrapher to paint the words on to a flag made of traditional Nigerian fabrics. It summed up the ethos of the market. Balogun is a place where nothing is wasted. The level of recycling is incredible. Everything has a value. One guy said to me, ‘If you shit here, I will find a way to make money out of it.’ That really summed up their resourcefulness, but it didn’t really work as a book title.” Money Must Be Made by Lorenzo Vitturi is available from Self Publish, Be Happy, £45"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/07/american-healthcare-america-medical-insurance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T17:50:38Z","webTitle":"My American awakening – suddenly I need healthcare.

(“System” in this context is a generous description.) Like many foreign passport holders, I was able to take out an international policy in my home country and avoid not only the unstable price hikes that plague US policyholders, but the shocking awfulness of most American insurance. Having premature twins in Manhattan can cost in the hundreds of thousands – and in my case did – and my UK insurer never passed on a bill. The only mystifying thing was how it made any money. Well. A few days ago a nervous-sounding agent rang me from Britain and, in what sounded like a script dictated by lawyers, said that he regretted to tell me the company, a huge European conglomerate, was getting out of the US market and my policy would not be renewed in January. There are fixed deadlines for buying annual coverage in the US and I had a week to find new healthcare. These are the options in the world’s richest country: qualify for Medicaid, the state healthcare provision for which the restrictions on income are tight and the availability of doctors tighter; work for a company that pays your insurance; or apply yourself to the free market and buy insurance from, for example, a provider part-owned by Jared Kushner’s brother that dwindling numbers of New York doctors accept and has a $14,000 (£10,000) excess on a family policy that costs more than $800 a month. (This isn’t an anomaly, it’s the industry standard.) That company, I note, is currently running an online ad campaign so ill-fitting it might be funny if it wasn’t obscene: “These days, almost everything is a click away. Want to become an ordained minister? Click. Want to meet the love of your life? Click. Want a dozen cupcakes at 3am? Click. Want to find a great doctor your insurance will actually cover?” I don’t know, move to Canada? Hoffman exposed “Shame on you!” yelled some guy in the audience at a Tribeca film festival event as John Oliver pursued Dustin Hoffman over allegations of groping. “Move on!” he shouted – not at Hoffman, at Oliver. Then a woman shouted something in defence of groped women and the audience clapped. The social awkwardness of the moment was somehow communicated even more strongly for being shot over people’s heads on a phone. Oliver was clearly uncomfortable, but ploughed on. Hoffman was livid, indignant, referring to “this woman” in the Clintonian style and dismissing the accusations as an “over-reaction”. It is a rare moment of pulling back the curtain not just on rotten celebrity, but on dim-witted PR events at which everyone on stage is supposed to behave. The tale of Farmer Christmas “Father Christmas comes to our apartment on Christmas Eve,” I said at the weekend after we’d put up the tree. “Sorry – not Father Christmas, Santa Claus.

Was I really going to slog through the construction of all this? “How does he get in?” asked my daughter, who has never been inside a house and understands chimneys to be a delivery system for big bad wolves or Dick Van Dyke. “The terrace,” I said. She looked alarmed. “But he’s a good guy,” I said. “When is he coming?” she asked the next day. “Who?” “The Christmas Farmer.” I don’t think I’m doing this right. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/07/nhs-england-accused-of-hiding-hospitals-winter-crisis-alert-figures","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T14:44:43Z","webTitle":"NHS England accused of hiding hospitals' winter crisis alert figures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/07/nhs-england-accused-of-hiding-hospitals-winter-crisis-alert-figures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/07/nhs-england-accused-of-hiding-hospitals-winter-crisis-alert-figures","fields":{"headline":"NHS England accused of hiding hospitals' winter crisis alert figures","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"NHS bosses have been accused of unacceptable secrecy after deciding no longer to reveal how many hospitals come under such pressure during winter that they have to declare an alert. NHS England will not publish this winter’s figures for the number of trusts forced to issue an alert under the operational pressures escalation levels (Opel) framework system. The disclosure last winter that dozens of NHS trusts in England had to issue black alerts – signalling they could not cope with a surge in demand for care – received widespread media coverage. Conditions in hospitals became so stretched last January that the British Red Cross called it a humanitarian crisis. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “It is entirely unacceptable that the true extent of the crisis may not be fully revealed because of a failure to publish details of which trusts have been forced to issue alerts. Ministers must be held accountable for their appalling failure to properly fund our NHS as it heads into another difficult winter.” The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, a health minister in the 2010-15 coalition government, said any cover-up by the government over NHS performance would be “a real scandal”. Lamb said: “There are serious questions as to why figures on trusts under pressure appears to have been dropped from the latest batch of data. It would be a real scandal if the government is trying to cover-up evidence that the NHS is under unsustainable pressure. We need to know immediately when these figures will be made available.” The Guardian has asked both NHS England and the Department of Health who was involved in the decision and to answer the accusation of burying bad news. England’s 153 NHS acute hospital trusts are still using the Opel system, which can lead to a hospital shutting its A&amp;E temporarily or sending ambulances elsewhere, or to it receiving extra help. The change in policy emerged on Thursday when NHS England issued the first set of weekly figures showing how hospitals are performing this winter. In an accompanying statement it defended the decision, saying it was publishing more data this year than in previous winters. “The NHS nationally has introduced a new system this year for identifying, and acting upon, heightened operational pressures over winter,” it said. “This is centred around the new national emergency pressures panel, chaired by Sir Bruce Keogh, and its decisions about raising, or reducing, their assessments of pressure will be made transparently and published.” The figures show that 10,184 people had to wait at least half an hour in the back of an ambulance last week because A&amp;E units were so busy. Under new NHS rules, hospitals are supposed to ensure such delays never happen. Between 27 November and 3 December, 8,340 people waited in an ambulance for 30-60 minutes and another 1,844 waited for more than an hour. Ashworth said the figures “reveal the dire impact Tory underfunding is already having on thousands of patients unable to promptly access A&amp;E departments right across the country. Some trusts are already completely full with no spare beds, an extremely worrying indicator for what is still to come.” NHS England and NHS Improvement wrote to all 240 NHS trusts in England on 7 November telling them to ensure no patient ended up being cared for in a corridor or having to wait 12 hours on a trolley to be admitted this winter. They also made clear that acute hospitals should prepare their A&amp;E units so that “patients do not wait more than 15 minutes in ambulances before being handed over to the hospital”. Trust bosses denounced the regulators’ approach as “barking mad” and unrealistic, given the intense pressures hospitals are under. The figures also show that hospitals in England were 94.5% full last week – far over the 85% limit that is regarded as the maximum in order to ensure safety. “It is very early days but it is clearly a concern that bed occupancy – with an average rate of 94.5% – is already running so high as we head into what into what is usually the busiest time of year”, said Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals. The Royal College of Nursing said the figures “make depressing reading for both patients and staff”. “Having so few free beds also means it’s far more difficult to admit patients to the right ward for their condition”, said Janet Davies, the union’s chief executive. The figures also show: A&amp;E units at five different NHS trusts were so busy they had to temporarily divert patients to a nearby hospital last week. Manchester University and Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS trusts did that three times each. An average of 790 beds, both occupied and unoccupied, were shut each day because of an outbreak of norovirus, the diarrhoea and vomiting bug. No A&amp;E unit had to close completely because it could not cope with a surge in demand from patients needing care.

The bill is due to come into force by May 2021 and is crucial at a time when the number of social homes in Wales has fallen by 45% due to housing being sold off under the right-to-buy scheme. Wales is leading the way on working to combat the housing crisis, using what tools it can. The Welsh assembly has more limited legislative powers than Holyrood or Stormont, but the devolved region has managed to implement a different homelessness strategy to England, and gives everyone the right to housing, wherever they come forward for help. So, if a homeless person approaches Cardiff council, the council is duty bound to help. There is no talk of local connection, which has become a crucial barrier to many people accessing homelessness services in other parts of the UK, or points-based needs assessments that have seen young single men pushed back onto the street. The Conservatives in Wales attempted to delay the bill, arguing for tenants to have two years to purchase their homes before the new rule comes in. That move was rejected, and many areas of Wales have implemented the ban. Under existing powers, Anglesey, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Swansea councils have banned right to buy. The blight of holiday homes lying empty and pushing up local prices has also been tackled by the Welsh government. In many regions, holiday homes and second homes left empty are now charged double the standard rate of council tax. This potentially puts off people whose finances might just stretch to another property, but also increases revenues for councils. And there’s more to be learned from Wales; housing associations there enshrine domestic violence policy in their working practices and, after an intervention in 2014 by the late Welsh housing minister Carl Sargeant, housing associations that don’t have a domestic violence policy will be denied crucial funding. In practice, this means housing professionals have a duty to ask, sensitively and following agreed guidelines, if they believe there is a possibility of domestic abuse. That duty falls to all frontline staff, including a repairs team member who might notice a pattern of damage in a property, an antisocial behaviour officer or a finance team member for whom a pattern of arrears might raise alarm bells. That Wales has soldiered on with legislation and policies that could genuinely improve the rights of Welsh tenants and protect the limited social housing stock in the region is commendable, given the pressures on its finances thanks to Westminster, and the lack of political leadership from London. Scotland, too, has taken action to halt its housing crisis. In his budget, Philip Hammond made the right noises about the plight of young people stuck with high renting costs, but offered nothing radical or helpful to address their problems. And what about those in need of social housing, or homeless and in need of any form of housing? England appears too scared to act on housing for fear voters will bolt like terrified horses at the first sign of sinking profits and assets if house prices decline. If the political situation continues in this manner, the housing crisis will be an exclusively English problem, and the blame will lie squarely at the Conservatives’ door.

She started the year having wild sex in a House Of Commons broom cupboard in BBC One’s hit psychological thriller Apple Tree Yard. She finishes it in a much more wholesome role as much-loved matriarch Margaret “Marmee” March in a three-part Christmas TV adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women. In between all the steamy scenes and bonnet-wearing, Watson also turned 50. The Shakespearean stage actress came relatively late to the screen, making her film debut aged 29 in Lars von Trier’s 1996 drama Breaking the Waves (when Helena Bonham Carter pulled out at the last minute). She won an Oscar nomination for that film and was nominated again two years later for her role as cellist Jacqueline du Pré in Hilary and Jackie. She won a Bafta for playing a social worker in ITV’s Fred West drama Appropriate Adult and has an OBE for services to drama. Once describing herself as “a character actor who gets laid”, when we talk she’s articulate, contemplative and full of mischievous wit while discussing everything from parenting to petticoats, Oscar Wilde to Arsène Wenger. Were you a fan of Little Women when you were young? I absolutely loved it. Certain events from the novel are seared into my childhood memory. I’m sure that’s the same for many readers. When Amy burns Jo’s book then falls through the ice – all those terrible, traumatic, shocking scenes. It was fascinating to reread as an adult. And then that awful, heart-rending sense of grief over Beth. Heidi Thomas [Call the Midwife creator and writer of the new adaptation] hasn’t shied away from that at all. What did you make of Marmee second time around? I was wonderfully taken with her, actually. She’s such an inspirational parent, whereas I just despair of myself [Watson is mother to Juliet, 12, and Dylan, nine]. The March family lead a considered life, very mindful of what it means to be good human beings. The first thing we see them do is give away their Christmas meal to refugees, which would still be a striking thing to do today. It wouldn’t go down well in my house [laughs]. She teaches her girls to be thoughtful citizens of the world. How else is she inspirational? She also has another great parenting skill to which I aspire: the ability to step back, let her children make mistakes and wait for them to come to her. In our age of helicopter parenting, where everything gets micro-managed, that’s a joy to read, even though I won’t ever reach her lofty heights. Marmee’s quite a saintly character. Was it tricky to bring her to life? What I love about her is when she talks to Jo about her terrible temper. Marmee tells her, “I used to have a temper just like yours but I’ve learned to control it. I’m still angry every day of my life but I’ve learned not to show it.” That’s the key to her character. She’s done work on herself, she’s mindful of how she comes across to her children. Is that something you can relate to? Are you angry every day? Yeah. I can get very short-tempered, I’m afraid. Did you feel maternal towards the four rising stars who play the March sisters? Very much. They were four very interesting young actresses with intelligent minds. Often in this industry, you come across young people who are very commercial-minded. Ambitious and all about climbing the greasy pole. This felt different. We had an intense rehearsal period where we shared lots about ourselves and it was a strong bonding experience. How were the senior cast members, Michael Gambon and Angela Lansbury? It was like having royalty on set. I didn’t get any scenes with Michael, sadly, but we hung out a bit, which was a thrill and such a privilege. Angela is 92 but sharp as a whip. Nothing gets past her. An amazing, inspirational woman. What was it like wearing 1840s outfits? Oh my God, so heavy. Too many petticoats. We were trying to convey the impression of an active life – fending for yourself, chopping wood, cooking – and it was exhausting. Turning mattresses when you’re wearing 30lb of petticoats is no fun. Thank goodness for progress. Would you say it’s a feminist story? Of its time, yes. It puts young women front and centre. The March sisters are raised to work and take their place in the world. It’s a very different sentiment to, say, Jane Austen, where young women are out to catch a husband for money. These girls want to marry for love and work to live. It’s shot in a Sofia Coppola-esque naturalistic style… It doesn’t look like a BBC chocolate box version, which is pleasing. Ness [director Vanessa Caswill] has a unique eye. She’s very connected to the young female body, that feeling of the blood running through young women’s veins. There’s an earthy, innocent freshness to it. And it was shot in County Wicklow, which was certainly handier than Massachusetts. Were you surprised by how talked about Apple Tree Yard became this year? I was delighted, because I’d hoped it would strike a chord. I hadn’t had a chance in a while to take out my inner lion and gallop for a good stretch like that. The BBC marketed it cleverly and told us we weren’t allowed to talk about anything beyond episode one. It annoyed me at the time but was a smart move. Viewers thought they were sitting down to watch a steamy, middle-aged romance, but it turned into something more provocative and unsettling. You were already good friends with your co-star, Ben Chaplin. Did that make the sex scenes easier? It meant we weren’t embarrassed, so could talk it through and scientifically plot the scenes to make them seem real. It’s quite a strange thing to do, but we all have to make a living. How do you reflect on the rape scene? It wasn’t graphic but very emotionally realistic, which made it difficult to watch. There wasn’t a single bit of lace or bra strap, but it was all about the psychological peril of rape. People felt affected by that. We took the fallout seriously. Was it a rare treat to play not just a female scientist but a sexually active mature woman? In film, those roles don’t really exist for women my age, but in television that’s definitely changing. The way we consume TV is evolving rapidly. It’s like going to the bookshop now, where you choose the thing you want to read. Half that audience is female and they’re going to make powerful choices. So many issues are emerging about how women are affected by the power balance in this industry. More female-driven stories will eventually lead to equal pay, respect, all sorts of changes. That’s driven by audiences, by people’s perceptions of the industry and by brave individuals who are making changes. Will recent revelations be a turning point? I really hope so. There’s an awful lot happening at the moment that needs to be dealt with calmly, carefully and patiently – but it could lead to fundamental change and be very positive. Have you ever experienced sexual harassment at work? No, I’ve been very lucky. I entered the industry at quite an unusual level. My first film was Breaking the Waves, aged 29, so I went into the film business with a bit of clout. People didn’t mess with me. I wasn’t ever as vulnerable as a novice teenage actress might be – or maybe I just have that vibe. Fierce, I think it’s called. Although you shouldn’t have to be fierce to be safe in your workplace. Lars von Trier directed Breaking the Waves. Did Björk’s recent allegations against him surprise you? Yes. The man is obviously eccentric and his work is quite extreme, but I was never treated with anything other than respect. I can’t speak for others, though. It’s incredibly brave of people to come forward. But there’s a massive range of allegations, from the clearly criminal to much milder. We can’t put everyone in the same bracket. People still have a right to presumption of innocence and due process. It’s become a rolling media storm but it would be disrespectful to the women who have been brave enough to come forward if it wasn’t treated with the seriousness it deserves. You turned 50 this year. Did you celebrate? Yes. It felt great, as if a lot of perplexing issues about being younger were ticked off. I was, like, so where’s the party? You’re an Arsenal fan. Do you go to many games? No, I’m an armchair supporter. But I’m definitely Wenger in. Loyalty and longevity. The man’s got an enormous amount of dignity, unlike most people in his profession. Do you ever get mistaken for Emma Watson? Only once. A load of old ladies in Mexico wanted my autograph and said I was wonderful in Harry Potter. I can only assume they hadn’t actually seen it. Next up, you’re in The Happy Prince – the Oscar Wilde biopic written, directed by and starring Rupert Everett. That must have been fun… Brilliant. Rupert is so immersed in that character. He played Wilde on stage for a long time, so lives and breathes it. I play his wife, Constance, which was lovely. We’re old friends and had such a laugh. What else is coming up? On Chesil Beach, but blink and you’ll miss me. Saoirse Ronan plays the lead and I love her. She’s an amazing young actress and carries the film beautifully. I’ve just finished King Lear with Anthony Hopkins and directed by Richard Eyre. That’ll do for the moment, I think. Are you home for a family Christmas? Yes, thankfully. I’ve done a long tour of duty but I’m finally home, ironing school uniforms and just being mum. Me and my husband [playwright Jack Waters] will tag-team on the cooking, then we’ll all sit down to watch Little Women. It’s one of the very few things I’ve done that my kids can watch [laughs]. My daughter’s reading the book at the moment. She’s got all the trauma to come!

In trying to evade any enquiries about my own plans or family, my tactic is often to ask after the smallest details of whichever acquaintance or stranger, the travel schedules and mulled wine recipes, exhaust them until their glasses are empty and they have to wend their way back to the bar. This isn’t the only way I’ve become an expert on the Yuletide traditions of others, but it’s good practice for the culminating event of Christmas, a holiday for which my only reliable tradition is a total lack of any. That I’ve sat at so many different tables on this day when what most people want is a sense of sameness, of time having temporarily fallen off, has become a kind of pride. Empanadas in Los Angeles or strudel on the snowy Canadian border, the thing that persists for me about the holiday is not a certain taste or smell but the richness of many, meals I’ve eaten not in loyalty to one part of my life but to the continuum of it, a measure every winter of how and with whom I hoped to be. My parents had both died by the time I was 24, but they were not people drawn to the predictable and domestic, and in losing them I did not lose some holiday ritual I’ll always wish to take back. Journalists, divorced almost as quickly as they were married, acolytes of California counter-culture whose youth seemed it would never expire, they tended to treat each holiday as though it were a surprise to be reckoned with creatively. One year my father and I drove through the fog Hitchcock loved to Bodega Bay, where we opened presents in our laps while looking through the windshield, he discussing, plaintively and respectfully, the power of the ocean and the several times he had almost died inside it. The sailing incident off the coast of Tahiti, the ribbons and crumpled tissue around my scuffed-up sneakers, the circling shark during his years on Kauai, the gifts of novels and ceramics beyond my years and tastes between my knees. He drove us then to the only restaurant that was open, where the chowder arrived in bowls of dense, springy sourdough, maybe the only meal in which the eater is encouraged to truly clean her plate. It’s the first thing I want when I return to the place I grew up, where I rent weekend homes like a tourist, and it’s a dish I still eat like a kid, incapable of waiting for it to cool, swallowing the chunks of creamy celery whole. Any time I order it somewhere else, I end up asking about the recipe, wondering what’s missing, but of course what’s gone is my father, how much he loved the doom of the misty ocean, the strange nicknames he had for me, Jar of Honey, Peaches, I’ll never hear again. As for my mother, a lapsed Catholic turned Wiccan then Buddhist, she must have worried her lack of enthusiasm would be apparent, and we often spent Christmas with more decisive friends of hers, some of whom we also lived with. I probably still miss Tibor, who had fled Hungary for political reasons in the mid-80s, leaving behind a wife and child I learned quickly not to ask about, and worked a job he hated overseeing meals for airlines. His Christmas gift to himself was to stay in his pallid, rainbow-striped robe while he cooked goulash. As far as I could tell, the vital directive in the preparation of goulash was to step outside and smoke as often as possible, then to return to the simmering pot, tongue numbed, take a taste and mutter, like a military command, “Needs–more–paprikash.” My mother and his wife Doris off somewhere gossiping, we ate in front of the television, watching, I’m shocked to admit, Taxi Driver. It’s probably true no 10-year-old should watch this film, and also that I might be the only person on the planet for whom Scorsese’s Travis Bickle elicits such blithe and sentimental feeling. My mouth full with the adult taste of thyme and garlic, the chunks of potatoes steaming like the streets of 1970s New York, I watched Tibor watching, how he could cackle at misery. Maybe he gave me that along with his insistence on tasting as you went, wooden spoon aloft, and certain bleak dictums on romance he spouted to anyone without prompt. All love ends. Sooner or later, one of you dies. True, or not true? Christmas cards these were not, but there was something Santa-like about Tibor, how busily he fussed over what he plated even once people were eating it, interrupting them to offer more salt, an affectation of audibly popping his lips when something delighted him. On the Christmases when my mother was in charge, we always bought our tree last minute and left it up till March. While I read by its glow, she prepared the meals which we ate all year, tostadas whose colour composition I loved, the yellow of the tortilla giving way to the earthy brown of the beans, the green of the dewy lettuce to the red of the local quartered tomatoes. My mother had a habit of going without cooking utensils, spinning the hardening discs in the popping oil with her spindly fingers, popping them out with her hands and gasping at the heat. In so many waysI wonder why she went without the things that would have made her life safer, but also it seems lucky I ever got to eat something she handled so intimately. Though as a rules-obsessed child I burned with embarrassment at how late the tree was visible through our window, I can appreciate now how my mother emphasised what she enjoyed about a holiday she hated. “I don’t love Christmas,” I heard her say more than once, smoking in one of the drapey shawls that were her signature, watering the plants on the patio one-handed with a vaguely cowboy swagger, “but I do love Christmas lights.” Even if she was irreverent about it, I hate to remember how the last Christmas my mother was alive was the first I didn’t fly home to see her. I was newly in love and eager to accept an invitation to what was surely the most traditional Christmas I’d ever have, at my boyfriend’s mother’s in snowy, gloomy Buffalo. An Austrian oncology researcher, she was the most precise and inscrutable individual I’ve ever met, the kind of person who weathers misfortune with only a pause and a sniff, who can prepare a five-course meal without leaving a single crumb or spill in the kitchen. We would fly up from Brooklyn to spend the week before Christmas in the winding, dustless house where she’d raised him, days during which relaxation and holiday cheer were as structured as anything else in her life. For a month ahead of time she baked, 10 varieties of holiday cookies she’d perfected some 30 years before, molasses chews, exactly half-dipped lady fingers. The unused bedrooms of the third floor she kept unheated, and in the one furthest from the stairs the near-freezing temperature made the ideal place for cookie storage, so much so that it was referred to as “The Cookie Room”. Noticing that there was a disparity in the selection she kept on the coffee table in the living room, where we always read by the fire in the hours before dinner, she would send me up to fetch the missing cookie that would make the display evenly varied again. In that room where nobody slept or dreamed, a 60s convex mirror hung over a teak credenza, I pried the tins open, gorging in secret on my favourite, perfect crescents of ginger topped with sinewy squares of chewy ginger candy, catching a look at myself and wondering whether this would be my life. The winter after we split up, after years where we’d lived together like family, was one whose cold I felt coming a long way off. By October I was hyperventilating on subway platforms, unbuttoning and rebuttoning my jacket many times in the movies I went to alone, calling my friends too often with the nervous frequency of an empty nester, never saying what was really on my mind, which was that I did not know where I would be spending Christmas. In America, Thanksgiving always works like some sort of a rubric for how you’ll feel about 25 December, the training event for the emotional marathon, and there was nowhere I wanted to be but at the apartment of a friend who, in the close-knit circle of gay men where I am a rare female exception, we sometimes call Decadent Dan. His culinary and domestic skills are the sort that would send Martha Stewart into an envious rage and then right back to prison. The saviour of our excessive 20s and 30s, he is the person who sends a text at 10am, on a day our hangovers feel about as temporary as amputations, that says: come over for stew at 6.30. Dan’s kitchen table seats a tight six, so for larger meals we eat splayed around a marbled linoleum tabletop balanced on temporary wooden trestles, a semi-perilous arrangement for violent gesturers such as myself. During that perfect Thanksgiving last year, something hilarious someone said sent my hand down to clutch the edge of the table, and for half a second Dan’s mashed potatoes, velvety and gold-lit like impressionist clouds, the full glasses of barolo, hovered an inch above the surface. When nothing spilled or broke we clapped, lucky not for the first time that evening. I came home and took a photo of myself in my red long underwear, wanting proof of how flushed I’d become in being fed by my family. The impending matter of Christmas finally split me open and I had to say it, on a call to a college friend across the country: I did not know where I would be spending it. With me, Lisette said, almost angry and bored with the question. In college she had been the person always ready with a mnemonic, with a clever storage solution, and Christmas Eve, at the apartment she shares with her fiancée Mike, was no different in terms of her fussy preparation. She bought hideous fleece socks in red and white polka dots, and if either of us were caught not wearing them she pointed at the transgressions of our feet with a brow knit in the comic exaggeration of a silent actor. For the group of five that came, Michael, who has the peculiar habit of taking physical notes on every conversation he has, made apple sausages and German pancakes. Because the latter had to be prepared individually, eggs and sugar and vanilla baking in half-size cast iron over 30 minutes, each guest was served separately, a birthday in miniature for which we were all envious and giddy. Christmas morning the three of us drove to Mike’s parents in a hilly and affluent neighbourhood by the ocean, the kind of house that always felt closed to me during a childhood without money, a place where every tawny painting, every woven bowl, came with a considered story of pride and acquisition. We ate tamales from husky orange dutch ovens, spicy pork and marinated chicken, with red salsa and green, with coffee someone was always refilling, saying freshen up your cup, freshen up your cup? Mike’s parents, who handled a stranger in their home on holiday with the enthusiastic grace of diplomats, asked me questions about my life, beginning with the recent and moving their way back, and I returned them like a journalist, posing earnest questions of my own. When we said goodbye in the early afternoon it was in the way of people who, having been a long time on a trip together, know the act of being alone again will take some readjusting – it seemed strange not to ask or answer, for the 30th time, are you warm enough? Close the window? Freshen up your cup? This will be my seventh winter in New York City, but it’s the first Christmas I’ve spent here, so hellbent was I on hunting down the family, the place where it might be easier not to think of the outrageous stories my mother might have told, of the farcical journal she kept as a Catholic child, which she called The Diaries of Saint Carolyn of Sacramento, and which she staged readings of for her brothers as they floated in the backyard pool, plastic swords at the ready. On Christmas Eve I have some plans, quiet, solid, to visit Valeria and Álvaro, who have just bought a house in the Bronx where they will raise their beautiful daughter Maia, a curious and moody girl whose tight curls of hair are always flying a half-second ahead of her. Then I’ll take the train back to Brooklyn to cook dinner with a girlfriend, a meal we’re planning together. I’m looking forward to kissing these people, to spoiling them with gifts, but the funny thing is that when I think of the day what I picture is the subway and the streets, all the people crippled with Tupperware and giftbags, how thrilled I will be to become one of them, making my way to the highest point in the city alone.

Power from small modular reactors (SMRs) would cost nearly one-third more than conventional large ones in 2031, the report found, because of reduced economies of scale and the costs of deploying first-of-a-kind technology. The analysis by the consultancy Atkins for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said there was “a great deal of uncertainty with regards to the economics” of the smaller reactors. However, the authors said such reactors should be able to cut costs more quickly than large ones because they could be built and put into service in less time. Advocates have argued that the reactors could be built in factories and achieve savings through their modular nature. While the report covers the technology being used by several of the international companies seeking government support, it does not apply to the design being pushed by businesses including Rolls-Royce. A government source said nuclear companies had told officials that the cost of the technology had come down since the report, which was finished in July last year but only published on Thursday. As revealed by the Guardian earlier this week, ministers confirmed that SMR developers would receive £56m of public funding for research and development over three years. A further £86m was announced for work on nuclear fusion. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said the backing would help the nuclear sector compete globally. Chris Lewis, infrastructure lead at the big four consultancy EY, said the government research showed there was a case for SMRs. “While the study recognises that the economics to build SMRs are challenging, measures can be taken to achieve greater cost reduction through the standardisation of technology, greater modularisation, and the ability to standardise design and repeat manufacturing,” he said. The government also defended Britain’s need for new nuclear power in the face of falling renewable costs. Richard Harrington, the energy minister, said the record low subsidies recently awarded to offshore windfarms emphasised the challenge for the French, Korean, Chinese and Japanese companies building the UK’s new generation of nuclear plants to be competitive on price. The minister argued that the lower cost of wind did not spell the end for new nuclear. “We are trying to avoid … this simplistic view – well, as some people say, oh well, with the way the price of offshore wind has gone down that means bye bye nuclear and bye bye everything else,” he told an industry conference in London. “We know this is not the case. That’s a very naive and very simplistic way of doing it.” Lord Hutton, the chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association, criticised “simplistic” comparisons of the guaranteed prices awarded to nuclear plants and windfarms. He also described wind and solar as “intermittent and unpredictable”. However, green groups and politicians accused the government of talking down renewables. Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “Instead of downplaying the rapid advancement of UK renewables, the government should concentrate on the export opportunities for this UK success story.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-leader, called the UK’s energy policy a mess. “Ministers are ploughing huge sums of money into supporting overpriced nuclear, while retaining a de facto ban on onshore wind and failing to give solar the support the sector needs,” she said. Ministers also announced that they would be looking in the new year at plans for a long-term underground nuclear waste dump. The government has been searching for several years to find a community willing to play host to a so-called geological disposal facility, but without success."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/15/killing-gavle-a-swedish-city-divided-by-a-giant-straw-christmas-goat","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T12:52:01Z","webTitle":"Killing Gävle – a Swedish city divided by a giant straw Christmas goat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/15/killing-gavle-a-swedish-city-divided-by-a-giant-straw-christmas-goat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/15/killing-gavle-a-swedish-city-divided-by-a-giant-straw-christmas-goat","fields":{"headline":"Killing Gävle – a Swedish city divided by a giant straw Christmas goat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Welcome to the small northern Swedish city of Gävle where there’s an annual battle over a 12-metre-high straw effigy of a goat. Local custodians try to protect a giant straw goat from mischievous pagans in a fight for the spirit of Christmas. Every year since 1966, in the dark days of winter, the business owners pay for a goat to be built in the central square on the first day of advent. For 37 of those 51 years, the goat has been burnt down or damaged by shadowy outsiders, sometimes within a few hours of going up. In the latest Guardian documentary, Killing Gävle, residents and those who might want to burn the goat explain their hopes and motivations as Christmas approaches and the battle over the goat is fired up once more. The goat, which pulls Santa’s sleigh, has come to symbolise Christmas in Sweden, drawing people in from the surrounding country. Families bring their children to look in wonder and, the businesses hope, do a bit of shopping while they are there. But there are other people in the dark forests that surround the city who hold an entirely different view of the goat. They believe in a time before Christianity appeared in Sweden, when people worshipped Norse gods including the goat goddess Heidrun (goddess of enlightenment) and the god of thunder, Thor, who rode around on two goats. Each night he would burn and then eat them, only to wake up the following morning to them having been reborn and able to pull his chariot again. The local pagans believe that the Christians of Gävle unknowingly build this giant statue to their god and that every year they must try to burn it down before the end of the year, thus ensuring a return of the sun and another good year of harvests. Every year, an epic fight is waged between these two opposed beliefs; an elemental battle between light and darkness, good and evil. The people of the city corral around the goat, protecting its symbolism of innocence and community as every year others make their way into the town to try to burn the goat down.

Coming up: Conectifai Wifi comes to Havana, and a whole new way of interacting in public emerges. Cuba’s state communications company installed internet points in public parks and despite the signal being weak, the world was opened up a bit more for a population that has always been innovative in using new technology. The priority is chatting – connecting with family members in other countries, flirting and showing off. We meet a selection of characters of all generations grappling with how to use their smartphones and wifi in a country where connecting with other people tends to be complicated. Released 19 January Our documentary recommendations At the cinema and on demand: as part of the brilliant London short film festival, we recommend the Radio Atlas programme of short audio documentaries. Radio Atlas is an award-winning platform for subtitled audio from around the world. A place to hear inventive documentaries and sound art works that have been made in languages you don’t necessarily speak. This intimate event premieres documentaries that explore the thin line between freedom and risk, taking the listener to unexpected places. Experiencing a Radio Atlas programme in the cinema is an amazing experience – you wouldn’t believe how quickly you get used to subtitled visual audio thanks to the immaculately timed text – but if you can’t make it to the event, subscribe to their podcast for a great back catalogue. On demand – short docs: the shortlist for the Oscar for short documentaries was announced this week, and Bertha Dochouse have helpfully supplied a list of viewing platforms where you can see most of them, or at least a trailer for them. If it whets your appetite for more short documentary chat then watch this interview about the form with Charlie Lyne (who made Fish Story) and Luke Moody from Sheffield Doc/Fest From the Guardian: with the news of Donald Trump’s plans to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, you might like to rewatch one of our old documentaries, Forever Pure. A story of Beitar Jerusalem’s fans, proud to call themselves ‘the most racist team in the country’, it vividly demonstrates the tensions of this holy city. Latest documentary news End of year ‘best of’ film lists are appearing and documentaries are well-represented. The Guardian’s own top 50 includes Strong Island, The Work and I Am Not Your Negro – all films we highly recommend. Peter Bradshaw’s own awards, The Braddies, has its own best documentary category which also includes I Am Not Your Negro. Debate might rage over his other choices, but that’s part of the fun. Meanwhile, Sight and Sound’s top 25 lists three documentaries, including Agnès Varda’s wonderful Faces Places. As the Oscar short doc list came out, Indiewire made some predictions about who might win. Also check out their predictions for the documentary feature winner – we think it might be City of Ghosts, although the timeliness of Icarus, which pre-empted the banning of the Russian team from the Winter Olympics, might mean it has a strong shout. Outside of awards, and thinking about the future not the past, Michael Moore is battling the Weinsteins over rights to his new documentary, and Sundance film festival announced their feature documentary and short documentary programmes. We’re particularly excited about Bisbee ‘17, the new film by Robert Greene. Support the Guardian If you like what we do with documentaries at the Guardian, then please consider becoming a supporter.

Making his first visit to Tehran as foreign secretary, Johnson will also seek to put UK-Iranian relations on a new footing, pointing to Britain’s strong defence of the Iranian nuclear deal signed in 2015. Johnson has played down expectations of an immediate breakthrough in the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Progress may depend on his conversations in two days of talks with senior Iranian figures including the foreign minister, Javad Zarif. The UK will be presenting ideas about how British banks, with the help of the Bank of England, can operate across Iran with less fear of being subject to mainly US-imposed sanctions and fines. Iran believes the nuclear deal has not led to the flourishing of trade or the interconnection with the western banking system it had been promised. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, said to be close to a mental breakdown, had been due to make a fresh appearance in court on Sunday facing new charges relating to espionage that could result in her five-year sentence extended by as much as 10 years. It is not clear if the hearing will still go ahead while the foreign secretary is still in Tehranand there have been suggestions it may be delayed. In a sign that an immediate breakthrough is not imminent, Johnson said on Thursday her case was extremely difficult. Iran does not recognise dual national status so the UK has a problem at the outset lobbying on her behalf. Hopes for her early release grew last week when it was revealed that an Iranian government health commissioner was to make checks on her health. It has been claimed she has been suffering panic attacks, insomnia, bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts. She was arrested at Tehran airport two years ago with her daughter who has stayed in the Iranian capital with her grandmother. Johnson has insisted the second set of charges laid against her are not related to his errorlast month in telling the foreign affairs select committee that she had been in Iran to train journalists. The possible coincidence of his visit and her reappearance in court had not been planned since details of his visit were agreed between the two sides before the date of her new court appearance had been set. The additional evidence is supposed to include a BBC pay stub and an email dating from 2010 saying that she had trained journalists in Iran. After some delay, Johnson met Richard, the husband of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, and apologised if his remarks in parliament could have been construed by the Iranian judiciary as a sign that she had been in Tehran on anything other than her holiday. Johnson said he had meant to say the worst offence of which she had been accused by the Iranian government was training journalists, not that he personally knew she had been offering this training. The separation between the Iranian diplomatic service and the more politicised state courts makes the task of influencing the regime’s thinking more complex. Although Johnson said on Thursday that what Iran was doing in the region was entirely separate to consular cases, the possibility of her release is inevitably interwoven with broader British-Iranian relations. Johnson has been a strong defender of the Iranian nuclear deal signed in 2015, personally travelling to Washington to urge US Republican congressmen not to follow Donald Trump’s lead and abandon the deal. No independent body has found any breach by Iranand the UK insists the deal is ringfenced from any wider criticism of Iran’s ballistic missile programme or its wider behaviour in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. At a press conference on Thursday, Johnson said he would be raising with the Iranians “the supply of rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon and helping the Houthis to launch missiles against Riyadh. This is causing fear. This is causing terror in parts of the Middle East. This is disruptive and dangerous behaviour. That is the message I will be taking”. Iran will want to hear British ideas to ease banking restrictions imposed largely due to US sanctions. Most UK banks fear they will face swingeing fines by US federal authorities if it emerges they funded a commercial deal between firms and an Iranian entity banned under US sanctions, such as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. Ownership laws in Tehran are opaque, and determining whether an IRGC firm has only a minority stake in a company is hard. There has been discussion of whether the Bank of England could indemnify some deals, but the risk to the UK taxpayer, and the level of commitment to the Bank may prove too large. The impasse has even left the Iranian embassy in the UK unable to set up a bank account in this country and the five major Iranian banks in the UK struggle to operate. Iran’s outstanding other claim is for £400m in compensation for the non-delivery of Chieftain tanks ordered by Tehran in the 1970s. The level of the compensation is largely settled, following a lengthy court case that the Iranians essentially won. The UK had made a payment into court, but unresolved issues over the method of payment, possibly using the Bank of England, and the lawfulness of payments to the Iranian ministry of defence remain obstacles. It is also possible the Iranians are seeking interest on the money that should have been paid to them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/dec/07/how-to-collect-a-nobel-prize-for-literature","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T18:26:13Z","webTitle":"How to collect a Nobel prize for literature","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/dec/07/how-to-collect-a-nobel-prize-for-literature","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/dec/07/how-to-collect-a-nobel-prize-for-literature","fields":{"headline":"How to collect a Nobel prize for literature","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“All writers belong to the class of non-orators,” Thomas Mann warned his audience at the outset, accepting the Nobel prize for literature in 1929 in a self-described state of “festive intoxication”. In a paradox the 2017 laureate, Kazuo Ishiguro must be keenly aware of as he undergoes this week’s induction process, the Nobel honours authors for their books but asks them to appear in person (though some, such as Bob Dylan last year, refuse) and morph into celebrity performers expert in the very different art of rhetoric. The contrast was starkly exemplified 20 years after Mann by William Faulkner, whose brief speech (calling for writers to return to the anguish of “the old verities ... of the heart”) was little understood even by anglophone listeners when delivered – he had a heavy southern accent and zero microphone technique – but once it appeared as a text was hailed as an inspirational classic. It’s a formidable challenge, and one winners have to undergo twice (usually, as with Ishiguro, delivering a lecture and a “banquet speech” three days later). But most attempts include at least three of the following elements: profuse thanks to the Swedish Academy; equally lavish expressions of humility and unworthiness (but don’t overdo this passive-aggressively, like Luigi Pirandello); confessing a personal debt to Scandinavian literature (WB Yeats’s entire speech, for example, consisted of tributes to Swedenborg and Ibsen); a potent childhood memory and a recent anecdote showing how grounded in mundane reality you are. (William Golding talked of being given a parking ticket and congratulations by the same policeman on the day of the prize announcement). Evocations of the heroic torment of a writer’s life, exemplified by Faulkner and Hemingway’s speeches, are out of fashion, as is lofty prophesying about the future of humanity and literature’s role in shaping it that mid-20th century laureates (such as Albert Camus) went in for. But taking up the cudgels on behalf of your own stigmatised ethnic group, or nation, or region (Gabriel García Márquez urged his audience not to view Latin America through a European lens) is still fine, though the fact that so many non-white and/or developing world winners chose that option in the 1980s and 90s might explain why there have been fewer such laureates of late. What about tone? Political anger has been voiced (eg by John Steinbeck) but comes across as incongruous if winners actually turn up in white tie and collect their enormous cheque from a Swedish royal (Harold Pinter denounced George W Bush and Tony Blair as war criminals, but did so on video due to ill health). More successful is being intelligently insolent about Sweden, the prize itself, or the dynamite magnate behind it, if discernible behind the cheek is a larger point. “First you give the prize to a black man, then a Jewish writer, and now a clown – what gives?” asked Dario Fo; while Wole Soyinka mocked Alfred Nobel in one speech and the “racist condescension” of the prize his legacy funds in another. Several recent laureates have told stories, cannily aligning their speeches with their fiction: an allegory about a blind woman (Toni Morrison); a Crusoe fable (JM Coetzee); a naughty tale of a lab rat awarded a Nobel (Günter Grass). To be avoided is succumbing, as many do, to grandiloquence, led on by the purple prose of the Academy’s citations; and Elfriede Jelinek took the speech-as-literature ploy to its limit with her submission of a video recording of an esoteric monologue about an evasive writer, her readers and her language, in which she resembled a Samuel Beckett heroine after taking a critical theory module. Never inclined to be predictable, Ishiguro in the first of his speeches on Thursday deviated markedly from the standard template: no thanks, no feigned bafflement at being chosen, and no profession of love for Swedish culture (though those might all come later in his banquet speech). Instead he majored on the anecdotes showing him as embedded in non-esoteric experience and resonant memories; a series of such scenes traced his life from childhood in a Japanese family in Surrey, via young adulthood and marriage, to decisive moments (ranging from going to Auschwitz to a Howard Hawks movie) and cultural touchstones – music and cinema as well as books – that have shaped his writing life. His lecture also ended unexpectedly, with a more tentative, less rhetorical version of the kind of perorations on writing’s importance that western laureates went in for either side of the second world war and non-white or non-western ones delivered in the 80s and 90s. Ishiguro suggested that literature would best play a role in the future by “becoming more diverse” in both the voices included in it, and in openness to “today unknown literary cultures” and “new, sometimes bewildering ways of telling stories”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/07/martin-schulz-united-states-of-europe-germany-sdp","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T18:29:53Z","webTitle":"Martin Schulz wants 'United States of Europe' within eight years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/martin-schulz-united-states-of-europe-germany-sdp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/07/martin-schulz-united-states-of-europe-germany-sdp","fields":{"headline":"Martin Schulz wants 'United States of Europe' within eight years","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The leader of Germany’s Social Democratic party has sketched out red lines for talks to form another coalition government with Angela Merkel. In a speech at the SPD’s party conference in Berlin that called for the creation of a “United States of Europe” by 2025, as well as a more robust social security net and a phasing out of coal power, Martin Schulz made the case for entering open-ended talks with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). “We don’t want to govern at any price,” Schulz said. “But we also shouldn’t refuse to govern at any price.” SPD delegates later voted overwhelmingly to allow their party’s leadership to enter talks with the CDU. The vote means leaders can discuss options including a renewed “grand coalition”, an informal cooperation or a formal agreement to tolerate a conservative minority government by not voting down certain parliamentary motions. Attempts to build Germany’s next government have been at a standstill since last month’s collapse of coalition talks between the CDU, the Free Democrats and the Greens. Other European states have expressed their growing impatience with Germany’s political paralysis. Leaders including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, have called on Schulz to break the deadlock. The SPD leader acknowledged those appeals on Thursday when he warned that “the continent cannot afford four more years of German European policy a la Schäuble”, referring to the austerity measures of the country’s conservative former finance minister. Schulz told delegates that he wanted EU member states to sign off on a “constitutional treaty” that committed the bloc to take steps towards a federal Europe – a proposal likely to be met with some resistance from Merkel and other EU leaders. “Such a constitutional treaty has to be written by a convention that includes civil society and the people. This constitutional treaty will then have to be put to the member states and those that don’t approve it will automatically have to leave the EU,” Schulz said. The SPD leader called for stronger social security for workers in the digital services economy, increased investment in academic and vocational education, and binding green energy targets. Phasing out coal energy was inevitable, Schulz said, and the next government should focus on creating new opportunities for those currently employed in the sector. “Let’s first see which policies we can push through and then decide about the precise form in which we do it,” he said. Despite the vote by SPD delegates to allow talks with the CDU to start, Thursday’s party conference also laid bare the centre left’s deep-seated reservations about teaming up with Merkel as a junior coalition partner for a third time in 12 years. Schulz apologised for presiding over his party’s worst result since the second world war; the SPD was well beaten by the CDU in September’s elections. Some delegates used their speeches to vent their annoyance with the party leadership opening the door to talks with Merkel, expressing fears that a new “grand coalition” could deal their party an existential blow. Surveys show that a majority of SPD members would prefer their party to prop up a Merkel-led minority government rather than rejoin a coalition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/07/manchester-united-fa-cup-live-third-round-end-58-games-derby","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T14:47:36Z","webTitle":"Manchester United’s 12-year live FA Cup run comes to an end at 58 games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/07/manchester-united-fa-cup-live-third-round-end-58-games-derby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/07/manchester-united-fa-cup-live-third-round-end-58-games-derby","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United’s 12-year live FA Cup run comes to an end at 58 games","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"After a 58-match run going back to their third-round replay against Exeter City in 2005, Manchester United’s FA Cup tie against Derby County will not be televised live in the United Kingdom while the Football Association has confirmed the match between Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Crystal Palace will be the first to trial video assistant referees. After criticism of the decision to provide live coverage of the 12-times winners’ third-round meeting with Reading last season, the joint broadcasters the BBC and BT Sport have instead opted to televise seven other ties – starting with the Merseyside derby between Liverpool and Everton on Friday 5 January. That will kick off at 7.55pm on BBC One, with the same channel broadcasting the tie between Leicester City and Hereford – the lowest-ranked team still in the competition – or Fleetwood Town on Saturday 6 January at 12.45pm. BT Sport’s first match will be Chelsea’s trip to Carrow Road to face Norwich City later that day at 5.30pm, with Nottingham Forest v Arsenal selected for the teatime slot on Sunday. BBC Wales will show Newport County’s fixture at home against Leeds United on the same day, while BBC One will have Joe Hart’s potential return to his former club Shrewsbury Town with West Ham United at 2pm. The M23 derby is the final third-round fixture to have been chosen, with Brighton and Palace rounding off the action on Monday at 7.45pm at the Amex Stadium. Disorder caused by fans around the teams’ recent meeting at the Amex Stadium was described as a “return to the dark days of football” by Sussex police. Having announced plans to introduce the VAR system this year, the match will become the first competitive use of the technology in the UK as part of the International Football Association Board’s trial. The technology was first used in November at Wembley Stadium at England’s two senior men’s internationals against Germany and Brazil and it is intended that VARs will then be used for the remainder of the competition at a select number of fixtures. “The FA has always been open to trialling new innovations and was heavily involved in the advancement of goal-line technology before it was introduced,” said Andy Ambler, director of professional game relations at the FA. “The trialling of the VAR system in this season’s Emirates FA Cup from the third round is a continuation of that and further demonstrates that whilst being the most famous and historic domestic cup competition in the world it is also modern, progressive and innovative.” Televised FA Cup third-round fixtures Friday 5 January Liverpool v Everton (7.55pm) – live on BBC One.

Liverpool reported Spartak to European football’s governing body after Brewster, a member of England Under-17 World Cup‑winning team, alleged he had been verbally racially abused. Mironov, who is 19, will have his case heard by Uefa’s control, ethics and disciplinary body. If found guilty he will be suspended for at least 10 games or for a specified period. Uefa regulations state: “Any person who insults the human dignity of a person or group of persons on whatever grounds, including skin colour, race, religion or ethnic origin, incurs a suspension lasting at least 10 matches or a specified period of time, or any other appropriate sanction.” The 17-year-old Brewster, considered one of the brightest young talents in the English game, had to be restrained by team-mates and coaching staff including Steven Gerrard at the final whistle. Liverpool confirmed they had “followed the proper procedure by reporting the alleged incident to Uefa”. It is the second time this season the club has made a complaint against Spartak after Brewster’s team-mate Bobby Adekanye was racially abused by fans during a game in Moscow in September. On that occasion Spartak were ordered by Uefa to close at least 500 seats at their academy ground for their next home fixture and display a banner on the empty seats reading “#EqualGame”. If Mironov is found guilty and this is seen as a continuation of the same problem, Spartak could face a full ground closure. Kick It Out sent out a stinging response to the alleged abuse during Wednesday’s match, pointing the finger at Uefa for its lack of action on the issue. Its statement read: “Less than two months ago,Spartak Moscow supporters were found guilty of racially abusing Liverpool’s Bobby Adenkanye, however it is clear Uefa’s punishment of a partial stadium closure was far from sufficient to protect Liverpool’s players. Kick It Out has worked closely with Liverpool over the past two years to offer support regarding on-field incidents of discrimination, and believes the club has been let down by Uefa in their response. “Kick It Out expects a swift investigation by Uefa. Should the Spartak Moscow player be found guilty, the club must receive a far stronger punishment if Europe’s governing body is truly serious about ensuring that football is an ‘#EqualGame’. It is also extremely concerning to this organisation that yet another incident has taken place involving a Russian club, particularly ahead of the 2018 World Cup. “Players and supporters have been told on several occasions by the Russian Football Association that racism is not a serious problem in Russian football. However, incidents such as these undermine any confidence black and minority ethnic footballers or supporters will have in their ability to attend the World Cup in Russia without suffering racial abuse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/07/marks-and-spencer-stoneless-avocado","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T14:36:15Z","webTitle":"M&S selling stoneless avocado that could cut out risk of injuries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/07/marks-and-spencer-stoneless-avocado","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/07/marks-and-spencer-stoneless-avocado","fields":{"headline":"M&S selling stoneless avocado that could cut out risk of injuries","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Marks &amp; Spencer has begun selling a stoneless avocado that could help banish the pain of “avocado hand”. The so-called cocktail avocado is 5cm-8cm (2in-3in) in length and has a smooth, edible skin, meaning it can be sliced or eaten whole. Earlier this year, the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons identified the problem of increasing numbers of people turning up at A&amp;E after cutting their hands and fingers while trying to remove avocado stones, and called for safety labels to be put on the fruit. Charlotte Curtis, a food technology specialist at M&amp;S, said: “We’ve had the mini, the giant, ready sliced and we’re now launching the holy grail of avocados – stoneless. This amazing fruit has been on our radar for a couple of years and we’re very excited to have finally been able to get hold of some for our customers to try.” The slimmer fruit is the result of an unpollinated blossom and develops without a seed. It is grown in Spain and currently only available during December. M&amp;S said stoneless avocados were usually sent to Paris, where chefs use them in high-end restaurants, but the retailer had managed to source a limited supply this year. Curtis said she expected them to sell out quickly, adding: “My top tip is to try them deep fried.” M&amp;S’s stoneless version is the latest attempt to meet growing global demand for avocados while supply is being squeezed. Over the summer, Tesco briefly sold an avocado weighing about 70g and nearly one-third of the usual size. M&amp;S is also experimenting with tattooing avocados instead of using sticky labels. UK sales have surged as the Instagram-friendly dish of avocado on toast has become increasing popular and health-conscious consumers have used the fruit in smoothies and salads. It has also been blamed for young people not being able to afford to buy a house. Poor harvests in producer countries including Peru and South Africa have combined with soaring demand from China to create a worldwide shortage. Strikes by workers in Mexico, which accounts for up to 70% of global avocado production, compounded the problem. •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/07/charles-ii-exhibition-reveals-how-he-tackled-the-kings-evil","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T14:36:50Z","webTitle":"Charles II exhibition reveals how he tackled 'the king's evil'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/07/charles-ii-exhibition-reveals-how-he-tackled-the-kings-evil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/07/charles-ii-exhibition-reveals-how-he-tackled-the-kings-evil","fields":{"headline":"Charles II exhibition reveals how he tackled 'the king's evil'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Charles II brought many things into English life: theatre, horse racing, parties, amorality, drunkenness, mistresses, a royal string of illegitimate children, and, perhaps less well known, touching the diseased. The king’s touching ceremonies are featured in a new exhibition opening on Friday at the Queen’s Gallery in Buckingham Palace. The show, with paintings, drawings, tapestries and objects, explores Charles’s colourful reign and Restoration in 1660 after the sober, fun-free years of Oliver Cromwell’s Commonwealth government. Of the ceremonies Charles revived, the “curing of the king’s evil” was one of the most important. “It was a way of him being visible and being shown to the people,” said Lauren Porter, curator of works on paper at the Royal Collection. “It was very popular. It is a real sign of the power of the monarchy being shown to a wide number of people.” The “king’s evil” was scrofula, a swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck caused by tuberculosis. Since the Middle Ages it was believed that a touch from royalty could heal the problem, hence the importance of reviving the ceremony. Its reintroduction was hugely popular. Porter said Charles had 7,000 people wanting to be touched in the first year and over the course of his reign he touched 96,796 scrofula sufferers. That is more, the exhibition reveals, than any other British monarch and was almost 2% of the population. The “healings” usually took place on Fridays and were held at Banqueting House in Whitehall or the state apartments of the palace where he was residing. Admissions were limited to 200 at a time, and not just anyone could turn up. On display is one of the admission tokens, given only if a royal surgeon confirmed the scrofula and a certificate could be provided proving they had not been touched previously. The king would use both hands to touch a sufferer under the chin while a chaplain read aloud from the Bible. There were many contemporary accounts of its success, but the glandular inflammation was likely to go down naturally. The Charles II exhibition is a companion to what will be a landmark Charles I exhibition opening at the Royal Academy of Arts in January. The latter is collaborating with the Royal Collection to tell the story of how Charles I’s art collection, one of the most stupendous ever created, was, after his execution in 1649, sold off and scattered across Europe. It will reunite spectacular works by artists such as Titian, Van Dyck, Rubens, Holbein and Mantegna, some of which are coming to Britain for the first time in nearly 400 years. Before that comes an exhibition showing the exuberance of Charles II’s court. The lead curator, Rufus Bird, said: “Suddenly there is this re-establishment of life and colour and excitement and theatre and luxury and all sorts of magnificence which you associate with princely European court culture in the 17th century and Charles II embraced that enthusiastically.” It explores the traditional view of Charles II as the Merrie Monarch, his love of sex, pleasure and parties as well as his patronage of the theatre, horse racing and yachting – all part of a concerted attempt to win the support of the country. • Charles II: Art &amp; Power is at the Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace 8 December-13 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/07/doris-lessing-nobel-prize-literature-medal-goes-up-for-auction","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T14:07:43Z","webTitle":"Doris Lessing's Nobel medal goes up for auction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/07/doris-lessing-nobel-prize-literature-medal-goes-up-for-auction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/07/doris-lessing-nobel-prize-literature-medal-goes-up-for-auction","fields":{"headline":"Doris Lessing's Nobel medal goes up for auction","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Doris Lessing’s Nobel prize medal, won in 2007 for “subject[ing] a divided civilisation to scrutiny … with scepticism, fire and visionary power”, is to be sold at auction next week, with an expected price upwards of £150,000. Christie’s, which has set a guide price of between £150,000 and £250,000, said that only one other Nobel medal for literature has previously sold at auction. That was Andre Gide’s, which sold in Paris last year for €300,000. Sotheby’s put William Faulkner’s Nobel medal up for auction in New York in 2013, with a guide price of $500,000 to $1m, but did not find a buyer. When Lessing was named Nobel laureate by the Swedish Academy in 2007, she had already declined an OBE in 1977 and a damehood in 1992. Writing of the latter to the principal private secretary to the prime minister, she said: “Thank you for offering me this honour: I am very pleased. But for some time now I have been wondering, ‘But where is this British Empire?’ Surely, there isn’t one. And now I see that I am not the only one saying the same. There is something ruritannical about honours given in the name of a non-existent Empire.” She was equally unfazed by her Nobel win, learning of the honour as she returned home in a taxi from a shopping trip with her son. “Oh Christ! I’m sure you’d like some uplifting remarks of some kind,” she told the cameras, adding: “I’ve won all the prizes in Europe, every bloody one, so I’m delighted to win them all. It’s a royal flush.” At 87, Lessing was the literature prize’s oldest winner. Born in Persia, Lessing grew up in Rhodesia, and left school at the age of 13. She was a voracious reader, and her parents sourced books from England for her. In her Nobel lecture, she spoke of the inequality she had seen and the importance of books in making a writer: “Even today I get letters from people living in a village that might not have electricity or running water, just like our family in our elongated mud hut. ‘I shall be a writer too,’ they say, ‘because I’ve the same kind of house you were in.’ But here is the difficulty. Writing, writers, do not come out of houses without books.” Lessing died aged 94 in 2013. Sophie Hopkins at Christie’s said she thought the price estimate was “pretty reasonable”. “I don’t think we’re in cloud cuckoo land – it reflects the importance of her as a writer, and as a female writer,” she said. “It’s such a difficult thing to predict though. At some point people start making subjective judgments about the importance of one writer over another, and how they fit into the broader story of Nobel winners. The fact that Doris Lessing is only the 11th woman to have won to me means that the estimate seems reasonable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/07/university-food-bank-vice-chancellors-pay-students-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T13:20:45Z","webTitle":"University food banks are monuments to the obscene pay of vice-chancellors | Kehinde Andrews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/university-food-bank-vice-chancellors-pay-students-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/university-food-bank-vice-chancellors-pay-students-poverty","fields":{"headline":"University food banks are monuments to the obscene pay of vice-chancellors","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On the same day that news broke that staff at the University of Birmingham are protesting the obscene pay of their vice-chancellor, I opened an email asking for donations to a food bank that my university, Birmingham City, has started for students. This Dickensian contrast in fortunes demonstrates the widening problems of inequality in universities since fees have been introduced. I have seen firsthand how hard some of our students struggle to make ends meet so I understand why the university offers emergency food services. I’m sure we are likely not alone. The initiative was started by those on the frontline of student support and is a valuable effort to provide help in a broken system. The very fact that staff have had to reach out for food charity demonstrates the failure of higher education “reforms” to provide for those that need it most. When my sister went to university, tuition was free and there was a generous maintenance grant. When I went a few years later, my fees were minimal and the grant was still intact for the students who needed it. I now teach in a sector that charges some of the highest fees in the world, and the maintenance grant has been replaced by a loan, with an interest rate far higher than that of most mortgages. It is chilling to think what future generations of students will have to overcome in order to participate in higher education. At the other end of the spectrum to hungry students are university vice-chancellors (VCs), who are being paid a king’s ransom. VCs have become CEOs who are rewarded for attracting customers into multimillion-pound businesses. Competition for consumers (they used to just be students) has led to an arms race across the sector to renovate utilitarian campuses into lavish spaces with recreational facilities and high street coffee chains. Halls of residence have been transformed from being functional units to study for a degree into luxury apartments, which are often so expensive I cannot imagine how anyone affords them. My family certainly would not have been able to. The impact has been a predictably sharp rise in the cost of university accommodation – no wonder some students are having difficulty finding enough money for food. The problem is that when education becomes a commodity and students are converted into consumers, the financial bottom line shapes decision-making. VCs are rewarded for staff cutbacks and saving money using casual contracts, no matter the impact on the quality of the “product” they are selling. Increasing the cost of living through outsourcing services and building luxury student housing is worth a bonus, as long as it pulls in the punters and generates more revenue. VCs are rewarded for making the sort of decisions more associated with CEOs, with David Eastwood at the University of Birmingham “earning” almost £3m since taking over in 2009, not including the house and chauffeur-driven car. In fairness to him he is not alone in his absurdly high pay: Glynis Breakwell at the University of Bath stepped down amid controversy and Christopher Snowden is facing protests at the University of Southampton. But Eastwood is reserved a special circle in neoliberal hell because, alongside Baroness Julia King, who was then at Aston, they were the only VCs to sit on the Browne Review that led to market forces being unleashed on universities. Lord Adonis has called for a cap on excessive VC pay, and wants an inquiry headed by the archbishop of Canterbury. Ignore the howls of disapproval from advocates of the free market claiming that the role is underpaid given the size of the businesses, and that without high salaries “the best people leave”. I’ve spent the last 15 years in universities, experiencing every level from undergraduate to senior academic. There is perhaps no less appropriate institution for the “captain of industry” model. The lifeblood of the university is teaching, research and student support. Like most organisations, it is the staff at the ground level who ensure the smooth running of the university, and make decisions such as setting up food donations for students in need. Most strategic decisions are made at the department, school or faculty level and while the VC sets a framework for this work, they have little direct impact on the majority of the activity that makes a university education attractive. VCs play an important role but how could they ever truly justify the excessive sums that some universities pay out? Even though students now pay for the privilege of learning, they are not simply consumers, but an active part of what makes university a unique experience. VCs are not directly responsible for all the hardships that students face – the government bears a significant responsibility. But it is undeniable that the changes most universities have championed under their leadership has drastically increased the cost of studying. While some VCs are getting rich, there are students who have to rely on charity for their most basic necessities. Let them eat donated non-perishables. • Kehinde Andrews is an associate professor in sociology at Birmingham City University"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/11/i-am-78-and-have-been-having-exciting-sex-but-now-cannot-masturbate","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T08:10:16Z","webTitle":"I am 78 and have been having exciting sex but now cannot masturbate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/11/i-am-78-and-have-been-having-exciting-sex-but-now-cannot-masturbate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/11/i-am-78-and-have-been-having-exciting-sex-but-now-cannot-masturbate","fields":{"headline":"I am 78 and have been having exciting sex but now cannot masturbate","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My husband died five years ago.

There should be no reason at all why you cannot enjoy both solo sex and sex with a partner. If the current barrier to masturbation is simply lack of time or privacy, then try to organise your life so you have all the opportunities you need. But if the problem is disapproval from your current lover, then do not put up with that. And, in any case, why tell him? It is absolutely none of his business. The notion that (moderate) masturbation interferes with one’s ability to enjoy sex with a partner is a myth. Many people find that, while sex with their partner is highly enjoyable, nothing is so deeply satisfying as masturbation. You deserve to enjoy the kind of sex that best appeals to you, and if that means limiting sex with your new partner to better prioritise self-pleasuring – then that is your right, your decision, and you deserve full sexual self-determination. • Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders • If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

His portraits resemble the one Oscar Wilde’s Dorian Gray kept in the attic. Every sin seems etched into the work as a grotesque wrinkle. His heavy black eyebrows and ungainly nose add to the ugliness. In a popular print that was pinned up in about 1661 in a pub or coffee house (it still has the pinholes), these features are exaggerated into an almost devilish mask. He may not have minded looking like a stage villain, because he loved and supported the stage. When Charles was invited to claim the British throne in 1660, plays had been illegal for nearly two decades. They were banned for their “lascivious Mirth and Levity” in 1642 by the Puritans, who won the English civil war. Their religious bigotry was one of the reasons crowds hailed Charles II so enthusiastically when he returned from exile in the Low Countries, after the death of the Puritan dictator Oliver Cromwell. A mezzotint portrait of a nude Nell Gwyn, posing as Venus, reveals the exact nature of Charles II’s passion for theatre – it was primarily a passion for female actors. Women were immediately employed as professional actors when the theatres reopened in 1660. In Shakespeare’s time that had been inconceivable. Gwyn rose from selling oranges to acting in comedies, to bearing the king two illegitimate sons, as a portrait in which she reclines on draperies while her two blueblooded boys float above her breasts. No, this was not feminism, but it wasn’t cultural conservatism either. All of these are printed images, not paintings. They’re beautiful, funny, strange and grotesque – we see in these prints the beginning of the visual world that would soon produce William Hogarth. Most spectacular of all, a giant louse bursts out of a book, its vicious claws clutching a stalk, its hard carapace covered with tiny hairs. It would make a great illustration to Franz Kafka’s Metamorphosis, in which a man wakes up to find he has changed into a giant insect. In fact, this is a superbly accurate scientific drawing from Robert Hooke’s 1665 book Micrographia, in which this pioneering researcher describes and illustrates tiny creatures he has seen with a microscope. Charles II is known to have owned similar drawings by Hooke’s friend Christopher Wren. Hooke was a gifted artist as well as one of the founders of modern science. He’d learned to draw from his teacher, the artist Peter Lely, who became the definitive painter of the Restoration court. The reason Lely was so perfect for the job was that he enjoyed painting “beauties” – he actually painted a series called The Windsor Beauties. While not exactly masterpieces, they leap into life when he gets aroused. The king’s mistress Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, looks powerful and monarchical, holding a crown of flowers between her fingers as if it was the monarchy itself. Protestants feared her power over the king lured him towards Catholicism. This is all good fun and fascinating history, but the real drop-dead highlights of this absorbing show don’t come from Britain at all. Charles spent a lot of money recreating the royal art collection, which had been sold off by Cromwell. In fact, the Royal Collection as we know it starts with his reign – and what gobsmacking works he purchased, or sometimes repurchased. He got his hands on the greatest collection of Leonardo da Vinci’s drawings in the world. Just four are on view here from the hundreds of stupendous sheets that are still preserved in the Royal Library, but they light up a winter day. Another treasure is Lorenzo Lotto’s portrait of Andrea Odoni, my favourite painting owned by the Queen. In this 1527 masterpiece, a man puts his hand on his heart as he daydreams of ancient grandeur amid his collection of Roman marble fragments. The white and yellow stone heads and headless bodies seem to come to life around him in this intensely atmospheric, enigmatic painting. If only Britain’s public art collections were as rich. If only the Royal Collection was part of our free museums. Exhibitions like this show that it is undeniably being well run. At a time when the monarchy looks like Britain’s healthiest institution, even its most outrageous asset, the Royal Collection is clearly being managed intelligently. In a year when good exhibitions of pre-modern art were thin on the ground, God bless the royals for giving a damn about history.

That doesn’t mean the information doesn’t exist, only that David Davis has gone out of his way to not ask for it. Away from Westminster, every anxious industry and professional body is scenario-planning for worst and least-worst outcomes. But it’s not easy when the cabinet, in 18 long months since the referendum vote, has never discussed the destination it is hurtling towards. Today is the turn of the environmental health officers (EHOs) to peer into the fog of possible Brexit futures at their annual conference. Is the government taking the charabanc over the cliff edge, or will it swerve in time? The cabinet front-seaters trying to press the accelerator are manic deregulators, bonfire-of-red-tape arsonists. Their whole purpose in wrenching us out of the EU is to give free rein to cowboy enterprise, liberated from the dead hand of health and safety, which they have always mocked and traduced. EHOs are one of the great invisible anchors of civilisation, the inspectors and guarantors of standards we have taken for granted all our lives. They rightly fear those standards are in grave peril. They warn that abandoning EU rules and relying on the World Trade Organisation will entail “acceptance by the UK consumer of food that doesn’t meet quality, composition, hygiene or standards of production” relied on for years. Already their work has been sabotaged by austerity. Councils hit by 40% funding cuts have shed a third of their EHOs: England now has half as many as Wales and Northern Ireland. Inspections of food outlets have been severely cut back, along with checking for food fraud, air quality, landlords letting out high-risk properties, septic tattoo parlours, rats, cockroaches, animal and bee welfare, pesticides, bad antibiotics, noise, fumes and risks of every kind. The protective covering between us and dangerous filth is growing perilously thin. Researching Dismembered, a book David Walker and I wrote on the shrinking state, I spent time observing a group of EHOs at work: they told me that on paper nothing has changed. Category-A, high-risk food outlets such as dirty chicken and kebab shops must by law be inspected far more regularly. And so they still are. How do they do that with a depleted staff? Easy – they rate fewer places as Category A. In one transport cafe, I saw them find meat pies lying on the kitchen floor, out of the fridge, labelled “organic”, with no known origin, delivered for cash off the back of a lorry. Just as air quality reaches crisis levels, two-thirds of their air monitoring stations were shut because of lack of staff. The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health feels it is peering over the possible abyss of a hard-Brexit, deregulated future, where no alignment with the EU means importing from elsewhere with lower standards, requiring more checks and certifications. It warns of already over-stretched capacity at ports checking just-in-time food arrivals, so any extra delay for new checks will leave food rotting on quaysides. Public health laboratories are stretched to breaking point. Where will extra inspectors come from, with many fewer trainees now? Besides, many inspectors are EU nationals who may not stay. They listen to the drumbeat of the deregulators with growing trepidation. “If we could just halve the burdens of the EU social and employment legislation we could deliver a £4.3bn boost to our economy and 60,000 new jobs,” the former international development secretary Priti Patel told the Institute of Directors. “The price of the food we eat is directly influenced by the barrage of regulations Europe imposes on farmers and producers.” Boris Johnson claims the reason for our low growth is “because we’ve got too much regulation, too much stuff coming from Brussels”. The same chorus has come from Jacob Rees-Mogg, Chris Grayling, Dominic Raab and the rest. The health and safety system already conducts dramatically fewer workplace inspections: inspectors can no longer pro-actively inspect, without an accident or complaint. That’s the triumph of decades of mockery of the “’elf and safety culture”, which the EHOs suffer too. No, it’s not true that they banned conkers, hanging baskets, candy-floss on sticks or flip-flops at work, or made trapeze artists wear hard hats. But those tales stick in the mind, like the lies Brexiteers peddled for decades against Brussels: straight bananas and fishermen in hair nets. As Trump shows, fake news campaigning scores so much better than dull facts. The Health and Safety Executive’s myth-busting website has to rebut such nonsense every week. Away from the Westminster impasse over the interpretation of “alignment” versus “harmonisation”, those words have real-world effects touching every aspect of British life. Yet the meaning is deliberately ignored in the Brexit press, hidden from too many voters. No wonder Davis never called for impact assessments, knowing how grim they would be. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/07/saracens-european-rugby-champions-cup-the-breakdown","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T11:44:16Z","webTitle":"Saracens contemplate European retaliation amid domestic slump | Paul Rees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/07/saracens-european-rugby-champions-cup-the-breakdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/07/saracens-european-rugby-champions-cup-the-breakdown","fields":{"headline":"Saracens contemplate European retaliation amid domestic slump","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In order to improve the mind, we ought less to learn, than to contemplate. So wrote René Descartes, the 17th-century French philosopher Saracens players have become used to discussing in a group organised by the club’s psychologist, David Jones, as part of the club’s team-building ethos. There will be contemplation aplenty at Allianz Park after the defeat at Harlequins last Sunday meant the European Champions Cup holders had lost three consecutive Premiership matches for the first time since 2010, the season they made their breakthrough after years of inconsistency. In 2010 Saracens lost at Wasps, at home to Bath and then away to the bottom club, Leeds in a run of matches during the Six Nations. This season, they lost at Gloucester after dominating the first half and then did the same at home to Exeter before again seeing Harlequins come from behind late on at the Stoop last Sunday. The first two matches were played during the autumn internationals when they were without six players, as well as the injured Billy Vunipola, but they were close to full strength at the Stoop, as they were on their previous two league visits to the ground, which also ended in defeat. Saracens’ success has made them prime targets for England to the extent that not only did they lose their outside-half Owen Farrell last month but also, although he was released to play at Gloucester, his backup Alex Lozowski. The second row Nick Isiekwe, groomed this season to take over from Maro Itoje and George Kruis in the international windows, played for England against Samoa. Sarries are finding their resources stretched and since defeating London Irish at the end of October, they have lost their two matches in the Anglo-Welsh Cup, against Harlequins and Sale, followed by the three league defeats. On Sunday they face Clermont Auvergne at home in the European Champions Cup, the last team to defeat them in the competition in the 2015 semi-final. Clermont, the French champions, have won only one match on the road this season, at Ospreys on the opening weekend of the Champions Cup, with five defeats and a draw at Oyonnax away from their home ground where they have a 100% record. It is a meeting of the sides who contested the final last May at Murrayfield and with both starting their European campaign with two victories, a home victory will be the sweeter for the denial of a losing bonus point. Saracens are no more at crisis point than Clermont, who while lying ninth in the Top 14 are only three points behind third-placed Lyon. Their current slump, which follows defeats at Worcester and Gloucester during the Six Nations last season, may prompt a debate over the practicality of having so many England players, but what is also relevant is the way the game is now placing more emphasis on retaining possession, something the Premiership champions and current leaders Exeter are masters at. Saracens in their league pomp were not the team to play catch-up against, but they let eight-point leads in the final quarter slip against Gloucester and Harlequins and led Exeter by nine at half-time. In each case, they lost to a try, not a penalty. They were games they used to see out and they lost to the Chiefs at Sandy Park in last May’s play-off semi-final to a late try. The Premiership will reach its halfway point in the next round just before Christmas but already, to look at two of last season’s play-off teams, Wasps have lost as many matches as they did in that campaign, four and Saracens have lost four compared to five. What has been notable in the last three months is the cluster victories and defeats are coming in. Wasps won their first two matches, lost the next four and are on a four-game winning streak; Northampton won four in a row but have lost their last five; Newcastle started with four wins in five but now have one victory in five; Gloucester have won five in a row after losing three of their first five matches; Saracens have five successive victories before their latest run; and Leicester started with two defeats and have lost their last two games but in between enjoyed a six-match winning streak. Only Exeter and London Irish have been models of consistency. “The Premiership is the most competitive of competitions,” said Dai Young, the Wasps director of rugby. “There are so many one-score margins that the law of averages dictates some games are going to go against you. All clubs are ambitious and are signing very good players so the gap is getting smaller: it is not about three or four any longer. “Sarries won a few games late on last season and it is currently going the other way. It is not a huge swing: they have not suddenly gone from winning by 50 points to losing by 50. I think the teams in the top four will lose more games this season than the average: ball in play time is increasing and it makes it harder because teams are scoring tries. “Sarries are kicking more than they used to and that creates the opportunity for mistakes: they are expanding and becoming a bit looser, but they will be in the top four without a shadow of a doubt, and do well in Europe. If we are in front of Saracens at the end of the season, I will be happy because it means we will be in a good place.” Crucial for Saracens will be their block of four matches during the 2018 Six Nations. They face Newcastle at home having won their last 15 league matches against the Falcons, then travel to Sale, a club they have lost to once in the last 13, and welcome Leicester, whose last win at Sarries was in 2012, before travelling to Exeter, a club they failed to beat in three encounters this year. The philosophy club at Saracens is run by the psychologist Jones. “We may discuss Descartes and we discuss themes like envy and anger,” he told the Financial Times in October. “We have conversation cards with open-ended questions.” The aim is to give them a deeper understanding of each other so that, when things go wrong, they pull together. Clermont can expect a reaction. Unbeaten records on the line The encounter between Saracens and Clermont at Allianz Park is one of three matches this weekend between teams who have a 100% record after the opening two rounds. Bath are in Toulon on Saturday and the following day Exeter take on Leinster at Sandy Park in a match which, despite the late kick-off on a Sunday evening that mercifully go when the tournament moves to one live broadcaster from next season rather than two, should be played before a packed house. Toulon are not the force they were when winning the Champions Cup for three successive seasons but, like most French clubs, they take some toppling at home. Only Racing 92 have won at Stade Mayol this season, prompting the club’s owner, Mourad Boudjellal, to declare war on Sunday rugby, but their only success away in the Top 14 was at Stade Français while in Europe, they needed a last-minute penalty to down Treviso. Bath, in contrast, have won three of their five away Premiership matches and in their last Champions Cup match beat the Scarlets, last season’s Pro 12 winners, in Llanelli. The Premiership produces more away victories than the Top 14, 23 in 60 matches this season compared to 17 in 84. Bath will not travel in fear to a ground where Saracens won last season and where the Scarlets in October were in a position to win the game, but they suffered a chastening defeat at Exeter last weekend while Toulon were indulging themselves at home to Lyon. Chris Ashton, who was moved to full-back a few weeks into the season, scored two more tries to take him to 11 in the league, overhauling the Montpellier wing Nemani Nadolo at the top of the season’s list with 11, while they have two All Blacks to consider in midfield in Malakai Fekitoa and Ma’a Nonu. The Top 14 leaders, La Rochelle, are at home to Wasps on Sunday having quickly taken to the Champions Cup, which is far from the norm. They are unbeaten at home this season and have passed 35 points in front of their own supporters four times, planting 51 on Clermont. Players find voice on scheduling The issue of welfare has seen players find their voice. In a season when the word strike has been mentioned unless the demands being placed on them are changed, they won a victory at the latest meeting of the professional game board at Twickenham. When the changes to the global season were announced this year, Premiership Rugby quickly announced that it would extend its season by a month, starting not in October from 2019-20, as they will be in France and the Pro 14, but carrying on from the beginning of September through to the end of June. It is not a decision Premiership Rugby is able to make unilaterally and the Rugby Players’ Association, which is part of the game board, has argued against it. The board decided nothing would be done until a paper was produced at the end of next month detailing how the domestic season would look. There have been a number of ideas floated, such as ending promotion and relegation, which, so the theory goes, would encourage coaches to rest players more, reduce the size of the Premiership by one or two or increase it to 13, which is its true number given that the relegated team tends to bounce straight back. A 13-team league would be one fewer than in France or the Pro 14, but it would have the advantage of ensuring that every round there would be one club sitting it out with its players rested. It would, in the current season length, mean the end of the Anglo-Welsh Cup, but, as ever, there are political hurdles to negotiate. Some on Premiership Rugby want the A league, rather than the Championship, to be the secondary tournament, meaning there would be no more talk about funding the second tier. A 10-team Premiership would mean a continuation of relegation and promotion for obvious reasons, but a 13-strong top flight would close the door on the Championship, although probably left on the latch. What the clubs do know is that the players, having found their voice and having a role to play, are not going to keep quiet.

The Center for Independent Social Research found that the number of sentences for crimes against LGBT people increased to 65 in 2015 from 18 in 2010. Murders accounted for almost 200 out of 250 crimes analysed, it was found. The centre attributed the rise to Russia’s 2013 ban on the spreading of “propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations” to minors. The law has been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights activists. Homosexuality was a criminal offence in Russia until 1993 and classed as a mental illness until 1999.

The contact had come with the Apoel Nicosia substitute Roland Sallai and it was clear that the Tottenham Hotspur full-back had to come off – at least for a quick patch-up job. Mauricio Pochettino assessed the situation and decided that “it was not necessary to take a risk”. Rose needed five stitches, there were only 20 minutes to play in what was a dead Champions League rubber and so the manager chose to keep him off and introduce Kyle Walker-Peters. Rose wanted to stay on, unsurprisingly, but Pochettino did not want to force it. The pair had a conversation on the touchline and Rose then disappeared off towards the dressing room for his treatment. He would reappear to watch the closing stages of Tottenham’s 3-0 win from the bench. In the age of social media, the incident was swiftly transposed into “Rose has angry words with Pochettino and storms off”. Rose’s recent history encouraged the leap. Only two weeks ago he admitted he had been “fuming” to have been omitted from the Tottenham squad for the derby at Arsenal, although he added that there was “understanding, at the same time” – given he was not long back from serious injury. Rose’s broader dissatisfaction with his lot at Tottenham has been well documented – by himself, via his interview in the Sun last August, in which he made it plain that he considered himself to be underpaid at the club. The 27-year-old also said that he wanted to “play up north” before the end of his career. He continues to be linked with a move to Manchester United. And so the Apoel incident was obviously the latest illustration of the simmering tension between him and Pochettino. Rose snapped at the notion and when Rose wants to make his point, he does not hold back. “This is getting silly now,” Rose declared. “The manager said it was best I came off and I didn’t want to come off. That was it. I’ve seen already that people are saying we exchanged words. There is no issue between me and the manager. There has never been an issue. And people trying to put stuff in the media is not welcomed. “For the last three and a half years, four years, the manager has been my biggest fan. He’s given me nothing but love and respect. There is no issue. There never will be an issue. People need to stop this because it’s not welcomed.” It is entirely possible that Rose can be irked at the chairman Daniel Levy’s relatively tight pay structure at Tottenham and be open to a transfer and not blame Pochettino for the situation. It is clear he owes Pochettino for helping to develop his career and that there is affection and gratitude in the equation. Only last month Rose reflected on how Pochettino had brought him back from his 10-month injury lay-off by sending him on as a substitute in the 1-1 draw at Real Madrid. “It was a class act on his part,” Rose said. “He didn’t need to bring me on.” Rose is the kind of guy who says what he thinks and, in the professional world he inhabits, he believes – not unreasonably – that his colleagues ought not be offended by his frankness. Football is not a place for sensitive souls. Rose is desperate to recover his fitness and he is conscious that he has completed the 90 minutes only twice since January. He also knows that Ben Davies has got ahead of him in the Tottenham pecking order at left-back. Is he happy about that? No. Would he say so? Most likely, yes. Rose’s straight-talking was evident when he considered Monday’s draw for the Champions League last 16. After taking 16 points from an available 18 to top a section that featured Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund, he and his teammates believe that they can be a match for anybody. “I wouldn’t like Bayern Munich,” Rose said, with a smile; Tottenham could get the German champions or Juventus, among others. “But we don’t fear anybody. We are confident we can beat anybody. The manager would prefer us to have one of the top teams. He relishes those sorts of games. We’ve proved in the group stage this season that we do turn up in these games. “It’s not easy to go to the Bernabéu and get a point, and maybe we should have won the game. It’s not easy to beat Real Madrid convincingly at home. I hope teams look at those performances and realise Tottenham are a team to be feared.” Tottenham’s next challenge is to reproduce their Champions League form in the Premier League. They face Stoke City at Wembley on Saturday and are keen to stop a run of four league matches without a win. “I can tell you that we’ve lost or drawn games recently because we’ve not started the games in the right manner,” Rose said. “When teams are coming here to Wembley, like West Brom, they score early then sit back and make it difficult for us to break them down. There are no excuses. We’ve got more than enough quality in the starting XI to be able to break teams down.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/07/adapted-gene-editing-tool-crispr-could-treat-incurable-diseases-say-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T17:00:16Z","webTitle":"Adapted Crispr gene editing tool could treat incurable diseases, say scientists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/07/adapted-gene-editing-tool-crispr-could-treat-incurable-diseases-say-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/07/adapted-gene-editing-tool-crispr-could-treat-incurable-diseases-say-scientists","fields":{"headline":"Adapted Crispr gene editing tool could treat incurable diseases, say scientists","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Incurable diseases such as diabetes and muscular dystrophy could be treated in future using a new form of genetic engineering designed to boost gene activity, according to scientists. The technique is an adapted version of the powerful gene editing tool called Crispr. While the original version of Crispr snips DNA in precise locations to delete faulty genes or over-write flaws in the genetic code, the modified form “turns up the volume” on selected genes. This potentially overcomes the problem of the wrong genes being modified by mistake, so-called off-target effects, which is viewed as a major safety barrier to using Crispr in a clinical context. “Cutting DNA opens the door to introducing new mutations,” said Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, who led the latest work at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. “That is something that is going to stay with us with Crispr or any other tool we develop that cuts DNA. It is a major bottleneck in the field of genetics – the possibility that the cell, after the DNA is cut, may introduce harmful mistakes.” Crispr has been a game-changer in biomedical research because of the ease and accuracy with which it can be used to edit the genetic code. Crispr is a guide molecule made of RNA that allows a specific site on the genome to be targeted. It is normally used along with a bacterial enzyme, called Cas9, which acts as molecular scissors, chopping the DNA at the exact point required. In the new version a Crispr-style guide is still used, but instead of cutting the genome at the site of interest, the Cas9 enzyme latches onto it. The new package also includes a third element: a molecule that homes in on the Cas9 and switches on whatever gene it is attached to. The new paper, published in Cell, demonstrates how this strategy might be applied to a range of devastating illnesses. The team showed that mice, with a version of muscular dystophy, a fatal muscle wasting disorder, recovered muscle growth and strength. The illness is caused by a mutation in the gene that produces dystrophin, a protein found in muscle fibres. However, rather than trying to replace this gene with a healthy version, the team boosted the activity of a second gene that produces a protein called utrophin that is very similar to dystrophin and can compensate for its absence. “We are not fixing the gene, the mutation is still there,” said Belmonte. “Instead ... the mice recover the expression of other genes in the same pathway. That is enough to recover the muscle function of these mutant mice.” In another mouse experiment, the team showed that normal kidney function could be restored in animals with a genetic kidney disorder. They were also able to induce some liver cells to turn into cells that somewhat resembled beta cells, the pancreatic cells that produce insulin, to improve the symptoms of mice with diabetes. The work is seen as an impressive technical feat, but will require extensive refinement and safety testing before it can move into patient studies. For instance, Prof Doug Melton, a Harvard scientist who is working to develop lab-grown pancreatic cells, said that steering a liver cell towards making insulin would not necessarily have advantages over insulin injections, because this would not restore the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar. “The key is to make a cell that accurately responds to changing sugar levels and secretes just the right amount of insulin, as does a beta cell,” he said. “To be fair, they seem to be saying [they’ve made] beta-like cells, which is accurate, but probably not good enough for a patient.” Alena Pance, a senior staff scientist at the UK’s Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said a potential drawback of the work was that the target genes would be boosted in organs throughout the body – raising the possibility of off target effects. “These results bring hope for a targeted gene therapy and widen the application of the technology ... but these issues would need to be investigated in depth before any application in humans is considered,” she said. Belmonte said that in future, the technique may even have the potential to reverse the ravages of old age – although this application is not on the immediate horizon. “Our goal will be to re-activate genes silenced by ageing, or to use the system to replenish stores of adult stem cells, which promote regeneration but are typically depleted with age,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/07/potential-pregnancy-deters-one-in-five-male-recruiters-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T14:04:19Z","webTitle":"Potential pregnancy deters one in five male recruiters – UK survey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/07/potential-pregnancy-deters-one-in-five-male-recruiters-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/07/potential-pregnancy-deters-one-in-five-male-recruiters-survey","fields":{"headline":"Potential pregnancy deters one in five male recruiters – UK survey","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nearly one in five male HR decision-makers say they are reluctant to hire young women who might have children, despite it being illegal to consider that factor when recruiting, a survey has found.

A quarter of decision-makers said they worked for companies that considered whether a woman was pregnant or had young children when making decisions about promotions. Carole Easton, chief executive of the Young Women’s Trust, which represents women aged 16-30 on low or no pay, and which commissioned the survey, said the findings were shocking. She said that although employers asking young women about their children was against the law, women found it “virtually impossible” to assert their rights in the workplace. The Young Women’s Trust said: “It’s no wonder women are held back in the workplace when employers have such outdated, discriminatory views. It is employers and our economy that miss out on the talents of young women as a result.” A previous survey for the charity found that two in five young mothers had illegally been asked in job interviews about how being a parent would affect their ability to work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/07/inquiry-announced-into-case-of-rogue-surgeon-ian-paterson","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T12:53:20Z","webTitle":"Inquiry announced into case of rogue surgeon Ian Paterson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/07/inquiry-announced-into-case-of-rogue-surgeon-ian-paterson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/07/inquiry-announced-into-case-of-rogue-surgeon-ian-paterson","fields":{"headline":"Inquiry announced into case of rogue surgeon Ian Paterson","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government will launch an independent national inquiry into the actions of the rogue surgeon Ian Paterson, who was sentenced to 20 years in jail in August after carrying out needless surgery on patients who were left traumatised and scarred. The inquiry will begin in January and report in the summer of 2019, and will be chaired by the Right Rev Graham James, the bishop of Norwich. Paterson, a consultant breast surgeon at the Heart of England NHS foundation trust (HEFT) who practised privately at Spire Parkway and Spire Little Aston, was found guilty in April of 17 counts of wounding patients with intent. The NHS has paid out almost £10m in compensation to more than 250 patients, and Spire healthcare agreed in September to settle a further 750 cases. The government said the scope of the investigation would include the independent sector, and it would examine whether the Care Quality Commission’s inspection regime needed to be strengthened. The health minister Philip Dunne said he was determined that lessons would be learned so that similar problems could be avoided in both the NHS and the private sector. Concerns were raised about Paterson as far back as 2003 but, despite several internal and external investigations and complaints from patients, GPs and other surgeons, the General Medical Council did not suspend him until 2011. Dunne said: “Ian Paterson’s malpractice sent shockwaves across the health system due to the seriousness and extent of his crimes. I believe an independent, non-statutory inquiry, overseen by Bishop Graham James, is the right way forward to ensure that all aspects of this case are brought to light and lessons learned so we can better protect patients in the future.” Lawyers for Paterson’s victims said they were disappointed that the inquiry would not be statutory and would not have the power to force people to give evidence under oath or give binding recommendations. “We have previously expressed doubt in the current government’s political commitment to take on and tackle failings of the private health sector that were so vividly exposed in this terrible case,” said Tom Jones, the head of policy at Thompsons Solicitors, which represented about 500 victims. “Our concerns are reinforced by the potential for this inquiry to kick the can down the road and whose recommendations will not be binding.” Kashmir Uppal, of Access Legal, said the inquiry was a “positive step” but victims were disappointed and concerned. “The government has said patients’ interests will be put at the heart of this inquiry and so it must take place in public and fully expose the failings that allowed Ian Paterson to continue practising in the private sector long after concerns were raised about him.” James, the inquiry chair, said serious questions remained unanswered. “It is vital that the inquiry be informed by the concerns of former patients of Ian Paterson and their representatives,” he said. “The interests of all patients, whether they seek treatment in the NHS or the private sector, should be at the heart of this inquiry.” The government said the inquiry would consider oversight of care in the private sector, the sharing of complaints between private hospitals and the NHS, the role of private health insurers, and arrangements for medical indemnity cover for clinicians in the private sector. One of Paterson’s former patients, Sarah Jane Downey, said she was pleased the inquiry would report quickly, but she shared the concerns of other victims. “It worries me that the inquiry won’t have the ability to compel witnesses. We know there were people who aided and abetted Paterson and they need to answer questions,” she said. “It is a worry that it could be toothless.” Spire Healthcare, which runs Parkway and Little Aston hospitals, where Paterson practised, initially argued that as Paterson was not technically its employee, it was not responsible for his actions. In September, it agreed to settle all claims against it relating to Paterson, paying £27.2m into a £37m fund, with the balance funded by Paterson’s insurers and the Heart of England trust."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2017/dec/12/weekly-letters-us-uk-special-relationship","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T11:59:33Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 15 December 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/dec/12/weekly-letters-us-uk-special-relationship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2017/dec/12/weekly-letters-us-uk-special-relationship","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 15 December 2017","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s really nothing special Jonathan Freedland is right when he claims it’s time for Britain to end special relationship (8 December). The only problem is there probably never was one, apart from a marriage of convenience between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt after the invasion of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese. America has always pursued its own interests first and foremost. Tony Blair wilfully suppressed that knowledge to his cost – and ours, and of course that of the many thousands of casualties from all sides – when he ignored all the warning signs and supported George W Bush’s Iraq invasion. Theresa May is in desperate need of a strong trading partner as well as a military ally, given the cards she was dealt after the Brexit vote and her subsequent failed attempts at bluffing on a losing hand. The best she can hope for is to try to keep her special relationship with Donald Trump on the back burner, in the vain hope of his impeachment. For the time being at least, Trump appears fireproof. Once his shadow has faded away though, the UK’s best hope is to negotiate a new and more adult relationship with the US and the EU, with no favours asked and none given. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia Question the assumptions Dani Rodrik’s critique of neoliberalism (1 December) was rather weak. Although he brought out the important point that state interventions often have a great impact in setting up well-functioning markets, the article was curiously silent on the neoliberal policies foisted on many developing countries through “structural adjustment programs”. The opening up of developing economies and the withdrawal of the state’s role have left many countries, including my own, India, with unfathomable inequality. Separating “the first-order principles” of economics, as Rodrik argues, from what appears as neoliberal creed need not be so difficult. All principles are based on underlying assumptions and we have to question these assumptions so as to not conflate the fundamentals of economics with one dominant school of thought. Political and historical contexts can help clarify why some assumptions look like first-order principles in a heavily contested discipline like economics. Deepa Iyer Cambridge, UK • Dani Rodrik provides a necessary critique of neoliberalism’s addiction to the more-markets-and-less-government mantra. It is, however, disappointing that he both presumes no end to a capitalist economy and, worse, only highlights the traditional code words of mainstream economics as the starting point for alternative policies. It’s all very 20th-century and overly limited. Meanwhile, Kate Raworth in her splendid book Doughnut Economics has detailed some new ways to think like a 21st-century economist by fundamentally reframing our understanding of what economics is. Raworth provides a new set of code words as the basis of a better economics. They include “growth agnosticism”, “socially embedded economy”, “distributive by design” and “regenerative by design”. Rodrik is playing the old game, albeit a better version of the old game. Raworth is changing the game and providing inspiration for a new generation of economists, policymakers and campaigners. Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia Worried about Germany The pessimists in Philip Oltermann’s article on Angela Merkel’s coalition difficulties are right: the comparison of the present federal republic in Germany with the Weimar one is an apt and very worrying one (1 December). And not just for Germany. Around the world liberal western democracies are in trouble, with unlikely party alliances being cobbled together with varying degrees of unmanageability. In all these countries tyranny waits in the wings if they can’t get it right and their parliamentary systems reach the point of collapse. We are closer to such a collapse than we think. A major global economic downturn could do it – especially if that were coupled with a major new armed conflict. Alarmingly, both are real possibilities and our complacency is dangerous. If we wake up one morning to see a senior uniformed military figure announcing on television that the constitution has been suspended and that martial law is in place, we will only have ourselves to blame. It is now up to all of us to make sure our failing democracies are revived before it gets to that stage.

Two men were arrested last week following a joint operation by MI5, the UK’s counter-terrorism security service, and police. Security officials believe the alleged Islamist plot is the ninth to have been thwarted since March this year. The attack on Westminster in March heralded the start of a spate of attacks, with five terrorist atrocities getting through Britain’s defences this year and claiming a total of 36 lives in London and Manchester. The alleged details of the latest plot emerged as an official report into the terrorist attacks Britain suffered between March and June was released, showing that MI5 had intelligence that could have stopped the Manchester terror attack in May but, with the benefit of hindsight, did not correctly interpret it. Two men were detained on 28 November following an operation involving MI5 investigators and counter-terrorism police officers from Scotland Yard and the West Midlands. They are aged 20 and 21 and will make their first appearance on Wednesday at Westminster magistrates court in central London. The Metropolitan police said they had been charged “with the intention of committing acts of terrorism” and they with “engaging in conduct in preparation for giving effect to that intention”. Counter-terrorism investigators and the Crown Prosecution Service are bringing the court case. MI5 and police believe the plot would have started with an attack using an improvised bomb at the gates of Downing Street. The latest plot comes against a backdrop of claims from security officials that Britain is facing a heightened terrorist threat, with the MI5 director-general claiming in a recent speech that it is the worst he has known in his 34-year career. Britain’s official terrorist threat level is at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. At any one time MI5 can actively investigate 3,000 suspects and it has a pool of 20,000 people it has previously examined for signs they are plotting attacks against the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/08/venezuela-opposition-boycott-mayoral-elections","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T07:15:36Z","webTitle":"Venezuela's opposition in disarray over boycott of mayoral elections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/08/venezuela-opposition-boycott-mayoral-elections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/08/venezuela-opposition-boycott-mayoral-elections","fields":{"headline":"Venezuela's opposition in disarray over boycott of mayoral elections","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"To run or not to run? When it comes to elections, the leaders of Venezuela’s beleaguered political opposition keep changing their tune. In July they boycotted what was widely viewed as an unconstitutional election called by President Nicolás Maduro to form an all-powerful legislative super-body. Then, in October, they urged supporters to cast ballots for state governors. Now, citing unfair conditions, many opposition parties have switched tack once more and are refusing to run candidates in Sunday’s nationwide polling for local mayors. Some analysts think sitting out elections backfires. Despite food shortages, hyper-inflation and widespread disgust with Maduro’s increasingly authoritarian regime, the boycott means that candidates from his ruling Socialist party are likely to win control of the vast majority of the 335 town and city governments up for grabs. “I think the very least you can ask of an opposition is that it shows up and puts up a fight,” said Phil Gunson of the International Crisis Group. “I don’t think there are many instances in history where governments have been brought down by electoral boycotts.” But opposition leaders insist Venezuela’s elections are rigged in the government’s favour: electoral authorities are loyal to Maduro; state workers are coerced to vote for the ruling party; the government has banned some popular opposition leaders from running for office. María Corina Machado, who heads Vente Venezuela, one of the parties sitting out the election, said that the Maduro government “decides who can be the candidates, who can vote, and who will win”. One high-profile figure stuck in the middle of this debate is Yon Goicoechea, who is running for mayor of the middle-class Caracas suburb of El Hatillo. Goicoechea has impeccable opposition credentials. He first rose to prominence 13 years ago leading student protests against the late Hugo Chávez, who ushered in Venezuela’s socialist revolution in 1999. After receiving threats Goicoechea lived for several years in the US and Spain. He returned to Venezuela last year but amid anti-government protests he was jailed on charges of possessing explosives. “I had a cell in which if I extended my arms I could touch both sides. It was really hard, really claustrophobic,” he said in an interview. Goicoechea was released last month after the charges were dropped. But his decision to run for mayor has angered his political allies who would prefer that he respect the boycott. Rumours have even been spread that Goicoechea cut a deal with prison authorities: his freedom on the condition that he run for office to convey a false legitimacy on the elections. When Goicoechea recently addressed a small audience in El Hatillo, a woman stood up and demanded to know whether he had gone over to the government’s side. Raising his voice, he said that he had just been through 14 months of hell behind bars and would never negotiate with the government. “It’s disheartening,” Goicoechea admitted later. “You would expect that if you are a political prisoner and you are released you would get some recognition.” Goicoechea believes it makes no sense to surrender control of districts like El Hatillo where opposition candidates have won recent elections. “If we give up the little political space that we still have it will only make the Maduro government stronger,” he said. “I know that these are not democratic elections. But this is what we can do. And we need to get stronger if we want to change the situation in the country.” A handful of opposition leaders are still holding talks with the Maduro government in the Dominican Republic, discussing the release of hundreds of political prisoners and ways to ensure equal conditions for next year’s presidential election. But so far there has been little progress. The presidential election must take place by the end of 2018, but there is growing speculation that Maduro – who will probably run for another six-year term – will move up the polling to the first half of next year to take advantage of opposition disarray. Should that happen and the opposition decides to take on Maduro, its leaders will have to backtrack on boycotting and start mobilising the masses. The mixed message “produces a lot of confusion”, said Javier Corrales, a Venezuela expert at Amherst College. “It creates a defeatist mentality. People say: ‘The hell with it.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/06/adani-coalmine-wont-be-funded-by-chinese-banks-embassy-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T21:27:45Z","webTitle":"Future of Adani coalmine hanging by a thread after Chinese banks back out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/06/adani-coalmine-wont-be-funded-by-chinese-banks-embassy-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/06/adani-coalmine-wont-be-funded-by-chinese-banks-embassy-says","fields":{"headline":"Future of Adani coalmine hanging by a thread after Chinese banks back out","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Adani’s Carmichael coalmine project will not be funded by Chinese banks, the Chinese embassy has said, in a move some see as dooming the project, and potentially Adani’s operations in Australia. Bob Carr, the former New South Wales premier and former foreign minister, told the Guardian he had been lobbying Chinese businesses and government for three weeks before receiving confirmation from the Chinese embassy in Australia that no Chinese bank would be financing the controversial project. Carr, who is also the director of the Australia China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney, said the move could be the end for the Carmichael project, a view which was backed up by financial activists and analysts who have been working on the issue. After all of Australia’s big banks ruled out funding Carmichael coalmine, which would be the biggest built in Australia, the Indian mining giant said it was “advanced” in its financing from international banks. China was widely understood to be the source of that financing. In October it was revealed that two Australian ministers had written to the Chinese government, apparently at the request of Adani, to confirm that the project had met all its environmental approvals. And in November it was revealed Adani was working with Chinese-state-owned enterprise China Machinery Engineering Corporation. But since Saturday, three Chinese banks have ruled out financing the project, and overnight it was revealed the Chinese embassy had confirmed no Chinese bank would do so. “It couldn’t have been more emphatic,” said Carr, who was enlisted to help with the lobbying by the Australian Conservation Foundation. He said he had received the confirmation from the embassy, and the ACF also reported being told the same. ACF said the embassy’s reason was “due to the absence of commercial feasibility”. Carr said the banks and other institutions he had discussions with were “keenly interested and informed”. “I underlined to them the controversial nature of the project,” Carr said, adding that he thought it could mean the end of Adani’s Carmichael coalmine. Julien Vincent, from the financial activist group Market Forces, said Chinese funding was Adani’s “last credible hope”. “And it’s gone,” Vincent said. “They’ve lost that chance. It’s essentially run out of credible options for funding.” He said any other possible funding sources would be further threatened by the string of statements from the world’s biggest coal-funding banks, now including three in China, that have ruled out funding the project. Vincent said without the Carmichael mine going ahead, refinancing for Adani’s Abbot Point coal terminal, due in the coming months, could also be in trouble, since it was not being fully utilised without coal from the proposed Carmichael mine. A report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis revealed that Adani needed to refinance more than $2bn worth of loans for the coal terminal in the coming year – an amount that is more than it paid for the port in 2011."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2017/dec/06/citizenship-saga-sparks-war-between-government-and-labor-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T07:33:42Z","webTitle":"David Feeney to be referred to high court but motion to refer nine MPs fails – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/dec/06/citizenship-saga-sparks-war-between-government-and-labor-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2017/dec/06/citizenship-saga-sparks-war-between-government-and-labor-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"David Feeney to be referred to high court but motion to refer nine MPs fails – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Breaking: Christopher Pyne has just confirmed the Coalition will not seek to refer any further members to the high court this year – as long as no one on the crossbench changes their mind. He says tomorrow will be set aside to deal with marriage equality. “Over the summer break, the high court will rule on the status of Katy Gallagher and that will give more clarity to the status of those other members.” So there you have it. And we might leave it there, because – phew! What a day. We end it with two referrals to the high court, with Katy Gallagher opening our day with one and David Feeney turning it into a book mark. Labor has backed off any suggestion it would seek to refer Josh Frydenberg or Arthur Sinodinos, one for a family history that includes fleeing the Holocaust and the other out of respect for his cancer battle. The next move in this referral chess game is the government’s. Logic would suggest it will seek to refer no one tomorrow, given the difficulty with numbers. Plus, it has to get the marriage equality legislation passed. No one wants to come back here for extra sittings. Especially not me. That would mean that Katy Gallagher becomes the test case. So we could wait and see what the high court decides in terms of reasonable steps. Because if the high court rules that Gallagher took all the reasonable steps before the nomination, despite not having the confirmation until after the nomination debate, then Susan Lamb, Josh Wilson and Justine Keay are fine. If Gallagher is ruled ineligible, then the others just resign. Feeney though, is a different case. If he can’t prove he renounced properly, Batman will head to a byelection. Kristina Keneally time, once known as question time, certainly heated up over the citizenship issue, with the prime minister ending it after talking about gas chambers. The festive spirit has not managed to seep into this building, obviously. But we might see it end on a positive note. The government has vowed to have marriage equality passed by the end of the year. There are still about 40 or so speakers on the list. But Peter Dutton all but confirmed today the amendments Tony Abbott wanted to put forward did not have the numbers. He seems happy to let the Philip Ruddock review into religious freedoms sought out any future changes. I’ll be back bright and early tomorrow morning but a big thank you to my partner-in-crime, Mike Bowers. Go check out his day here and here. Thank you also to the Guardian Australia team and to everyone for following along for these very loooong hours. You do make it easier. Have a wonderful night. Oh – for those wondering about the Speaker’s casting vote, you can find more information here: The thing about those individual referrals though is the crossbench has just shown that it doesn’t think there should be individual referrals. Because that vote, 73-73, will be the result every time if the government attempts to force a referral. Unless it can convince one of the crossbenchers to switch sides, because, as Tony Smith has just pointed out and Tony Burke seconded, the precedent for the Speaker’s casting vote is not to create a majority. David Feeney’s case is referred to the high court but he remains in parliament. We should go back to marriage equality now. Which means tomorrow will not only have the remaining marriage equality speakers, the amendment debate (which should fail) and then the vote, we might also see the government attempt to individually refer MPs it believes there are questions over. ie: the Labor MPs. Won’t tomorrow be fun! Tony Burke makes it clear “before Twitter goes off” that Smith’s vote was consistent with every precedent. Basically, he is attempting to head off the criticism that Smith sided with the government for partisan lines. Which is nice. Burke now moves to refer David Feeney to the high court. Tony Smith gives his casting vote to the “no”s, which he says is in accordance with the standing orders. So no referrals. The result is in Ayes - 73 Noes - 73 While we wait on the count, here is some Mike Bowers magic: The five crossbenchers have lined up with Labor. This is going to be a tie. NXT MP Rebekha Sharkie says she asked her name to be put on the motion and asks the parliament to get its act together. She only takes a few minutes, but makes her point clear. You can feel her frustration that it has come to this. “We will hang individually if we don’t hang together,” she says. At this point, I think it might be a little from column A and a little from column B Barnaby Joyce is looking so pleased to be back right now. Wilkie says if the government doesn’t support this, it points to a “hatchet job by the government on the opposition”. “Frankly the only way to end this, the only way, is every member of this House with a legitimate concern over their eligibility to sit in the parliament must be referred.” He says the high court is the only way to decide this issue. He said the fact that both sides of the parliament had spent so much time lobbying the crossbench to support their side of the motion, putting up the different arguments over why there were questions over certain MP proved their was uncertainty over the eligibility of some members. It is not our job to understand foreign law. We don’t have the competency. Andrew Wilkie is speaking in support of the motion. He says that many Australians have “had a gutful of politicians, they have had a gutful of politics”. We have become the laughing stock of this country Katter says he “just wants this to stop.” Every Australian wants this to stop” Another T-shirt contender. Bob Katter now has the floor. He said he spent six weeks walking the streets and listening to people to see what they were saying. “And it wasn’t pleasant and it wasn’t edifying.” Adam Bandt says the government hadn’t adequately answered all the questions regarding its members eligibility. The test is, in large part, what would the public think is a fair thing to do when there is a legitimate question make over someone. So I would urge the two sides to start having a conversation with each other and, in that conversation, put yourself in the public shoes ... and say what would the public say where there are legitimate question marks? “We think there should be an agreed set of names that goes forward from this house ... we will not support picking off people one by one, because the position that would mean at the moment, is that no government member no matter how serious the question would ever get referred,” Bandt says. He says if the government has concerns over the names on the list, he is open to hearing their arguments. Bandt says it is not the role of the parliament to stand in the way of referrals where there are legitimate questions. He also says the issue can not be partisan and it is wrong for the government to use its numbers to refer opposition members, given the precedent it would set for the future. Adam Bandt says he would rather be debating marriage equality, but this issue needs to be addressed. “The noise from nuff nuff corner is just getting a bit much,” he says as government MPs interject. “The leader of the opposition sees everything through the prism of politics,” Pyne says. “He can never see anything through the prism of principle.” Pyne says it is unfortunate that Labor “has managed to create enough dust” to get the crossbench to support the motion, as the Liberal MPs involved, he believes have no reason to be referred. He says it is “intellectually offensive” to refer the Liberal MPs and “implores” the crossbench to reconsider. Christopher Pyne is next. “I rise more in sorrow than in anger for this particular motion,” Pyne begins [because Labor is playing politics here]. “We invite you to join us in this resolution, the Australian people will say it makes sense,” he says. Bill Shorten quotes Jason Falinski’s legal advice, which recommends he seek advice from a foreign law expert and says it cannot be used to determine constitutional eligibility. “What we are proposing is one rule for all,” Shorten says. “We have an obligation to restore confidence in this parliament.” Shorten says the government is “setting two standards” with its refusal to support the motion: that it can refer opposition MPs, but it will decide which government MPs will be referred. Now Bill Shorten is up. He says that he understands “Australians are fundamentally disenchanted” with the parliament and the citizenship issue. “We are moving this resolution because Australians are fed up with the parliament.” Malcolm Turnbull says Labor is doing this for “no reason other than political advantage” and each referral should be dealt with individually. “This motion debases the House, and if Labor wants to debate this, we are happy to do so, we should debate them one at a time and we should debate them on Thursday after we have dealt with marriage equality” Malcolm Turnbull returns to the floor to argue against the motion. He says it is only being put forward by Labor to distract from their members who were still dual-citizens at the time of their nomination. Turnbull says if David Feeney can’t find his paperwork, he should resign from parliament, as John Alexander did. He then reads from the statement from the Hellenic Republic in regards to Alex Hawke and says it would be an embarrassment for the parliament to refer him to the high court, as the foreign government had “stated the member concerned is not a citizen”. Turnbull says Labor “bullied” the crossbench into supporting the motion. Either we support this resolution, or the cloud which is currently over this parliament will continue to be there.” Tony Burke says in regards to the Liberal MPs Labor wants to refer, there are issues that cannot be explained away by letters from the embassy (he is talking about Nola Marino) because, as he points out, if you had gone to the New Zealand embassy and asked if Barnaby Joyce was on the electoral roll, they would have said no. He also says that when it comes to Greek heritage, the advice Labor has received is its candidates have to renounce any claim to Greek citizenship, pointing out that some of its members renounce it again and again before each election, just in case (Greece doesn’t usually respond). Burke says if the vote does not go through with full support, it will be the first time this issue has been voted on, on partisan lines. He says the referral includes Rebekha Sharkie, at her request, even though Labor doesn’t agree with the reasons the government has set out for her referrals (she sent her documents in before the nomination date, but like some Labor MPs, did not receive the confirmation until after the nomination date). Sharkie nods along as Burke says this. Burke says if the government doesn’t support the referral, then the issue won’t go away. Burke says the timing of the renunciation process has taken months in the case of some MPs and a matter of days for others (he is talking about Coalition MPs who managed to have it done in a very short amount of time, once it became an issue for their election eligibility). But he says while there was nothing more those members could do, it is for the high court to decide whether or not that was a reasonable step. Tony Burke is moving Labor’s motion to refer MPs to the high court. That includes Labor MPs, as well as the crossbench and Liberal MPs. He says the only one which can be considered a self-referral is David Feeney who has asked to have his case referred to the high court. Brian Mitchell has just apologised for calling an ABC journalist “a maggot” earlier today. Today has gone places. And in the Senate: The crossbench sure was popular during question time today. Jason Falinski’s advice is dated 6 December 2017 because he had received draft advice before the 5 December deadline and this version is the final, settled advice. Falinski told Guardian Australia the settled advice was “not materially different” in its conclusion, but was updated to remove requests for records. Draft advice is not going to be released. Just updating from a previous post: the full Scott Morrison quote on “shifty” Bill Shorten was: “This bloke is shifty as, ‘Shifty Shorten’ is totally shifty.” Anyone who watches Rick and Morty may understand why I have ‘get swifty’ stuck in my head now. Just on Jason Falinski’s legal advice, it says that while Arnold Bloch Leibler believes he does not have any citizenship problems, it also adds “we cannot conclusively advise on foreign law and recommend that you seek independent advice from foreign law experts to confirm our views set out in this process”. And another update: Looks like that advice is slowly dripping out now, after it was missing from the disclosure records. We have had Nola Marino release further documents, and now Jason Falinski. This has come after Labor and the crossbench moved to refer MPs with question marks: Scenes from question time, as captured by the magical Mike Bowers. In the Senate, George Brandis tabled a document that says Arthur Sinodinos was never Greek, because he didn’t register his Greek citizenship. Penny Wong says Labor’s advice for its Greek-Australian candidates is they have to renounce as they are Greek from birth. So it continues. However, Labor has said it will not seek to refer Sinodinos (for now) because of his health condition. So. That went places. Just six Kristina Keneally references today. And gas chambers. Question time ends on this note: Josh Frydenberg takes a dixer about power prices in New South Wales, for which the answer is Kristina Keneally and Sam Dastyari. Tony Smith interrupts to say the answer needs to be relevant. Michelle Rowland to Malcolm Turnbull: “Yesterday the prime minister tried to deny he had promised that every Australian would have access to minimum speeds over the NBN by the end of 2016. Does the prime minister also deny he promised to deliver the NBN for a cost of $29.5bn, or is his recollection as unreliable as the HFC network?” Turnbull: “That is a very tough one, Mr Speaker. It is a very tough one. Another blow from the opposition. Right, Mr Speaker, let’s say it again. The NBN was a complete train wreck under Labor. Six years, six years, 50,000 activations. Oh, what a great effort. Do you know how many the NBN does now? It does more than that every two weeks. There is ... over 3.25 million premises that have got the service. The reality is this: Labor’s approach was a catastrophe. Tens of billions of dollars were wasted and can never be recovered. To fulfil Labor’s plan would have taken six to eight years longer and $30bn more. The approach we are taking is getting the job done. The project will be completed. The company assures it’s by 2020. We are getting on with the job and getting it done. Done. We inherited a train wreck from Labor and we are fixing it and delivering it. Labor cannot manage anything. They cannot manage the construction of a broadband network any more than the leader of the opposition can manage his fantastic vetting process.” Peter Dutton takes a dixer on border security, as is normal, but he finishes with this intriguing line, while criticising Labor siding with the Greens to accept New Zealand’s refugee offer: What he doesn’t realise is one of the motions, which we are going to speak about over the course of the coming days, one of the positions that he supported actually goes against a recommendation made out of the inquiry into Man Monis out of the terrible siege in Martin Place. I don’t think he realises that yet. You have sided with the Greens and you don’t understand what you have done. I will give you this assurance. I am going to explain the detail to you in coming days.” Meanwhile, on the crossbench Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull: “Last night on 7.30 families of delivery drivers told stories of demands that Tip Top made on their drivers. One driver said after he returned to work after having a lung removed. He called in sick but was told he was under contract. He gave up work all together after driving as long as he could and died later that year. Why didn’t the government put something in place to ensure safe and fair conditions for contract drivers?” Turnbull: “The road safety remuneration tribunal, so-called, set up at the behest of the Transport Workers Union, put 50,000 owner drivers off the road. 50,000 owner drivers off the road. Very cosy for the big union and big trucking companies. That is – it was absolutely true. It is absolutely true ... “We are committed to safer roads and we are committed to backing safe trucking, safety for family businesses for truckers, whether they are working for themselves or for big companies. We are putting the resources in to back that. Labor set out to put 50,000 families out of business and had it not been for the Senate voting to abolish that tribunal, those families would be out of work and on the bread line. “That is Labor’s approach to enterprise and hardworking Australian families. The alternative is what we do, which is to put more money into the pockets of hardworking Australian families backing investment, backing jobs, backing enterprise. Labor hates that because, as he said ... he thinks a class war is just the ticket. Well, it is the ticket to disaster.” The Chinese embassy has released this statement: Over the recent period, some Australian media have repeatedly fabricated news stories about the so-called Chinese influence and infiltration in Australia. “Those reports, which were made up out of thin air and filled with cold war mentality and ideological bias, reflected a typical anti-China hysteria and paranoid. The relevant reports not only made unjustifiable accusations against the Chinese government, but also unscrupulously vilified the Chinese students as well as the Chinese community in Australia with racial prejudice, which in turn has tarnished Australia’s reputation as a multicultural society. Some Australian politicians and government officials also made irresponsible remarks to the detriment of political mutual trust between China and Australia. We categorically reject those allegations. “China has been committed to developing its friendly relations with other countries on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, which is one of the main principles of Chinese foreign policy. China has no intention to interfere in Australia’s internal affairs or exert influence on its political process through political donations. We urge the Australian side to look at China and China-Australia relations in an objective, fair and rational manner.” Scott Morrison take a dixer and we get our first Kristina Keneally mention this question time. Ahhhh, how short political memories are. Here is what Barnaby Joyce had to say about members remaining in the House and voting, despite having questions over their eligibility: The only excuse they say is they haven’t got their paperwork back. How does that work? Do you drive on a highway without a licence because you believe it is in the mail? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. Yet, these people will continue to vote. They will continue to vote. I can tell you one good thing - the people of New England gave you a vote. 11% is what they gave you!” So that is a thing that happened. Chris Bowen has a question for Scott Morrison: “In the last two years, the treasurer wasn’t told that the date the Budget had changed. Wasn’t told about the plan for state income taxes. Booked a Press Club speech to argue for a GST increase only to have the Prime Minister abandon the idea. Was kept in the dark about the royal commission terms of reference, despite the Minister for Revenue working on them for a long time. Why is the Treasurer always out of the Loop? Is it because he’s also always out of his depth?” Morrison: “Taking lessons from the Shadow Treasurer on the economy - you got a problem with that? Taking lessons from the Shadow Treasurer on the economy is like getting driving lessons from a drunk driver. This muppet of a Shadow Treasurer, this muppet seriously was the one presiding over jobs growth as a Treasurer which was barley a quarter. Speaking of muppets...” He is interrupted with a point of order, but Tony Smith says he didn’t hear the term in question. That would be ‘muppet’. Morrison then moves on to Sam Dastyari. So at least we are back on familiar ground. Adam Bandt has the crossbench question today. He delivers it to Josh Frydenberg: At recent climate negotiations I attended...it was reaffirmed that current commitments are not enough to meet the Paris agreement goal of staying well below 2 degrees of warming. In fact, Australia’s existing paltry 2030 target will contribute to over 3 degrees of warning. Even worse Australia as pollution is going up and up and up. Minister, last year, you started a climate change policy review to be completed by the end of this year. Will you release the results of this review before the end of the year? Will the new policy increase our pollution reduction commitments to help meet the Paris 2-degree goal or under your government will we remain op track for over 3 degrees of warming? The short version of Frydenberg’s answer is: “...it will be released in due course. But the point is this: that we have taken steps to reduce our emissions and that is occurring, particularly in the electricity sector in the land sector, through energy productivity in the built environment. We are taking steps to reduce power prices and create a more stable system. But what we will not do, which the Greens and the Labor Party will do, is sell out the workers of Australia.” Tanya Plibersek to Malcolm Turnbull: “Can the prime minister confirm that he said about citizenship disclosures: ‘I want everyone to make full disclosures of all of the relevant material and I am determined that Australians see there is full transparency.’ “If a government member has acknowledged the existence of documentation in their citizenship statement but kept copies secret, will the prime minister refer them to the high court?” Turnbull: “What Labor is now seeking to do is to debase this house by not only covering up people they know should go to the high court but wanting to refer people to the high court who are not dual citizens and they have no basis for claiming that they are. It is tit for tat that time is no substitute for justice. “The member for Batman should go to the high court and see how he goes. The other members should go to the high court and make their argument. We wish them all the best of luck. It is an uncertain environment down there, believe me. There it is. The high court makes the decisions and they should be allowed to do so.” Barnaby Joyce gets a dixer. He talks about the New England byelection and dual citizenship and goes various shades of vermillion. Just like old times. Tony Burke comes on after a dixer to the prime minister. “My question is to the prime minister. On 9 November the leader of the house was asked by David Speers: ‘You are saying if your parents are born overseas and you don’t have a document renouncing citizenship you are off to the high court.’ “The leader of the house said: ‘That would be the assumption because that is what the process says.’ “If they have acknowledged such documents and he is keeping them secret will the prime minister refer them to the high court?” Malcolm Turnbull: “What the Labor party is seeking to do here is distract attention from the fact that they have on their side members who are plainly at very high risk, I would say, of being found to be ineligible by the high court. Well, Mr Speaker, I am not making any more predictions.” For that he receives applause. He continues: “I am down to a 50% ratio. I don’t want my strike rate to go any lower, although I was speaking to one of the colleagues here on the crossbench who advised me that his strike rate was zero. I said, ‘Go for your life. It can only get better.’ “Mr Speaker, seriously, we have a position where we have Senator Gallagher referred by Labor to the high court because she was a UK citizen at the time she nominated. Fair enough? She will make an argument that filing the renunciation paper was enough. “The high court will consider that. It is clearly a matter for the court. It is only the high court that can determine that matter and it is plainly in the public interest that it be determined. This area of the law needs more certainty, needs more clarity and members who are in her position should go to the high court for precisely the same reason. “If the member for Batman is, as appears to be unless he can find some paperwork to the contrary, is in fact a dual citizen right now, he shouldn’t be sitting here today. I mean, Mr Speaker, because he knows that following the high court’s ruling, following the rejection of the arguments the government made to take a more lenient approach, it is a very black-letter law approach to this section and the fact is that what Labor now wants to do is to create some sense of political equity or balance by referring members on the Coalition who are not dual citizens to the high court. “Well, I say to the leader of the opposition, if he believes any of our members are dual citizens, put up or shut up! Put up or shut up! Actually state the case. Actually state the case. He’s no evidence, no basis to make those claims. This is simply a distraction from his hopeless failure on leadership and of course it is not just dual citizens he’s been covering up for and trying to bamboozle the media, talking about his great vetting procedures, it is also of course a senator who has much more than a dual citizenship issue at stake. It is Senator Dastyari. “There the issue is one of loyalty. Who is the leader of the opposition loyal to? Is he loyal to Australia and our national interest or is he loyal to the man who runs the faction who put him in his job?” Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull: “The Australian people are sick of this constitutional crisis. The only way to resolve this citizenship crisis is with the cooperation of all sides of parliament, so will the prime minister work with the entire parliament, including Labor and the crossbench, to reach agreement on who should be referred to the high court?” Shorten has to start the question again, as the gaffaws from the government side of the chamber are so loud. Turnbull: “He said that the Labor party has got very strict vetting processes. ‘We have a strict vetting process,’ he said. ‘There’s no cloud over any of our people.’ None! Let’s be straight here. I assume that included all of the British citizens? No cloud over there? No cloud over there? He said the Labor party candidates have got extremely stringent vetting process and that is why this hasn’t happened. ‘I am not going to jump every time some Liberals get up with a complaint,’ he said. ‘It is a matter of fact we have a good vetting procedure.’ “Mr Speaker, again and again and again. It seemed to overlook the member for Batman, didn’t it? He lost his papers. Did the dog eat them? Did he leave them in the house he overlooked? If you can overlook a house, you can presumably overlook a few papers. “Mr Speaker, this is where we have the leader of the opposition now, twisting and turning in his own incompetence and dishonesty. He has a number of members who we all know, knew they were and were UK citizens at the time they nominated. That is a fact. He also has a senator, Senator Gallagher, in exactly the same position. She has been referred by Senator Wong in the Senate to the high court. But he doesn’t want to refer the people who are in exactly the same position here.” Turnbull goes on to mention that the difference between Labor and the Coalition is that Barnaby Joyce and John Alexander referred themselves when they learnt they had a problem. Both only happened after the media made their status clear. NXT MP Rebekha Sharkie, who is one of the nine who would be referred to the high court under the Labor crossbench motion, had this to say on the possibility the government could block the move: “If they don’t refer their own then this will drag on for months and months. We want clarity, fairness and an end to all this.” Malcolm Turnbull, Bill Shorten and now the member for Higgins, Kelly O’Dwyer, have honoured the first member for Higgins, Harold Holt. To recap the citizenship motion which occurred just before question time, Labor and the crossbench (all five of them) voted to hold a vote on referring nine MPs, which included members of Labor, Liberal and the crossbench who have questions. But the standing orders moved on to 90-second members’ statements, which could not be stopped. The vote will now be held after question time, and with Barnaby Joyce’s return, the numbers will be tied. It means that the government will have to vote against referring Labor MPs it says have problems, to save its own from referral. It also means Labor and the crossbench will have wedged the government into voting against the will of the parliament. The politics of this will continue to play out for sometime. Everyone clear now? Before we get to question time, the parliament is honouring Harold Holt. Next week marks the 50th anniversary of the death of the 17th prime minister of Australia. Adam Bandt says Australia “effectively has a hung parliament” and that may continue even when Barnaby Joyce returns. Bandt says the crossbench is of the view that referrals should be done “in an even-handed way” and not through “partisan warfare”. “The opposition has proposed referring its own members in addition to government members over who there is a question mark ... The crossbench don’t want to see this done in a partisan way. We want those with legitimate questions answered in the high court.” Bandt said debate wasn’t able to occur before QT but hopes it will after, and warns the government to reflect on the vote and the signal the crossbench has sent. Speaker Tony Smith reads the writ and says that Barnaby Thomas Joyce has been elected. He is admitted to the parliament to the cheers and a standing ovation from the government side of the chamber, the prime minister by his side. It is almost question time. And given the day’s events so far, it should be a doozy. Anyone prepared to make any predictions on what Kristina Keneally will be blamed for today? That feeling when you have to delay the debate, so you have it on Twitter A little bit more from Di Natale: Richard Di Natale has accused Malcolm Turnbull of a “disgraceful act of partisanship” for attempting to refer Labor MPs but not government MPs to the high court. “On the basis of that – clearly the cross bench has been discussing [a motion] ... It is astonishing, disgraceful, remarkable that rather than seeking to resolve the situation the prime minister is attempting to save his job.” Di Natale says a stalemate has developed and calls on the PM to support the referrals. We are being told that the crossbench went to the prime minister this morning and asked what was happening, but weren’t happy with the outcome of the meeting. So the crossbench agreed with the motion to have the vote. But then the house moved into members’ statements. Which means they can’t have the actual vote until after question time. When Barnaby Joyce will be back in the house. The government is now in a position where it will have to vote down referring Labor MPs, as the motion includes some of their own. On the numbers, the vote after question time will be a draw. So, what appears to be happening is Labor has been chatting to the crossbench, saying nine MPs should be referred. That would be the four Labor MPs in question, as well as Rebekha Sharkie and then gthe Liberals Nola Marino, Alex Hawke Julia Banks and Jason Falinski. But they need the numbers. Which means they have to do it before Barnaby Joyce gets back to parliament. Start your engines. Down in the House of Representatives, Tony Burke, the manager of opposition business, says he is about to move a resolution to refer various people to the high court. Just for folks watching on at home, Barnaby Joyce has been sworn in and is on his way back to parliament. Stopping to speak to reporters at Government House, Joyce thanks the people of New England for sending him back to the circus. Then he hops into Bill Shorten and Labor. I am disgusted with the Australian Labor party. I am disgusted with a party that would refuse my capacity to speak in the parliament, while at the same time they obviously were fully aware of people within their own side who were in exactly the same predicament. I am disgusted ... Mark Dreyfus again lists the Turnbull government MPs Labor believes to have problems: Jason Falinski, Nola Marino, Julia Banks, Alex Hawke, Michael McCormack, and Josh Frydenberg. He says he sympathises with Frydenberg’s family situation, and mentions his own similar family history, from the German side, but says it is a matter of foreign law. Bill Shorten says he is not calling for the immediate referral of these people, but Labor does want to see further documents proving their eligibility. Shorten also says, on David Feeney’s situation that he is “deeply frustrated” that one of his MPs is missing their documents, and as for the ‘rolled gold’ comment he made about Labor’s processes a few weeks ago, he said in hindsight, he would use other words. But he says Labor’s processes have been thorough. “I say to Malcolm, if you have got nothing to hide, what are you worried about.” A very chipper Scott Morrison has released the world’s longest statement on the national accounts: “Today’s national accounts is another encouraging set of numbers, reinforcing an economic strategy that is based on driving growth through increased investment to secure the better days ahead. “This has been the heart of the Turnbull government’s growth strategy to support jobs, by driving investment that in the September quarter created more than 100,000 jobs. That’s more than 1,000 jobs every day. “So far this year we have experienced the strongest jobs growth in 40 years, with four out of five jobs being full time. The solid 0.6% growth outcome in the September quarter national accounts has accelerated growth from 1.9% to 2.8% through the year. “This is above the OECD average and puts Australia back up towards the top of the pack of major advanced economies. “As you can see from the contributions to growth in the quarter, our growth story is primarily an investment story. “In the context of an expected soft result on household consumption, most likely impacted by concerns over cost of living pressures, and an anticipated negative result in dwellings investment, the engine of our economy has been driven by investment from both the private and public sectors. “For private investment the contribution to our growth more than tripled in the quarter. “The Turnbull government’s national economic plan has been targeted to move the dial on investment, by encouraging businesses to grow, innovate, hire more Australians, and increase wages. “Everything we do as a government is aimed at driving investment because we understand it is business that boosts growth, creates jobs and pays higher wages. “And we are seeing the fruits of that action. “In the private economy, which includes household consumption, business investment and dwelling investment, annual growth has lifted from 0.4% to 2.8% in the past two years under the Turnbull government. “Looking specifically at investment, new private business investment is now growing at the strongest rate since the peak of the mining investment boom in 2012, expanding by 2% in the quarter and 7.5% through the year, to eclipse the 20-year average. “We have now seen four consecutive quarters of investment growth, following 12 consecutive quarters of decline. “Investment in new machinery and equipment has lifted from a through-the-year decline of around 11% two years ago, to a positive growth rate of just shy of 3% today. “In the past two years, the Turnbull government has been turning our investment ship around. We are now heading in the right direction, by making the right choices, to set the right conditions to encourage investment in our economy. “Business conditions, as surveyed, are at their highest level in 20 years. Last week’s capital expenditure survey showed expectations for non-mining investment in 2017-18 improving strongly to be around 7% higher. Non-mining firms are expected to invest $80.9bn this financial year. “Our enterprise tax plan is a key part of this, which is why it must be supported. But so too are our many other plans, our positive trade agenda, our support for innovation and new start-up businesses, our investment in our defence industries to support new manufacturing jobs and our investment in important public economic infrastructure. “As noted by the RBA, one of the reasons why businesses have been encouraged to go out and invest is because of the record infrastructure investment that is under way across the country. “New public final demand, across all levels of government, was up a solid 1.2% in the quarter, to be 4.4% higher through the year. “This growth was driven not by increases in the size and cost of running government, which actually fell at a commonwealth level during the quarter, but by government investment in building the capacity of our economy and our defence forces. “New public investment was up 12.6% over the year, with defence investment up 31% over the year. “This is in line with the government’s record $75bn investment in economic infrastructure, two-thirds of which will be provided to the states for spending on their roads, railways, water and other projects. “Turning to households, consumption increased by just 0.1% in the quarter, to be 2.2% higher than a year ago, coming off a strong quarter of growth in June. Household consumption contributed just 0.1 percentage points to growth in September. “However, through the year it contributed 1.3 percentage points to annual growth, highlighting the softness of the results in September. “This is not a surprising result, given the cost of living pressures on essentials that Australians are feeling. “Tellingly, the result shows households were cutting back on discretionary items, while we saw growth in everyday essentials like electricity, food and transport. “Clearly many Australians were concerned about the cost of living and the pressures on their household budget, which reaffirms why it was important that our budget guaranteed essential services like Medicare and schools funding, while working to put downward pressure on rents, childcare and electricity prices, and provide income tax relief wherever and whenever possible. “Concerns around electricity prices were at front of mind in the September quarter. We saw large retail price increases coming into effect on 1 July. “In response the Turnbull government has taken action. “We got a better deal from energy retailers which saw some customers given a 20% reduction in their bills and we created the national energy guarantee, with modelling by the energy security board showing a saving of $400 per year for the average household compared to today’s prices. “More recently we have seen some better data on retail sales, which grew by 0.5% in the month of October after lacklustre results during the September quarter. We also have seen improved measures of consumer confidence, which have recovered after falling to low levels during the September quarter. Let’s not forget households will also be out there this holiday season. “Our exports continue to go from strength to strength. “Mining exports have seen a recovery from the impact of tropical cyclone Debbie. Service exports rose almost 10% over the year on the back of strong education and tourism exports. “But it is the agriculture sector where we have seen the most impressive growth, with record crops underpinning export growth of more than 20% through the year. “This is tremendous news for our regional towns and a welcome reward for years of hard work and readjustment following periods of drought. It is also a resounding vote of confidence in the Turnbull government’s trade agenda that is a key component of our national economic plan. “This rural growth story has been particularly bolstered by strong chickpea exports to India, strong citrus exports to China and strength in our meat exports. “After taking account of imports, net exports recorded a flat contribution to growth in the quarter. Imports grew by 1.9% in the quarter – driven by capital imports which rose 6.6% and reflects the pick-up in business investment. “Looking at today’s results by sector shows it was broad-based with 17 of the 20 industries posting growth this quarter. The services sector – our largest employer – contributed 0.3 percentage points in the quarter and 2.1 percentage points over the year. “Turning to the income side, pleasingly, compensation of employees, what is paid out in wages and salaries, rose 1.2% in the quarter and 3% cent through the year. “This is an encouraging improvement driven by the welcome increase in employment – as I said over 100,000 jobs created in the September quarter _ more than a 1,000 jobs a day. “As the labour market continues to strengthen, wages will improve and as noted by governor Lowe there have already been encouraging signs of this in high demand sectors. But there must also be a sustained improvement in profits and productivity. “Profits, or the gross operating surplus, rose 1.2% in the quarter, with through the year growth moderating to 16.7% from a previous surge linked to commodity prices, as I flagged earlier this year when I spoke to the December quarter accounts. “It is an encouraging sign that profits are starting to improve in non-mining sectors. Improved profitability is in line with the record business conditions seen in recent survey measures and is the prerequisite for increased investment, that is now flowing. “Once again, it’s clear from today’s national accounts that our economy is strengthening. The better days ahead are emerging. “They will continue to strengthen with the right policy settings in place. “That’s why we continue to implement our national economic plan, driving growth policies based on the economics of opportunity, rather than indulging the cynical politics of envy and the $164bn in higher taxes that would come with it and choke our economy as it is getting back in gear. “The Turnbull government is getting on with the job. *end statement* As for how Bill Shorten believes the referrals should happen: “I have said on a number of occasions in the last month, that once the disclosures are in, the Parliament needs to adopt a joint approach. “The concern that I now have when I see the disclosures, only one side of the Parliament has played by the rules. “Labor has conscientiously put forward its arguments, its propositions, why we are eligible. “You could drive a Mac truck through some of the inadequate disclosures of the Liberals. “Now, my view about the referral to the high court, because there are legal questions on a range of MPs, but why does one side of politics get a leave pass from full transparency by using their numbers in the Parliament? “Let me be very clear - and through you to the Australian people - Labor is absolutely prepared to reassert the confidence of the Australian people in the eligibility of the parliamentarians to sit in the Parliament, but that rule doesn’t just apply to Labor. “We all know that Malcolm was dragged kicking and screaming to universal disclosure. He didn’t want to do it and now he want toes use his numbers to apply a higher standard to Labor.” Bill Shorten on David Feeney: “I want to briefly turn to the member for Batman. Just over a week ago he contacted me and informed me that in the process of preparing for the disclosure, some documents that he thought he had in his possession, he didn’t. “He advised me he was undertaking searches in both Australia and the UK for some of these documents. I informed him that he needed to do this search and furthermore I informed him that he needed to tell the parliament what was happening and I made it clear to him that there was a deadline of disclosure and even if the searches are still under way, as they are, that if at the time of the referral discussion he couldn’t provide all of the documents, then he would need to be referred to the high court for a decision of his eligibility to serve in this parliament.” Bill Shorten: “Labor MPs, nearly 100 of them, have conscientiously filled in a disclosure form and demonstrated why they believe that they are eligible under the constitution to be able to take the privileged position of sitting in the parliament of Australia. “But, as we have seen the disclosures emerge in the House of Representatives from the Liberal party, we now see that Malcolm Turnbull is engaging in mass cover-up. “They are engaging in a mass cover-up. There are many inadequate disclosures that ask more questions than provide answers. I say to Mr Turnbull today. This is not about you or me or Liberal or Labor. “It is now about the government and the parliament of Australia. It is time to stop hiding. It is time to stop the mass cover-up. We believe that all MPs should demonstrate that they are eligible under the constitution and what reasonable steps have they taken to renounce any foreign citizenship. “Sadly, we cannot end this circus until Mr Turnbull and his MPs actually submit to full disclosure. “We want the circus to end. Labor is up for that. We recognise that these are very unusual times and the very credibility of parliament is under question, not just the government, but we call upon Mr Turnbull to stop hiding half-filled disclosures and inadequate explanations.” Just to recap ahead of Bill Shorten’s press conference: Katy Gallagher has asked the Senate to refer her case to the high court, but says she is confident she was eligible to be elected and took all reasonable steps. On Tuesday, David Feeney said he could not find the renunciation documents he believed had been sent to the UK authorities in October 2007 and said he would ask the house to refer him if they could not be found. The government is threatening to refer Josh Wilson, Susan Lamb and Justine Keay if Labor doesn’t and says Bill Shorten has been a hypocrite on the citizenship issue. Bill Shorten’s office had the citizenship documents for a week, which potentially means Shorten knew about David Feeney for a week. Labor is calling on the government MPs who did not provide their paperwork to submit proof they are eligible. Bill Shorten has just announced he will be holding a press conference with Mark Dreyfus in the next 10 minutes. Will we be seeing some more referrals? Scott Morrison on Labor’s response to the citizenship issues: Shifty Shorten is shifty.” The T-shirt contenders have come thick and fast these past few days! The Labor MP Michael Danby has spoken to the Australian Jewish News about Josh Frydenberg: “My view is the Dreyfus approach is just political tactics and not cognisant of the wider political, historical and ethical issues,” Danby said. “I support Tanya Plibersek’s earlier view, that the issues around Josh Frydenberg’s mother’s statelessness should not be raised as part of the citizenship debate.” From around the traps today: The national accounts are out: economic growth came in at 0.6% for the September quarter, following a 0.9% rise in the June quarter. The economy grew 2.8% through the year. For more, head here Scott Morrison is addressing the accounts now (he even has a screen): “This government’s strategy has supported jobs by driving investment that in the September quarter created more than 1000 jobs everyday. So far this year, we have been experiencing the strongest jobs growth, with four out of five jobs being full-time.” Labor MP Emma Husar is being asked what inquiries she made to ascertain she is not a Polish citizen: Husar disclosed that her paternal grandparents were born in Poland. She said she had made inquiries and was satisfied that she had not acquired Polish citizenship from them but she did not include legal advice. Guardian Australia understands that Husar contacted the Polish consulate in Sydney and was told that she would have had to apply to have Polish citizenship conferred on her. Husar never made any application to become a Polish citizen. Polish law appears to require people of Polish descent to submit proof and actively declare their intention to become a citizen. In her disclosure Husar attached a letter dated 24 May 2016 in which she acknowledged her father and she “may have acquired Polish citizenship” and purporting to renounce that citizenship, although no response from the Polish embassy was included. The Independent MP Cathy McGowan has just given a highly educational and sincere speech about gender in the same-sex marriage debate. McGowan said she has been a feminist since age 12, when she noticed that her brothers and sisters were treated differently. She said she is uncomfortable with gender-specific language like “boys and girls” and terms for which there is no gender-neutral equivalent like “nephews and nieces” because people shouldn’t be viewed through the frame of their gender. McGowan said that young people in her electorate of Indi taught her about gender fluidity and about pronouns, that not everybody fits into the categories of “he and she”. “They took me on a journey. I now get pronouns. I now say to gender non-defined people: tell me your preferred pronoun. This bill is not only about same-sex [attracted people]. It’s about two people getting married ... It’s not up to me to do the definitions but to respectfully ask others ... For a significant number of people ‘other’ is the appropriate box to tick.” McGowan concludes by saying that LGBTI and gender non-binary people need to be included in our community “not as they, not as other, but as us”. Donald Trump may have told the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, the US embassy is being moved to Jerusalem, but Australia is staying put. From Julie Bishop: Any decision regarding the location of US embassies is a matter for the United States. The Australian government will continue our diplomatic representation to Israel from our embassy in Tel Aviv and our representation to the Palestinian Authority from our office in Ramallah. Matters relating to Jerusalem are subject to final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Australia supports a two-state solution where both peoples live within secure and internationally recognised borders. Dan Tehan, who was at the Long Tan cross ceremony, has defended Malcolm Turnbull for answering journalists questions on citizenship, after Amanda Rishworth’s comments: “We had a very respectful service in the war memorial. The prime minister was then followed by the press [to the car],” he told Sky. “It was the journalists themselves who asked him the questions ... He was literally in the car in the car park; he was away from where we did the ceremony ... He was grabbed as he was hopping into the car “I think we should hear no more on that, because otherwise the opposition is descending into some grubby, grubby politics by raising that.” The high court has released its reasons for ordering that Hollie Hughes – who took a job at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal after the 2016 election – cannot fill the vacancy created by Fiona Nash’s disqualification, despite the fact Hughes resigned. Section 44(iv) of the constitution disqualifies a person who held an “office of profit under the crown” from being chosen as a senator. Hughes was disqualified because she held such an office “during a period in which the disqualification of Ms Nash from being validly returned as elected meant that the process of choice prescribed by the parliament for the purpose of s 7 of the constitution remained incomplete”. Basically, a candidate has to be free of disqualification from the moment they nominate until the moment a position is validly filled. Since Nash didn’t validly fill the Senate spot, Hughes had to be free of disqualification from June 2016 until October 2017. The AAT job given to her by the attorney general, George Brandis, did her in. The unanimous five judge decision addressed the view this might seem “harsh or unduly technical” by noting that the question arose only because Nash was ineligible. They said: “Ms Hughes’s acceptance in the meantime of appointment to the [AAT] ... was understandable. But it was a voluntary step which she took in circumstances where [a reference creating a vacancy in the seat] of a senator who had been returned as elected was always a possibility. By choosing to accept the appointment for the future, Ms Hughes forfeited the opportunity to benefit in the future from any special count of the ballot papers that might be directed as a result of such a vacancy being found.” The prime minister was stopped by journalists on his way out of the war memorial event this morning, honouring the gift of the original Long Tan cross from Vietnam. As he was getting into his car, he was asked about citizenship and, as has become habit, swivelled from that answer to talk about Sam Dastyari: “The Labor people that are caught up in this not only were UK citizens, but knew they were. I think it is pretty straightforward – Shorten should do the right thing. He should stop running this protection racket. “And of course, I come back to Senator Dastyari too because this is a critical issue of national security. “Surely every senator, every member, should be required to put Australia first. “Senator Dastyari did not. It is very clear. He took money from a Chinese benefactor and in return for that, stood up and read out Chinese talking points on the South China Sea. “Now, that would inspire nothing but contempt for him and his party from Beijing and the same contempt it inspires here, because people expect politicians to put their country first. Australians expect their leaders to put Australia first and, frankly, people in China expect Australian leaders to put Australia first. “So it is a contemptible act that Dastyari undertook and then to go to Mr Huang’s house and tip him off that he may be under surveillance from Australian security agencies and advise him how to avoid it. I mean how much has Senator Dastyari got to do before Bill Shorten is going to do the right thing and kick him out of the Labor party? “I mean this is a failure of leadership by Bill Shorten. “There’s a tendency for people to look at Sam Dastyari and say he’s a comical fellow and so forth. He is a senator of the Australian parliament. He is a key supporter of Bill Shorten. “Bill Shorten’s leadership depends on Senator Dastyari but I tell you what’s more important: Bill Shorten’s leadership depends on his putting Australia first and right now he is not doing that. “It’s time for Bill Shorten to stand up for Australia and show that he is a leader as opposed to just being a puppet of backroom factional leaders like Senator Dastyari.” Labor’s veterans’ affairs spokeswoman, Amanda Rishworth, has called on Malcolm Turnbull to apologise for what she said was “a grubby political press conference on the steps of the Australian War Memorial whilst we honoured the service of veterans who fought in Vietnam. “The prime minister clearly doesn’t understand there is a time and place for politics and a time and place to remember the sacrifice of the men and women who have served our country. These are not one and the same.” The high court has handed down its reason in the Hollie Hughes case. You’ll find that here. We will have to wait a little longer to see how that position is filled. It looks like the speakers on the marriage equality bill have decided to speed up the process themselves, with speeches now sitting at about five minutes. Peter Dutton this morning confirmed that he didn’t believe Tony Abbott’s amendments had a chance of surviving (for now): I do not think that has any chance of getting up. I think that is a reality of the numbers. Again, I have spoken to many on our side. They have no intention of ignoring the vote or frustrating the process. The same-sex marriage bill will pass in the House of Representatives this week, there is no doubt in my mind about that. “But we do need to have a discussion about whether we can get those appropriate balances in place. “This debate has never been for me about homophobia, it has never been about denying the love in the same-sex relationship, it has never been about hate on any basis. The question is though, we need to get the balance right in terms of religious protections. “Those people who have religious beliefs or otherwise need protections, I think they will be agreement with that, including on the Labor side and including many gay couples, they should be allowed to have same-sex marriage, but nonetheless same-sex marriage is just another ideological stepping stone for Labor, on an ideological path that I do not think the Australian public would agree with. “At some point in the year, informed by the Philip Ruddock process, they will be another debate about the balance.” George Brandis denied that the government had reflected on the integrity of Katy Gallagher. “I do not reflect at all on the integrity of Senator Gallagher and I don’t doubt for a moment the accuracy and truthfulness of the statements she has made to the Senate. The assertion that has come from Senator Gallagher and Senator Wong that Senator Gallagher plainly is not disqualified prejudges the very issue which the Senate by this notion has asked the high court to determine.” On Katy Gallagher’s referral, Penny Wong had this to say: “It’s not just the case that Senator Gallagher’s eligibility is beyond question. So too is her integrity. “Those opposite and everyone in this place know this. “It is now incumbent on the government to follow Labor’s lead and ensure that after it has lost two senators, there are no further doubts over the standing of its senators. “Labor does not believe in using this chamber for partisan referrals. For this reason, and in light of Senator Sinodinos’s medical circumstances, Labor will not be seeking to refer Senator Sinodinos at this point. “However, we note that there is significant legal contention about his citizenship status that the government, and the chamber, may need to consider in due course. For now we will leave that for the government to reflect upon.” The drug tests for welfare trials have been scrapped, with the government unable to get the measure passed in the Senate. Richard Di Natale has told the Senate the Greens will support bona fide referrals, but he has no time for George Brandis’s claim that Labor is in the same position as the government on this matter. We have some members of the Labor party who took steps, took legal advice, and at the time was satisfied that that was enough to disqualify themselves as dual citizens and two in fact mean that they were eligible to stand, and then we have members of the government who took no steps, no steps. He sat in this chamber knowing they were dual citizens, and took no steps, and in fact were forced after the high court decision, to come clean by the former president of the Senate. Like Minister Nash, who came here at one minute to midnight, as we were about to go home, to put her version on the table, which it now is clear that she was sitting here, knowing she was ineligible, and did nothing about it. The rank hypocrisy from the attorney general is remarkable here. We have members of the government who took no steps and have now given the middle finger to the parliament by not disclosing the relevant information in the disclosure form! “Now, I accept that the high court needs to determine whether those Labor members who sought advice and were told that initiating the renunciation process was enough to make themselves sure that they were not dual citizens, that was based on previous judgments. I understand that we do need to get some clarity on that not just for this parliament, but for future parliaments, to know reasonable steps, at what point the test for that applies. “That is why we would support this referral and referrals in the lower house, but don’t come in here and lecture this Senate about your role in these, as though somehow, Labor have put themselves in the same category as your senators. They have not. “What we have seen is one party, where dual citizens have been dual citizens, have taken no steps, have been ineligible and have continued to sit in this chamber and in cabinet. “When this first appeared,we had minister Matt Canavan standing up and saying well, given the circumstances, I can no longer sit as a minister. “When it occurred to minister Nash and indeed minister Barnaby Joyce, a completely different test was applied. “For some reason, they were able to continue as ministers. We have the president of the Senate issuing orders to the high court, knowing that he himself was ineligible. “The reality is that this government has shown itself to be without integrity, decency, to be hypocritical and to be standing up there and lecturing the opposition as somehow having behaved in a way that is comparable with this government is appalling. I make the exception, of course, for David Feeney.” Liberal MP Jason Falinksi has used his speech in the marriage debate to indicate he supports both same-sex marriage and religious freedom, but the freedom issue should not be dealt with in the marriage bill. Falisnki, a practising Catholic, said he accepts his religious view of marriage should not be enshrined in civil laws because if the state is to regulate marriage “it should be regulated so everyone has access to it”. The state should not be used to “enforce on others my personal views”, he said. Addressing people who feel their freedom to express their beliefs and conscience could be affected by the bill, Falinski said: “My distinct preference is for this discussion to be dealt with holistically, rather than piecemeal in a bill designed to give expression to people’s voice by expanding definition of marriage in law.” He indicated he supports the Ruddock review process to enshrine religious freedoms in law. Here is what Mark Dreyfus said this morning about Josh Frydenberg’s situation: It’s a matter of the constitution of Australia. I’m simply making the point that the high court decisions need to be applied; the constitution needs to be observed. The high court has said it is a matter of foreign law, foreign citizenship law. It’s a matter of the law of Hungary, the law of Poland, the law of Germany, the law of Greece, the law of Italy. And these MPs need to do what the disclosure process called for. Not simply hide behind legal advice, not say I’ve got legal advice and that’s enough.” Labor looks set to refer David Feeney. Here is what Tony Burke said this morning: With respect to David Feeney, I’ll move that referral. If the documents turn up, it doesn’t make sense that he was asked 10 years ago to deal with both potential Irish and potential UK and only dealt with one of them. But it’s a disclosure process. If you don’t have the documents you get referred. So I’ll move that referral personally. With respect to the other individuals, there is no step they could have taken before they nominated that they didn’t take. Absolutely no steps. In fact, in fact in Susan Lamb’s case, the UK then wrote back to her and said we’re not even convinced you had UK citizenship in the first place. So that’s the situation that they’re in. If Malcolm Turnbull’s desperate to move referrals then he has already indicated they will move them with respect to those members. On the referrals, it doesn’t look like the government will be referring any of its own people. If Bill Shorten doesn’t refer the Labor MPs under question, then the government may move. Probably not today though. I think we’ll see that tomorrow. Barnaby Joyce will be sworn in today, before question time. Government ministers are really pushing the line that reasonable steps is not enough here, with Alan Tudge the latest to question why it took Labor members so long to renounce their citizenship. I’m not sure if the government can take the moral high ground on this one. Besides the whole “and the high court shall so hold” line, it’s also been proven that several Coalition MPs didn’t take any steps at all. Despite Mark Dreyfus mentioning Arthur Sinodinos’s name this morning as someone Labor could consider referring to the high court, Penny Wong has told the Senate that out of respect for Sinodinos’s medical condition, Labor will not pursue his referral. Katy Gallagher’s statement: On 4 September this year, I provided a detailed statement to the Senate addressing concerns that had been raised about my citizenship status. In my statement to the Senate, I informed the chamber that I had completed an RN—renunciation of citizenship—form on 20 April 2016. I did this based on advice from the ALP legal team and out of an abundance of caution. As I have previously informed the Senate, the UK High Commission had previously advised me that I would need to make an application to obtain British citizenship by descent. The renunciation declaration, supporting information and the prescribed fee were sent to the UK Home Office by registered mail on 20 April 2016. On any measure, I took all reasonable steps to renounce any entitlement I might have had to British citizenship by descent. At the time, I received advice that the action I took was sufficient to make me an eligible candidate for election. On 16 August 2016, some 118 days after I renounced any right to British citizenship, I received confirmation from the UK authorities. It was also at that time, in August 2016, that the previous advice I received from the UK authorities and had acted on in respect to the ACT assembly and the Senate was clearly wrong—I had indeed received British citizenship from my father. Whilst I wish the matter of my renunciation had been dealt with more expeditiously in the UK, the delay had no bearing on the declaration of renunciation I made in April last year. I renounced prior to nomination and was eligible to stand at the 2016 election. Those opposite know that processing time varies. It took 118 days from the date of my signing and lodging the RN form to the date my renunciation was registered by the British Home Office. I note that this is far longer than the more recent cases for senators and MPs where renunciation has taken two, three or four days because a special process has been put in place for them to renounce quickly. This special process was not available to me. Those opposite also know that I’m not the only member of this place to have submitted renunciation documents before nomination and to have received confirmation post-election. Indeed, there are current senators sitting in this parliament who were in exactly the same position to me in previous parliaments. It is a matter of enormous regret to me that I was not correctly advised by UK authorities of my citizenship status ahead of my nomination to fill the casual vacancy in the last parliament. However, in relation to this parliament, my eligibility is clear. I have acted at all times on the legal advice available to me. More recently, I have taken further legal advice following the renewed questioning of my eligibility by the government after the High Court’s decisions in Re Roberts and Re Canavan. The legal advice that I received from Dr Collins QC also draws on the expert opinion of Mr Berry from the London Bar. Dr Collins’s opinion is that ‘Senator Gallagher had, prior to the date for nominations for the 2016 election, taken all of the steps that were required to be taken by her, not just the reasonable steps required under British law, in order to renounce her British citizenship.’ I can assure the Senate that at no time have I received any advice to say that I am ineligible to sit as a senator in the 45th Parliament. I have acted at all times on information from the British High Commission, the British Home Office and the legal advice given to me. I can confirm again that I have no evidence or advice before me that would indicate a problem with my eligibility. Over the past few days, there have been reports that I, or Labor, were refusing to refer my case to the High Court. I have previously stated that I do not think there is a basis to refer my eligibility to the High Court for determination. I stand by that position. I have also said the referral would ultimately be a matter for the Senate. I stand by that position too. This is as it should be. It is, however, clear to me that the government have decided I should be referred, despite having full access to all of my legal advice and expert reports for the past two days. A standard, I note, the government doesn’t meet with their members of parliament on the disclosure register. I have not been provided with any information or copies of any legal advice from the government, which justify the position they are taking towards me and on which they justify their hostile referral threats. It may be because such advice does not exist. In light of this, and conscious that the attacks on my legitimacy to sit as a senator will continue to be used by my political opponents, I have formed the view that my situation should be considered by the High Court, despite the lack of any legal advice indicating I have a problem that warrants referral. This is a decision I have taken individually and based on my own individual circumstances. Mr President, this statement today, the statement of 4 September, along with all the documents I have released as part of my disclosure, and the legal advice, indicates just how seriously I take my responsibilities to the Australian Senate and to the people of the ACT. I have provided more information than anyone on my citizenship status, and anyone who reads the full disclosures can see for themselves the difference in standard and content that exists across this side of the chamber. In conclusion, Mr President, while I do not agree with the need for this referral, I do not resent it. The success and standing of the Australian Senate is bigger than all of us, and should be focused solely on what we are able to deliver together for the Australian people. It is bigger and much more important than the circumstances of individual senators, and acting in a way which protects the reputation, the legitimacy, the confidence of our parliamentary institutions, should always, in my humble opinion, be paramount. It is for this reason that I have asked for this referral motion to be moved today. Finally, Mr President, I have advised the Leader of the Opposition that I am standing aside from my portfolio responsibilities within the shadow cabinet, as well as from the role of Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate until my case is resolved by the High Court. And I will not be making any further comment about this until my case is finalised. I thank the Senate. Katy Gallagher said she will also be standing aside from her shadow portfolio responsibilities and as her role as manager of opposition business in the Senate. The ACT senator says she has advice that there is no problem with her eligibility. She notes that it took more than 100 days for her renunciation to be confirmed by the UK authorities but only a matter of days for some Coalition members. But she says despite the lack of evidence from the government calling for her referral, she takes her “responsibilities to the Australian senator and the ACT people seriously” and will refer herself for the high court to make the ultimate decision. Government ministers have been dancing around calling Sam Dastyari a spy all week. They’ve used a variety of different phrases but you can always count on Peter Dutton to just ramp up the rhetoric. The soon-to-be home affairs minister just called Dastyari a “double agent” while talking about what he thinks Labor should do with its members who have potential citizenship issues: Now the court has been very clear, it is clear that these people need to be referred to the high court. Mr Shorten should take the initiative to do that when parliament commences this morning, and it is as plain as that. He cannot pretend that there is no problem as he’s done over the past weeks, this is now really a problem for Bill Shorten. His leadership is in question, if he cannot stand up to Sam Dastyari, you have someone who is essentially a double agent in this country and yet Bill Shorten still allows him to remain in the Senate. How can you go to the Australian people wanting to be prime minister of this country if you know that people in your own ranks are breaking the law are involved in questionable practices? The bells have rung. Parliament is under way for the second last (scheduled) sitting day this year Mike Bowers was up early to catch Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten at the War Memorial this morning, for the ceremony welcoming the gift of the original Long Tan cross from the Vietnamese government. Peter Dutton has gone on the attack over Labor’s support for motions to accept New Zealand’s offer to take some of the refugees in Australia’s off-shore detention centres: It is obvious that for whatever reason they have done a deal with the Greens in the Senate, I don’t know whether it relates to citizenship or other issues but there is to be some logic as to why Labor would move a motion that dictates people would be sent to New Zealand knowing that New Zealand is the only country in the world, not even the US or the Five Eyes partners have the ability to send their citizens to our country without a visa. New Zealand citizens have preferential treatment, they are the only country in the world where you have as a right a visa on arrangement, even people coming from the United States, the United Kingdom or Canada must have a visa before they get on a plane to come to our country and that is why we have been very clear about yes, wanting to send people as quickly as possible to clean up Labor’s mess on Manus Island to certain treaties with the United States and I am pleased to say that more people will move from their under the US arrangement. All of that continues. We have also had our first Kristina Keneally mention by a government minister. Start the tally! While we are dipping back into Queensland, it looks as though Labor has (unofficially) reached the 47 seats needed for a majority government. Hetty Johnson, who ran as an independent candidate in Macalister has conceded – she lost by 483 votes. But that gives Labor the seats it needs. We’re still waiting on it to be called by the Electoral Commission Queensland, which is still working through tens of thousands of postal votes and preferences. Environmental Justice Australia has asked the ACCC to investigate the claim from Adani that its Queensland Carmichael mine will create 10,000 jobs, on behalf of clients Chris McCoomb and the Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union. From its statement: “Adani has been telling jobseekers 10,000 jobs are on the way,” said Chris McCoomb, volunteer co-ordinator at the AUWU. “Unemployed people are spending their meagre savings on training courses for jobs that don’t exist now, and may never exist.” The letter to the ACCC provides evidence of mining training outfits relying on Adani’s claims to lure jobseekers into training courses. “Plenty of evidence suggests Adani’s representations about 10,000 direct and indirect jobs are seriously flawed, yet the company continues to mislead people looking for work,” said David Barnden, lawyer at Environmental Justice Australia. “People should not be misled into spending hundreds of dollars on mining industry training courses for jobs that just aren’t there.” Evidence given by Adani’s representative and accepted by the Queensland Land Court said the mine would create 1,464 jobs. The Court said the methodology used by Adani to arrive at the 10,000 figure had significant shortcomings. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the method used by Adani is likely to significantly overstate the impacts of projects. The ACCC has a mandate to prioritise issues of significant public interest or concern and conduct detrimentally affecting disadvantaged or vulnerable consumer groups. The AUWU is an organisation run by the unemployed for the unemployed. Formed in 2014, the AUWU’s mission is to protect the interests of the 2.8 million people looking for work, and stop the government’s ongoing assault on Australia’s social security system. *end statement* The issue of Josh Frydenberg’s citizenship is becoming a particularly hairy. Labor had left it alone, on purpose, as his mother’s family arrived in Australia as stateless citizens after the Nazi-aligned Hungarian government stripped Jewish citizens of their citizenship during the second world war. In an effort to right wrongs, Hungary changed its citizenship laws to address that situation. Which may have conferred dual citizenship on Frydenberg’s family. In his declaration, Frydenberg said he had sought advice but did not provide it. His name was one of the one’s Mark Dreyfus raised as having potential issues, which has sparked another argument over whether the debate has now gone too far. Speaking to Sky, Ed Husic admitted to some discomfort: If we get to the point where we are pursuing people who were stateless and escaping one of the most horrific episodes in modern history, well, I will be interested to see how far we pursue that ... You know what, I think this reflects the delightfully feral state of Australian politics right now that this is all tit-for-tat in terms of what is happening right now.” Tony Burke has been out and about very early talking about the reasonable steps argument. When they talk about reasonable steps, they talk about the steps a candidate can take prior to nominating. There is no additional step that those individuals could have taken. Think though, that this argument that the Liberal party is currently running would actually mean [that because] the British Home Office took many, many weeks, months, to process their police stations, their renunciations [are not valid]. For Fiona Nash, the National party senator, they did it in about three days. We can’t have a situation where the onus which we’ve always been told is on the candidate to complete all their reasonable steps, but the decision about whether or not they’re eligible is driven by a junior public servant in Great Britain. The constitutional expert Anne Twomey spoke to ABC this morning on the issue of reasonable steps. Labor says its MPs (David Feeney as the potential exception) took all possible steps before its members nominated, as set out by the high court in the Skyes v Cleary. In most of these cases, the UK authorities didn’t send confirmation of the renunciation until after the nomination date but Labor says the steps it took are enough, under precedent. Prof Twomey says whether Labor is right is something for the high court to decide: Look, with most of them, it’s just a timing issue. So the question that needs to be resolved is whether it’s enough to have done everything that the candidate can do before the nomination date – so sending off your renunciation,paying the fee, filling out the forms – if the test is that as long as you’ve done your part, that’s enough, they should all be fine. The doubts that have arisen since the citizenship seven case, however, are that when the court looked at that reasonable steps test in that case,it did so in terms of a much more narrow, view of it, but just referring to it in relation to circumstances where, otherwise, the other country wouldn’t accept renunciation at all. Now, if that’s the view taking a much stricter line on it, then these people are in trouble. But the problem is we don’t really know. Now, later today, the high court’s handing down another judgment in relation to Hollie Hughes and if the court was being very kind to us, um, they might put in a few clues that resolve that other issue of approximate timing and that could alleviate the need to refer these things to the high court. If the court set out the test clearly, we might not need other references and that would be helpful. The prime minister has also weighed in, maintaining the rage not just over the citizenship issues, but also Sam Dastyari. Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten were both at the War Memorial for an event this morning. Here is what Turnbull had to say on the way out: Well, it appears that David Feeney is still a foreign citizen, so ... And he’s indicated that he will refer himself. Well, that’s what I understand he said. But there are a number of people on the Labor side who were clearly UK citizens at the time they nominated for the parliament. We’ve seen the interpretation the high court is imposing. It’s a strict black-letter, strict reading of the section. They found Barnaby ineligible for being a New Zealand citizen when he wasn’t aware he was a New Zealand citizen. The Labor people caught up in this not only knew they were citizens, but didn’t declare it. Shorten should stop running this protection racket and of course, you know, I come back to Senator Dastyari too. Because this is a critical issue of national security. Surely every senator, every member, should be required to put Australia first. Senator Dastyari did not. It is very clear. He took money from a Chinese benefactor and in return for that, stood up and read out Chinese talking points on the South China Sea. Now, that should inspire nothing but contempt for him and his party from Beijing and the same contempt it inspires here, because people expect politicians to put their country first. Australians expect their leaders to put Australia first and, frankly, people in China expect Australian leaders to Australia first. So it is a contemptible act that Dastyari undertook and then to go to Mr Huang’s house and tip him off that he may be under surveillance from Australian security agencies and advise him how to avoid it. I mean, how much has Senator Dastyari got to do before Bill Shorten is going to do the right thing and kick him out of the Labor party? I mean, this is a failure of leadership by Bill Shorten. You know, this is not ... there’s a tendency for people to look at Sam Dastyari and say, ‘Oh, you know, he’s a comical fellow and so forth.’ He is a senator of the Australian parliament. He is a key supporter of Bill Shorten. Bill Shorten’s leadership depends on Senator Dastyari but I tell you what’s more important – Bill Shorten’s leadership depends on his putting Australia first and right now he is not doing that. It’s time for Bill Shorten to stand up for Australia and show that he is a leader as opposed to just being a puppet of backroom factional leaders like Senator Dastyari. In return, Mark Dreyfus had a few things to say about some of the Coalition MPs disclosures. Here is what he told Sky overnight: I am saying the disclosure has been inadequate. We seem to have a cover-up in the case of Jason Falinski, in the case of Nola Marino, in the case of Julia Banks, Alex Hawke, Michael McCormack, Arthur Sinodinos and possibly Josh Frydenberg. And it’s a matter of them making proper disclosure. That’s what we’re calling for, Kieran. And if there is not proper disclosure then there needs to be a referral to the high court.” On the citizenship issues for Labor, particularly faced by David Feeney – who says he understands his paperwork was sent off in October 2007 to renounce any claim to either British or Irish citizenship, but the UK authorities have been unable to find any record of those applications – government ministers have been having a field day. Here was Mathias Cormann overnight: Bill Shorten’s sanctimonious hypocrisy has been completely exposed. For months now he’s been lecturing everyone about how fantastic Labor’s vetting processes supposedly are and here we’ve got David Feeney not only forgetting that he owned a multimillion-dollar house somewhere in Melbourne, but also clearly forgetting he had another citizenship. You can’t tell me, nobody can tell me, that Bill Shorten only found out tonight that David Feeney is a dual citizen, still holds British citizenship. That is something Bill Shorten would have known for some time, but he continued to keep up the pretence that somehow nobody on the Labor party side had any issues with their citizenship at all. Well, hasn’t it been quite the night! After the citizenship disclosures were released for the house MPs, all hell broke loose, as the government relished Labor becoming embroiled. Unless he can find his paperwork, David Feeney looks likely to have a date with the high court and a byelection in Batman would not be good news for Labor, which only just scraped over the line against the Greens in 2016. There are three others from Labor with questions marks over them, including Josh Wilson, Justine Keay and Katy Gallagher. Labor says reasonable steps are enough there. Government ministers are threatening to use their numbers to refer the members to the high court, which would be a massive break in convention. In return, Labor has threatened to do the same unless more documents are provided for government MPs, including those with Greek heritage (one of the more complicated citizenship laws) and Jason Falinski. Josh Frydenberg’s name is also back in the mix, while NXT’s Rebekha Sharkie looks set to be referred. Expect the tit-for-tat on that to continue all day. Then there is the fire the government experienced from one of its own, with the former trade minister Andrew Robb taking offence at being mentioned in the same breath as the government’s new foreign interference legislation. You may remember Robb as the trade minister who worked on free trade agreements, including the one with China, who then took a $880,000 consulting job with a Chinese billionaire shortly after the 2016 election. “I’m being used and abused,” Robb told the Australian. “I feel I deserve, from my own side, a bit more consideration — a phone call, a question to find out what the facts are,. “I’ve complied in every sense with the ethical requirement, which is the important part. In any work that I’ve been doing since I left the parliament, is the work ethical? Does it in any way conflict with the responsibilities that I had? And I’m not a bad judge of those things. I defy anyone from Labor or my own side on that. “All of them are running fast and loose and I’m sick of it.” George Brandis was in damage control this morning, telling the ABC that Robb was one of the nation’s finest trade ministers, “patriotic” and an all-round good bloke, before attempting to mollify him with the message: “It’s only a register.” And of course, there is still the marriage equality legislation. There are about 50 speakers left on the list. So, given the average speech has gone for about 11 minutes, we have quite a few hours left on that. Oh, and the high court will be publishing its reasons for rejecting Hollie Hughes as being eligible for Fiona Nash’s Senate spot. It will still be a few days before the decision is handed down on how that spot should be filled, though. If it is a casual vacancy, Nash has made her intentions loud and clear – she wants back in. If it is next in line, well, I would think we’ll see a fight on. Mike Bowers is out and about working his magic, so follow along with him on the blog and @mpbowers and @mikepbowers.

The RFU has traditionally been against ring-fencing the top flight but Brown conceded that as discussions continue over how the domestic structure fits in with the global calendar from 2020 onwards, its stance has changed somewhat. As revealed by the Guardian last week, reducing the Premiership to 10 teams is also among a host of suggestions previously made and Brown admitted it may take until the end of the season to reach a resolution, more than a year after Premiership Rugby Limited announced its intention to extend its season to 10 months, adding, “There’s no specific plan of action at this point”. Brown also hinted that doing away with one or both of the A League and the Anglo-Welsh Cup may also be part of the solution. “We’re looking at all options, but there’s no specific consideration of numbers [of teams in each league] at the moment, whether it’s the first or second level, at this stage,” he said. “It’s not just about number of teams in the league, it’s also about the number of competitions played within the season. “Our historic view would be the same, that promotion and relegation is the right thing.

There, her 1987 tableau A Fashionable Marriage – a take on William Hogarth’s Marriage à la Mode, restaged as a series of large cut-out figures – had a giddy, comic and sprawling vitality, holding its own among other key works of the decade including Black Audio Film Collective’s Handsworth Songs (directed by John Akomfrah) and Isaac Julien’s early film Territories. But in her Turner prize show in Hull, A Fashionable Marriage feels constrained. Shown alongside a group of reworked, adumbrated pages from the Guardian (a series begun 10 years ago, and continuing), a single recent painting and a set of decorative Lancaster crockery and tablewear that Himid has overpainted with acrylic figures, scenes and portraits, it adds up to an uneven show that lacks coherence. Made in 2007, the Lancaster Dinner Service is a barbed reflection on the slave trade, British class and the collision of cultures. Part obliteration, part excavation, part chronicle and part fiction, riffing on fat squires, vomiting bewigged youths, a whole cast of 18th- and 19th-century caricatures, and mixing them with images of black slaves and servants, as well as patterns from Nigeria and Mali, the work shows what a powerful graphic artist Himid can be. This is where the pleasure of her art really lies. Himid’s art is interested as much in ideas as in objects, in histories as much as in paintings. Her tableaux of often larger-than-life cut-out and painted figures, crowds and groups, have both a cartoonish boisterousness and vitality that her paintings often seem to lack. Himid studied theatre design at the Slade, and the theatricality of her best work enables her to make serious points – about ethnicity and history, origin and arrival – without getting bogged down. Her art has a surprising lightness. This is a strength. But it is odd to have a Turner prize show that relies more on past achievements than on the present, though it does free the Turner from its sometimes wearisome and perpetual focus on the new. In any case, for many viewers, Himid’s art is a surprise. Dropping the upper age limit of Turner prize nominees (a rule imposed in 1991) is a good thing; I wouldn’t exclude any artist on the basis of age. But it is not a valedictory award. More and more older artists who have previously been sidelined, ignored and overlooked are being re-evaluated when they are no longer sexy, hot and under 30. Himid has been showing for decades. I first saw her work in the early 1980s. The sculptor Phyllida Barlow only began achieving wide international recognition in her 60s. The painter Rose Wylie – at 83, 20 years Himid’s senior – has her first major show in a public gallery now, to much acclaim, at the Serpentine. Keep at it long enough, at a high enough level, and things will happen. Are we looking at a whole career, at the current exhibition, at the enthusiasm carried over by Himid’s recent re-evaluation? A bit of all of these, for sure. And there is no doubt that as a campaigner for black artists, a teacher and lecturer and, in her way, something of an establishment figure, Himid is a good thing. I doubt any of the other contenders will object to her winning the 2017 prize. I just wish her art did more for me. Rosalind Nashashibi’s recent films, and especially Vivian’s Garden, which I thought deserved the prize just on its own account, are what I’ll take away with me, to think about and want to see again, which is the most you can want of any art. That in itself is a prize."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/05/celtic-anderlecht-champions-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T21:39:12Z","webTitle":"Celtic reach Europa League despite Simunovic gifting Anderlecht win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/05/celtic-anderlecht-champions-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/05/celtic-anderlecht-champions-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Celtic reach Europa League despite Simunovic gifting Anderlecht win","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brendan Rodgers was keen to accentuate positives after Celtic’s latest European disappointment. Perhaps he was quite right to; from a Champions League section that also included Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain, Europa League football after Christmas was always the fairest target. Celtic confirmed third place in unimpressive fashion, though, and with only three points. Victory in the head-to-head scenario with Anderlecht was necessary to extend Celtic’s European stay, after the Belgians secured success in Glasgow which should really have been by more than one goal. Celtic were second best in every department with their manager, curiously, citing the “context of the game” as problematic. It was Celtic who entered this tie with the glaring advantage, after all, having swaggered to a 3-0 success in Belgium. Rodgers is rightly lauded in these parts for a domestic record of being unbeaten in 67 games. Yet it would be remiss of onlookers not to pinpoint failings visible throughout this European campaign. Celtic must improve if they seek to enjoy a Europa League run worthy of the name. “They were better than us tonight,” Rodgers admitted. “But over the bigger picture, our aim at the beginning of the competition was to get through to the Europa League. We have done that. There is immense pride but it’s hard to feel that when you’ve lost. There is a story for some of our players in that they have a long way to go before they can call themselves be players at this level. But we’ve shown over the course of this campaign that we can be better.” Any sense of Celtic complacency was undermined by their starting lineup. Rodgers named his strongest available team, with Moussa Dembélé returning from injury to spearhead the home attack. In one way, Celtic had a point to prove; 10 matches had passed in group stages of either the Champions or Europa League without them winning at home. Such a statistic contradicts the widely held notion of this being a venue to intimidate continental opposition. The winless figure increased before 10pm. Anderlecht had shown marked improvement since the reverse to Celtic in Brussels and yet, like the Scottish champions, they had found Group B a struggle; Anderlecht arrived in Glasgow having scored just a single group goal. That should have been doubled during the opening exchanges in which Anderlecht were by far the more composed team. Henry Onyekuru cut the ball back for Sven Kums, with Craig Gordon forced into a smart save with his legs. With Celtic struggling to impose themselves, Adrien Trebel was the next to test Gordon courtesy of an acrobatic effort. If there was concern for Anderlecht during the first half, it resonated in the failure to turn dominance into meaningful reward. The probings of the visiting captain, Sofiane Hanni, caused all manner of problems for the Celtic defence with Rodgers’s team woefully unable to retain possession when in the Anderlecht half. Rodgers replaced two ineffectual players, Stuart Armstrong and Scott Sinclair, at the break. The Belgians again opened on the front foot, though, with the outstanding Hanni narrowly failing to connect with a Pieter Gerkens cross just six yards from goal. With Celtic showing improvement, James Forrest sought to rub salt into Belgian wounds with a curling effort which Frank Boeckx scrambled wide of a post. Fortune was soon to favour Anderlecht at the other end. Sloppy Celtic defending allowed Dennis Appiah possession on the right, with the defender’s cross seemingly straightforward for Jozo Simunovic to clear. Instead, the centre-back miscued a header beyond Gordon. Simunovic could have atoned for his blunder with a 67th-minute half-volley which instead flew over Boeckx’s crossbar. Dembélé squandered another chance, 18 minutes from time, after Kieran Tierney had fed him at the end of a typically marauding left wing run. This was to be Dembélé’s last act as he limped off to be replaced by the PSG loanee Odsonne Édouard. Hanni almost intensified a slightly edgy Celtic Park scenario with a 20-yard drive which had Gordon worried. Thankfully for Celtic, this proved the extent of their fright."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/05/manchester-united-cska-moscow-champions-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T23:18:00Z","webTitle":"Manchester United hit back to beat CSKA Moscow and clinch top spot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/05/manchester-united-cska-moscow-champions-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/05/manchester-united-cska-moscow-champions-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United hit back to beat CSKA Moscow and clinch top spot","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Under other circumstances, the main cause for celebration would have been that Manchester United qualified for the Champions League’s knockout stages for the first time since David Moyes was a few months into his six-year contract and Marouane Fellaini was Old Trafford’s newest signing. As it was, in the lowest-profile match of a high-stakes week, sandwiched between games against Arsenal and Manchester City and when progress was all but guaranteed, the most important element could be the goal that might spur Romelu Lukaku into another scoring spree. “His work for the team every match is crazy,” said José Mourinho, a supportive voice during his £75m signing’s drought. “If I could choose goalscorers, I would always choose the strikers. If he can feel that happiness that strikers only get when they score goals then great.” Lukaku began his United career with 11 in 10 games. This was just his second in 13 subsequent matches and a first meaningful strike since September. It was beautifully taken and, besides a statistical significance, his equaliser should increase morale and momentum, not least his own. United were trailing, their 39-game unbeaten run at Old Trafford and 100% home record this season under threat, when Lukaku volleyed in Paul Pogba’s delightful ball. If it was a reminder of how much United will miss their record signing on Sunday, when Pogba begins a three-match suspension for his red card at Arsenal, two goals in as many minutes were both fashioned by superb passes. A swift turnaround was concluded when the influential Juan Mata lofted a ball over the visitors’ defence. Marcus Rashford completed an unusual one-two by angling in the winner to earn the goal he had threatened from the off. He had struck the post in the fourth minute, springing the offside trap to meet Lukaku’s pass, and had used his pace to torment a CSKA Moscow back three with a combined age of 102 and his persistence to keep the goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev busy. Rashford started, as Mourinho made six changes with City in mind. Even with seven players injured or rested it was notable that Henrikh Mkhitaryan was omitted altogether for the fifth time in six games. Luke Shaw, another who has felt Mourinho’s displeasure when marginalised, began for the first time in 219 days, almost scored his first career goal with a volley Akinfeev parried and drew rare praise from his manager. “It was a very positive performance, especially going forwards,” he added. “He was deserving of that opportunity for quite a long time and he is going to get more.” In the short term, however, demotion beckons as others return. Mourinho ruled Eric Bailly and Michael Carrick out of the derby, while adding: “Phil Jones has a chance, Fellaini a chance, Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] a big chance and [Nemanja] Matic is injured but will play for sure.” Their absences meant progress was a squad achievement. “Fifteen points in a season returning to the Champions League is good,” said Mourinho. It would have taken a seven-goal defeat, which United have not suffered since 1931, plus a victory for Basel over Benfica to eliminate them. That always appeared improbable but a first home defeat since City’s last visit to Old Trafford was on the cards when CSKA led in bizarre fashion. Vitinho’s shot went in via Alan Dzagoev’s back as United appealed for offside. Referee Gianluca Rocchi rightly ruled that Daley Blind, who had slid off the pitch in an attempt to cut out Mário Fernandes’ cross, had played Dzagoev onside. Uefa muddied the waters by crediting Vitinho with the goal but Mourinho conceded it was correctly given. Thereafter, Sergio Romero was required to make a late save to deny Dzagoev an altogether more conventional equaliser, while Mourinho was left pondering if United’s reward for topping Group A will be a meeting with Real Madrid or Bayern Munich. “I am not the luckiest guy with draws,” he said sardonically. “It is better I shut up and forget it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/05/us-arrests-at-border-fell-while-ice-arrests-rose-during-trumps-first-eight-months","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T20:26:17Z","webTitle":"US arrests at border fell while Ice arrests rose during Trump's first eight months","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/05/us-arrests-at-border-fell-while-ice-arrests-rose-during-trumps-first-eight-months","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/05/us-arrests-at-border-fell-while-ice-arrests-rose-during-trumps-first-eight-months","fields":{"headline":"US arrests at border fell while Ice arrests rose during Trump's first eight months","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"US immigration officials on Tuesday said arrests at the border had fallen in Donald Trump’s first eight months in office while rates of people arrested in the US away from the border soared. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) numbers provide the first detailed picture of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, which human rights advocates said seemed to be targeting people with deep ties to the US. Advocates are also concerned because the release showed the plight of people fleeing violence in Central America is still severe. From Trump’s inauguration in January to the end of September, there was a 40% increase in arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Because Ice operates in the country’s interior while Customs and Border Protection (CBP) oversees the border, DHS supervises both agencies. Clara Long, a senior researcher for the US program at Human Rights Watch, said people arrested in the interior were more likely to have deep connections to the US through family, friends and work. “Many of them are being ripped apart from family, from home, from businesses, from jobs without consideration of family ties that they have to the US,” Long told the Guardian. “That has devastating impacts on families and communities.” Human Rights Watch on Tuesday afternoon released the results of a six-month examination of the impact these deportations had on people who had been living in the US interior long term. The report detailed people being forced out of the country, away from their loved ones, after decades of building lives, having children, starting businesses and paying taxes in the US. “All undocumented people in the US now have reason to fear deportation, regardless of the strength of their ties to the US,” the report said. The administration has said its immigration policies emphasize national security but there is no indication that a higher rate of dangerous criminals are being apprehended, detained or deported, compared with under Barack Obama. In explaining the preponderance of Ice arrests under Trump, DHS did not separate people who were convicted criminals from people who had not been convicted or who had entered the country more than once without legal papers. DHS said 92% of people Ice arrested from the inauguration through September “had a criminal conviction or a pending criminal charge, were an Ice fugitive, or were an illegal re-entrant”. Long told the Guardian: “Ice’s press release today tries very hard to make the argument that Ice continues to prioritize people who are so-called criminals ... But they also lump huge numbers of people into the pot they call criminals, including people who don’t have criminal convictions.” The DHS release also included numbers from the final four months of Obama’s second term, including the three-month period between Trump’s election win and his inauguration. Those numbers showed Central Americans continue to come into the country at high rates because of violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. CBP said while there was an overall decline in border apprehensions, there continued to be an increase in people traveling from Central America, including unaccompanied children. The Obama administration last year took steps to address this issue, which DHS described in July 2016 as a “humanitarian challenge” that primarily affected vulnerable people. On Tuesday, DHS took a much harsher position on such people, suggesting they abuse US immigration laws and pose a threat to the US. “CBP continues to be concerned about steady increase in the flow of unaccompanied children and family units from Central America, as transnational criminal organizations continue to exploit legal and policy loopholes to help illegal aliens gain entry and facilitate their release into the interior of the country,” the release said. Joanne Lin, Amnesty International USA’s national director of governmental affairs and advocacy, said the continued increase in people fleeing Central America demonstrated how desperate the situation was for people living there. “The fact that we’re still seeing these vulnerable asylum seekers make the journey to the United States is strong evidence that they are genuine refugees and they do need humanitarian protection in the United States,” she said. The acting DHS secretary, Elaine Duke, commended the president in a statement. She said: “We have an obligation to uphold the integrity of our immigration system, but we must do more to step up and close loopholes to protect the American worker, our economy, and our communities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/07/cambridge-dictionary-nativism-populism-word-year","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Why nativism, not populism, should be declared word of the year | Cas Mudde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/cambridge-dictionary-nativism-populism-word-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/cambridge-dictionary-nativism-populism-word-year","fields":{"headline":"Why nativism, not populism, should be declared word of the year","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week the Cambridge Dictionary declared populism its 2017 word of the year. In many ways, that makes perfect sense. Since Brexit and Trump, virtually every political event has been couched in terms of populism, from the Dutch parliamentary elections to the French presidential elections earlier this year. New media catchwords such as “fake news” are linked to populism. However, it has become the buzzword of the year mostly because it is very often poorly defined and wrongly used. Indeed, the Cambridge Dictionary’s definition perfectly illustrates this. It describes populism as “political ideas and activities that are intended to get the support of ordinary people by giving them what they want”. Oddly enough, this is almost identical to the interpretation used by many populists themselves. However, rather than populism, it describes responsive politics, as exists in idealistic models of democracy. The only part of that description that has some overlap with more common academic definitions of populism is the reference to “ordinary people”. In its blog , the dictionary further claims that people tend to use the term with reference to “the implied lack of critical thinking on the part of the populace, and the implied cynicism on the part of the leaders who exploit it”. In other words, populism is a political ploy by cynical leaders who mobilise the “ordinary people” by promising them whatever they want. While this might be the way that many of the members of the embattled cultural and political establishment use the term to disqualify it and (implicitly) its supporters, this is elitist, self-serving and unhelpful. It implies that non-populist politicians are genuine; non-ordinary people are politically sophisticated; and that populism has no true substance, and therefore no real critique of the political status quo. This might be a convenient definition for those who find themselves challenged by populists, but it has little to do with what populism actually is. While there is no consensual definition of populism within academia – like all important political terms, it is contested – most scholars use the term to denote a specific set of ideas that juxtapose “the people” and “the elite” and side with the former. In our new book, Populism: a Very Short Introduction, Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser and I define populism as an ideology that considers society to be separated into two homogenous and antagonistic groups, “the pure people” and “the corrupt elite”, and argues that politics should be an expression of the volonté générale (general will) of the people. While many colleagues debate whether populism is truly an ideology, or more a political discourse or style, their definitions are not much different. However, the Cambridge Dictionary does not only get the definition wrong – its application is wrong, too. It argues: “What sets populism apart … is that it represents a phenomenon both truly local and truly global, as populations and their leaders across the world wrestle with issues of immigration and trade, resurgent nationalism and economic discontent.” This conflates populism and the radical right. As elections in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Austria have this year been couched in terms of an epic battle between an emboldened populism and an embattled status quo, populism has became a synonym for what used to be termed the radical right. (The only left populist of relevance in the last year has been Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s challenge in the first round of the French presidential elections.) The populist radical right combines populism with two other core ideological features, authoritarianism and nativism. If anything, 2017 was the year of nativism, or more correctly, yet another year of nativism, as we have had many of these years since the turn of the century. Nativism is an ideology that holds that states should be inhabited exclusively by members of the native group (“the nation”), and that non-native people and ideas are fundamentally threatening to the homogenous nation-state. This year mainly stands out for the way in which nativism has been whitewashed as populism. This is not to say that populism is irrelevant to contemporary politics or to the populist radical right. But within the core ideology of the populist radical right, populism comes secondary to nativism, and within contemporary European and US politics, populism functions at best as a fuzzy blanket to camouflage the nastier nativism. Journalists should not let the radical right get away with that. They should not allow the popularity of the term populism to mask the nativism of the radical right. Because it’s only when we know exactly what is threatening our liberal democracies that can we effectively defend them. • Cas Mudde is the author of On Extremism and Democracy in Europe and The Populist Radical Right: a Reader"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/05/the-guardian-view-on-britain-and-the-customs-union-just-do-it","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T19:46:38Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Britain and the customs union: just do it | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/05/the-guardian-view-on-britain-and-the-customs-union-just-do-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/05/the-guardian-view-on-britain-and-the-customs-union-just-do-it","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Britain and the customs union: just do it","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 2016, more than 17 million British people voted to leave the European Union. But – as the journalist Tim Shipman’s new book, Fall Out, which covers the political turmoil of the 15 months since the referendum, makes clear – only two British people decided that this meant leaving the European single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. Those two people were Theresa May and her former aide Nick Timothy. These fateful national decisions were their personal interpretations of the vote to leave the EU – and theirs alone. As Mr Shipman explains, these foundational decisions of the UK’s withdrawal strategy were not discussed by Mrs May’s cabinet, let alone by parliament. Instead they were simply prime ministerial edicts to the 2016 Conservative conference. Later, they were included in the Tory manifesto for the June 2017 election, in which the party lost its overall majority, Mrs May’s leadership was humiliated and Mr Timothy lost his job. They were and are reckless and foolish policies, not justified by the 2016 referendum outcome, at odds with the national economic interests of Britain, inimical to peace in Ireland, and threatening to the internal cohesion of the UK. They are largely responsible for the mess into which Mrs May led the British negotiating effort in Brussels this week. The choice to leave the market, which is a project that had been shaped by Britain for more than 30 years, and the customs union collided on Monday with the reality that to do so will inflict a hard border inside Ireland or create a new border in the Irish Sea between Ireland and Britain. On Tuesday, while ministers and officials in London, Brussels and Dublin tried to piece back together a version of the deal that had been vetoed by the Democratic Unionists, MPs from all parties at Westminster made clear that neither of these options is acceptable. The MPs are right. Cobbling together a form of words that will pass muster with the EU, the Irish government, Tory backbenches and the DUP may get Mrs May over the immediate negotiating hurdle in Brussels next week. But in the long term, even if Brexit goes ahead, it is not sufficient. The policy itself needs to change. In a Commons performance marked by too much complacency and condescension, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, continued to take the cobbling option. His aim is “regulatory alignment” between the EU and the UK (the Irish Sea option has been ditched) rather than convergence or harmonisation. He seeks “mutually recognised rules, mutually recognised inspection”. But this is to offer a superficial and semantic solution to a deep and material problem. Without harmony there is only disharmony or stasis. The economy, jobs and the Irish issues all require a clearer and more engaged approach. That approach is to stay in the customs union and to keep the single market on the negotiating table, as Labour significantly now advocates. Labour’s tougher stance is principled. It marks a clear rejection of the deregulatory liberalism that lurks behind so much Brexit thinking. Tuesday’s Commons exchanges strongly suggest there is in fact a majority in parliament – as there is in the country – for doing this. Staying in the customs union as the best way of protecting the UK economy and avoiding a hard border in Ireland was backed not just by most Labour MPs, but by several Tories and most other parties. Even the DUP could probably live with it. “We are as one,” said the Tory Anna Soubry. “Just do it,” said Labour’s Chris Leslie. Do it indeed. It is the policy whose time has come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/10/best-architecture-2017-rowan-moore-apple-park-grenfell-tower-garden-bridge","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Rowan Moore’s best architecture of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/10/best-architecture-2017-rowan-moore-apple-park-grenfell-tower-garden-bridge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/10/best-architecture-2017-rowan-moore-apple-park-grenfell-tower-garden-bridge","fields":{"headline":"Rowan Moore’s best architecture of 2017","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"If you’re talking about architecture, or housing, or construction, in 2017 it’s hard to look past the charred stump of Grenfell Tower. This image will remain in the collective mind, as it should, long after the year’s novelties have faded. The best that can be hoped for from the disaster is that it will alert public and politicians to the parlous state of housing in Britain – and all parties are now at least talking about large-scale public housing programmes, which not so long ago was politically unthinkable. It might also be noticed that a decades-long tendency to reduce risk, by spreading it among building contractors, project managers and an expanding panoply of consultants – and by marginalising architects – did not, in this case, reduce risk. In other news we found out once again that vast wealth can produce splendiferous buildings, whether the digital billions that paid for Foster and Partners’ visible-from-space Apple Park in Cupertino, or the petrodollars (and offsets from arms sale) that created the Louvre Abu Dhabi. In both cases the architects opted for a gigantic circle, cosmic emblem, symbol of eternity, as their dominant motif. In London, Bloomberg’s billion-pound new HQ opened, also by Fosters, civic-minded and imperial at once. This was also the year when postmodernism, for long derided as the gimcrack style of shyster capitalists of the 1980s, was well and truly rehabilitated. (In this it followed on the heels of brutalism, which was long derided as the inhuman style of arrogant socialists of the 1960s.) Historic England started listing postmodern works. Books were published. Playful reincarnations of the style – post-postmodernism, perhaps – appeared at the Chicago Architecture Biennial. In truth, the late lamented architectural practice FAT was doing much of this before the turn of the millennium, but it takes time for the rest of the world to catch up with true visionaries. Lastly, two victories for good sense. In London the Garden Bridge sank under the weight of its own contradictions and deceptions. In Liverpool the Welsh Streets – well liked, serviceable, refurbishable Victorian terraces – were spared from demolition after years of campaigning by committed local residents and by Save Britain’s Heritage. As with Grenfell, it might be hoped that lessons will be learned from these experiences, but don’t hold your breath.

The eighth annual American Values Survey from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) revealed fractures in the Republican party and deepening polarisation in America. Assaults on government agencies, the judiciary and the media have been a feature of the Trump presidency, prompting critics to draw comparisons with autocrats in Africa, the Middle East and Russia. His strongest supporters do not appear to object. Some 66% of Republicans classified by the researchers as “Always Trump” agreed that “because things have gotten so far off track in this country, we need a leader who is willing to break some rules if that’s what it takes to set things right”, according to a random sample of 2,019 adults. More than half (55%) of all Republicans or Republican-leaning independents hold the same view, although Trump’s sworn opponents disagree. Robert Jones, chief executive of the PRRI, told an audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington on Tuesday: “Among the ‘Never Trump’ camp, only 35% agree that this kind of authoritarian leader is the kind we need.” Nearly a year into his wildly unorthodox presidency, the survey shows Trump retaining diehard loyalty but hemorrhaging support elsewhere. Just over four in 10 Americans (41%) approve of the job he is doing. A majority (54%) disapprove. But 84% of Republicans, including more than nine in 10 “strong” Republicans, approve of the job Trump is doing as president. More than seven in 10 white evangelicals approve. Nearly a third of white evangelical Protestants say there is almost nothing Trump could do to lose their approval. Still, around one in three Republicans say they would prefer the 2020 GOP presidential nominee be someone other than Trump. There has been speculation that moderates such as Ohio governor John Kasich could mount a challenge. Jones said: “After a tumultuous first year in office, a significant minority of Republicans would prefer another candidate in 2020. But key Republican base groups such as white evangelical Protestants are maintaining their commitment to the president.” If the 2018 midterm elections were held today, 44% of registered voters would support the Democrat while 37% would vote Republican. But as the current US Senate race in Alabama involving alleged sexual abuser Roy Moore has illustrated, tribal divisions run deep. Negative views of the other party among partisans are nearly identical. A majority of Republicans (52%) say Democratic policies are so misguided they present a threat to the country; 39% believe Democratic policies are misguided but not dangerous. Democrats hold similarly negative attitudes toward Republicans: most (54%) feel Republicans policies pose a threat to the country while 38% believe they are simply misguided. Trump has been accused of exploiting such divisions for political gain across a range of flashpoint issues. More than eight in 10 (86%) Republicans say athletes should be required to stand during the national anthem; fewer than one in three (32%) Democrats agree. More than eight in 10 (84%) Republicans believe Confederate monuments are symbols of southern pride rather than racism, a view shared by only 40% of Democrats. And eight in 10 (79%) Republicans believe most reporters have a personal or political agenda, compared to only 31% of Democrats. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics &amp; Public Policy Center and author of The Working Class Republican, told the audience at Brookings: “I think what it means to be a Republican under Trump is to be scared. “What drove appeal for Donald Trump in the primaries, and what allowed him to unify a very hesitant party behind him, and now turn them into loyal fans, has been a sense of fear among different groups of Republicans.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/05/sex-lies-and-the-special-relationship","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T19:23:27Z","webTitle":"Sex, lies and the special relationship | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/05/sex-lies-and-the-special-relationship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/05/sex-lies-and-the-special-relationship","fields":{"headline":"Sex, lies and the special relationship","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In recent months, the bizarre behaviour of Donald Trump has left many in the UK worried about the connection with Britain’s “closest ally” (Retweeting Britain First, 29 November). As a Canadian, I find it odd to hear that the US is considered by Britons to be their closest ally. In the great wars of the last century, Americans initially profited from neutrality, delaying entry for three years, until 1917 and 1942; and in the case of the second world war they only committed to the war when they were directly attacked. (In 1941 then Senator Truman even proposed to aid Germany if the Russians appeared to be winning in the East.) Canada and Australia, in contrast, immediately entered both wars alongside Britain. Of more recent vintage, Canadians and Australians fought alongside allied forces in Afghanistan. But we didn’t drag the UK into the Iraq debacle. If you want to know who your true allies are, ask who was there for you when you were in need, and who dragged you into a foolish, unjustified war on false pretences. Aidan Hollis Professor of economics, University of Calgary, Canada • I share Jonathan Freedland’s keenness to ditch the “special relationship” (The special relationship is a delusion, 2 December), which, as he says, the US does not view as we do and about which the UK is unrealistic. However, it might not be straightforward to end it. Just as the Brexit negotiations are exposing how much national independence the UK lost in the civil sphere by being in the EU, so ending the close US-UK link would reveal just how dependent the UK is on the US in the military sphere, for procurement for Trident and conventional defence. Placing the relationship on a more hard-headed basis would take time. John Webster London • You can’t assume that most of what Trump says is the truth, writes Jonathan Freedland, “as you would for a normal occupant of that office”. Has Freedland forgotten Bill Clinton’s public statement in 1998: “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky”? Or the lies and deception told by President George W Bush to justify the invasion of Iraq in 2003? Or, indeed, the 2012 New York Times report that noted President Obama had “embraced a disputed method for counting civilian casualties” of US drone strikes that “in effect counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants”?

That is where the Financial Conduct Authority, fairly or not, now finds itself. It chose not to publish the high-profile report into Royal Bank of Scotland’s handling of 6,000 small and medium-sized businesses because it feared being sued. The FCA had other reasons, but the legal worry is the one that will fuel the suspicion that the full horrors of what went on within RBS’ now-disbanded Global Restructuring Group (GRG) are being kept from public view. “Publication of the final report would expose the FCA to an unacceptable risk of successful legal action by current/former RBS managers for unfair treatment,” say FCA minutes from 2016, first reported by the Times. A timid watchdog, then? In defence of the FCA, one could make four points. First, the regulator can’t simply wish away the legal risks. Second, if it published the report after Maxwellisation – the process by which those criticised are allowed to respond – the resulting document might be full of redactions. Third, the FCA is still investigating events and does not want to jeopardise that effort. Fourth, the recent public summary of the report was judged to be mostly “fair and balanced” by the QC appointed by the Treasury select committee to give an opinion. That was the report that revealed that 92% of sampled businesses within GRG suffered some form or “inappropriate treatment”. Those factors, however, will not clear the air. The FCA minutes acknowledge that full publication would “increase transparency and minimise any perception that we have tried to fetter the report in some way”. Then there is the extremely awkward fact that Promontory, the consultancy that compiled the so-called skilled person’s report for the FCA, thought it “was written in a way that meant it could be published”. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, should keep pressing. It was only political pressure that forced the FCA to publish a summary of findings in the first place. It falls to her committee to tell us whether the FCA is still dragging its feet or making excuses. A definitive answer is needed. ‘So many flashing red lights’ “There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count,” the fund manager Neil Woodford declared the other day. He was talking about stock markets in general but one could say the same about one of his pet stocks, the money-lender Provident Financial. The latest warning concerns Moneybarn, the division that lends to people with poor credit records who want to buy secondhand cars. It was previously regarded as the one part of Provident Financial that was vaguely stable. No longer. The FCA is investigating the unit “in relation to the processes applied to affordability assessments for vehicle finance and the treatment of customers in financial difficulties”. The bland wording offers few clues about the seriousness of the investigation, but the timing could hardly be worse. In August, Provident ousted chief executive Peter Crook, issued a calamitous profits warning and cancelled its dividend after a botched rejig of its core doorstep lending business. It also confessed that credit card operation, Vanquis, its most profitable division, is under investigation by the FCA for issues that sound similar to those that have cropped up with Moneybarn – the fair treatment of customers, in that case relating to a product that allowed borrowers to freeze their debts. To compound the difficulties, chair Manjit Wolstenholme, who was filling the executive vacuum, died suddenly last month. The net result is that Provident is looking to hire both a chairman and a chief executive at a moment of corporate crisis. The share price has collapsed from £32 in April to 790p, so it’s a bit late for Woodford, who has stuck with his 21% stake, to have any regrets. To almost everybody else, however, Provident will surely look uninvestable in its current state. Betting against Netflix Netflix is turning us all into stay-at-home couch potatoes, or so it is said, so here’s a brave bet: Cineworld, the UK-listed cinema group that also runs the Picturehouse chain, is paying $5.8bn (£4.3bn) to buy the much bigger US operator Regal Entertainment Group. In the process, Cineworld, which also operates in central and eastern Europe, will become the second largest cinema owner in the world with 9,500 screens. When this deal leaked last week, Cineworld gave its investors a heart attack – the shares fell by almost a fifth. One can understand why. Depending on your point of view, the financial firepower needed to pull off this takeover is impressive or frightening. Cineworld, currently worth £1.5bn, will raise £1.7bn via a rights issue and take on borrowing facilities of £3bn. On day one, the enlarged business will have net debt four times the size of its top-line profits. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the brothers whose family fund owns 28% of Cineworld, have managed to pay down debt quickly after previous takeovers, so they know the territory.

The Hairy Bikers twin deep-fill pie maker (£19.99, robertdyas.co.uk) is an electrically heated ceramic press, used to seal and cook pastry hulls. Why? Who ate all the pies? You did: they were designed for one. Sweet legitimacy. Well? It’s ironic I’m reviewing an individual pie maker from the Hairy Bikers, because due to social anxiety, I can’t really handle bars. I SAID I CAN’T HAN–forget it. You want to know more about the gadget. It’s a deep-fill, twin machine, which makes sense, since the TV cooks are a twin machine themselves. Unless Deep Phil is one of their mates, a hog-bound philosopher who reads Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and communes with the duende on the Andalucian trails? (I checked the spelling; it’s deep-fill. Stand down, everyone.) Let’s open her up and see what she can do. I preheat the machine, use the provided pastry section to cut a disc – fluted for flexibility – that lines the ceramic interior. I add precooked filling. Flipping the cutter produces a smaller disc, to lid the pie. All my life, people have asked me to shut my pie hole, so now I do, clip-locking the clamshell. There are no temperature or time dials, no app-enabled extra content. You don’t apply egg wash via Bluetooth. It’s basically a sandwich toaster for pies, which I find refreshing. It’s not perfect – the concave lid means the pastry tops brown at a completely different rate to the rest. The biggest problem is how to plate the things. “Use a spoon”, advises the leaflet, but the device’s walls are deep and the pie is sunk snug to them, with fragile sides. You can’t extract it with a spoon any more than you could re-pot a plant with chopsticks. Eventually, I tip it out, trying not to maim myself on hot ceramic. I have to say, it’s a fine figure of a dish. Is there anything more comforting than a pie of one’s own? No. I tried wet chicken in gravy, then a crumbly stuffing, with both fillings retained faultlessly. I don’t even mind their non-artisanal appearance. In an age of individualism, the cookie-cutter mentality is strangely welcome. Deep Phil say: don’t be anxious; we’re all one, dude. Any downside? You can only cut one pie per sheet of shop-bought shortcrust, which is wasteful. I could make my own pastry, but no one likes those people. Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard? Counter?

While some cities and towns have seen stations spruced up, the public suffer from often late, expensive and frequently overcrowded train services. While the cack-handed rollout of infrastructure improvements has led to cancellations and delays on the network, commuters saw ticket prices rise at twice the rate of their wages between 2010 and 2016. Tuesday’s news that rail passengers will be hit by the largest fare hikes in five years next month will do nothing but confirm the view that the public are being taken for a ride. The situation, it seems, is one where private companies reap the benefits, while passengers bear the costs. Ministers shouldn’t allow this state of affairs to continue. The reason for their apparent inability to sort out the railways is that the Conservative party drove through the privatisation of British Rail two decades ago for largely ideological reasons. Ministers still believe that only competition and private sector fizz will make the railways profitable and customer-friendly. However, last week the transport secretary was forced to bail out a joint venture led by Stagecoach with Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group. Their franchise on the east coast mainline between London and Scotland had pledged to pay the Treasury around £3bn to run the service until 2023. Now it will be replaced by a “public-private partnership” in 2020, despite track upgrades and new rolling stock. In exiting early, the Stagecoach-Virgin venture could end up paying the taxpayer approximately £1bn – about a third of what it promised – and around the same amount the service earned when it was operated by a public sector firm. There is a good case to return more train operating companies to state hands. Three in four voters, disillusioned by high prices and poor service, back renationalising the railways. Many train lines in Britain are run by state-backed European rail firms. So why not in Britain? Ministers’ plans to make train operators and the state-owned Network Rail work together is a tacit recognition that splitting the management of trains from tracks in the 1990s was wrong. The dogma of free markets has been shaken by taxpayer-funded rescues. Nobel laureate Maurice Allais thought the state should run a few firms in each industry to make private companies up their game. It’d be a good time to test that thesis on Britain’s railways."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/10/bach-small-gifts-review-andreas-scholl-dorothee-oberlinger-ensemble-1700","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T07:25:29Z","webTitle":"Bach: Small Gifts CD review – riches galore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/10/bach-small-gifts-review-andreas-scholl-dorothee-oberlinger-ensemble-1700","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/10/bach-small-gifts-review-andreas-scholl-dorothee-oberlinger-ensemble-1700","fields":{"headline":"Bach: Small Gifts CD review – riches galore","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The title Small Gifts is taken from the frontispiece of Bach’s six Brandenburg concertos, Nos 2 and 4 of which feature here.

MP Heidi Allen wiped away tears as Labour’s Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, described persuading a man not to kill himself and spoke of another man who told him about his “lucky week” going to a funeral “so they could finish off the food”. The debate came as the government pledged it will make universal credit reports from between 2012 and 2015 available to the select committee in a concession to Labour, but work and pensions secretary David Gauke said they should not be made public. Gauke said the government had nothing to hide on universal credit, hinting that the project assessment reports would not give any sort of damning indictment of the flagship welfare reform. Labour said the government had so far ignored a ruling in August by the information commissioner that five of the reports should be released to campaigners because their publication would be in the public interest. Government sources said they would continue to challenge their public release, even though the reports will be given to the committee, after Labour used an arcane parliamentary device called a “humble address” to the Queen, requesting ministers release project assessment reviews conducted into the welfare reform. The Information Commissioner’s Office has already said the papers should be published publicly and in full – as that is specifically in the public interest. During the debate, a visibly upset Allen said she was pleased how MPs were working cross-party to improve the system. “I’m humbled by the words from my honourable, good friend from Birkenhead [Field],” she said. “No government is perfect, no benefits system is perfect, no debate, no motion is perfect, but by God we work together and make this better.” Field intervened to give Allen a chance to compose herself, saying: “I’m just amazed for the first time I’ve been able to report those events publicly without weeping. “I’m so affected by them, I’m affected as she is. That’s the debate we’re really having – how do we represent here the desperateness of many of our constituents when many of us feel we can’t offer them hope.” Earlier Field said his constituents were being hit by the cumulative impact of reforms under Labour and Conservative governments. “On my last surgery Friday, for the first time ever a gentleman rose after we had spoken, I had tried to persuade him not to commit suicide, such was the desperateness that he saw the future for himself, and I realised the hand that shook my hand was wet. He’d been crying. And the hand that shook my hand was the hand that wiped away those tears,” he said. Gauke said he was granting the request on an “exceptional basis” and said the reports would only give a partial picture of the policy’s impact, given how it had subsequently been revised. He said he would confidentially provide the reports to the select committee, and “hope and expect that the documents will not be disclosed further”. Field hinted he was uneasy about the condition that his committee keep the reports confidential, and that he would seek guidance from Commons Speaker John Bercow about “what sense of secrecy or of honour bind us” when they get the documents. Labour and some Tory MPs have repeatedly voiced concern about the long wait faced by fresh claimants to be paid benefits once they apply for universal credit, originally six weeks but reduced to five in last month’s budget. The Department for Work and Pensions has said no claimant needed to wait that long without funds, saying emergency payments to cover the period can be requested and received within three days and paid back over 12 months. Speaking in the debate, Gauke accused Labour politicians and the media of “scaremongering”, which he said was leading families to believe they had no way of accessing help.The shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said the reports would give a “greater insight into the scale of their implementation and design failures during the mismanagement of the programme and must be published unredacted and unedited”.

At first glance this is a victory for the offshore lobby, who have been fighting to keep the worst offenders, many of them British dependencies, outside of the hall of shame. Not one of the nine UK territories that made an earlier longlist has been called out. Hurricane damage means the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla and Turks &amp; Caicos are in a group of eight that have until February to get their house in order. The list of non-cooperative jurisdictions, to give this initiative its proper name, contains 17 entries. Many, such as Namibia, Mongolia and American Samoa, are small countries or isolated regimes without major powers to defend them. There are some notable exceptions: Panama is deservedly singled out, so too is the United Arab Emirates. But the real action is on an accompanying “grey list”. It contains 47 names, including the Cayman Islands, Vanuatu, Guernsey, Jersey, Bermuda and the Isle of Man. Followers of the Paradise Papers will have noticed the last two featured prominently in the latest revelations of offshore antics. All have a corporation tax rate of zero. The six named above have been singled out for failing a crucial test – fair taxation. In particular, these islands “facilitate offshore structures which attract profits without real economic activity”. Their laws allow companies to book profits without ever really doing business on their shores. These sorts of laws have allowed trillions in untaxed earnings to be syphoned out of Europe’s big consumer markets. Think of the sportswear brand Nike, which used Bermuda and the Netherlands to amass a $12bn offshore cash pile. Greylist members have promised to address tax fairness, transparency and other issues. They have until the end of 2018 to do so. Progress will be monitored by an obscure entity called the European code of conduct group on business taxation, which is made up of tax experts from member states and chaired by the Italian mandarin Fabrizia Lapecorella. If improvements don’t materialise, these jurisdictions could be added to the blacklist, which is set to be updated annually. So, what are the penalties for being blacklisted? Unfortunately, none have been agreed. Pierre Moscovici, the French politician who has led this initiative in his role as finance commissioner in Brussels, is urging member states to pick and choose from a menu of sanctions. The most draconian is withholding taxes: profits cannot leave a member state disguised as interest payments on a loan, or royalties, without being taxed in the market where they were made. At the other end of the scale, tax inspectors could decide to pay special attention to any structures involving these jurisdictions. Many probably already do so. Moscovici is encouraging member states to act unilaterally on sanctions if they cannot agree as a group. France, which has been calling for bigger contributions to state coffers by Google and Apple, may decide to bite. While this blacklist does not pose an immediate threat to tax havens, it is not without teeth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/10/jime-james-tribute-to-2-review-dramatic-reworkings","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T08:00:30Z","webTitle":"Jim James: Tribute to 2 review – dramatic reworkings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/10/jime-james-tribute-to-2-review-dramatic-reworkings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/10/jime-james-tribute-to-2-review-dramatic-reworkings","fields":{"headline":"Jim James: Tribute to 2 review – dramatic reworkings","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Cosmic rockers My Morning Jacket aren’t the force of old but, as this album of cover versions shows, their frontman’s voice remains a potent instrument.

The removal of “subsidies” following the New Zealand model is not the route to achieving this. Public funding is critical to farmers’ livelihoods – without it, roughly half of farming is uneconomic. Those likely to suffer the most are small- to medium-sized farms already struggling in very tough markets. A fifth of English farms have disappeared in the past 10 years, and the rate is fastest amongst the smallest. Almost a third of farms under 50 hectares vanished between 2005 and 2015. Farm size diversity is key to sustaining rural communities through jobs as well as protecting distinctive local character. It is also crucial to maintaining England’s world-renowned landscapes and diversity of food. We are presented with a once in a lifetime opportunity to create a farming policy framework and new funding model that will support all farmers, rural communities and economies if we are to create the diverse, thriving countryside most of us want to see. Graeme Willis Senior Rural Policy Campaigner, Campaign to Protect Rural England • It is unfair of you to reduce Michael Gove’s record as environment secretary to “presentational gimmicks” (Editorial, 5 December). Few environmentalists regarded Mr Gove as a natural soulmate when he was appointed, but his short time in office has been, on the whole, hugely impressive. The UK stands to lose vital environmental protections when we leave the EU. These must be replaced. We need to carry into UK law the environmental principles (polluter pays, the precautionary principle etc) that underpin policy; and we need a strong, independent watchdog to replicate the beneficial role now played by the European Court of Justice and the European Commission in holding governments to account for their environmental practice. There is a long way to go, but Michael Gove gets this, as he gets the need to address the rising tide of plastic pollution and the alarming erosion of soil quality. What we now need is a much stronger green narrative from other parts of government, not least on housing and transport, and an unequivocal commitment to match and then exceed current EU environmental standards.

Unlike that production, though, this staging of The Tale of Tsar Saltan, directed by Alexander Petrov, is hardly new. Though the production (which the Mariinsky brought to London in 2008) was nominally only 10 years old when the recording was made in 2015, its vivid, cartoon-like costumes and painted sets are re-creations of those for a 1937 version in Leningrad. With some clunky ballet and acting of the kind that gives opera a bad name, it’s a museum piece, though it’s hard to imagine what a grittier, more naturalistic staging of this fairytale work might be like. Rimsky’s score glitters in best fairytale mode, too, and Gergiev’s performance makes it shimmer where it should. There’s some good singing, especially from Irina Churikova as the Tsarina and Albina Shagimuratova as the Swan-Princess, but this isn’t going to make new converts for the Rimsky cause."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/07/readers-recommend-playlist-your-songs-about-education","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T12:00:10Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: your songs about education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/07/readers-recommend-playlist-your-songs-about-education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/07/readers-recommend-playlist-your-songs-about-education","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: your songs about education","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from hundreds of suggestions on last week’s callout. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. After 30 years living in Madrid and a quarter of a century married to my beautiful, flamenco-dancing Spanish wife, one of my favourite regular conversations goes like this: “Andrew, where did you learn Spanish?” “I’m still learning.” And that’s something we learned this week. You never stop learning and, if you’re lucky, you learn what you need to learn – if you’re not, you end up Learning the Game the hard way, as Buddy Holly says in our opener: When she says that you’re the only one she’ll ever love Then you find that you are not the one she’s thinking of Feeling so sad and you’re all alone and blue That’s when you’re learning the game. Next up are the Ramones, who really don’t care for all this learning stuff – and far less for the teachers on Rock‘n’Roll High School. It’s all about kicks, chicks and fun. At least it is while it lasts. Pearl Jam are far more reflective when questioning the value or, perhaps more, the consequences of Education. The final line referencing the seed that grows without knowing why leads us to James Brown and his warning to that seed in Don’t be a Drop Out: “Without an education / You might as well be dead.” Esperanza Spalding’s Black Gold expands on the theme offering a curriculum which reader untergunther says is a “Grade A bid to encourage young black children to educate themselves in pre-colonial African history with a view to drawing strength and pride from their ancestors.” And gaining knowledge to shut out ignorance continues, with Dream Warriors and Gang Starr claiming to have lost their ignorance, as reader nilpferd so neatly states in nominating this: “The eloquence of the title and the rap undermines people’s prejudices that rap was some kind of primal and dangerous street music, the nicely poised wit of the lyrics exploring the idea of musical self-education.” Formal education doesn’t work for all, as Ian Dury and the Blockheads are keen to point out in Jack Shit George (“What did you learn at school today? / Jack shit”). And students can be a pretty unbearable bunch at times. The early 80s university types certainly got under the Specials’ skins in Rat Race: You plan your conversation to impress the college bar Just talking about your Mother and Daddy’s Jaguar Wear your political T-shirt and sacred college scarf Discussing the worlds situation but just for a laugh. I remember that being a favourite on the juke box in the university bar I worked and drank in – we all sang along merrily and without a hint of irony. Student Wankers, the lot of us, as I reckon Peter and the Test Tube Babies would have said. But what about the teachers? Well, as George Michael says in One More Try, not everything they want to teach us is necessarily for our own good. That isn’t going to stop Van Halen in their bid for a little extracurricular activity in Hot for the Teacher.

As his open-topped car sped from his house to the ground, whenever it was forced to stop at the frequent traffic lights, a crowd of admirers would gather, clapping, shouting and begging for autographs. He signed willingly, sometimes holding up the traffic, and when we reached our seats at the cricket ground, he spent almost the entire day signing again. I asked him why he was so generous with his time, particularly as he was really interested in the match. “Look, Derek,” he said. “I owe everything to these people. It’s my way of saying thank you.” He was not only the most handsome leading man in Bollywood, but also the most charming and modest. English-speaking audiences will remember him best in Merchant Ivory films such as The Householder (1963), Shakespeare Wallah (1965) and Heat and Dust (1983), and for these he willingly accepted far less money than for the Bollywood movies that made his name. Trained in the theatre, he took his acting seriously and often laughed at the fact that he had to make three or four Bollywood epics at a time and had no idea as he went from set to set what he was supposed to be doing, and who he was supposed to be doing it with, let alone what he was pretending to sing, as the playback singers did the real business behind the scenes. “It’s all a game,” he told me, “and I am very fortunate to be asked to play it. But sometimes it’s a bit too much.” In fact, he appeared in some of the best Bollywood films of his era, opposite the greatest stars in the business. His looks carried him through all the absurdities of the song-and-dance numbers. Although the list of his hits at the box office is endless, he made a good many bad movies too. As a producer for his own company from the late 1970s to the early 90s, he had less success than he had been used to, despite critically well-received productions such as 36 Chowringee Lane (1981), which starred his wife, Jennifer Kendal. Shashi was a member of the famous Kapoor family, who dominated the Bollywood scene for decades, particularly through the influence of Raj Kapoor, Shashi’s elder brother. Raj made hit films such as Boot Polish (1954), nominated for the Palme d’Or at Cannes, and Shree 420, the highest grossing Indian film of 1955. If Raj was considered the Clark Gable of India, Shashi was his country’s Robert Redford. Born in Kolkata, son of Ramsarni Devi and Prithviraj Kapoor, Shashi was already on the stage as a child in the 40s, acting for his father’s repertory company Prithvi Theatres, as his brothers Raj and Shammi had done before him. The movies soon followed, among them Aag (1948) and Awaara (1951), both directed by Raj, and considered classics now. Shashi then became assistant director for Sunil Dutt, who was making Post Box 999 (1958). Success followed as a leading man in more than 60 Hindi films, in which he appeared with the most notable female stars of the time. One of his favourite leading ladies was Nanda, with whom he made eight films and whom he regarded as his mentor. Others he worked with included Raakhee, Sharmila Tagore, Zeenat Aman, Hema Malini and Parveen Babi. He also made a dozen films with Amitabh Bachchan and appeared with almost all the male stars of the period. He was well paid for his work, but somehow managed to lose much of his fortune, perhaps through sheer generosity and the fact that he was not a good businessman. He became increasingly bored with commercial Hindi movies and charged into films such as Bombay Talkie (1970), Siddhartha (1972), Junoon (1978), New Delhi Times (1986) and In Custody (1994) with some relief. The 70s and early 80s were a good period for more challenging independent films and Shashi took full advantage of the freedom they gave him. Though the cinema made him, theatre was his first love, and he did everything he could to encourage the stage in in Bombay (now Mumbai), with money and help. Shashi’s work in establishing the Prithvi theatre in the city, in memory of his father, was outstanding. Jennifer helped supervise and run the theatre for many years. She was the daughter of Geoffrey Kendal, who had toured the Shakespeareana acting troupe around India, and upon whom Shakespeare Wallah was loosely based. Both Jennifer and her sister, Felicity, acted with Shakespeareana in the 50s. Jennifer and Shashi met in Kolkata in 1956 while each was appearing with their father’s company and they married two years later. It was thought that Shashi never fully recovered from the shock of Jennifer’s death in 1984 from cancer. He died from complications of long-standing heart and liver problems and while in hospital insisted on meeting and attempting to help other patients. He is survived by their three children, Kunal, Karan and Sanjana. • Shashi Kapoor (Balbir Prithviraj Kapoor), actor and producer, born 18 March 1938; died 4 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/06/adam-riches-the-beakington-town-hall-meetings-review-battersea-arts-centre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T13:49:22Z","webTitle":"The Beakington Town Hall Meetings review – Adam Riches' tortoise tombola laughathon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/06/adam-riches-the-beakington-town-hall-meetings-review-battersea-arts-centre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/06/adam-riches-the-beakington-town-hall-meetings-review-battersea-arts-centre","fields":{"headline":"The Beakington Town Hall Meetings review – Adam Riches' tortoise tombola laughathon","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There’s been an incident at Beakington Town Hall, and the mayor is fuming. We councillors – given name badges at the door by Adam Riches’ eager apparatchik – assemble to get to the bottom of the debacle. And until the culprit has been smoked out, no one is leaving. That’s the setup for this pre-Christmas confection from audience participation monster Riches, the latest bespoke festive comedy show at BAC after those by Sara Pascoe, John Kearns and Daniel Kitson in years gone by. But although Riches’ knockabout whodunnit is seasonal only in the sense that it is jolly, The Beakington Town Hall Meetings is about as jolly as it gets. It’s ramshackle, ends anti-climactically and the premise is as thin as the foil atop Riches’ beloved bottles of Yakult. But it is buoyed along by our host’s force of personality, the communal good cheer he deftly stokes – and several instances of winning oddity. These include two audience stooges being eyeballed by a live tortoise, the sole survivor of a tombola massacre that has threatened to ruin Christmas in Beakington, “a town so backwards it could almost be twinned with itself”. Another of the show’s delights finds Riches’ sidekick, Ben Target, playing the embodiment of tension itself – a delicious device, which makes a virtue of the ticklish terror Riches tends to incite among his audience. In fact, the participation tonight is mild by his standards. In character as swaggering alpha male Victor Legit, Riches has his audience members – sorry, suspects – get busy with watermelon, party poppers and a sprig of mistletoe. It’s often ridiculous but never overbearing. Nor is it inconsequential, the show’s sleuthing conceit bringing to Riches’ usually nonsensical audience harassment an unfamiliar dramatic legitimacy. It ends abruptly, just as we think the perpetrator is to get their public comeuppance. But until then it’s constant good fun: Riches challenges male punters to a roaring contest, shares a spring roll between 60 councillors and plays attendees at this kangaroo court off against one another in his search for the tortoise slayer. Would you sacrifice yourself to protect a stranger from Riches’ clutches? That’s not a test I’d pass with much distinction. But mercifully, no audience members are harmed in the making of his latest interactive comedy. I only hope the same can be said of the tortoises. At Battersea Arts Centre, London, until 9 December.

The Christmas movie of 2017 has turned out to be a cheerfully unpleasant and bracingly nasty horror film: an ingenious and efficient black-comic shocker unfolding in real time over one seasonal evening in a prosperous American home. The twists and lurches are interspersed with bouts of boisterous carol-singing. It looks in many ways like a garden-variety home invasion drama, with hints of Home Alone and Funny Games. But there are suggestions of something older, like a well-made stage play. Dial S for Slasher? Levi Miller plays Luke, a sensitive, somewhat pampered 12-year-old with a major crush on his babysitter Ashley (Olivia DeJonge), who has come round to look after him while his parents – amusing cameos for Virginia Madsen and Patrick Warburton – are out at some yuletide bash. Naughty Luke has been swigging booze, and he has put a horror film on the home entertainment system, apparently hoping Ashley will cuddle up to him on the couch in fear. Then a dark shadow appears at the window, the phone starts ringing and no one’s there.

How Quentin Tarantino could save Star Trek","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If you were to draw up a shortlist of likely directors for the next Star Trek movie, auteurish cinephile, renowned grump and all-round cuss-enthusiast Quentin Tarantino would probably not be on it. And yet we may be plotting a course towards exactly that. QT has pitched a Trek idea to producer JJ Abrams, who is so impressed that he’s going to assemble a writers’ room to hammer it out. Tarantino could feasibly direct. Yes, it sounds like spinning-bowtie, box-of-frogs madness: a cray-cray cross-pollination of eye-watering obscenity and Prime Directive piousness. But imagine Tarantino boldly going where no one has gone before. It could crash and burn like the USS Vengeance. Or – and try to seriously picture it for a second – it could be utterly fantastic. It’s definitely the right time for the franchise to offer up a WTF like this. The last movie, Star Trek Beyond, felt like a film that didn’t quite quite know what to do with itself. It was the third in the rehatched series but not a trilogy-closing culmination. It felt like a placeholder, an extended big-budget TV episode that left its characters much in the same way it had found them. There were no real stakes, no sense of finality. With a new Star Wars movie seemingly every six weeks, Abrams contracted for Episode IX and a Trek TV series currently sating Trekkies’ appetites, clamour for big-screen Enterprise outings has waned. Put simply, Trek needs a sharp kick up the backside. And it’s hard to think of a more steel-toecapped wallop in the fundament than one administered by Tarantino. It’s not as weird a fit as it sounds, either. Tarantino has shown he’s got the action chops a tentpole like this requires. Both of Kill Bill’s volumes are stuffed with some of the finest and most creative duff-em-up sequences of the last two decades, while Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds were no slouches when called on for action. He’s never done squillion-dollar CGI spectacle, but neither had Taika Waititi until he made Thor: Ragnarok. It seems to be something you can learn. Tarantino might have to tone down the claret-drenched ultraviolence a tad to ensure that all-important 12A rating, but he could probably manage that if he tried really, really hard. It’s not action competence that makes Tarantino such an intriguing Trek proposition, though. Previous Treks each had a fine actor as the primary antagonists – Eric Bana, Idris Elba, Bendleworth Crumbleflatch – but none will go down as an all-time great baddies. Something was missing: for all they menaced, there was little actual menace. Tarantino is the man who made the lovely Christoph Waltz a beast of clammy nightmares; who turned Michael Madsen into a Pavlovian trigger for the flopsweats; who, in Django Unchained, imbued Leo DiCaprio with so much malice people now cheer when he freezes to death in Titanic. A 12A certificate is no barrier to this: look at Heath Ledger’s Joker. Star Trek needs a good, three-dimensional baddie. Tarantino can deliver in spades. More importantly, though, Trek is an examination of friendship, shining most vibrantly when Kirk, Spock and Bones are bickering and riffing off each other. This is where Tarantino makes the most sense. Even if he doesn’t write all the dialogue himself, you know any chat-heavy sequences will be snappy, bouncy and assuredly naturalistic. New Trek has strived for this before, and has achieved it on occasion. Tarantino would knock it out of the park. He can do action. He can do shocks. He can do dialogue. He can do suspense. He could provide a shot of adrenaline to the heart of this directionless franchise. It’ll probably never happen. This is likely all Hollywood hearsay and fanboy what-ifery. The odds of a studio giving Tarantino final edit of an action epic, or the chances of him agreeing to do the movie without it, are slim indeed. But … maybe. Just maybe. If the sharp-chinned one sticks to his word to retire after 10 movies, this, after the Manson murders movie he’s currently got in development, would make his Trek the final film of his career. What a typically unexpected, Tarantino-esque way to go out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/06/saga-shares-slump-profit-warning-monarch-airlines","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T13:57:59Z","webTitle":"Saga shares slump by more than 25% after profit warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/06/saga-shares-slump-profit-warning-monarch-airlines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/06/saga-shares-slump-profit-warning-monarch-airlines","fields":{"headline":"Saga shares slump by more than 25% after profit warning","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Shares in Saga, the over-50s travel and insurance company, have slumped after it warned profits would be hit by factors including the collapse of Monarch Airlines. When Monarch went into administration in October, resulting in the UK’s biggest peacetime repatriation of holidaymakers stranded abroad, Saga had to switch to other carriers and said this would add £2m to its costs. The company said its insurance division also faced “more challenging trading”. A spokesman for Saga blamed intense competition in motor and home insurance, “with some players aggressively targeting volume growth”. Saga shares tumbled more than 25% to 135.70p in early trading on Wednesday. The company expects underlying pretax profits to grow by 1-2% in the year to 31 January, followed by a 5% drop in profits next year. The firm has looked hard at its cost base and taken action to save £10m annually from next year, but the changes will result in a one-off cost of £4m. They include about 100 redundancies out of a total workforce of about 4,500. Sources told the Guardian that the job losses included senior executives at Saga magazine as well as in marketing and financial services. Lance Batchelor, the chief executive, said: “Against a backdrop of some challenging trading conditions in our final quarter, we continue to develop the business for the long term.” In September, Saga unveiled plans for a concierge-style scheme offering customers “VIP access” to events and “money can’t buy” experiences as part of an effort to rebrand itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/06/two-down-ashes-way-back-for-england-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T15:32:18Z","webTitle":"Two down with three Ashes matches to play – is there any way back for England? | Vic Marks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/06/two-down-ashes-way-back-for-england-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/06/two-down-ashes-way-back-for-england-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Two down with three Ashes matches to play – is there any way back for England?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In Brisbane and Adelaide England have managed to tantalise. They have not been uniformly hopeless. They clung on at the Gabba for three days and there were moments when they could have taken control of that Test. Conversely in Adelaide, having played ineptly for two and a half days, they bowled out Australia for 138 in their second innings and so conjured up the possibility of a historic victory. On the fourth day they rose again and allowed their fans to dream. On the fifth grim reality returned. All out for 233, defeated by 120 runs. Nonetheless there have been moments when the soft underbelly of their opponents has been visible. This is not a vintage Australia side. Darren Lehmann is not a backward looking bloke, which is just as well. If he was he would surely look at some of his batsmen and then wonder how it was he played only 27 Tests for Australia and Stuart Law played just one. How Steve Smith would love a Lehmann and a Law in his middle order – so would Joe Root for that matter. But the capacity to tantalise butters no parsnips. Look at the score; England head to Perth 2-0 down despite their little renaissance towards the end of the Test in Adelaide. Australia may have recovered from 2-0 down under Don Bradman in the summer of 1936-37 but there are no more recent precedents to cheer Root and his tourists. The analysts will have to be at their most inventive to bring some good feeling to their table. At the start of the second Test there was a hint of desperation in the England camp peculiarly allied with a timidity among their bowlers. There have been worse insertions by an England captain in Ashes history: 2002 and 1982 immediately spring to mind and the history books – and John Woodcock, one of the few witnesses left – acknowledge that putting in Australia at Brisbane in 1954 did not work out so well. But the simple fact Root opted to diverge from the orthodox tells of his uncertainty that his bowlers would be able to take 20 wickets cheaply enough. After the second innings in Brisbane he lacked confidence in them. So he gambled. He was not convinced that orthodoxy would work. Moreover his bowlers, however experienced, seemed to feel the pressure on that first morning. They did not bowl dreadfully in the opening overs of the match but they did bowl cagily; they were wary of bowling too full and there was not much zip – in contrast to their efforts in the second innings, albeit in the devious dark. A captain who is conscious of the limitations of his attack is more prone to try to pluck rabbits out of his hat; it is a ploy that seldom works. England’s pace bowlers may be as skilful as their counterparts but they are slower. The misgivings about England’s attack are most easily identified when contrasting Nathan Lyon and Moeen Ali. Admittedly Moeen has been handicapped by injuries to his side and his spinning finger but there has been a gulf between this pair. Lyon is fizzing the ball down and, critically, it is dipping at the end of its flight path. He is tormenting England’s left-handers, including Alastair Cook, who had few problems with the pacemen but looked like a novice against the finger spinner. Ten of Lyon’s 11 victims in the series bat left-handed (the next generation surely requires ambidextrous batsmen to combat quality off-spinners or left-armers). It may be we all underestimated him before the series and therefore did not consider the best way to attack him. There was not much talk before the Ashes tour party was announced about the need for right‑handed batsmen. Now we bemoan the fact the one spare batsman, Gary Ballance, is also left-handed. Lyon has bowled extremely well and quickly; he has also made the ball turn, all of which makes it very difficult for left‑handers to attack him. This explains why the push to promote Jonny Bairstow above Moeen has nothing to do with psychology and everything to do with strategy. Of the left-handers Moeen may be more inclined to attack Lyon than the others but he has also been dismissed by him four times out of four. Yet the blunt and difficult truth is England will have to attack him successfully to get back in the series and they need their right-handers at the crease for much longer if that is going to happen. It should be more difficult for Lyon to prevail at the Waca where the ball seldom turns – at least it never used to. One suspects in his last Test there John Lewis, the curator, would like to finish with a fast, bouncy pitch that has been the USP of one of cricket’s iconic grounds. However, there are doubts whether this is still possible. In recent times the Waca has been more of a haven for batsmen than fast bowlers. There are, at least, a couple of pluses for England post-Adelaide. They discovered Craig Overton has potential. For the moment he may be a callow Test cricketer but he clearly has the stomach for the fight. This was evident as much from his batting in the first innings – remember how he had endured three ducks in Australia before taking guard in his first Test – and his fielding, in particular the way he clung on to a tricky skier down at long leg. He did not bowl too badly either, which made Root’s preference for Moeen on the fourth morning all the more puzzling. Overton has surely leapt above Jake Ball in the pecking order. It was also encouraging to see Chris Woakes bounding up to the crease in the second innings when it all started to click again. And the team are still trying their best, which was not always the impression four years ago. Unfortunately that may not be enough. Over the next few days there will be much talk of Durham’s Mark Wood, who is earmarked to play in the two-day match in Perth that begins on Saturday against a raw Cricket Australia XI. He has not bowled at 90mph for a long time; he has barely bowled with a red ball in the last six months. Sadly this is likely to be yet another example of straw-clutching, a habitual exercise for Englishmen on the majority of Ashes tours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/06/donald-trump-jerusalem-statement-capital-israel-middle-east","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T10:59:39Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump’s Jerusalem statement is an act of diplomatic arson | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/donald-trump-jerusalem-statement-capital-israel-middle-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/donald-trump-jerusalem-statement-capital-israel-middle-east","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump’s Jerusalem statement is an act of diplomatic arson","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Not content with taking the US to the brink of nuclear conflict with North Korea, Donald Trump is now set to apply his strategy of international vandalism to perhaps the most sensitive geopolitical hotspot in the world. With a speech scheduled for later today that’s expected to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and reaffirm a pledge to move the US embassy to the city, he is walking into a bone-dry forest with a naked flame. For the status of Jerusalem is the most intractable issue in what is often described as the world’s most intractable conflict. It is the issue that has foiled multiple efforts at peacemaking over several decades. Both Israelis and Palestinians insist that Jerusalem must be the capital of their states, present and future, and that that status is non-negotiable. But it’s not just important to them. The Old City of Jerusalem contains the holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest mosque in Islam, to say nothing of its enormous significance to Christians, meaning that even the slightest move there is felt by billions. It is a place where diplomats have learned to tread with extreme care. There is a reason why no US administration, no matter how pro-Israel, has changed its policy toward the city in the nearly 70 years since Israel’s founding. But here comes Trump, oblivious to precedent and indeed history – even in a place where history is a matter of life and death – stomping through this delicate thicket, trampling over every sensitivity. The risk is obvious, with every Arab government – including those loyal to Washington – now issuing sharp warnings on the perils of this move, almost all of them using the same word: “dangerous”. Let us be clear. Most advocates of an eventual two-state solution believe the only way to resolve the Jerusalem issue is for it to serve as the capital of both states: East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Then, and only then, would be the right moment to start moving embassies and issuing statements of recognition. Until that day, any act that pre-empts an agreement between the two parties on the city’s future is reckless and needlessly incendiary. How incendiary? Recall that the second intifada – which turned into a bloody two or more years of death for Israelis at the hands of Palestinian suicide bombers, and death for Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli military – started after a 45-minute visit in late 2000 by the then leader of the Israeli opposition, Ariel Sharon, to the place that represents the nuclear core of this most radioactive conflict, the site Muslims call the Haram al-Sharif and Jews call the Temple Mount. Bear that in mind when you hear the Palestinian ambassador to London say that Trump’s move amounts to “declaring war on 1.5 billion Muslims”. Why is Trump doing it? Perhaps he wants to show that he’s honouring his campaign pledges: now, along with his tax cut for the rich and his travel ban from mainly Muslim countries, he can tick the box marked Jerusalem. He said he would do it, and now he’s doing it, and to hell with the consequences. That’s a style of politics his base – including those Christian evangelicals hawkish on Israel – seems to like. The rest of the world will draw some comfort from the fact that no immediate move of the embassy is imminent; that it may not even happen before Trump’s term expires in January 2021. Perhaps this will be like Trump’s break from the Paris accords on climate change – more symbolic than concrete. But that is to forget that in the Israel-Palestine conflict, symbols matter. Which is why other world leaders, and senior US politicians, need to close ranks in saying this act is wrong and does not speak for them. They need to signal that a saner policy might prevail once Trump has gone. The trouble is that by then, given the way violence in that region can spread and escalate, it might be too late."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/06/ryan-shazier-spinal-injury-pittsburgh-steelers-cincinnati-bengals-nfl","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T12:37:11Z","webTitle":"Ryan Shazier thanks supporters as doctors monitor spine injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/06/ryan-shazier-spinal-injury-pittsburgh-steelers-cincinnati-bengals-nfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/06/ryan-shazier-spinal-injury-pittsburgh-steelers-cincinnati-bengals-nfl","fields":{"headline":"Ryan Shazier thanks supporters as doctors monitor spine injury","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ryan Shazier has thanked those who sent him messages of support after he suffered a spinal injury during Monday night’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker was hurt while making a tackle and was treated on the field for several minutes receiving treatment from medical staff. He did not appear to have any movement in the lower half of his body as he was strapped to a board and carted off the field. Shazier was still at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center on Tuesday night as doctors continue to monitor him and carry out tests. “He will continue to be monitored and treated by the neurosurgery experts at UC Medical Center until he has been cleared to return to Pittsburgh,” said a statement from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “It is expected that Ryan will undergo additional tests and evaluation over the next 24 to 48 hours, and he will then return to Pittsburgh to receive further evaluation and care at UPMC.” NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport says Shazier has regained “some movement in his lower extremities” although the extent of his injury is still unclear as doctors evaluate the 25-year-old further. On Tuesday night Shazier tweeted his thanks to supporters. “Thank you for the prayers. Your support is uplifting to me and my family,” he wrote on Twitter. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said it has been a difficult time for the team. “It was a tough evening. Ryan is a trooper,” Tomlin said on Tuesday. “[I] had an opportunity to spend some time with him; he is in really good spirits, tough guy. He has great support from family and loved ones there. It was painful to get on that plane last night. That’s life. We realize and understand he is in really good hands and getting expert medical care. He also challenged us to move on with what it is we need to move on, and he is with us as well.” Shazier’s injury came during a brutal game between the Bengals and Steelers, whose rivalry goes back years. Monday night’s game was particularly ugly – in addition to Shazier’s injury, two players were given one-game suspensions for illegal hits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/06/jeremy-corbyn-attacks-theresa-may-over-brexit-talks-shambles","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T13:31:06Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn attacks Theresa May over Brexit talks 'shambles'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/06/jeremy-corbyn-attacks-theresa-may-over-brexit-talks-shambles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/06/jeremy-corbyn-attacks-theresa-may-over-brexit-talks-shambles","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn attacks Theresa May over Brexit talks 'shambles'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of presiding over “a shambles” in the Brexit negotiations, using a noisy prime minister’s questions in the wake of abortive talks in Brussels to charge Theresa May with having no answers on a future deal. May – who faced regular mocking laughter from the Labour benches – insisted she was confident Brexit talks would reach the next stage on schedule, and accused Labour of being divided over what outcome it wanted to see. However, she also faced a difficult time from some of her own backbenchers, with three fervently pro-Brexit Conservative MPs seeking reassurance over possible concessions to the EU during talks earlier in the week. Jacob Rees-Mogg asked whether May need to “apply a new coat of paint to her red lines, because I fear on Monday they were beginning to look a bit pink”, while Peter Bone jokingly asked if he should accompany her to Brussels to stiffen her resolve. Bernard Jenkin was more pointed still over the idea the European court of justice might keep some role in UK affairs. Many nations sought free trade deals, he said: “But none of these opportunities will come our way if we remain shackled to EU regulations after we’ve left the EU.” Corbyn said the collapse on Monday of an initial deal with the European commission over the DUP’s objections to plans for Northern Ireland were indicative of a wider malaise in May’s government. “Eighteen months since the referendum, no answers to the questions,” the Labour leader told the Commons. “Today they haven’t yet concluded phase one, and the DUP appear to be ruling the roost and telling her what to do. “Whether it’s Brexit, the national health service, social care, our rip-off railways, rising child poverty, growing pensioner poverty, or universal credit, this government is unable to solve important issues facing this country. In fact it’s making them worse. “The economy is slowing, more people are in poverty, Brexit negotiations in a shambles. This government is clearly not fit for the future. If they can’t negotiate a good deal wouldn’t it be better if they just got out of the way?” May responded by accusing Corbyn of regularly “making promises that he knows he can’t deliver” on issues such as student debt. The prime minister also confirmed what her Brexit secretary, David Davis, had told a committee of MPs earlier on Wednesday: that the government had not carried out dozens of impact analyses on how sections of the economy could be affected by Brexit. “Can the prime minister put us out of our misery: do they exist or don’t they?” Corbyn asked. “Have they done the work or haven’t they? That is surely one question she can answer after 18 months.” May replied: “There were no 58 sectoral impact assessments. There was sectoral analysis. Over 800 pages of sectoral analysis has been published and made available to the select committee.” A PMQs always likely to be focused on talks with the EU began unpromisingly for May when a question from one of her backbenchers, Henry Bellingham, seeking a “quick update on the Brexit negotiations” brought laughter from the Labour benches. May responded by insisting the government was not watering down Brexit: “We’re leaving the European Union, we’re leaving the single market and the customs union, but we will do what is right in the interests of the whole of the United Kingdom. And nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.” Corbyn began by quoting Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, who in July said Brexit negotiations would be “the easiest in human history”. He asked, mockingly: “Does the prime minister still agree with that assessment?” May replied: “Negotiations are in progress and very good progress has been made,” bringing competing sets of cheers and and mocking shouts from the government and opposition benches. The prime minister insisted there were only “a couple of things” to be agreed before talks with the EU could move on to substantive trade talks, and that the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was “confident that we will be able to achieve sufficient progress”. May and Corbyn clashed over how the Irish border situation would be eventually resolved, with the prime minister arguing that, beyond long-agreed general principles, it remained too early to give precise details. May said she would “ensure that there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland”. She continued: “We will do that while we respect the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom, and while we respect the internal market and respect the internal market of the United Kingdom. “Those Labour members who shout, ‘How?’ – that’s the whole point of the second phase of the negotiations. We aim to deliver this as part of our overall trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and we can only get into that when we get into phase two. We have a plan, he has none.” Corbyn gave a scathing reply: “Eighteen months after the referendum, the prime minister is unable to answer the question.

He is one of the best-known names in the 19th-century French repertoire, but his reputation rests on a relatively small number of pieces, while outside his native country large portions of his output remain unexplored. With one exception, Jun Märkl’s orchestral collection is made up of some of those unfamiliar works. Saint-Saëns’ four symphonic poems, all from the 1870s, provide its spine, and among them is the well-known Danse Macabre, the third of the poems to be composed (in 1874) and based on the legend of Death appearing at midnight on Halloween. Liszt’s 13 symphonic poems were the inevitable model. However, with the exception of the last, La Jeunesse d’Hercule, none of Saint-Saëns’ quartet has the heft of Liszt’s examples, and certainly none has the symphonic ambitions of some of the orchestral poems produced at more or less the same time by César Franck. There’s nothing here to match the dramatic power of Franck’s Le Chasseur Maudit. This is charming rather than stirring music – even the Danse Macabre doesn’t really conjure more than the mildest frisson. But as always with Saint-Saëns, everything is crafted with immense skill and facility, whether it’s the depiction of the events in Le Rouet d’Omphale, with its spinning-wheel figurations, or the pounding hooves of the wild horses in Phaéton. The musical descriptions are brilliant even if there is not always a great deal of substance behind them. The performances from the Lille orchestra are lissom and deft, and Märkl never attempts to overload his reading with portentousness. The four symphonic poems are interspersed with a suitably rousing Marche Héroïque composed during the siege of Paris in 1870 and, more interestingly, a Sarabande and Rigaudon from the 1890s, which Saint-Saëns wrote for his new edition of Charpentier’s comédie-ballet Le Malade Imaginaire. Like everything here, they are immaculately polished miniatures, which do exactly what they are intended to do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"games/2017/dec/11/games-reviews-roundup-dimension-drive-xenoblade-chronicles-2-oh-my-godheads","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Games reviews roundup: Dimension Drive; Xenoblade Chronicles 2; Oh My Godheads","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2017/dec/11/games-reviews-roundup-dimension-drive-xenoblade-chronicles-2-oh-my-godheads","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2017/dec/11/games-reviews-roundup-dimension-drive-xenoblade-chronicles-2-oh-my-godheads","fields":{"headline":"Games reviews roundup: Dimension Drive; Xenoblade Chronicles 2; Oh My Godheads","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Dimension Drive Switch, Linux, Mac, PC, 2Awesome Studio, cert: 7 ★★★★ There are few creators of space games who can rival the CVs of the team behind Dimension Drive, previously engineers in the space exploration sector. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they’ve brought a distinct perspective to the arcade 2D shooter, a genre usually constrained by rigid conventions. All the prerequisites are here: a nimble starfighter, shooting down enemies and dodging swarms of bullets. But the screen is also divided into two distinct areas: the titular dimensions, which you can warp between to avoid enemies or recharge your weapons. Initially this can feel a little clumsy, but it adds an intriguing puzzle element to the gameplay. Also boasting some great boss fights, Dimension Drive would benefit from a little more scoring complexity and strategic depth, but is great fun, challenging and admirably innovative. WF Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Switch, Nintendo, cert: 12 ★★★★★ This third title in Monolith Soft’s Xenoblade Chronicles series is the most Japanese-leaning to date, the developer having successfully fused design elements from western MMOs and JRPGs over the past eight years. The art direction has gone unashamedly full anime, discarding the sombre palettes and realistic proportions of past entries. The characters wear their emotions delightfully and this more emotive visual style ties neatly into the newfound focus on cinematic storytelling. Though far more scripted, it’s still an experience driven by exploration, and as usual, delivers big on scale and spectacle, pushing its host hardware beyond expectations. The battle system is the zenith of the genre: intuitive, yet vastly complex and customisable. Every element in the game from economy to levelling and collecting combines work to form a perfect symbiosis. This is a lavish, beautiful, full-fat JRPG experience, and a perfect bookend to a phenomenal first year for Nintendo’s hybrid console. RH Oh My Godheads PS4, Xbox One, PC, Titutitech cert: 7 ★★★★ The concept sounds absurd and dated: capture-the-flag, played with outsized heads in small, brightly lit arenas. But as with Rocket League’s unlikely combination of racing and football, Oh My Godheads manages its mashup to perfection, shunning flashy visuals and online modes in favour of silly, competitive fun. Viewed from above, up to four human opponents battle to capture giant heads while battering each other into oblivion, with exuberant gameplay, confidently balanced characters and clever modes making for a rare multiplayer delight. There are flaws: the AI team-mates often refuse to help and the single-player mode is more like a tutorial. But to be sniffy over minor issues is to miss the sheer joy of carrying a gargantuan head to its destination as all the while it tries to kill you. It’s a concept that has made all other capture-the-flag games suddenly look tame in comparison.

In an address to reporters moments after the US president had finished speaking, the UN secretary general António Guterres said he opposed “any unilateral measures that would jeopardise the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians”. “In this moment of great anxiety, I want to make it clear – there is no alternative to the two-state solution,” Guterres said. “There is no plan B.” Earlier on Wednesday Pope Francis had issued a heartfelt plea to Trump to respect the status quo of the city, and to conform with UN resolutions. The pope told thousands of people at his general audience: “I cannot keep quiet about my deep worry about the situation that has been created in the last few days.” He said he hoped “wisdom and prudence prevail, in order to avoid adding new elements of tension to a global panorama that is already convulsed and marked by so many cruel conflicts”. At the regional level, the response was universally hostile, including from Saudi Arabia, a steadfast ally of the US. Riyadh said its continuing efforts to negotiate a peace deal, starting with a unification of the Palestinian leadership, would be damaged by the US plan. King Salman told Trump by telephone that a change to Jerusalem’s status would escalate regional tension, Saudi media reported. A spokesman for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said the US was “plunging the region and the world into a fire with no end in sight”. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said he had told the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, that Washington was making a grave mistake, and the whole world was against the decision. Turkey has suggested it might cut diplomatic ties with Israel if the embassy move goes ahead. Lebanon said Trump’s decision had put back the peace process by decades, and that it threatened regional and perhaps global stability. Qatar’s foreign minister described it as a death sentence for all who seek peace. Jordan said Trump had violated “international legitimacy”. There were reports of a protest outside the US consulate in Istanbul on Wednesday evening. In Tunisia, a labour union described the announcement as a declaration of war and called for a mass protest there. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, was the first western leader to reject the announcement, saying the final status of Jerusalem had to be settled by negotiation. He called for calm and for restraint from violence. The British prime minister, Theresa May, said the UK opposed Trump’s decision on Jerusalem and called it “unhelpful in terms of the prospects for peace in the region”. “We disagree with the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem and recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital before a final status agreement,” she said. “The British Embassy to Israel is based in Tel Aviv and we have no plans to move it. “Our position on the status of Jerusalem is clear and long-standing: it should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and Jerusalem should ultimately be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states. In line with relevant security council resolutions, we regard East Jerusalem as part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.” Both Germany and France updated travel advice to their citizens, warning of possible clashes in Israel and the occupied territories. At the request of Jordan and the Palestinians, an emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers will be held on Saturday. The Arab League warned that any such recognition of Jerusalem would be a blatant attack on the Arab nation. The Organisation for Islamic Co-operation will meet in Istanbul on 13 December in a special session to co-ordinate a response. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said any move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was made “out of despair and debility” because “their hands are tied and they can’t achieve their goals”. Khamenei, who is stridently anti-Israel, told government officials: “Victory belongs to Islamic Ummah. Palestine will be free, the Palestinian nation will achieve victory.” The UK’s response was at the milder end of the spectrum. Speaking before Trump’s announcement, Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, said he was concerned but that it was important to wait for the details of the president’s statement. Before meeting Tillerson, Johnson said the decision “makes it more important than ever that the long-awaited American proposals on the Middle East peace process are now brought forward, that should happen as a matter of priority”. In London, the Jewish Board of Deputies president, Jonathan Arkush, welcomed Trump’s decision, saying it was bizarre that it should be seen as remarkable. “Jerusalem has been the spiritual centre of Jewish life for 3,000 years, since the time of King David,” he said. “Given that Jerusalem is in fact historically, presently and legally Israel’s capital, the decision by many countries not to formally recognise this has been an act of post-truth petulance.” A Kremlin spokesman said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had expressed his concern about the announcement, but was also waiting to hear Trump’s speech. China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told a regular news briefing that the status of Jerusalem was a complicated and sensitive issue and China was concerned the US decision “could sharpen regional conflict”. Speaking from Ramallah, Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the PLO executive committee, described the decision as “disastrous, disheartening and absolutely irresponsible”, adding: “It is not well thought out. It is in contradiction of the basic tenets of peace. It shows bias and is an accommodation for occupation, force and military violence. “President Trump talks about reality, [but] what is reality? The only reality is that law should be the basis for any recognition. He is trying to scuttle the chances of peace. In his mad rush to show he is different from other presidents he did not stop to think why other peace settlements failed.” “He is siding with the most racist and hard line government in the history of Israel. and he cast his lot with them and so snubbed those that talked of reconciliation. It will embolden extremists around the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2017/dec/06/rising-debt-and-hallyday-tributes-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T12:20:01Z","webTitle":"Vice-chancellors' pay and Hallyday tributes: your best comments on the Guardian today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/dec/06/rising-debt-and-hallyday-tributes-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/dec/06/rising-debt-and-hallyday-tributes-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","fields":{"headline":"Vice-chancellors' pay and Hallyday tributes: your best comments on the Guardian today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Your reactions to a story on spiralling personal debt, an article on embracing sadness and tributes to French singer Johnny Hallyday are some of the conversations worth checking out today.

Britain distrusts meritocracy: that’s the lesson from Bath University In light of protests against vice-chancellors’ pay, former Guardian education editor, Jeevan Vasagar, wrote if we want public servants who are capable we must accept high pay and high inequality. ‘It would be useful to know what the selection process was’ We are comfortable with a meritocracy if it functions correctly – here it would be useful to know what was the selection process for the job; did the University identify a number of people who could operate in the job and question how much they would do the job for? It’s not only the vice chancellor who should be scrutinised but also (1) the recruitment process and (2) the individuals who granted the salary who should be required to justify their decision. The University should be seeking, for want of a better phrase, value for money, (and defining what this is) for all their stakeholders but particularly their students who are paying for this hand over fist. If the University can show VFM then there would be no problem. I would also mention that the award of a pay increase in the light of the existing scrutiny shows either a lack of sensitivity; a lack of awareness or plain bone headed stubbornness - from all parties. haulgh UK banks have 2m customers stuck in permanent overdraft Charity StepChange has warned of unaffordable lending in the overdraft market, creating a vicious cycle of debt. This story led many readers to share their thoughts and personal experiences of a system they feel is broken. ‘I didn’t consider the long term ramifications’ I have a £4k overdraft and won’t see the end of it anytime soon. As a younger man I saw they would keep giving me more and more, so I took it. Foolishly I thought that £40 a month was affordable – it was – but didn’t consider the long term ramifications. Now they’ve upped the fees and I’m in the position where I need to save each month to clear it but lack excess cash to do so. I only have myself to blame really but the fee change was a nasty surprise I didn’t expect. Perhaps they shouldn’t have allowed me to reach an overdraft that was about 20% of my salary, but still my fault unfortunately. WalterCronkiteBot Johnny Hallyday, the ‘French Elvis’, dies aged 74 Readers have been paying tribute to Johnny Hallyday, who has died after suffering from lung cancer. ‘The Anglo-Saxon world cannot imagine how he towered over French music’ Saw him twice here in NYC at the Beacon. Absolute legend. The Anglo-Saxon world cannot imagine how he towered over French music. A treasure and an amazing stage performer right to the end. RIP Johnny and condolences to Laeticia. NYBrit ‘I was taken aback by the power and range of his voice’ His records were played in the UK in the 70s but I guess there were so many home grown groups and singers it was hard to really break through. He seemed to be on a very long farewell tour over the last few years and I was lucky enough to see him live and close up. I was taken aback by the power and range of his voice, more akin to Tom Jones than any singer I can name, and it seemed everyone in the audience knew all the lyrics by heart. A very sad day for France and the francophone world. Mothipa It’s OK not to be OK: why we need to embrace sadness This piece by Johanna Leggatt has provided forum for many readers to discuss issues of sadness and depression, which it is careful to distinguish: “I don’t suggest depression isn’t a serious health problem or that it shouldn’t be professionally treated. But we should distinguish it from ordinary sadness.” ‘In today’s world, one is just not allowed to feel sad’ I suppose generations of people, have been told to ‘cheer up, it may never happen’. I mean, what is that about? How does that stranger not know that your cat may have just died, or your spouse just left you? The importance of accepting sadness, and other less desirable emotions, is the affect of permission; to be allowed to ‘feel’ that emotion. In so doing, the sufferer is relieved of said undesirable emotion that much faster. In today’s world, one is just not allowed to feel sad, mainly due to superficial social media and their cock-eyed approach to a healthy reality. nikinumnut Comments have been edited for length.

You could put it in a double bill with It’s a Wonderful Life or The Wizard of Oz, though its pure English differentness would shine through. It was released in 1946, the same year that Winston Churchill coined the term “special relationship” – an idea that the film finds itself debating. With that concept now under pressure, 2017 is a good time for this classic to be rereleased in UK cinemas. The film begins with a sensational flourish: a nuclear explosion that destroys a solar system. We start by drifting through outer space, accompanied by a droll narrative voice, commenting on its vastness and noticing a sudden supernova way in the distance: “Someone must have been messing about with the uranium atom.” The eerie casualness of that revelation sets the otherworldly tone for the rest of what follows. The starlit expanse, the intertitles, the distant detonation, the huge quasi-senatorial valhalla, all hint at where George Lucas got ideas for the Star Wars movies. Then we find ourselves on Earth in 1945, where RAF pilot Peter Carter, played by David Niven, is flying back to Britain after a bombing raid, losing height, badly hit. He has presumably been attacking German cities, and it has to be noticed that Germans are not represented here, either in this world, or the next. Carter’s parachute has been damaged; he knows he is going to die, and with impossibly dashing flair, he radios his final position to an astonished American radio operator called June, played by Kim Hunter, asks her to contact his family and flirts with her. June and Peter fall in love at that moment. The miracle is that Peter seems to survive, staggering out of the sea. He finds June, and with the help of a local doctor, Frank Reeves, played by the incomparable Powell/Pressburger stalwart Roger Livesey, he is gradually nursed back to health. Yet an emissary from heaven, in the form of a dandified pre-revolutionary French aristocrat played by Marius Goring, informs Peter that his survival is a mere clerical error and he is expected back in the afterlife right away. Peter complains that now he has fallen in love he is entitled to remain below. A huge trial is in prospect, and a prosecuting counsel is chosen: American revolutionary veteran Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey), who intends to argue that this decadent Brit has no business with a good American girl. Frank believes that these heavenly visions are delusions caused by his brain injury and everything – or almost everything – is consistent with that rational explanation. But how did Peter survive the fall? A Matter of Life and Death is a visually extraordinary film: a gorgeous artificiality is created by Alfred Junge’s production design and Jack Cardiff’s vivid Technicolor photography. Counterintuitively, the heaven scenes are in black and white and Earth is in colour. The modernist architecture of heaven is something to rival Fritz Lang’s Metropolis and the “stairway to heaven” sequence (which gave this film its US title) is narcotically weird. Even down on Earth, and without the angelic visits, things have a distinct surreality. Frank likes nothing more than to keep the village under benign surveillance with his camera obscura device, evidently kept on a high rotating turret, which gives him live pictures of everything that’s happening in the village. He is like the voice and eye of an all-seeing God. And perhaps the most extraordinary moment comes when Peter encounters a naked young goatherd on the beach: it is this figure – like someone from a late Shakespeare play, such as The Tempest – who tells Peter that he is back on Earth. (The boy’s nakedness meant that this sequence was cut for TV transmission by prim US networks; Martin Scorsese has spoken entertainingly of his periodic exasperation at sitting down to watch and finding it is the bowdlerised version.) So what does this film have to say about the special relationship? The speechifying on the subject of history and politics might disconcert some viewers who would rather hear and see more about Peter and June’s romantic adventure. But Powell and Pressburger are telling America and the world that just as Squadron Leader Peter Carter does not want go to heaven, so Britain itself is not dead; it does not deserve to be consigned to history along with those effete and irrelevant periwigged Frenchmen. Britain lives – in partnership with America. I have watched this film many times, but it was only on sitting down to it again that I finally realised what Frank Reeves’s death reminded me of. Riding his motorbike fast in the rain, Dr Reeves had selflessly swerved in order to save the lives of the ambulancemen and their patient, conveying Peter to hospital. His sacrifice means that he can go to heaven to be Peter’s defending counsel. How should we feel about this terrible event? I had a flashback to a long-suppressed memory of reading CS Lewis’s The Last Battle, the final Narnia episode, in which Peter, Edmund, Lucy, Diggory and Polly are revealed to be killed in a train crash, along with the Pevensie parents, and so they can be admitted to eternal life. It was a profoundly strange happy-sad collision. So is this. • This article was amended on 8 December 2017. An earlier version referred to Peter Carter as an “RAF Hurricane pilot”, and in the subheading as a “fighter pilot”. He piloted a Lancaster bomber."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2018/mar/21/cemetery-slums-life-manilas-graveyard-settlements-philippines","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T11:00:55Z","webTitle":"Graveyard living: inside the 'cemetery slums' of Manila","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/21/cemetery-slums-life-manilas-graveyard-settlements-philippines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/mar/21/cemetery-slums-life-manilas-graveyard-settlements-philippines","fields":{"headline":"Graveyard living: inside the 'cemetery slums' of Manila","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“I have lived here for 51 years – and I have been trying to leave for 51 years,” says Elvira Miranda. “The government want us gone, and we also want to go. But we need somewhere to go.” Miranda, 68, has been living with her husband and children in a teetering shanty above a stack of graves in Manila North Cemetery since 1966. It is the kind of situation you might find yourself in if, like Miranda, you’re poor, you have no job and you live in one of the world’s most notoriously crowded cities. “We keep the cemetery clean … The community has kept to itself,” she says. “Most people here don’t have an income, but we try and find odd jobs to make ends meet. We sell flowers to victims’ families, make headstones or build coffins.” Manila is one of the world’s most densely populated cities, as migrants from the countryside have poured in seeking better opportunities. On arrival, the majority find little work and nowhere to live except self-built communities. Elvira Miranda and the Navotas cemetery, on the Manila coast. Photographs: Lynzy Billing Some of these slums have developed inside public cemeteries. People sleep in haphazard shanties built on top of graves, or inside mausoleums. It’s free, but there are no basic services such as sanitation, electricity and clean water, let alone adequate shelter. Cemetery slums have existed here since the 1950s, and generations of families now live in Manila North, the oldest and largest cemetery in the city. An expansive 54 hectares (133 acres), it is home to an estimated 6,000 slum-dwellers from 800 families, as well as one million dead. Some of the community are caretakers, paid by relatives of the dead to maintain the graves; the fee can be as little as 600 pesos (£9) a year. Other residents own makeshift stores or work as masons, carving headstones for the 80-100 funerals that take place daily. It is a difficult life, made more so by frequent violent anti-drug raids by the Philippine National Police (PNP); grislier still, some of the graves hold the corpses of the victims of the PNP’s extra-judicial killings. President Rodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs” has killed more than 12,000 people since June 2016, and many of the raids take place in cemeteries. One such raid occurred in Manila North on 3 August last year. Carmelita Bahacan’s son, Irish, was killed. He was 37. Ricardo Medina, who lives in the Pasay slum, near his son Ericardo’s grave. Photograph: Lynzy Billing “That night 50 police came into the cemetery,” she says. “They shot him five times. He was dead after the first shot but they continued shooting.” Bahacan, 57, who moved to Manila North in 1992, now lives in a shanty built atop the grave of her son. “I like Irish’s body to be next to me. He is buried in a tomb with my father. Someday soon I will die, and I would like to be buried here also.” The PNP says crime and drug use are prevalent in cemeteries. “Many slum-dwellers are unemployed, some of them will resort to criminal activities so that they can support their families,” says superintendent Erwin Margarejo of the Manila Police District. “Cemeteries here serve as hideouts for criminals.” A funeral takes place in the Navotas slum. Photograph: Lynzy Billing “There used to be a problem with drugs here, but now people have stopped using,” Bahacan says. “But anti-drug raids still happen every other day, in the evening or early morning hours when it is quiet and dark. They are shooting and killing us inside the cemetery.” She says a lack of money means they cannot afford to investigate the police shootings. And with no official record of populations living in the big cemeteries – Navotas, Pasay and Manila North and South – the residents remain targets for extra-judicial operations. Ricardo Medina, 70, also lives near the grave of his son, Ericardo, who was killed by police on 16 November 2016. In 1996, Manila North Cemetery residents appealed for a school, washroom and church. Nothing happened. Photograph: Lynzy Billing “I was watching TV here and I saw Ericardo. His head was wrapped in packaging tape and he had a cardboard sign tied across his chest saying ‘pusher’, but my son is innocent,” Medina says. Ericardo is now buried with Medina’s wife, just a few metres from his house. “I like him close. I like that when I wake up I can see him ... I like that I can be the one to care for his grave.” Medina moved to Pasay cemetery in 1967. Back then, he says, “No one was living here, but look at it now.” In his section alone, there are 50 families. “But there are only two water wells. These are basic services we need.” He works as an exhumer. Graves in this crowded city are leased for five-year periods; if the family cannot pay, the bones are dug up and incinerated. A caretaker in Pasay exhumes a baby – its family can no longer pay to rent the grave space. In Manila most graves exist on a five-year lease. If it is not renewed, the bones are dug up and incinerated or given back to the family. Photographs: Lynzy Billing “I like living here, the area is quiet. It is free, and my work is good. I can get 50 pesos to dig a baby’s grave, 150 for an adult. There are lots of bodies and so lots of work for me. It allows me to feed my family and helps people. Somebody has to do it.” Unsurprisingly, he is not squeamish, and while speaking he holds up the hand of a decomposing corpse. “See, it doesn’t matter if we’re black, white, fat or thin, we all turn the same colour after death. ‘The government say they want us gone.’ Photograph: Lynzy Billing “There are no ghosts here. But when I am digging up a corpse I always apologise, and say I am sorry for disturbing you. It is a matter of respect.” Despite Medina’s claims, living conditions here are far below acceptable standards. In 1996, the residents of Manila North Cemetery appealed to the mayor for a school, washroom facilities and a church. Nothing has happened, so they now run their own classes for the local children. And while they wait – for housing, for jobs, for justice – they continue to work as masons, caretakers or makers of coffins, headstones and mausoleums. “The government say they want us gone, but we are doing the jobs no one else will,” Medina says. “We are part of the greater community, caring for their dead.” This week, the Overstretched Cities series examines the impact of the rush to urbanisation, which has seen cities around the world explode in size.

Tune in later for added post-match colour and comment from some of the main protagonists. It’s finished all square between Maribor and Sevilla, who drew one goal apiece. Here’s how they’ve finished in Group E. Liverpool go through as winners, Sevilla qualify in second place and Spartak Moscow drop into the Europa League. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! Our referee spares Spartak Moscow the anguish of added time and it’s all over at Anfield, where Liverpool have slaughtered Spartak Moscow 7-0. Philippe Coutinho bagged a hat-trick and Sadio Mane a brace, while Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah got one each in a rout that could have been a lot more emphatic given some of the chances they missed. Liverpool go through as group winners. 89 min: “Mane could be on for a Salvador Dali-esque surrealist hat-trick,” writes Paul Griffin. “He’s scored an nonsensical scissor-kick rocket for the first and affected an absurdist rabona for his second. He just needs to convert the ball into a melting spoon to get the full set. It’s a difficult technique but I’m backing him.” 86 min: Standing with his hands on his hips in the Spartak Moscow goal, Aleksandr Selikov looks thoroughly fed up with life after picking the ball out of his net for the seventh time. He’s done little wrong and made a few decent saves, but there was certainly nothing he could do about that shot Salah rifled into the roof of the net. He received a pass from the left, took out a defender with a feint as he shifted the ball from one foot to the other and then buried the ball into the roof of the net. Salah finally gets on the score-sheet and it’s a fine strike into the roof of the net from eight yards out. 82 min: Daniel Sturridge - who I’ve just referred to as Danny Welbeck for weird reasons I can’t quite fathom - latches on to a sublime pass from Philippe Coutinh, takes the ball around goalkeeper Aleksandr Selikov and is brought down. Perhaps out of sympathy for the Russian side, the referee doesn’t award a penalty. 81 min: Spartak embark on a rare sortie into Liverpool territory, only for their attack to break down when Roman Zobnin gave the ball to Trent Alexander-Arnold. 78 min: Spartak substitution from a few minutes ago: Aleksandr Samedov on, Quincy Promes off. 75 min: It’s single-bagel for Liverpool, who have notched up a tennis score against their Russian visitors. Daniel Sturridge got in behind the Spartak defence down the inside right and squared the ball for Sane, who was up in support. The pass was a little behind Sane, but no matter - he more or less bundled it over the line from close rage with his standing foot. Sadio Mane scores his second of the night to make it a round half-dozen for Liverpool. 76 min: “Commentary farce is claiming another victim here,” writes another Alex, in Boston. “Trying to listen to the audio stream on my phone at work, but it’s not built for mobile. If we’re going to muscle out the likes of 5 Live then we should at least have our own media platforms up to scratch.” 73 min: Sturridge is flagged for offside as he mistimes his run on to a ball from deep down the inside left channel. 72 min: Liverpool substitution: Roberto Firmino goes off with one goal and one assist to his name and is replaced by Daniel Sturridge. 70 min: Liverpool seem to be taking something resembling pity on their guests and some of the sting seems to have gone out of their attack. They’re not attacking with the same kind of intensity which has been the hallmark of this their game this evening. 66 min: “Off the field things aren’t quite so peachy,” writes Alex Lomax. “No-one thought to tell the IT guys that the BBC had been refused rights for live commentary, the LFC login server has been down since 7.30.” Welcome one and all, particularly our new readers. Here’s hoping you’ve come for the minute-by-minute report and will stay for the comment, features, podcasts and myriad other juicy delights the Guardian has to offer. 64 min: Spartak midfielder Fernando is booked for clattering through the back of James Milner. A minute or so later, Firmino tries to tee up Mane for a shot on goal, only for his deft pass to be hacked clear by a defender. 62 min: Mo Salah goes close to getting among the goals, only to be denied by a fine save from Selikov, who dives low to his right to save the curling effort, It’s a bit of a shame, really - while Selikov deserves a break, Salah took out two Spartak players with a wonderful drag-back en route to goal and could have bagged himself a fine individual effort. 60 min: Liverpool substitution: Dejan Lovren off, Trent Alexander-Arnold on. Spartak Moscow substitution: Georgi Dzhikiya off, Chelsea loanee Mario Pasalic on. With his team 5-0 down, he doesn’t look like a man who’s relishing the opportunity of playing in the Champions League at Anfield. 59 min: Coutinho picks out James Milner on the left with a neat ball through the Spartak penalty area, but the substitute is unable to squaeeze the ball through the corridor of uncertainty for Mo Salah. 58 min: Meanwhile in Slovenia, Maribor continue to lead Sevilla 1-0 in this group’s other fixture. 55 min: Mo Salah hasn’t got among the goals yet tonight but looks on the verge of getting on the scoresheet with a shot from 20 yards until Spartak right-back Andri Eschenko intervenes. 54 min: As Coutinho celebrated his deflected effort from 20 yards, Massimo Carrera replaced his striker Ze Luis with Lorenzo Melgarejo. One suspects Ze Luis is glad to be out of there. No pressure, Lorenzo. Just the six goals required. 51 min: Selikov is forced to pick the ball out of the net again as Philippe Coutinho completes his hat-trick in front of the Kop with the scruffiest goal of the night. His shot took a heavy deflection on the way in, giving the wrong-footed goalkeeper no chance. Stick a fork in this Russian team. They. Are. Done. 49 min: That was a sensational volley from Mane. With his first touch of note, Milner whipped an out-swinger of a cross in from the left. Mane was running on to it and his technique was sublime as he sort of scissor-kicked a diagonal volley past the hapless Russian goalkeeper, who probably didn’t see the ball, such was the venom with which it was struck. Oh lord! Sadio Mane sends a volley screaming past Aleksandr Selikov after getting on the end of a James Milner cross. 46 min: No changes in personnel during the interval, which first half substitute James Milner spent out on the pitch warming up with one of Liverpool’s backroom staff. 46 min: Liverpool get the second half party started and it’s difficult to imagine them not scoring another few goals against a Spartak side that have been totally unable to cope with the blistering pace of Salah, Mane, Firmino and Coutinho. It’s difficult to imagine what, if any, solutions Spartak manager Massimo Carrera, who was Antonio Conte’s No2 at Juventus, might have had to offer his players. His side need to win tonight, so can’t really afford an exercise in damage limitation. However, if his players do go for broke, they could face total humiliation. That’s your lot for a first half in which Liverpool completely crushed Spartak Moscow. Philippe Coutinho bagged two and Roberto Firmino got the other in a half where Sadio Mane and MOhamed Salah also spurned decent chances. Liverpool have, however, lost Alberto Moreno to what might be a serious injury (knacked ankle ligaments, perhaps) given the player’s reaction as he walked off. He was distraught, in tears as he hobbled off the pitch. 45 min: Moreno goes down injured again and will shortly be replaced by James Milner. Yup, Liverpool substitution: Moreno off, Milner on. Moreno looked very upset as he walked off; here’s hoping his injury is not too serious. 44 min: Moreno hobblers to the sideline before coming back on. He’s still limping badly, but Liverpool’s medical team will probably reassess him at half-time. 41 min: There’s a break in play as Alberto Moreno receives treatment for what looks like a twisted left ankle sustained as he hung his leg out to block a pile-driver of a shot from Ze Luis. 39 min: Now Salah shoots inches over the bar after being put through. Liverpool are so rampant here, a court stenographer would struggle to keep up with them, let alone me with my sausage fingers skittering around a crisp crumb-covered keyboard. Georgi Dzhikiya, who I was hoping would have a quiet night tonight due to the difficulties his name presents for those of us trying to type minute-by-minute reports, is having an absolute nightmare. Already responsible for the concession of two Liverpool goals, he is very, very lucky to avoid a second yellow card for deliberate hand-ball. 36 min: Sadio Mane blazes a right-footed shot over the bar when scoring looked easier after being put through on goal by a delightful back-heeled flick from Mo Salah. 33 min: Loris Karius, Joe Gomez and Luiz Adriano end up in a tangled heap outside the Liverpool penalty area after the Liverpool goalkeeper charge out of his penalty area to clear a through ball the other two were chasing. Gomez had it covered, so we can only assume Karius was bored. 32 min: Spartak Moscow show some long overdue signs of life, stringing a few nice passes together as they make their way towards the edge of the Liverpool penalty area. They get no further. 31 min: Luiz Adriano sprints down the right flank chasing a pass from deep, but Alberto Morena beats him to it and puts it out for a throw-in. 29 min: Quincy Promes wins a corner for his side and sends the ball into the mixer. Liverpool clear. 28 min: Now it’s Salah’s turn to go close, shooting low and hard towards the bottom right-hand corner after being teed up by Mane. Aleksandr Selikov saves fairly comfortably. 25 min: One of few Spartak players making any effort to track back or pick up his man, Spartak striker Luiz Adriano gets back to prevent Phil;ippe Coutinho from completing his hat-trick. Running on to a pass to the edge of the Spartak penalty area, Coutinho looked set to pull the trigger with the goal at his mercy, only to be denied by a tackle from Adriano that left him limping. 24 min: A minute or two after taking a shot on when Philippe Coutinho was in a better position, Sadio Mane tries to teee up the stand-in skipper with a pull-back from the byline. Salvatore Bocchetti intercepts and clears. 19 min: More calamitous defending from the Russian side, who gift another goal to their hosts. A loose pass from Georgi Dzhikiya, who gave away the opening penalty, gifted possession to Sadio Mane, who advanced up the field and attempted to pick out Mo Salah in the Spartak penalty area. Serdar Tasci made a pig’s ear of his clearance and with the ball dropping kindly for him, Roberto Firmino steered it past Aleksandr Selikov and into the top corner with the outside of his right boot. Crikey! This is turning into a turkey shoot. 16 min: That was too easy for Liverpool, who took advantage from some extremely generous defending to seize complete control of this match. In acres of space, Philippe Coutinho side-footed into the bottom right-hand corner after having the ball presented to him on a plate by a deft pass from Roberto Firmino. Sadio Mane began the move, while Mo Salah was also involved. Atrocisous defending from Spartak as Liverpool score almost at their leisure to double their lead. 15 min: Philippe Coutinho tries to curl the ball into the top corner from the edge of the area, it takes a deflection and Selikov saves easily. 13 min: Spartak break down the left flank and the ball’s played to Luiz Adriano, who shoots through Dejan Lovren’s legs and brings a smartish save out of Loris Karius. 13 min: Meanwhile in Slovenia, Maribor have taken an early lead against Sevilla. 10 min: Sadio Mane gets in behind the Spartak defence to get on the end of Coutinho cross, but blasts the ball into the side-netting from a tight angle when perhaps he should have squared it for Roberto Firmino. 9 min: Going back to that penalty, for which Georgi Dzhikiya was booked. It was a daft challenge by the Spartak left-back, who put his arm around Mohamed Salah’s shoulder as the Egyptian sprinted into the Spartak penalty area in pursuit of a long diagonal from Philippe Coutinho. Salah went down and the referee pointed to the spot without any hesitation. 6 min: Liverpool go close again, bursting forward with Roberto Firmino cutting into the left-side of the Spartak Moscow box. His attempted cross to Sadio Mane is cut out. As Spartak gallop off on the counter-attack, Emre Can is booked for a scything challenge on Luiz Adriano. Liverpool’s skipper makes no mistake as he takes his run-up and hesitates ever so slightly before sending Spartak’s Aleksandr Selikov the wrong way. Selikov goes left, the ball goes right and Liverpool are a goal up. 4 min: Mo Salah goes down in the box under a challenge from Georgi Dzhikiya as he chases a cross from deep and Liverpool have a spot-kick. 3 min: The players of both teams try to feel their way into the team, with most players apart from the two goalkeepers getting early time on the ball. 2 min: Philippe Coutinho wears the captain’s armband for Liverpool tonight, with Jordan Henderson dropped to the bench. 1 min: Play is under way at Anfield, where the crowd seem in fine fettle. Ze Luis kicks off for Spartak Moscow and almost immediately, Liverpool win a throw-in near the halfway line. Not long now: The teams are on their way out on to the Anfield sward for the last of the pre-match niceties. Liverpool’s players wear their customary home kit of red shirts, shorts and socks. Their visitors are in white shirts, shorts and socks. A reader email: “I’ve been staring at the line-ups for 10 minutes and whichever way I look at it, Liverpool’s defence just spells trouble,” writes Václav Smerda. “There is too much pressure on the front three. You only win when you outscore the opposition, but with that defence it just means scoring three or four goals each game.” And this from Peter Oh: “Klopp singled out Quincy Promes but I’m also concerned about Spartak’s physical strikers, Brazilian Luiz Andrade and Cape Verdian Zé Luís,” he writes. “‘Zé Luis’ is ‘Joe Louis’ in English, which causes me particular concern. I hope he doesn’t land an uppercut to the jaw of Liverpool’s chances of advancing to the knockout stages.” Speaking on BT Sport, Gary Lineker has just revealed that Liverpool have lost 39 points from winning positions in the Premier League since Jurgen Klopp took over as their manager. Of their top six rivals, Arsenal are next, having lost 30 points in the same period of time. It is a sign that for all their pleasing qualities going forward, Liverpool are a wee bit of a shambles at the back. Liverpool: Karius, Gomez, Lovren, Klavan, Moreno, Coutinho, Can, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Mignolet, Milner, Henderson, Sturridge, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Solanke, Alexander-Arnold. Spartak Moscow: Selikhov, Eshchenko, Tasci, Bocchetti, Dzhikija, Zobnin, Glushakov, Fernando, Promes, Luiz Adriano, Ze Luis. Subs: Rebrov, Samedov, Melgarejo, Kutepov, Pasalic, Popov, Pedro Rocha. Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland) “This is the game,” said the Liverpool manager yesterday. “We are only part of the Champions League because we want to go to the next round. All the good and bad things that have happened so far have got us to this situation. If we win the game, that’s cool! I’m really looking forward to it. I think we are stronger than when we played them last, but I think they are as well. They have players back, so it should be an exciting game.” On what he’s expecting from tonight’s opponents: “We have learned from our first game with Spartak, but the atmosphere here should give us an advantage,” he said of his side’s 1-1 draw in Moscow. “Everyone knows what the atmosphere here can do. It’s special, and it will be special tomorrow night. “We want to win this game, so I will not hesitate in lining up our best team - as we have done in every game so far. We have always focused on having the players with the skills and the fresh legs to win the game. Thankfully that has worked well in recent weeks. It will be no different tomorrow.” Liverpool are to make an official complaint to Uefa after Rhian Brewster was allegedly racially abused during the Youth League game with Spartak Moscow played earlier today at Prenton Park. The 17-year-old was incensed after being targeted by an opposition defender during Liverpool’s 2-0 win and had to be dragged away by team-mates at the final whistle, according to the Guardian’s man on the Merseyside beat, Andy Hunter. The 17-year-old reported the alleged offence to the referee Mohammed al-Hakim during the game and he passed the details to the fourth official at Prenton Park. You can read the full story below. “The 90 minutes tomorrow will decide who is better,” said the Spartak manager in his pre-match press briefing. “We’re going to face great players with a great atmosphere inside our squad. We will face a very strong team, but we respect the opposition and the fans of Liverpool. We expect it to be very tight tomorrow. Liverpool have many strong players. We respect them, but we don’t fear them.” How things stand in Group E Liverpool will go through to the knockout stages if they avoid defeat. If they lose and Sevilla beat Maribor, Liverpool will drop into the Europa League. Liverpool defenders Joe Gomez and Ragnar Klavan are available for selection after recovering from the illness that ruled them out of Liverpool’s win over Brighton last weekend. Joel Matip and Adam Lallana remain sidelined with thigh injuries. For Spartak, defenders Dmitri Kombarov and Georgi Tigiev are injured, as is midfielder Jano Ananidze. Barry will be here soon enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/06/aactas-2017-lion-blitzes-australian-film-awards-and-calls-for-real-change-in-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T01:57:59Z","webTitle":"Aactas 2017: Lion blitzes awards as Russell Crowe comments cut from broadcast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/06/aactas-2017-lion-blitzes-australian-film-awards-and-calls-for-real-change-in-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/06/aactas-2017-lion-blitzes-australian-film-awards-and-calls-for-real-change-in-industry","fields":{"headline":"Aactas 2017: Lion blitzes awards as Russell Crowe comments cut from broadcast","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Oscar-nominated movie Lion dominated the 2017 Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (Aacta) awards on Wednesday, winning best film and each of its competing categories. The film’s producer, Angie Fielder, acknowledged the ongoing issue of sexual harassment and assault in the screen industry. “As a film that was partly financed by the Weinstein Company, it would be remiss of us not to acknowledge the incredible bravery of the women and men who have come forward to break the silence about sexual harassment and assault in our industry,” she said. The film was distributed by the Weinstein Company, whose head, Harvey Weinstein, was sacked in September over dozens of sexual harassment allegations – leading to an avalanche of women and men speaking out about abuse of power in the film industry and beyond. “Hopefully this marks a time of change and it’s really encouraging to see the industry taking a stand … Let’s keep talking about it. That’s how we make real change,” said Fielder. At Wednesday’s main awards, the Weinstein reckoning and #metoo moment dominated conversations on the red carpet beforehand, and popped up during moments of the ceremony. A week earlier, veteran actor Geoffrey Rush stood down as president of the Aacta board after a complaint of “inappropriate behaviour” from two years ago surfaced, which he denies. But in perhaps the most tone-deaf moment of the evening, and one which was cut for broadcast, Russell Crowe acknowledged the need for “sensitivity”in the industry – but tied it into a tongue-in-cheek anecdote about “sodomising Jacqui McKenzie on the set of [1992 film] Romper Stomper”. “I didn’t actually intend to do that – I was trying to keep my bits away from her bits, and she’s been given one of those pieces of elastic that the girls get when you do those scenes, which protects them from all things, and my bits and pieces were in a little canvas sack with a drawstring,” he said, to muted laughs. “And it wasn’t (sic) actually my desire to keep the bits apart. It wasn’t until the opening night of the film that it was pointed out by none other than Jacqui McKenzie’s beautiful late mother that we were in fact, in her mind, engaged in sodomy. Anyway, that was just a story about sensitivity!” Last week McKenzie added her name to the list of women who have come forward about assault and harrassment in the industry, posting to Facebook about the “grubby behaviour” she had encountered during her early career. On the red carpet earlier on Wednesday, McKenzie told Guardian Australia: “It’s not just about sexual assault and harassment, it’s bullying and bad behaviour in the industry.” “In all industries, no matter what job, gender or age, it occurs everywhere. I posted on Facebook last week about my experience … I’m really interested in effecting some change now.” Emile Sherman, another of Lion’s producers, added in the media room that the discussion felt like “a massive cultural and social turning point”. “It feels like a great moment for our industry and society as a whole to really grapple with these really important questions,” he said. “It’s great that our industry is in a sense leading the way in terms of the spotlight being shone on it.” Lion, which tells the true story of Indian-Australian Saroo Brierley’s search for his childhood home, picked up five awards on the night including best film and best director for Garth Davis. Including seven wins for screenplay and production at the early event on Monday, it has now amassed a total of 12 Aacta awards. Top of the Lake: China Girl won four Aacta awards including best television drama series. Nicole Kidman, who featured in both Lion and Top of the Lake, won twice for each performance, and her Lion co-star Sunny Pawar became the youngest winner of best lead actor in Aactas history. Elisabeth Moss, who won for best lead actress in a television drama for Top of the Lake, also used her acceptance speech to speak about the importance of strong women and women’s stories, while her co-star Ewen Leslie won for best supporting actor, his first Aacta win after four previous nominations. Top of the Lake won four awards, and ABC drama Seven Types of Ambiguity won twice, for Hugo Weaving’s lead performance and for best television screenplay. Celia Pacquola, meanwhile, won her third consecutive Aacta for her starring role in ABC’s Rosehaven. Emma Booth won best lead actress for Hounds of Love, Simon Baker won the trailblazer award, and director Phillip Noyce won the Longford Lyle lifetime achievement award, for his work on Rabbit-Proof Fence, Dead Calm, The Quiet American and Patriot Games. Film-makers Martin Butler and Bentley Dean, who made Contact, First Footsteps and Tanna, were awarded the Byron Kennedy award. The SBS drama Sunshine – an underdog sports movie about a team of Sudanese-Australian basketball players – beat out tough competition in Blue Murder: Killer Cop and Seven Types of Ambiguity to win the best telefeature or miniseries category. The ceremony, held at the Star Casino in Sydney, was dominated by the video message from many of the more high-profile winners, from Australia and abroad, including Kidman, Weaving, Pawar, Moss and Dev Patel, who won best supporting actor for Lion. • Click here for the full list of Aacta 2017 winners"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/07/martinu-bouquet-flowers-cd-review-prague-radio-symphony-orchestra-netopil-supraphon","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T15:40:15Z","webTitle":"Martinu: Bouquet of Flowers CD review – smell of the soil and stark modernism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/07/martinu-bouquet-flowers-cd-review-prague-radio-symphony-orchestra-netopil-supraphon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/07/martinu-bouquet-flowers-cd-review-prague-radio-symphony-orchestra-netopil-supraphon","fields":{"headline":"Martinu: Bouquet of Flowers CD review – smell of the soil and stark modernism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Bohuslav Martinů lived in Paris through the 1920s and got swept up in the city’s jazz and avant-garde scenes. Then in the early 1930s he turned his attention back to his native Moravian folk culture and wrote earthy, angular music that fused the lot – including his 1937 cantata Bouquet of Flowers. It’s for children’s chorus, soloists and orchestra and there’s no danger of missing the smell of the soil in these pungent tunes. However, between the carols and cowherds come moments of impressively stark modernism, which this account really illuminates. The voices of Kateřina Kněžíková and Michaela Kapustová are particularly rich together and Tomáš Netopil conducts with a grand sweep. At the end of the disc we get the bruisingly nostalgic Philharmonic Dances by Martinů’s student Jan Novák – music from 1956 that swaggers and rambles. Unfortunately, Jan wasn’t a patch on his teacher."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"inequality/2017/dec/16/journey-to-heart-of-britain-precarious-future-ebbw-vale","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T22:30:13Z","webTitle":"‘There’s no life here’: a journey into Britain’s precarious future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/dec/16/journey-to-heart-of-britain-precarious-future-ebbw-vale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2017/dec/16/journey-to-heart-of-britain-precarious-future-ebbw-vale","fields":{"headline":"‘There’s no life here’: a journey into Britain’s precarious future","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"At the Ebbw Vale steelworks in the south Wales valleys, thousands of men once laboured to produce the steel that helped to drive Britain’s industrial revolution. The steelworks closed for good 15 years ago, and today a familiar fare decorates the town’s mournful high street: pound shops, arcades, bookies. On the brief walk from one end to the other, I count three pawnbrokers. “It ain’t worth looking for any work up here,” Rob Smyth, a youth worker tells me. “I tell you what – I’m glad I’m old because if I was young now I’d be struggling, you know? I know people who’ve got degrees and all the rest of it, and they can’t get work. You’ve got to settle somewhere else and make a life for yourself. There’s no life up here, no life at all. I only live here because it’s cheap, and it’s close to where I work.” Ebbw Vale is the largest town in Blaenau Gwent. This autumn the county borough was found to be the cheapest place to buy a home in England and Wales (averaging £777 per sq m in 2016, compared with £19,439 for the most expensive, London’s Kensington and Chelsea). It offers the second-lowest mean salary in Britain, and its GCSE results are the worst in Wales. Five food banks operate within an area of about 42 square miles. People here are struggling economically and physically. It’s a grim irony that an area encompassing the former constituency of Aneurin Bevan, architect of the National Health Service, should today be facing a quietly unfolding health crisis. Some 12% of working-age residents receive government support for disability or incapacity – twice the national average. Life expectancy for both men and women is among the lowest in England and Wales. Out of a population of 60,000, one in every six adults is being prescribed an antidepressant, according to NHS data from 2013. “GPs haven’t got time to listen, to talk to people, to find out what’s going on. They’ve got that five- or 10-minute slot, somebody’s in tears, they’re saying they’re depressed,” Tara Johnstone tells me at the Phoenix Project, the publicly funded drop-in centre where she works in nearby Brynmawr. It’s run by a local charity, Torfaen and Blaenau Gwent Mind, and people come to chat about their problems: anxiety, depression, illness, bereavement. Most stories revolve around the same theme. “It’s lack of work,” explains Trish Richards, another Phoenix staff member. “I’ve had people come to me on zero-hours contracts. They don’t know where they are from one week to the next. Can’t plan. Can’t even plan to go to the dentist in case they get called in to work.” In the face of so many present-day problems, it’s all too easy to become wistful for a lost golden era of nationalised industry that brought secure jobs and forged strong communities. The low-paid jobs in call centres and distribution sheds, most located in bigger cities, that eventually arrived to replace the noise and filth of the pits were cleaner and safer, but they lacked the solidarity and support networks. Soon they, too, may disappear. First globalisation, then austerity; now automation looms on the horizon. South Wales is particularly vulnerable, being heavily reliant on exactly the low-skilled jobs which are easiest to send offshore and automate out of existence. If they go, then so too may the young people who commute to these jobs from places such as Blaenau Gwent. “It’s the easiest thing in the world to put your foot on someone’s head when they’re drowning. And that’s what you see around here,” Wayne Hodgins, an independent councillor for Brynmawr, tells me when we meet in one of the few pubs that are still open. “There was factories employing 100, 200 people. That factory environment – your friends, your colleagues – became an extension of your family.” The professionalisation of even entry-level work has made it very difficult to find employment without some form of academic qualification or accredited skill. Consequently, Hodgins says, people here can feel worthless because they are “getting rejection letters right, left and centre ... They’ve got nothing to get them out of bed in the morning.” This, in many cases, can lead to a prescription for antidepressants. “There’s a lot of people on social [benefits], there’s a lot ill,” says Allan Price, a former miner who volunteers at the South Wales Miners’ museum amid the slopes of the Afan Valley, high above Port Talbot. “Everybody in my village will tell you they know them. And lots of them come from good men and good families – hardworking.” The deindustrialisation experiment inflicted on the valleys in the 1980s offers a cautionary tale for the next big transition. The region stands as an example of how not to move from one form of economic life to another – the Thatcherite omelette left many broken eggs. “Automation is a risk to many occupations across Wales and the UK,” says Professor Julie Lydon, chair of Universities Wales who recently wrote an article entitled The Robots are Coming. The key to avoiding a repeat of the devastation caused when the mines and factories shut is investment in skills, according to Lydon. “Demand in Wales for jobs that require higher-level skills is increasing, and evidence shows these jobs are less vulnerable to automation. We must focus on developing skills which are with you for life, and make you more adaptable and employable through your career. This will mean building on existing collaboration between universities, employers and colleges, and finding new ways to provide these skills, such as through degree apprenticeships.” This will require government and employers to take more action than they have so far been prepared to do. Research in 2014 indicated that employers in Wales lagged behind the rest of the country in offering training: just 62% said they had done so in the previous 12 months, compared to the UK average of 66%. Nick Smith, MP for Blaenau Gwent, says some investment in road infrastructure has already arrived, and that the area must revive its tourist industry. “There’s been £200m provided by the Welsh government. We’ve also had in the last 10 years a new railway line from Cardiff to Ebbw Vale. If we improve transport infrastructure, I think it will help Blaenau Gwent as a destination, to enjoy the fantastic scenery. I’m a hiker, and there’s nothing better than to get up there and to fill your lungs with the fresh air.” Rebuilding dignity Cath Jones is 31 and before she showed up at the Phoenix Project looking for help, she’d been in and out of mental health institutions since she was 15. “In three, four years I had 50 admissions to a psychiatric ward,” she tells me over a cup of milky tea. “I was on five or six different antidepressants, antipsychotics, sleeping tablets, diazepam. You name it, I was on it.” She insists she’d have been “six feet under” were it not for the help and advice she received at the Phoenix. In terms of getting people fit, well and – eventually – back to work, Trish Richards tells me that the Westminster government is lukewarm about initiatives such as the Phoenix Project. “They don’t see the fact that somebody getting up in the morning, getting dressed and coming here is a big achievement,” she says. “They want outcomes, they want results, they want little boxes ticked.” But Jones stands as proof of what schemes such as this can produce. Having stabilised her life, she now volunteers at the centre. She’s not alone: it has often been former service users themselves who helped to keep the project running. “It’s people that have been there, done it and got the T-shirt,” says Richards, pointing proudly at Jones . “She’s brilliant at helping people because she’s been there. She’s been at rock bottom.” The project may offer a lesson as to how to rebuild the dignity of the south Wales valleys. People can be knocked down by the sweep of powerful economic forces, but solidarity and compassion can help them back to their feet. “Another lady [who came to us] – two years ago she had planned how she was going to kill herself, wasn’t going to tell anyone,” Richards tells me as I leave the Brynmawr community centre and head back to the relative prosperity of Bristol, just 50 miles away. “She’s now got three jobs in a school.” Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain (Atlantic Books) by James Bloodworth is available to pre-order If you have experiences relating to this article that you’d like to share, please email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/06/britain-meritocracy-bath-university-inequality-high-pay","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T11:44:52Z","webTitle":"Britain distrusts meritocracy: that’s the lesson from Bath University | Jeevan Vasagar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/britain-meritocracy-bath-university-inequality-high-pay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/britain-meritocracy-bath-university-inequality-high-pay","fields":{"headline":"Britain distrusts meritocracy: that’s the lesson from Bath University","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A state-educated woman becomes a prize-winning scholar and rises, through intellect and ability, to run an institution with a £263m turnover. This should be a modern-day Cinderella story, with academic achievement standing in for the glass slipper. Instead, Glynis Breakwell, who quit last week as vice-chancellor of Bath University following an outcry over her £468,000 pay package, is this season’s pantomime villain. Joining her in the stocks this week is Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of Southampton University - and the subject of an intensifying row after it emerged that he sits on the salaries committee that awarded him a package worth £433,000. Why do we boo them? There are three reasons – they are seen as out of touch (the £2 claim for biscuits was Breakwell’s Marie Antoinette moment), there is anger over inequality at a time when university pensions face a shortfall, and they are felt to have manipulated the system. These are valid points. But no one has accused Breakwell or Snowden of doing their jobs badly. Indeed, Bath university has climbed league tables, its research grants have grown from £17m to nearly £36m and its student population has doubled to more than 16,000 since Breakwell arrived in 2001 – these are all the signs of a flourishing institution. Snowden is a fellow of the Royal Society, one of Britain’s most eminent scientists. He combines academic strength with business experience gained as chief executive of Filtronic, the wireless telecoms equipment maker. If we want public servants who are capable, we need to accept high pay and high inequality. It is understandable that students and their families feel disquiet about vice-chancellors’ pay when tuition fees in England have reached £9,250, with a top interest rate of 6.1%. Their education isn’t cheap. But we need to remember that Britain’s university sector is the goose that laid a golden egg. They are admired around the world and their talent search is global – Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial all hired their current leaders from overseas. In the US, dozens of college leaders earn more than $1m a year, though admittedly this is easier to swallow when such institutions are private. Universities are a rare example of a service industry that is both concentrated and diffuse. Unlike the City, their benefits are spread around the country. Unlike law firms, they are frequently one of the biggest employers in our cities. We need to pay their managers accordingly. Other countries take leadership seriously, and reward their leaders lavishly. Singapore prides itself on paying civil servants “market competitive” salaries. The Asian country’s prime minister is the highest-paid elected head of government in the world, earning S$2.2m (around £1.2m) a year. It is worth having a debate about pay ratios. Breakwell’s remuneration is around 30 times the salary of the university’s most junior employees. This is a trifling gap by comparison with the distance between the average bank teller and their chief executive. But it is far wider than the five to one ratio that was proposed by Plato – and adopted for a while by Ben and Jerry’s. Universities also need to reform their governance. Allowing members of the remuneration committee to vote down a motion expressing concerns about Breakwell’s pay is unacceptable. Similarly, Snowden should not be sitting on his own salaries committee - even if, as the university says, he was not present at meetings where his pay was decided. This messy governance fuels the suspicion that those at the top of universities are acting as a cosy club. Pay should be tied to performance. Civil servants’ bonuses in Singapore rise and fall with the performance of the economy – this year’s payout will be an extra month’s salary, the biggest bonus in four years. Conversely, Singapore’s prime minister took a 36% pay cut in 2012 at a time of public anger over rising housing costs and declining standards of service on public transport. A similar ethos runs through Singapore’s family businesses, where bosses will often set an example by taking deep pay cuts themselves at times when sales plummet. The crucial point is that the cuts are not a signal of humility but a response to the crisis; and the money is restored when times are good. Andrew Adonis, the Labour peer and former education minister who has led the campaign against vice-chancellors’ pay, has offered to run the university of Bath himself for a month “to clean out the Augean stables”. Lord Adonis added: “I would do it without pay”. This is noble – and would sow the seeds of disaster. A public service cannot be built on saints who work for little or nothing because there is a limited supply of them. Such a policy would not be sustainable or scalable. Universities are strange hybrids: charities that receive public money while touting for customers like a business. They operate in a marketplace which is opaque – how can a teenager easily measure the worth of a geology degree at Manchester against a chemistry degree at Leeds? – and many of their consumers have little choice but to buy their product if they want to get ahead. It is understandable that all this makes it harder for the public to accept lavish rewards for university leaders – compared with the obvious risks taken by an entrepreneur. But the design of the system is not Breakwell or Snowden’s fault. By all means punish our leaders when things go wrong. Vice-chancellors should be held responsible for failing their students by delivering a sub-par education. But reward them for their achievements too. It is time for Britain to decide how comfortable we are with meritocracy. The example of vice-chancellors like Breakwell and Snowden – two people who have strived hard for success – should be an inspiration to undergraduates. If these two do not deserve to be handsomely rewarded for their work, who does? • Jeevan Vasagar is a former Guardian education editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/06/theresa-may-finally-gets-dup-arlene-foster-on-phone-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T12:50:10Z","webTitle":"DUP leader finally talks to May but says border issue still needs work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/06/theresa-may-finally-gets-dup-arlene-foster-on-phone-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/06/theresa-may-finally-gets-dup-arlene-foster-on-phone-brexit","fields":{"headline":"DUP leader finally talks to May but says border issue still needs work","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said there is “still work to be done in London” after her short telephone call to the prime minister on Wednesday morning over the Irish border issue in the Brexit talks. Following her conversation with Theresa May, the DUP said Foster was ready to fly to London to examine the finer points of any agreement. The pair spoke on the phone on Wednesday morning, after Foster declined to take the prime minister’s calls for 24 hours while their officials were thrashing out their differences over No 10’s proposed deal with the EU. May and Foster agreed that staff from both sides would continue to work on the issue of the Irish border – with the DUP concerned about the scope of a promise of continued regulatory “alignment” in the event of no deal. Earlier, Foster said the latest furore could have been avoided if her party had had a seat at the table in the Brexit talks. “There is a need for us to be directly involved,” she said. Referring to the debacle earlier this week over the leaked document, which suggested a post-Brexit deal for the Irish border based on a “regulatory alignment” in terms of trade on the island, Foster said: “If we had been involved directly in the process, in the room, I don’t think we would have arrived at such a stark situation.” The DUP expressed its shock at May’s handling of the talks on Tuesday and appeared to be in little hurry to reach a deal, despite the UK and the EU hoping to sign off an agreement this week. A government source said the prime minister stood ready to travel to Brussels when Britain believes it is in a position to clinch a deal – but that is not expected to be on Wednesday. A spokesman said: “The prime minister said earlier this week we’re making good progress and there’s more work to do. We remain focused on making more progress at the December European council.” May had hoped to settle the issue of the Irish border with the EU on Monday but did not appear to have sufficiently consulted her political partners in the DUP, whose 10 MPs prop up her minority government. The UK was prepared to sign up to the idea of “regulatory alignment” between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, in specific areas such as agriculture and energy, potentially applying across the whole of the UK. However, hopes of a deal fell apart after the DUP said it did not have assurances that No 10 was doing enough to make sure Northern Ireland got exactly the same Brexit deal as the rest of the UK. In a further headache for May, senior leave-supporting Tories, including the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, are unhappy about the idea of the whole of the UK signing up to any “regulatory alignment” with the rest of the EU, as they believe it would defeat the point of Brexit. One senior government source said the Brexiters were keen to “bottom out” the implications of the wording in the proposed agreement. Separately, Sinn Féin warned on Wednesday that Ireland must not be “collateral damage” in any attempt to keep the Tory/DUP pact at Westminster alive. The Sinn Féin MP for Foyle, Elisha McCallion, said: “The solution to Britain’s Brexit crisis in Ireland is clear. The north of Ireland should have designated special status within the EU ensuring that we remain within the customs union and the single market. “That is the only guarantee of stability and certainty and delivers the full protection of the Good Friday agreement in all its parts, including Irish citizenship and the benefits of EU citizenship. “This is a commonsense, practical, and achievable proposal and does not change the constitutional position of the north.” The DUP leader also sought to repair some of the damaged relations with the Irish government on Wednesday. She described the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, as a friend but accused him of taking the “Sinn Féin line” on Brexit talks. Only last month Foster stood side by side with Varadkar at the war memorial in Enniskillen on Remembrance Sunday – the spot where an IRA bomb had killed 11 Protestant civilians on Poppy Day in 1987."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/07/chris-thile-thanks-listening-review-nonesuch","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T18:40:20Z","webTitle":"Chris Thile: Thanks for Listening review – topical songs for a Trumped America","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/07/chris-thile-thanks-listening-review-nonesuch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/07/chris-thile-thanks-listening-review-nonesuch","fields":{"headline":"Chris Thile: Thanks for Listening review – topical songs for a Trumped America","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Not content with conquering the worlds of bluegrass, indie-folk, jazz and JS Bach in recent years, mandolin virtuoso Chris Thile is now the host of liberal America’s most revered radio show, A Prairie Home Companion.
