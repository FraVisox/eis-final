Every day you get a little older, a little closer to the grave – you should taste it all.” A master of contemporary garage rock, he came into prominence as part of the fruitful San Francisco scene of the early 2000s. Since then Thee Oh Sees have rattled out 21 LPs of bewilderingly consistent quality, under various iterations of their name, and Dwyer has written, recorded and released another 20 albums with other collaborators, encompassing everything from industrial electronics to improvised jazz and death metal. In a recent interview with Marc Maron, Dwyer talked of his love of Scott Walker and, in particular, a scene in the Walker documentary 30th Century Man when a percussionist is recorded punching a side of beef; Dwyer has similarly tried to master new sounds, be it a flute on Thee Oh Sees’ Dog Poison or electronic bagpipes on his most recent Damaged Bug LP. His career is full of examples of how to explore genres on a shoestring, too – there are projects that are just drums and vocals (the Drums) or a hefty death metal record squeezed out of three people (Dig That Body Up, It’s Alive). We asked him where to begin in his vast back catalogue. Coachwhips – Bangers vs Fuckers (Narnack, 2003) Coachwhips rewrote the punk aesthetic for the 21st century. Raw, stripped back to the bones of guitar, drums and keys, their shows were chaotic and rambunctious. Bangers vs Fuckers epitomises that, squeezing 11 tracks into 18 minutes, and was notable for Dwyer’s use of a telephone transducer rather than a microphone. “It was very simplistic and was meant to be bombastic and primitive,” Dwyer says. “Doing it the most direct path was key. The music was so abrasive and forward that no one would have noticed any of our innovation. It was a sort of as-much-as-you-can-squeeze-from-nothing aesthetic.” OCS – 34 Reasons Why Life Goes on Without You (Tumult, 2003) “This goes hand-in-hand with the amount of marijuana I was smoking at the time,” is Dwyer’s take on this early OCS material, a stunningly delicate collection of untitled tracks that marks the only time an acoustic guitar has been given prominence in one of his records. Zeigenbock Kopf ‎– IDM LP (KimoSciotic, 2002) The first time Dwyer worked extensively with abrasive electronics was in his band Zeigenbock Kopf. The group aped German industrial to create an abrasive noise overlaid with homoerotic subject matter – the IDM of the title stands for “I dig men” and the cover featured Dwyer dressed as a leather daddy. “I got a lot of heat from this band,” he says. “We had a real mix of people who loved and hated it. I think it goes to show that not every idea is a good idea or needs to be a reality. I was much more into heavier drugs and beats and distorted electronics, so it felt perfect. I had this idea of doing a faux German band, and the leather daddy thing sort of fell into line with it.” Sword &amp; Sandals ‎– Good &amp; Plenty (Empty Cellar, 2010) This project with Randy Sutherland and Shaun O’Dell wraps duelling saxophones around blistering percussion. “I love jazz and improvisation,” he says. “That band was real fun. We played a lot of shows in the woods, on the street, in art galleries and bookstores. Even today we have massive segments of improvisation in Thee Oh Sees, so why not [do it]? It would be boring otherwise.” Damaged Bug – Bunker Funk (Castle Face, 2017) With Thee Oh Sees constantly touring and recording, it is astounding that Dwyer finds time to work on his own Damaged Bug solo project, full of instrumental experiments (like the aforementioned bagpipes). “It’s my meditation – I love doing it,” Dwyer says. “I love to be consumed in art, whether it be my own or somebody else’s. I love Philip K Dick, Truman Capote, Flannery O’Connor, Peter Watts, Ben Wheatley, Stanley Kubrick, Peter Weir … the list could go on for days. I’m always working.” With that approach, it would not be a surprise to see 40 more releases over the next two decades. • Memory of a Cut Off Head by OCS is out now on Castle Face."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/21/poland-faces-100000-a-day-fines-over-illegal-logging-in-biaowieza-forest","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T11:21:14Z","webTitle":"Poland faces €100,000-a-day fines over illegal logging in Białowieża forest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/21/poland-faces-100000-a-day-fines-over-illegal-logging-in-biaowieza-forest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/21/poland-faces-100000-a-day-fines-over-illegal-logging-in-biaowieza-forest","fields":{"headline":"Poland faces €100,000-a-day fines over illegal logging in Białowieża forest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Poland has been given two weeks to stop illegal deforestation in the Unesco-protected Białowieża forest or face fines of at least €100,000 a day. In a precedent-setting ruling that will echo across the EU, the European court of justice ordered Poland to show it was acting lawfully in the ancient woodland, or face a €36.5m (£32m) annual penalty. Agata Szafraniuk, a lawyer for the green law firm ClientEarth, said that the court was acting after Poland’s environment minister, Jan Szyszko, showed “complete contempt” for an earlier emergency ban on logging in the ancient woodland. “Financial penalties are, unfortunately, an essential tool to ensure that the best-preserved primeval forest in Europe is protected from further harm,” she said. “Trees are still being cut down every day, so the court prescribed this measure to guarantee the full protection of this unique forest, and to avoid irreparable damage.” The court move will ratchet up pressure on Poland, which is already facing a suspension of its EU Council voting rights over a clampdown on the country’s independent press and judiciary. Women’s groups have also been targeted for police raids, and rights to protest have been curtailed, adding to concerns about the rule of law in the east European country. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, condemned Poland’s nationalist-right Law and Justice party government on Sunday, suggesting it was following the “Kremlin’s plan”. The Polish government maintains that it always behaves lawfully and that logging in Białowieża is necessary to staunch a spruce bark beetle outbreak. “In the western media, everything is based on disinformation,” a Polish government spokesman told the Guardian. “We are doing everything right by law. We are using EU law. We are using Polish law, and we are doing nothing against decisions made by the European court of justice.” Greenpeace says that it has logged photographic evidence of violations to the court’s “public safety” condition for logging in 16 out of 30 areas of Białowieża surveyed . Szyszko though, has previously accused the EU of “spreading lies” by using photos of extensive logging in Białowieża that he claimed were “manipulated” in a cyber-attack. While the EU’s case on illegal logging was “without any arguments, ours are based on facts and documents,” the Polish official said. “Białowieża is not the last primeval forest, because it was made by local people, and we have facts and books that show that people were there from the beginning.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/21/huddersfield-hits-40-contemporary-music-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T15:27:20Z","webTitle":"Huddersfield hits 40 with a broader scope but its spirit undimmed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/21/huddersfield-hits-40-contemporary-music-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/21/huddersfield-hits-40-contemporary-music-festival","fields":{"headline":"Huddersfield hits 40 with a broader scope but its spirit undimmed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK, even today, is not well blessed with festivals devoted to new music. But when the Huddersfield contemporary music festival began, in 1978, the situation was much worse, with no annual showcase here for what living composers were producing. That such an event took root in an unprepossessing West Yorkshire industrial town in the late 70s was remarkable in itself, especially when most of the activity in new music then was centred on London. What began on a modest scale under the aegis of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the University of Huddersfield) – where the festival’s tireless founding director, Richard Steinitz, was a lecturer in music – grew quickly into one of the most important dates in the British musical calendar. The HCMF really hit its stride in the early 80s, hosting a series of important premieres alongside residencies from many of the senior figures of postwar music, from Olivier Messiaen and Terry Riley to Hans Werner Henze and Elliott Carter. Gradually expanding its ambition and range, Steinitz’s programming was never narrowly doctrinal; from the early days, he tried to reflect the spectrum of what was going on across Europe and the US. Steinitz stood down as director after the 2000 festival. The current director, Graham McKenzie, has been there for more than a decade, not only steering the programming towards new generations of composers from across Europe, but also broadening the stylistic scope, including events that touch on jazz, electronica and rock. With these changes, so the atmosphere of the festival has altered. This is partly because the generation of postwar composers whose appearances made the early festivals so memorable has all but gone, but also because, in those days, festival audiences had a sense of a shared purpose. Performers and visitors tended to stay in the same hotel, where you might have been confronted with Karlheinz Stockhausen and his retinue at breakfast or have found yourself sharing a table for a postconcert Indian meal with Iannis Xenakis. Now, things seem more diffuse. New music has split into so many strands in the past 20 years that perhaps this was inevitable. However, the opening weekend of this year’s 40th festival demonstrated the way in which Huddersfield has continued to sustain its longstanding associations, while also spotlighting less familiar names. There were major premieres from two of the senior figures in British music today, James Dillon and Brian Ferneyhough, as well as concerts devoted to the works of the US-born, Toronto-based Linda Catlin Smith. Dillon’s connection with Huddersfield goes back to the first festival, when he was awarded the young composer’s prize. A number of his pieces have received their first performances here since, often when his music was otherwise ignored in Britain. The latest, commissioned to open this year’s festival, is his second work for the Red Note Ensemble, the group that also introduced his New York Triptych there four years ago. A 45-minute piece in three movements, Tanz/haus: triptych 2017 came with a cryptic programme note from Dillon himself – just a quotation from Heinrich von Kleist and the etymology of the title. The music, though, was compelling, with electric guitar and accordion adding a distinctive edge to the sound of the nine-piece ensemble. As so often with Dillon, there seems to be an oblique dialogue with the past, with the ghosts of other music flickering around the new work. There are the decaying remains of a funeral march in the first movement, for instance, while the textures and the harmonies create a world that seems constantly to be on the edge of imploding or crumbling away. Ferneyhough’s Umbrations, brought to Huddersfield by Ensemble Modern and the Arditti Quartet, is a collection of 11 pieces compiled over the past decade, all based on the viol-consort music of the English renaissance composer Christopher Tye. There is nothing remotely anecdotal about Ferneyhough’s writing. What he calls an “almost open-ended collection of encounters” interleaves string-quartet movements with ensemble pieces that are typically highly wrought, yet always pungently vivid. Alongside those scores, Catlin Smith’s music seemed joyously straightforward. Eve Egoyan played two of her piano pieces – The Underfolding, an exploration of dense, dark harmonies, and Nocturnes and Chorales, a sequence of spare miniatures of lonely melodies and lingering harmonic sequences. Quatuor Bozzini played two string quartets, Gondola and Folkestone, which confirmed Catlin Smith’s fondness for constructing large-scale form from musical vignettes, just as her Piano Quintet (in which Philip Thomas joined the Bozzinis) showed how refined her tonal and harmonic palette is. The biggest compliment one can pay any composer in today’s crowded musical world is to say that their music has a distinctive voice. Catlin Smith’s undoubtedly has that. • Dillon’s Tanz/haus: triptych 2017 performance is available on BBC iPlayer until 18 December. Ferneyhough’s Umbrations will be broadcast on Radio 3’s Hear and Now on 2 December. The Huddersfield contemporary music festival continues until 26 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/nov/21/talking-horses-harringtons-mission-to-get-sizing-john-to-cheltenham","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T08:44:40Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Harrington's mission to get Sizing John to Cheltenham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/21/talking-horses-harringtons-mission-to-get-sizing-john-to-cheltenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/21/talking-horses-harringtons-mission-to-get-sizing-john-to-cheltenham","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Harrington's mission to get Sizing John to Cheltenham","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook In among the heady speculation at Jessica Harrington’s yard about what Sizing John might do this season, there was a moment of realism yesterday. It came when the trainer stated her baseline ambition for the horse. “I’d like to get him back to the Gold Cup because the last two Gold Cup winners haven’t even got back. That’s Plan A, to get him there. Whatever happens after that will be a bonus.” Harrington is right about this. Neither Coneygree nor Don Cossack made it back to the Gold Cup the year after winning it. This is part of being a top-class staying chaser, in my view; in most cases, you only get a year at the top. Winning a race like that comes at a cost, which can be that the winner is either unwilling or incapable of a reprise. “My only worry,” Harrington continued, “is maybe the three hard races last year might leave a mark on him. But he’d had a good few hard races the year before and he seemed to come out of it very well.” Sizing John is only seven, rising eight, and he looked a picture yesterday. I have high hopes for him. To Southwell for some jump racing, where Pretty Reckless (12.30) is the nap. This is a rarity, a four-year-old filly being campaigned over fences as her trainer, Dan Skelton, makes best use of her fluent jumping. She hasn’t won by wide margins in her two successes since Harry Skelton returned to her saddle in September but she gives the distinct impression of more to come. She’s a half-sister to Heath Hunter (who won from 20lb higher) and is 2-1 to go in again today. At a more generous 12-1, Whin Park (1.30) may be worth chancing in a handicap hurdle, just his second attempt in a handicap. From the excellent Ben Pauling yard that had a double on Sunday, he put up a fine performance on his seasonal return here last month but ultimately needed the run and tired into fourth. An improved showing here puts him right in the argument. Windy Writer (3.00) is an interesting 10-1 on his second start for Sam England, who has proved effective in handicaps. Four of his five best runs have been at this track and he went well for a long way on his seasonal reappearance last month. If he’s sharper this time or benefits from the fitting of a tongue tie, he can get into this, having been dropped 5lb for his latest defeat. He was previously with Shaun Lycett, who went winless through the last season he had the horse.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had “abused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS” by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than £34m on the drug last year, up from about £600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to £9.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel’s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug. The medicine, a synthetic version of the hormone T3, is taken by patients who do not respond well to the cheaper alternative, levothyroxine. It is sold across Europe for a few cents per pill. The CMA chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: “Pharmaceutical companies which abuse their position and overcharge for drugs are forcing the NHS – and the UK taxpayer – to pay over the odds for important medical treatments. “We allege that Concordia used its market dominance in the supply of liothyronine tablets to do exactly that. “At this stage in the investigation, our findings are provisional and there has been no definitive decision that there has been a breach of competition law. We will carefully consider any representations from the companies before deciding whether the law has in fact been broken.” Concordia and the private equity firms Cinven and HgCapital, the previous owners of Amdipharm Mercury which was acquired by Concordia in 2015, have been asked to respond to the findings. Concordia said it would review the findings, but added: “We do not believe that competition law has been infringed. The pricing of liothyronine has been conducted openly and transparently with the Department of Health in the UK over a period of 10 years. “Over that time, significant investment has been made in this medicine to ensure its continued availability for patients in the UK, to the specifications required by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK.” The British Thyroid Foundation said: “There are many thyroid patients who have told us that this medicine makes a huge difference to their lives and the enormous price rise has caused significant confusion and distress. “We look forward to the CMA’s final decision and very much hope that it will lead to an improvement in care for patients with hypothyroidism.” The drug industry body said it “does not in any way support or condone any deliberate ‘price hikes’ by pharmaceutical companies”. Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: “We fully support the CMA in taking action in cases of proven abuse of market power. We also continue to support the government in taking policy steps to ensure such abuses cannot happen in the future. “This case is yet to conclude, but we do not – and will not – support any company found to have intentionally exploited the NHS.”In a consultation paper published in July, NHS England recommended that health trusts should not prescribe the pill for new patients. It said it was clinically effective but there were cheaper alternatives. Concordia is the subject of a further CMA investigation. The regulator said in March in a provisional finding that the Canadian firm had made illegal deals with its rival Actavis UK to inflate the price of life-saving hydrocortisone tablets in Britain. Last year, the CMA fined the US pharma giant Pfizer and drug distributor Flynn Pharma nearly £90m – including a record £84m penalty for Pfizer – after they increased the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug by up to 2,600%. Britain’s biggest drugmaker, GlaxoSmithKline, and two other firms were fined £45m over the antidepressant paroxetine. Both decisions are under appeal. The CMA is carrying out seven other investigations in relation to drug pricing and competition issues. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/22/turnbull-government-uses-modelling-to-pressure-states-on-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"Turnbull government uses modelling to pressure states on energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/turnbull-government-uses-modelling-to-pressure-states-on-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/turnbull-government-uses-modelling-to-pressure-states-on-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull government uses modelling to pressure states on energy policy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Turnbull government has deployed new modelling on the national energy guarantee in an effort to step up pressure on state governments to sign up to its policy at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. A summary of the modelling, circulated by the government in advance of the talks with the states, suggests household power bills between 2020 and 2030 would be “in the order of” $120 a year lower, in today’s dollars, than under a business-as-usual scenario, if the policy applied across the national electricity market. The material supplied by the government says wholesale electricity prices would be 23% lower than business-as-usual between 2020 and 2030, and it suggests the share of renewables in the market by 2030 “could range from 32% to 36%”. The full modelling, undertaken for the Energy Security Board by Frontier Economics, has not yet been distributed to state energy ministers and the documents circulated in Canberra are a summary of the findings, not the work itself. The Turnbull government announced in October it would dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and proceed with the national energy guarantee – a policy that imposes new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The policy requires cooperation from the states but some of the Labor governments, particularly South Australia, have been hostile. Part of the reason for that is the states were involved in the exhaustive consultations with Finkel about the clean energy target but were not kept in the loop about the national energy guarantee. Some state governments are also concerned the Turnbull policy will hard-bake coal into the system at the expense of renewables at a time when the energy market needs to transition to low-emissions power sources. A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is continuing to insist that the state will not commit to sign on to the national energy guarantee in the absence of data showing its specific impact on the state. The Labor states have also commissioned their own work through the Council of Australian Governments energy council examining whether or not they could implement a clean energy target by themselves. The lack of agreement has unsettled business groups. A joint statement from 16 business, energy, farmers, trade union and welfare groups has urged governments to collaborate. The joint statement notes the national energy guarantee is “only a concept at this point, with much development required, but we are hopeful that this further work will identify that the proposed mechanism can deliver”. The statement notes pointedly there are “no apparent alternatives at present that are both potentially functional and potentially acceptable to all sides of politics”. It says stakeholders in the community will not agree to “just anything”, and neither should energy ministers, but governments should maintain goodwill and forward momentum. “What the Coag energy council meeting in Hobart this week should do is agree a work plan and full consultation to resolve the many unanswered questions about the guarantee as soon as possible and produce a fully fledged design ready for consideration, agreement and implementation,” the joint statement says. “Without timely progress Australia will see energy costs and emissions increase, threatening our society, environment and economy.” While the states remain to be convinced, and stakeholders are concerned about the current trajectory, Turnbull has declared the new modelling “a wake-up call to Labor and the states”. “They should work with government to bring down prices, increase reliability and meet our international emission reduction commitments,” the prime minister said. “The independent experts have spoken – our plan will cut power bills and ensure the lights stay on.” The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the new modelling suggested savings for households would be higher than initially forecast. The government released some preliminary estimates of cost impacts of the scheme when it unveiled the national energy guarantee policy last month. The first-run estimates said wholesale prices were expected to decline by 20% to 25% a year between 2020 and 2030 and residential bills would go down “in the order of” $100 to $115 a year over the same period. After stakeholders queried the initial figures, given the lack of detailed modelling, the Turnbull government asked the Energy Security Board to model a “least-cost trajectory” assuming an emissions reduction target for electricity of 26% on 2005 levels by 2030, and a “constant target post-2030”. The scope for the modelling included analysis on “an optimised non-linear trajectory” for emissions reduction – which suggests the government in Canberra might look to back-end load emissions reduction commitments in Australia’s electricity sector to the latter half of the decade between 2020 and 2030. The direction on the modelling also suggests the government wants the new reliability and emissions reduction obligations in place by 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/21/nt-police-failed-to-act-after-suicide-attempts-in-caged-vehicles-coroner-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T05:15:52Z","webTitle":"NT police failed to act after suicide attempts in caged vehicles, coroner finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/21/nt-police-failed-to-act-after-suicide-attempts-in-caged-vehicles-coroner-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/21/nt-police-failed-to-act-after-suicide-attempts-in-caged-vehicles-coroner-finds","fields":{"headline":"NT police failed to act after suicide attempts in caged vehicles, coroner finds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Northern Territory police failed to act on a string of self-harm and suicide attempts in caged police vehicles before the death of a vulnerable 23-year-old man last year, a coroner has found. NT coroner Greg Cavanagh has criticised police for failing to act on an internal report recommending CCTV cameras be installed in caged vehicles in 2013, following an earlier death in custody. In the three years between the two deaths, there were at least 16 attempted suicides in caged vehicles. “In six cases the persons were not detected until they were semi-conscious or unconscious,” Cavanagh found. “It wasn’t a matter of if a person would die in the back of a police van but when.” On 16 September last year, two officers were making their way through Darwin, on their way to investigate a noise complaint, when they came across the scene of a serious crash. A Toyota Hilux had smashed into a palm tree on the corner of the Stuart Highway and Bargot Road, not far from Darwin airport. Hiding behind some vegetation was Dale Scott Walkinshaw, 23. Walkinshaw was unharmed but held his passenger in his arms. The young woman, whom he had met earlier at a bar, was in and out of consciousness, having suffered an injury to her back. Walkinshaw was well over the limit, returning a reading of 0.149. The coroner noted he expressed regular concern and distress over his passenger’s wellbeing. He was placed in the back of a caged vehicle, taken to the police station and then to the Royal Darwin hospital. When police arrived at the hospital, they immediately realised something was wrong. “[The officer] opened the cage door,” the coroner found. “He found Dale sitting bolt upright with his head turned to the side. His tongue was out and his face grey.” Walkinshaw was revived but suffered a serious brain injury. His life support was turned off three days later. The inquest into his death heard officers in the cabin of the vehicle had trouble seeing into the caged part. Visibility was particularly poor in the dark and because of condensation on the window. Lights intended to illuminate the cage of the vehicle reflected into the cabin, making it even harder to see. Realistically, police could check on the cage’s occupant only by stopping the vehicle, getting out and opening the back door. Similar visibility issues had been raised before the same coroner in 2013, after the death of Kwementyaye Briscoe, 27. Briscoe, an Indigenous man taken into “protective custody”, was able to consume a 700ml bottle of rum in the back of a caged vehicle before reaching the watch house. He subsequently died due to a litany of errors and failures, which caused Cavanagh to criticise NT police for being derelict in their duty of care. At the Walkinshaw inquest, police conceded they should have installed cameras in caged vehicles after the 2013 death. It would have cost about $823 per vehicle, or about $132,000 for the total fleet. Police conducted a successful trial in five vehicles but did not roll the cameras out more broadly. “The reasons for that are not obvious,” Cavanagh found. “At the inquest the deputy commissioner told me that the project ‘dropped off the radar’.” A large number of incidents since had prompted no further action. Two weeks before Walkinshaw’s death, Cavanagh made a recommendation in another inquest that CCTV cameras be installed in caged vehicles. He said the cameras might have led to a different outcome. “It might be thought that if police had the ability to see what was happening in the cage at that time he [Walkinshaw] would not have been able to end his life so tragically,” he said. Another CCTV trial was held this year. It was successful and the NT police now plan to install cameras in its entire fleet. The NT police assistant commissioner, Michael Murphy, said in a statement that the force fully accepted the recommendations of the coroner and had already commenced work on each. “We extend our deepest condolences to the family and regret the loss and pain they have endured,” Murphy said. “At this time we have one caged vehicle fitted with cameras and equipment, and will continue with the installation of this camera technology into our caged vehicles, aligning with the timelines I provided in the coronial inquest of between six and 12 months.” At the inquest, the police, represented by Angus Stewart SC, conceded the cameras should have been installed earlier. “I have instructions from the commissioner of the Northern Territory police to tell your honour firstly that the commissioner accepts that following the recommendations in 2013 with regards to the installation of CCTV in the cages of police vehicles, there should have been a rollout of that and there wasn’t,” Stewart said. Cavanagh said police did not need “the benefit of hindsight” to appreciate what needed to be done. “In my view, it is tragic that it took the death of this young man to focus the minds of senior police,” he said.

Respondents to a Guardian callout said they thought Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was waging a war against them, and they felt a change in mood towards their community across the country – including in areas where they had previously enjoyed personal freedom. Authorities in Ankara imposed a ban on all LGBT cultural events on Sunday night, citing threats to public order and fear of “provoking reactions within certain segments of society”. Days earlier, they banned a festival of German-language gay films in the capital city. Idil, 25, who lives in a small city in southern Turkey, said he was used to the government’s lack of acceptance for the LGBT community, but he feared authorities were now acting on their words. “I wasn’t so surprised when I heard [the news]. I have participated in gay pride in Istanbul since 2009. The atmosphere was always really peaceful but, in the last years, it became a tour de force of the police. Brutal attacks have already given a clue about what we were going to experience. I think that this is just a start.” Last week, Erdoğan said empowering gay people was “against the values of our nation”, echoing a sentiment he expressed earlier in the year after cancelling Istanbul’s gay pride parade for a third year in a row. Police used rubber bullets and detained 10 people to suppress the event, according to the Turkish newspaper Hürriyet. Idil said he was worried that the government’s bullying attitude to the LGBT community was legitimising homophobia and encouraging people to voice their prejudices. “I think the nationalism which is rising day by day in Turkey has an influence on what people think about the LGBT community. According to the majority of people, we cannot be the descendant of our supposedly glorious ancestors,” he said. “It isn’t just uneducated people but also the well-educated who think that being gay is not natural. When they want to humiliate someone, they easily use word ibne, which means gay in Turkish.” Necmiye, 40, who works in Istanbul, also said the ban was not a surprise, and he emphasised that the government’s anti-secular stance was extremely dangerous. “The public were told that secularism was the enemy of Islam and its values. But LGBTI+ people are citizens of this country and it is the state’s duty to protect them. If there is an issue of homophobia, rather than trying to hush down the LGBTI+ movement, the public needs to be educated,” he said. Like everyone who responded to our callout, Leyla a 22-year-old student from Istanbul, asked to disguise her identity as she feared reprisals for speaking out. “No one ever wants to attend the LGBTI events or protest any more,” she said. “People want their reputation to stay clean. They couldn’t even use their names or faces in something about LGBTI. And also other hate crimes get more common because the judges sentence the criminals not as bad as they deserve.” According to those who responded to our callout, attacks on the LGBTI community are frequent and it is ironic that authorities cite threats to public order as a reason for curtailing freedoms. “The community is lovely as we try to help each other out at all times; however, not many of us can talk openly about who we truly are and who we truly love,” said Leyla. “As we are kind of forced to live in the closet, most of us try to show support to the LGBTQ+ community and individuals through social media accounts with fake names.” But it was the government’s claim that LGBT events could provoke “reactions within certain segments of society” that respondents said was the most worrying. Sune, a student in the south of Turkey, said he had been constantly bullied by his peers because of his identity. “It is really hard to live in Turkey. We are exposed to a lot of discrimination and bad treatment because the majority of society is conservative. Even our families do not like it and do not accept us. It is more convenient to live in cosmopolitan cities, such as Istanbul and Ankara, but life is really hard for those living in rural areas like me,” he said. “People have been asked which of the minority groups you would not want to be your neighbour and 90-95% of respondents say they do not want to be next door to homosexuals. “If you want to be gay in Turkey, go to the Netherlands. If I can, I do not want to stay for a second. I want to go to Netherlands. I really wanted to live abroad and complete my education there.” Another respondent, Damir, said many of his friends had relocated to other countries because of the political situation and the hampering of LGBT rights. “The rise of political Islam meant that everything from legislations to education was seen as not Islamic enough,” he said. “It is such a shame that the unique status of Turkey as the most LGBTI+ friendly Muslim-majority country is being eroded.” *All names have been changed due to security considerations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/21/jana-novotna-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T13:17:54Z","webTitle":"Jana Novotná obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/21/jana-novotna-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/21/jana-novotna-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Jana Novotná obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Czech tennis player Jana Novotná, who has died of cancer aged 49, had a career of consistent success that would have more than satisfied most players, but fell some way short of what she would have achieved had she possessed a much steadier nerve. In 1998, the year before she retired, Novotná became only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money and in the same year was within reach of being ranked No 1 in the world. As an athlete she was among the best of her era, possessed of consummate skill in the dying and difficult art of serve-and-volley and an ability to deliver a backhand smash that was the envy of her peers. And yet in her 14 years at the top of the women’s game she won only 24 tour singles titles. Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title. The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotná herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she “got a little tight”. Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German. But she double-faulted to announce one of the great Wimbledon meltdowns. Not much more than 10 minutes later Graf had won 7-6, 1-6, 6-4. The Duchess of Kent, trying to console the Czech player at the awards ceremony, said: “Don’t worry, Jana, you’ll be back next year.” That did it for Novotná – moments later her head was in the crook of the Duchess’s right arm as she cried on the royal shoulder. “I wanted to handle myself well,” she said, “but when she smiled at me I just let go.” In 1997 Novotná was back in the Wimbledon final against the 16-year-old Swiss player Martina Hingis. Although this time it was excusable that she lost, given that she was suffering from a strained abdominal muscle, she still threw away a one-set lead and a 2-0 advantage in the final set of a 6-2, 3-6, 3-6 defeat. The Duchess of Kent was again on hand, this time, though, in the role of soothsayer rather than trauma therapist. “I told her I’m getting a bit old,” Novotná said, “and she said to me my third time would be lucky.” And so, by royal decree, it came to pass. A year later Novotná avenged her defeat by Hingis with a straight sets win in the semi-finals and then in the final held firm in a second-set tie break to beat Nathalie Tauziat of France 6-4, 7-6. Even that stern wordsmith Rudyard Kipling would surely have forgiven Novotná her refusal to abide by his stricture, inscribed above the players’ entrance to Centre Court, to treat the twin impostors, triumph and disaster, just the same. She did in fact cry in her moment of triumph but they were very different tears from those that followed her 1993 disaster. By the time she reached the Duchess she was almost composed and the pair clasped hands in joint celebration. “I’m proud of you,” the Duchess said. At 29 years and nine months, Novotná had become the oldest first-time winner of a women’s singles title since grand slam events first accepted professionals in 1968. It was probably a sign of her vulnerability that it was in partnership with other players that she achieved far greater grand slam success than as a singles player. Set against her solitary singles title was a total of 12 in doubles – four of them with Helena Suková – and four in mixed doubles – with Jim Pugh. In later years, after retiring in 1999, Novotná became a coach herself and also a member of the BBC’s commentary team at Wimbledon. As on the court, she was a natural in the commentary box without being assertive: it was said that her microphone always needed a boost because she was so softly spoken. Having lived for some years in Florida in the US, Novotná had returned in 2010 to live near Brno, where she had been born, in communist Czechoslovakia, to František, an engineer, and Libuše, a teacher. Despite her globetrotting she always felt happiest in the Brno area and had recently built a house in the nearby village of Omice, where she lived with her partner, the Polish tennis player Iwona Kuczyńska, who survives her, along with her parents and her brother, Pavol. • Jana Novotná, tennis player, born 2 October 1968; died 19 November 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/21/easyjet-profits-passenger-numbers-weak-pound","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T13:55:47Z","webTitle":"EasyJet profits plunge despite record passenger numbers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/21/easyjet-profits-passenger-numbers-weak-pound","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/21/easyjet-profits-passenger-numbers-weak-pound","fields":{"headline":"EasyJet profits plunge despite record passenger numbers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than £100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded £5bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was “a difficult year for the aviation industry”. McCall said: “Our planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe’s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.” Profits before tax fell from £494m to £408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of £101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was “a technical, administrative thing” and the airline had “no concerns” about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was “primarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market”. The collapse of Monarch, plus the decision by Ryanair to cancel thousands of flights, has reduced competition in the low-cost sector for this autumn and winter. McCall said there was “positive momentum” including rising ancillary revenues, driven by high sales on the mobile app, as well better inflight brands. EasyJet expects to increase its capacity by another 6% next year, before the expected addition of Air Berlin slots. The company last month announced it would acquire part of the German airline’s operations at Berlin Tegel airport, including leases for up to 25 A320 aircraft and taking on up to 1,000 crew in a £40m deal. The airline said it would expect a further £60m costs before it turns around the loss-making operation but would see a profit by 2019. The airline said it would pay dividends of 40.9p per share in March, a windfall of about £55m for the biggest shareholder, Haji-Ioannou. McCall is leaving easyJet at the end of November to run broadcaster ITV, and will be replaced as chief executive by Johan Lundgren, previously deputy chief executive of Tui Group. The newcomer will earn a basic salary 5% higher than McCall’s at £740,000 – raising further questions about the gender pay gap. McCall said it was a question for the board: “I don’t set the salary for the successor. The board has to set the right salary.” She said she was proud to have increased customer loyalty at easyJet during her seven years in charge. “Our customers don’t see the low-cost model – we have got enormous loyalty from passengers, 60 million last year were repeat customers. That’s testimony to our crew and people.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/09/fit-in-my-40s-gut-bacteria-analysed-zoe-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T06:59:00Z","webTitle":"Fit in my 40s: what my gut bacteria says about me","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/09/fit-in-my-40s-gut-bacteria-analysed-zoe-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/09/fit-in-my-40s-gut-bacteria-analysed-zoe-williams","fields":{"headline":"Fit in my 40s: what my gut bacteria says about me","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are three broad categories of microbiome, named by Atlas, a company that will analyse the bacterial environment in your gut: the Urban Citizen, the Village Peasant and the Indigene. Your type can change if you significantly alter your diet. Anyone with any sense wants to be an Indigene, since the Urban Citizen is associated with the “western diet” (code for: “some Cinnamon Grahams and a KFC, what of it?”) and the Village Peasant sounds a bit, you know, dumpy. However, the Indigene is most prevalent in isolated tribespeople from the Amazon and Africa, or failing that, vegetarians. I got my results back from the £125 test I did in August, a complicated business of trapping poo on a piece of paper. I did this because your gut environment is as vital to your overall health as your hormonal one, or your brain chemistry; its health is determined by bacterial balance, which in turn is affected by your diet. I’m a Village Peasant. It turns out, now that I am one, they’re the best. I have bacteria from the Dorea genus to reduce inflammation of the gut, making it less likely that I’ll get Crohn’s disease. I have eubacterium, built by bananas and barley which, since I hate bananas, I can only ascribe to my high consumption of Ovaltine. This, apparently, has a prophylactic effect against various cancers. The results also break down the “citizenship” of my gut bacteria – that is, the places whose typical diets produce biomes like mine: Village Peasant is the gut environment of the rural Russian population, people so strong they can go out in subzero temperatures wearing only ear-muffs. So it’s no surprise that I’m 42% Russian; also, 44% Danish, a little bit Malawian, and a bit Chinese and, like the Labour manifesto, 0.2% Venezuelan. Look, nobody said I was perfect: my recommendations are that I should eat soy, miso, apples, grapes and porridge to increase the proportion of good bacteria. I should eat fish oil, black tea, tomatoes and garlic to guard against obesity, which sounds like a cocktail so revolting as to put you off food, and guard against obesity that way. Artichokes, jerusalem artichokes, asparagus and more garlic would increase my potential for fibre metabolism (though anyone who knew me would say that if I ate any more garlic, I would smell like a gas leak). Buckwheat, chokeberries and sweetcorn would be brilliant for maximising my vitamin B synthesis, or alternatively, if I wanted to stop being invited to anybody’s house. My disease risks for everything that can be measured (atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes, colitis) are low. Having said I wasn’t perfect, it’s hard to pinpoint the respect in which my digestion could be better. I actually am perfect. “Then how come,” said my Mister, weighing his words carefully, “you fart every time you stand up?” I honestly don’t know. I guess that’s just bad manners.

John Lewis has become a prime target for Stop Funding Hate on the back of the launch of its Christmas advert and as retailers increase their spending on advertising as the festive season approaches. Stop Funding Hate has produced a mock advert that depicts the star of last year’s John Lewis Christmas advert – Buster the dog – as unhappy because the retailer is buying adverts with the Mail, Sun, and Express. The video has been shared almost 10,000 times on Twitter and Facebook. Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose are also being targeted by Stop Funding Hate. The organisation was founded last year and says its aim is to take on “divisive hate campaigns” by the Mail, Sun and Express, and persuade advertisers to cease their financial input. Richard Wilson, the founder of Stop Funding Hate, said: “[John Lewis] are a company well known for their ethical values and one that people have a lot of respect for. Customers are saying there is a clash between what the brand stands for and these newspapers. It would be great if John Lewis made a move, but another company could make a move too.” However, John Lewis said it would continue advertising with the newspapers and not bow to the pressure. A spokesperson said: “Withdrawing advertising on the basis of editorial coverage would be inconsistent with our democratic principles, which include freedom of speech and remaining apolitical.” Paperchase announced on Monday that it would not run any marketing campaigns with the Daily Mail and said it was “truly sorry” for running a front-page promotion in Saturday’s edition of the newspaper. Stop Funding Hate encouraged Paperchase customers on social media to express their disappointment with the retailer after the promotion appeared. However, Paperchase’s apology has provoked a backlash, with the Daily Mail saying it was deeply worrying that the greeting card retailer had allowed itself to be bullied by a “small group of hard-left Corbynist individuals seeking to suppress legitimate debate”. Stop Funding Hate targets the Daily Mail, Sun and Daily Express, and claims on its website that 23 companies and organisations have now said they will not advertise with one or all of the newspapers. The list includes Lego, the Body Shop, the fashion retailer Joy, and Evans Cycles, as well as Paperchase. The campaign group has also published lists of the top 10 advertisers in the Mail, Sun and Express, and its website includes links to the Twitter accounts of Britain’s largest supermarkets so that customers can express their concerns. Wilson denied that Stop Funding Hate was suppressing freedom of speech or that Paperchase had been bullied, saying it had been a “civilised conversation” with the retailer. “If you look at the tweets [to Paperchase], they were very friendly overall as far I could see,” he said. “Customers have a right to freedom of expression as well and Paperchase has a right to choose where it does and does not advertise. Censorship has a clear definition and talking to Paperchase and asking them to switch advertising is not a breach of freedom of speech. No human rights have been abused by Paperchase switching from the Daily Mail. It’s a business choice.” A spokesperson for the Daily Mail said: “All newspapers, the Guardian included, should be deeply concerned at this sinister campaign by a tiny group of hard-left, Corbynist internet activists – ardent Remainers – to use social media trolling to shut down legitimate debate in order to impose their own views on the Mail and other newspapers. “Anyone who values freedom of expression should equally be disturbed by Stop Funding Hate’s attempts to apply commercial pressure to newspapers’ advertisers and business partners in order to influence their editorial decisions. If big business was using this tactic against the Guardian your liberal commentators would rightly be outraged. “Stop Funding Hate’s founder, Richard Wilson, chillingly described their aims last night – ‘the end point for us is a media that does the job that we all want it to’. There you have it: an arrogant, self-appointed group of internet activists using trolling to silence a free press enjoyed by millions, and force it to promote their views alone.” In response to the Mail’s comment, Stop Funding Hate said: “Stop Funding Hate is a non-partisan human rights campaign focussed solely on the issue of hate speech and discrimination. We have no position on any other issue. “We are shocked at the personalised attacks that have been directed at Stop Funding Hate supporters in recent days – and at attempts by the Daily Mail and others to delegitimise peaceful protest by characterising consumer engagement as ‘sinister’ and ‘bullying’. “For the avoidance of doubt, Stop Funding Hate is not linked to, or aligned to, any political party. We are funded by voluntary donations from thousands of members of the public. “We are proud to have supporters from a wide range of backgrounds and political viewpoints – and welcome the support of everyone who shares our values.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/22/key-charts-november-2017-budget-philip-hammond-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T06:33:38Z","webTitle":"Five key charts you need to see to explain the budget","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/key-charts-november-2017-budget-philip-hammond-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/key-charts-november-2017-budget-philip-hammond-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Five key charts you need to see to explain the budget","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is delivering one of the most difficult budgets in recent times, set against a backdrop of weaker growth, Brexit uncertainty and falling living standards. Here are five key charts to consider. 1. The UK is slipping down the G7 leader board as growth slows Britain was second only to Germany in 2016 in the growth league table of the G7 leading industrial nations. It is a boast the chancellor will not be able to make this time around, as the UK is expected to slip down the leader board in both 2017 and 2018, as Brexit uncertainty weighs on consumers and businesses. The International Monetary Fund is predicting UK growth will slow to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018. Revised forecasts from the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), are likely to reflect Britain’s weaker growth prospects. 2. Wages are falling in real terms as prices rise faster than pay Hammond will deliver this budget at a time when family finances are under renewed strain from falling real pay. As the chart above shows, the financial crisis took a heavy toll on UK living standards, as prices roses faster than wage in the six years from 2008. Following a brief respite in 2015 and 2016, falling real pay returned in 2017 as the sharp fall in the value pound drove up the cost of imported goods and fed through to higher inflation. Inflation has risen from 0.5% in June 2016 – the month of the referendum – to 3% in October. Wage growth has failed to keep pace, despite low unemployment, and was 2.2% in September. 3. UK productivity has stalled since the financial crisis Growth in economic output per hour has stalled in the years since the 2008 crisis. The OBR is expected to downgrade its estimates for productivity growth on Wednesday, with damaging effects for the public finances. Lower growth in the efficiency of workers means weaker economic output in the years to come, leaving less activity for the exchequer to benefit from in the form of taxes. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates this will create a £20bn hole in the public finances. 4. Unemployment is the lowest since the 1970s The chancellor can draw considerable comfort from the lowest unemployment rate since the mid-1970s. Hammond is likely to use the figures to suggest the economy is in good health, despite fears over Brexit. However, the low rate of unemployment appears to have done little to improve the bargaining power of workers to demand higher wages. Meanwhile the latest official data on the labour market contained signs that Britain’s long employment boom might be coming to an end, showing a drop in the number of people in work, a fall in full-time employment, and a decline in number of job vacancies. 5. Borrowing has been lower than expected this year The budget deficit, which is the shortfall between spending and tax receipts, has come in better than forecast in recent months thanks to rising inflation pushing up the cost of goods – and therefore the taxes taken by the exchequer in the shape of VAT receipts. That could help the Treasury to undershoot official predictions for the annual 2017-18 deficit by about £10bn, coming in closer to £48bn than the official forecast of £58bn for the year. Still, the deficit unexpectedly grew in October, and the OBR is poised to raise its forecasts for government borrowing in the years to come, painting a weaker picture of the public finances than it was previously expecting. •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/25/emily-thornberry-labour-hope-have-election","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T11:00:22Z","webTitle":"Emily Thornberry: ‘I hope we have an election before any more damage is done’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/25/emily-thornberry-labour-hope-have-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/25/emily-thornberry-labour-hope-have-election","fields":{"headline":"Emily Thornberry: ‘I hope we have an election before any more damage is done’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Emily Thornberry was seven when her life went horribly wrong. Her father walked out on the family, leaving her mother to bring up three small children alone and penniless. They lost their home, were raided by bailiffs, and had to survive on free school meals and food parcels. Too poor even for pets, her mother had the family’s cats put down. “The biggest thing was the cats, you know.” Thornberry isn’t joking. “I was so upset about it. But she just said, ‘It was all too much. It was all too much.’ She was suddenly on her own with three kids, and she had to start claiming benefits and move us into a council house.” One unexpected consequence of the family crisis, however, was a solution to a conundrum Thornberry would encounter in her career. Her mother signed her up to an after-school choir – probably, she thinks, just to give herself one less child to worry about for an hour a week. But as a young chorister, Thornberry was trained to control her voice, breathe from the diaphragm and thus overcome a problem that has beset every female politician from Margaret Thatcher to Hillary Clinton. Women in public life have always been accused of sounding either too shrill or too robotic to be taken seriously. But when the shadow foreign secretary talks, the star of the show is her voice. Rich and smooth, like salted caramel, it pulls off the trick of sounding simultaneously authoritative and informal. Thornberry is a spellbindingly assured speaker, so much so that it’s easy to forget that only three years ago her political career looked as if it might well be over. In November 2014, the then shadow attorney general tweeted a photo of a house in Kent draped in flags of St George, with a white van parked outside, for no discernible reason her critics could identify other than snobbish mockery. In the febrile Twittersphere, Thornberry was damned as the worst sort of sneering metropolitan elite – snooty Lady Nugee, a “champagne socialist” married to the high court judge Sir Christopher, looking down on the riff-raff from her multimillion-pound Islington house. It wasn’t a good look, and Ed Miliband forced her to resign. Three years on, Thornberry is credited as a key architect of Labour’s comeback, and widely tipped to be the party’s next leader. She deputises for Jeremy Corbyn in PMQs and, as one political commentator put it, “certainly gets how to dominate the session: she’s theatrical, clearly enjoys herself, can think on her feet and has a dry wit.” Her relentless attack on the government’s impression of “sleepwalking” towards no deal on Brexit has been credited with making that a significantly less likely outcome, and she recently had Boris Johnson on the ropes over his carelessness concerning Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s imprisonment in Iran. “If Boris is going to stay in post, then he has to start to pay attention, and start taking the job seriously,” she says. “And start understanding that what he says means something. When you’ve made a mistake, you have to admit you’ve made a mistake, and correct it. What was it, 12 days? And then to have [Michael] Gove appearing on television. What was he playing at? He was trying to be loyal to Boris, but how can you do that when there’s a young mother languishing in jail. How could he not know? Surely he must know what the true situation is.” As for Priti Patel’s off-piste adventures, “It just shows a lack of discipline, because there’s no one around to discipline. All the leading people in the Tory party are looking further than Brexit, to their individual futures and their chances of becoming leader. Theresa May is the titular head, but it’s as if she’s crashing around depending on who puts the most pressure on her.” It is a remarkable turnaround for Thornberry, and part of the explanation is, of course, political. As one of the few frontbench Corbynistas reassuringly familiar to Blairites and Brownites, she cuts a unifying figure within the party. After a 20-year career at the bar as a criminal barrister, she brings a heavyweight’s experience to frontbench politics. But if her resignation ultimately came down to optics – the elusive power of public perception – it seems very clear to me after spending time with Thornberry that optics also play a big part in her success. We meet at a hotel in Blackpool early one Saturday in early November, where she is about to make a speech to the North West Labour conference. As she is one of the headline names, I expect her to be sequestered away in a room until she is due on stage, but instead find her in the lobby amid the crush of lanyards and polystyrene coffee cups, nursing a hangover after the previous night’s gala dinner. She opens her speech with a joke about needing aspirin, pays playful tribute to senior colleagues’ karaoke skills and gets a big laugh for calling Donald Trump an “enormous asteroid of awfulness”, before moving on to Brexit, Boris and the currently perilous reputation of British foreign policy. More conversational than oratorical, she finishes to rapturous applause, with large sections of the audience on its feet. Afterwards, she tours the lobby stands, chats to delegates, submits to a frenzy of selfies and gives a TV interview, during which she is asked about everything from the northern powerhouse to sexual harassment. The interviewer looks amazed when she tells him she’s been groped and flashed at in the street. Thornberry finds this bewildering, if not surprising. She later tells me she was once assaulted in the lift of a tower block, and “I remember saying to the police, ‘Well, this sort of thing happens, doesn’t it?’ I started reeling off to the cops, ‘Well, this has happened to me, and that has happened to me, and this’, and I could sense them getting increasingly uncomfortable. I began to realise that they thought I was a little bit crazy and must be making all this up. And yet, when you talk to women, you know it happens to everybody.” She experienced plenty of sexual harassment on arriving in parliament in 2005. “But I just ignored it. It’s about power, and it’s about misogyny. It’s about putting you in your place.” We catch a train to Liverpool, where she addresses a Labour Students conference, takes questions and poses for a million more selfies. Night has fallen by the time our train arrives back in London; the following morning, she will be up early and back on duty again, doing the rounds of the Sunday politics television shows. The last time Thornberry took a weekend off was in June. It is the long, unglamorous slog of opposition, fuelled by KitKats and leavened by the occasional moment of The Thick Of It farce. There is a minor dress emergency before her Blackpool speech, when gaping cleavage sends an aide scurrying for a needle and thread. No dark cotton can be found, so the black dress is hastily stitched up with bright purple thread, which preserves Thornberry’s modesty but looks a little surprising. “Oh well, it was that or bright yellow,” she shrugs philosophically. There is another brief panic before the TV interview begins, when the aide spots that Thornberry’s cardigan has obscured her poppy and dives in to rearrange the outfit and spare her boss the Daily Mail’s wrath. Our photoshoot takes place in her Westminster office on another day; she arrives immaculately groomed in a beautiful silk dress, but before the shoot is over, she is clambering on to a chair and out of the window to smoke a fag on the roof. All politicians must wrestle with the mysterious and conflicting rules of an electable public image. I have encountered few, if any, however, who find this less problematic than Thornberry. Strikingly tactile and relaxed, when she talks, she leans in closely, her body language almost conspiratorial, creating an instant impression of intimacy – yet her stride is heavy and purposeful, commanding authority without grandeur. When she laughs, which is a lot, her eyes crinkle almost until they close – the very opposite of Clinton’s wide-eyed beam that US voters found so unnerving. The version of herself that Thornberry presents on stage or camera is indistinguishable from the one I see chatting with cab drivers, and she talks to me in the same easy register whether or not the Dictaphone is running. In a political era that prizes authenticity above all else, Thornberry is a natural. When we meet in her office in Portcullis House, Thornberry’s media adviser, Damian McBride – the infamous spin doctor forced to resign by Gordon Brown in 2009 for plotting to smear senior Tories – is nowhere to be seen. Given the current shadow cabinet’s distrust of mainstream media, I’m surprised when the only aide in evidence leaves us alone. Thornberry sits at a little table away from her desk and pours tea from a china set. She is heavy with dismay at the government’s belligerent approach to Brexit negotiations. “If I had a row with my husband, it’s not going to work my saying, ‘Right, if you don’t do what I want, I’m going to walk out.’ It doesn’t work on any level. What you do is you go in and you say, ‘I have a problem. You have a problem. Let’s try and sort this out together.’ You don’t come to an agreement with people who you’re falling out with badly.” Like most of her colleagues, the MP for Islington South &amp; Finsbury was a passionate remainer. Why doesn’t Labour reposition itself as the anti-Brexit party and promise to reverse Article 50, if elected, before time runs out? “I don’t think we should be undermining our democracy. I think there are people who came out to vote in that referendum who hadn’t voted for literally decades, because they thought they weren’t listened to. And then we, the political establishment, turn around and go: ‘Oh, you’re too stupid. We’re not going to listen to you. We’ve actually got a better idea – we’re going to stay’? You just can’t do it. You just can’t do it.” Labour could, I suggest, offer the country a second referendum once the terms of Brexit are known. “But there isn’t that great shift in the polls, is there?” Thornberry says. “So we just have to look after the country as best we can. We have to look after our democracy, we have to look after our economy, we have to leave, and we have to get the best possible deal. And I certainly hope we have a general election before any more damage is done by this government. We can do things differently and that’s the hope that the Labour party offers. There is another way.” As foreign secretary, she would pursue a very different kind of diplomacy, she says. “I think that Boris’s temptation to show off and make jokes is not helpful. I don’t think you negotiate with people by going around telling them that they’re like Nazi guards or it’s all about prosecco. It’s all good fun and so on, but this isn’t a dinner party. This is representing your country and looking after the country’s interests. I mean, people don’t take him seriously. People I’ve spoken to say that they laugh at Britain. I hate that.” She would certainly take a different approach towards the current White House. “What I’m trying to do is make our friendship closer with America, but not necessarily Donald Trump. We’re capable of independent thought in a way that the current government doesn’t seem to be in relation to America.” Had she been in Theresa May’s shoes when the president held the prime minister’s hand, “I would have pulled my hand away. His wife can do it,” she chuckles, “why can’t anybody else? But, seriously, yes, I would have. “I would not be fine being seen holding his hand, because I don’t want to hold his hand. I don’t want anybody to think that I have any agreement with him, or any sort of close relationship with him. I think that he’s a danger and I don’t think that he’s temperamentally suited to be president of the United States. The thing that worries me most is that he has a nuclear button. How do we make sure that there are checks and balances to make sure that he doesn’t, in a fit of pique at three in the morning, decide: ‘That’s it’?” She genuinely worries about Trump blowing up the world? “Yes, I do.” As a real and present danger? “I think it is. I think it would be complacent for us to think otherwise.” To hear a shadow foreign secretary talk about the US president in such terms is without precedent. “I agree, but he is not the United States. I don’t have a problem with America, but I do have a fundamental problem with Donald Trump.” Does she think he will be impeached? “It’s part of the complete uncertainty. We don’t know whether he will serve the full term. Will he just decide one morning he doesn’t want to do it any more? I mean, who knows?” I suggest Trump’s vanity would rule out walking away. “I don’t know. His vanity might also say, ‘Well, if you don’t want me, I’m off.’” I put the question another way: does she hope he is impeached? She looks conflicted. “I do want America back in the mainstream. But then, obviously, the other side of it is that the American political system can seize up if there’s an impeachment. It can suck all the oxygen out of the American political system, just like Brexit does in Britain.” Thornberry says she spends a lot of time building relationships with both Democrats and Republicans in Washington, “so that they know where we’re coming from”. Yet I’m struck during our visit to the north-west by how few people in this country appear to know who she is. Inside the conference venues, her presence ignites a flurry of celebrity thrill, but the moment we step outside, she becomes anonymous. Only once does anyone appear to recognise her. “You look,” a ticket conductor tells her, “like that Labour politician.” At first I take her invisibility to indicate she still has a long way to go, but I change my mind as the day wears on. It’s quite a skill to blend in seamlessly on a rickety old train to Preston, and look equally congruent amid the lofty splendour of Westminster. This ambidextrous class identity is probably not a coincidence. When I ask if Ed Miliband had been right to fire her for the England flags tweet, she points out that her own brother was a van-driving builder. “When you know my background, if you think about it, I’m not looking down on people. I was brought up on a council estate in a house that was very similar.” She often cites the poverty of her childhood in her defence against the charge of snobbery. But although very real, this hardship is not quite the full story. *** Thornberry was born in Guildford in 1960, the eldest of three children, to middle-class, politically active parents. Her father was an Oxbridge-educated barrister, academic, foreign correspondent and international human rights lawyer, before later joining the United Nations, where he became assistant secretary general. When he left the family for another woman, Thornberry was plunged into an unfamiliar new life of domestic distress and free school dinners. “We had to queue up for lunch separately, with different coloured tickets. It was shaming.” In photographs of her and her two younger brothers taken around the time their parents split up, “our eyes are very, very deep. Sort of black eyes, big rims under them. We were quite badly disturbed kids.” She remembers sitting at the back of the class one day, “and the teacher stood behind me throughout the lesson, while she taught, and combed my hair, because my hair was such a mess.” It doesn’t sound as if her mother could cope. “She used to sit up late with me and drink whisky and talk to me about how terrible my dad was and how unfair things were.” Thornberry failed her 11-plus and went to the local secondary modern, where she “didn’t really fit in” and was badly bullied. “The school was on the edge of our estate, and I used to go home through a hole in the fence, and they used to wait for me. It was in the days when kids wore platform shoes, and I used to get really quite badly beaten up. They tried to force a sanitary towel down my throat.” Sometimes she would visit her father, who had moved to west London with his beautiful new partner. “I remember there was a photograph that my dad had taken of her nude, which was a lovely picture, but I was quite shocked.” Was his world bewilderingly bohemian for a Guildford council house girl? “Yes, yes. He was terribly glamorous. But he wasn’t terribly interested in us.” He was, though, ambitious for his children. “From Dad, there was, ‘You’re bright, anything is possible, get on with it.’ From Mum, it was much more kind of taking the mickey out of us, you know, undermining our confidence.” The mixed signals were confusing, and she became an angry, lonely teenager. As she grew, though, so did her father’s influence. “I was going out with a squaddie and he said, ‘Don’t worry about all of this. When you get to 16, we’ll get married.’ And I just thought, oh my God, no. A lot of my friends from school were thinking in those terms. But there seemed to be a big disconnect between my dad and the way we lived.” At 15, she fell out with her mother and went to live with her father; but when she was 17 he went to New York “for the weekend”, joined the UN and never came back. Alone in London, she resat her O-levels, took A-levels and won a place at the University of Kent, followed by bar school. “I was poor, but I was ambitious and driven and chippy.” She and her husband met at bar school while playing bridge. Public school-educated and unambiguously posh, “he just loved me. He loved me unconditionally, and he has done for 35 years. I seriously think the big turning point in my life was meeting my husband. To be fair, his mum has said that his meeting me was the making of him, too.” Were there cultural or class tensions? “There was quite a lot of that when we first met, and it was a challenge,” she chuckles. “His family were quite surprised. What did his mother call me? A prickly little thing.” His grandmother was even doubtful about the name Emily. “It’s all very well,” she told her grandson, “but a bit below stairs.” “So it was a bit intimidating, yes. But they were so kind to me and so welcoming and affectionate, they really were, always.” A smile spreads across her face. “It must have been a bit of a shock for them, you know.” In her early career, working for a firm of solicitors, she spent six months sleeping on a friend’s sofa before being rehoused in an east London council flat. “It was on the top floor, faced north-east, and it was freezing. We had a shallow end and a deep end in the lift, because people used to piss in it. His parents came to visit, and it must have been a bit of a surprise for them.” There is a dauntless quality about Thornberry that she attributes in part to the security of her happy marriage. Her husband is “very protective” and finds the bruising intrusions of her public life much harder than she does. He “loathes” journalists, she says, which I see for myself when he greets her off the train at Euston. He accepts my hand reluctantly, won’t meet my eye and coldly turns his back; I am not so much greeted as dismissed. In a subsequent phone call, she apologises for his hostility, but says the years of being doorstepped in the family home, where they live with their three grown-up children, have taken their toll. Thornberry herself is so inured by now to the rough and tumble of political life, she says she barely notices when anyone is rude to her. She was the third most abused female politician online in the country this year, after Diane Abbott and the SNP’s Joanna Cherry, “But I don’t talk about it. I don’t want to be a victim and I’m not a victim. I have other things I want to talk about.” Does she worry about her personal safety? She shoots a meaningful look. “Oh, yes. But I don’t talk about that. I want young girls to look at me as a role model – someone they might want to be. I don’t want them to feel sorry for me.” The only thing that does intimidate her, Thornberry says, apart from “very cultured, well-read people – you know, intellectuals”, is standing in at PMQs. “Yes, that does make me a bit nervous,” she laughs. But I suspect she secretly loves it, and I find her self-confidence mesmerising. It’s very rare for an opposition politician who has never held office to look so convincingly like a minister in waiting, but then, as she says, “The government could collapse literally any day now. And it could be on something that nobody anticipates – and that will be it.” The one and only time I see Thornberry look uneasy is when I ask if she shares the view of many of her colleagues that the next Labour leader must be a woman. She evades the question repeatedly, and I think I can guess why, but ask anyway. “Oh, God,” she sighs heavily. “I don’t want to open this whole stuff up. I don’t want it to be that I’m quoted in the paper saying, ‘Oh, the next leader of the Labour party should be a woman’ and then there’ll be all this, ‘Oh, why’s she saying that?’ Jeremy is the leader, and I really hope that I will be the next foreign secretary. That’s what I want.” • Commenting on this piece?

The EU shocked Downing Street in April when it effectively backed Spain in the centuries-old territorial dispute. In guidelines outlining their approach to the Brexit negotiations, the 27 member states insisted Gibraltar would be outside any future trade deal with the UK unless an agreement was reached in advance with Madrid over its future status. A Spanish government source said this stipulation included any deal on a transition period designed to soften the blow for the UK of falling out of the single market and customs union by retaining the status quo for a period after withdrawal. There had been no proposals from either the British government or the government of Gibraltar on the future of the territory, over which Spain has a longstanding territorial claim, the source added. Spain believes Gibraltar will now fall out of the single market on 29 March 2019. Gibraltar’s prime minister, Fabian Picardo, has previously suggested that a hard Brexit would pose an “existential threat”. The Spanish government source said May’s government appeared to have bigger issues to deal with than the fate of the 28,000 people who live on the rock. “I think the situation with Gibraltar is crystal clear,” the source said. “Gibraltar became associated with the EU project because of their dependence in the UK. This is going to stay until March 2019. In 2019 when the UK leaves the EU, Gibraltar will leave with the UK.” “This is what we are telling the Gibraltarians”, the source added. “If you want to have your existing status, you will have to talk with us. And I cannot understand why Picardo has refused to do so. I think in the past he has played very hard on the other side. But reality arrives.” Of Britain’s lack of proposals with regards to the future of the Rock, the Spanish government source said: “I honestly believe they have other more important issues.” Such is the economic importance to Gibraltar of retaining the rights of EU membership that just 4% of the population of Gibraltar voted to leave in the UK’s 2016 referendum. Last month Theresa May claimed she would be fighting for a deal that “works for Gibraltar as well as the United Kingdom”, in response to concerns expressed in the House of Commons that Downing Street was willing to abandon the territory in its effort to secure an EU-UK trade deal. Clare Moody, the Labour MEP for south-west England and Gibraltar, said: “The UK should be insisting that the transition period is a continuation of all existing terms, including for Gibraltar, before the future relationship [with the EU] is finalised.” A spokesman for the government of Gibraltar said they would not comment “on what unnamed Spanish sources are alleged to have said”. Madrid has also hit out against claims by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, last week that Spain was among a number of member states keen to move on to trade talks. Davis told an audience in Germany, whose government he accused of blocking talks about a future trade deal: “Many of them [the member states] do want to move on. You know, they see it’s very important to them. Countries like Denmark. Countries like Holland. Countries like Italy and Spain. Countries like Poland can see the big, big benefit in the future deal that we’re talking about.” The Spanish government source said Britain had consistently misinterpreted Spain’s position. “It is amazing how the British misread us,” the source said. “Almost as if we speak a different language. They come to us, we say: ‘We will see what we can do.’ But it means nothing.” The source added: “When David Cameron came to Angela Merkel and said: ‘We must stop [Jean-Claude] Juncker being commission president,’ she said: ‘We shall see what we can do.’ It meant nothing then as well.” “The Foreign Office is very good – at least, they used to be very good – but they come to see us on any other issues and they would understand we are favouring their position when it wasn’t the case,” the official said. “I get the impression that when the British and Mr Davis come to see us and we say: ‘I will see what I can do,’ he makes a positive interpretation.” “We are sticking behind [Michel] Barnier [the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator],” the source said. “We want a deal. We think you took a decision, you stick to your decision and you should leave in 2019. And we want a fair deal. That’s all. But we will stick to Barnier. We will not find other ways out of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/24/i-tried-living-apart-from-my-wife-to-save-our-marriage","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-24T13:29:00Z","webTitle":"Why living apart together is worth a try","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/24/i-tried-living-apart-from-my-wife-to-save-our-marriage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/24/i-tried-living-apart-from-my-wife-to-save-our-marriage","fields":{"headline":"Why living apart together is worth a try","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Louise and Jamie Redknapp are the latest recruits to what appears to be a small but growing army on the field of family relationships. They have elected to become LATs – couples who live apart together. Other famous LATs include Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton (before they separated for good), Woody Allen and Mia Farrow (before they separated for good) and Michael Holroyd and Margaret Drabble (before they moved back in together). These parenthetic caveats may say something about the arrangement. Because appealing in theory though it is – and nearly 10% of couples in the UK are LATs – it is often as much a last-ditch attempt to keep a relationship together as a positive and joyful decision. It is also very expensive – to keep two houses going, especially when you have children, is not something most can afford. You might presume from the preceding paragraph that I am not a fan of this arrangement. But that’s not quite true. In fact, I was in this situation myself for several years (although I did not write about in my column at the time) before returning to my marital home towards the end of 2015. Sadly, the marriage still ended. But I do not consider the experiment a failure. At the end of 2013, my wife and I had reached a breaking point. Divorce appeared inevitable. Then, out of desperation, the idea of living apart together was raised. For nearly two years we managed to conduct a relationship in which I returned home at weekends and for holidays. At first, we thought we had found the holy grail. Our relationship improved. The number of arguments fell, if only because we were spending considerably less time together. For the first few months, it was even quite romantic. However, to me, it never felt like a solution. Rather than a bold experiment in a new way of living, it felt neither here nor there. There was always a question at the back of my mind – how is this going to end? And ending it would have been fairly easy. Having in effect half moved out, and established a separate base, it made the denouement relatively straightforward. You just had to say the word – all the practicalities were already in place. As it happened, we both felt that there was enough hope left to try again as full-time cohabitees. The return – which for me was joyful, at least in the short term – lasted little more than a year before we finally split for good. Moving out had not helped to address any of the underlying issues that led to our separation: none of the problems that had been lurking, it turned out, had been dissipated by distance. Having said that, it doesn’t feel like a decision that should be regretted. Apart from anything else, it bought us three more years as an intact family, in which our children could avoid the pain of having separated parents. We had some good times and some good holidays during those years, and there were quite a few moments when I really believed it was going to work out. Although this didn’t prove to be the case, I think anyone whose relationship is struggling – certainly when children are involved – needs to give everything they can to engineering a possible solution. This may include counselling, therapy, meditation, or living apart together – whatever it takes. We tried them all – and they were all worth trying. I do not think that living apart together as a more permanent arrangement will work for many. However, if you can afford it, I can’t doubt that it is worthwhile. But it is not a magic pill to cure an ailing marriage – more like a temporary painkiller that sooner or later is bound to wear off. @timlottwriter.wordpress.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/26/kelly-lee-owens-debut-album-electronic-music","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T08:30:05Z","webTitle":"Kelly Lee Owens: ‘My patients were my career advisers’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/26/kelly-lee-owens-debut-album-electronic-music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/26/kelly-lee-owens-debut-album-electronic-music","fields":{"headline":"Kelly Lee Owens: ‘My patients were my career advisers’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Music can soothe the soul, but Kelly Lee Owens’s techno pop appears to have an especially balm-like quality. Her eponymous debut album came out in March, and while she didn’t have any specific intentions for it – “I had the Yoko Ono mindset, which is just to put good work out into the world and let it do its thing” – she didn’t anticipate the response it received. Perhaps it was the Tibetan singing bowls sampled on the song CBM. Or the meditative, 10-minute closing track inspired by gong baths. Or Owens’s soothing coo, which ripples trippily throughout the album. Fans would message her on Instagram telling her: “Your music has healed me.” That revelation could sound pretentious, but Welsh-born Owens, 29, operates on a sweetly spiritual plane.Throughout our interview, there is talk of natal charts and the age of Aquarius, but also of how lazy festival promoters need to step outside their “boys’ club” and book more women. She’s pleased about the response to her record because for a time she felt guilty about leaving her job as an auxiliary nurse in a cancer ward in Manchester to pursue music. It was, however, her patients who encouraged her to quit. “They were kind of like my career advisers,” she says. “They had this unique perspective, of having their lives threatened by something out of their control, so I respected all of their words of advice.” When Owens moved to London in 2009 she had a spell in Sonic Youth-ish indie band the History of Apple Pie. But while working in various record shops she met the mentors who would help shape her sound: electronic producers Daniel Avery, James Greenwood (aka Ghost Culture) and Erol Alkan. Avery invited her to collaborate on his breakthrough 2013 album Drone Logic, and through those sessions she developed a taste for techno. It was Alkan who suggested she should make her own, which she did, on Avery’s analogue synth collection (unsurprisingly, their music shares a certain kinetic warmth and rhythmic buoyancy). Owens says the resulting album is the sound of “discovering who I was as a producer and a musician”, pulsing between romantic techno, acid, shoegaze and ambient atmospherics. She performs it live with an energy you hope she’ll bottle and give to brittle lads with laptops. For a time she had a backing band, but she now says: “People who don’t know I produce might presume I just sing. I wanted to take full control and show people that I am the author of my creation, so now I do it solo. It’s been very empowering.” Two years ago, Björk gave an interview in which she corrected the assumption that she didn’t produce her music, and Owens is similarly keen to underline her role in the studio. “There’s the perception that there aren’t many examples of women who are fully doing it themselves, so I thought, if I write, produce, arrange and perform my music then that’s my protection, you can’t attack me.” She says she feels “more confident now in myself and my abilities”, though she still wrestles with self-doubt. “I think we all do, I see this in a lot of women. Maybe it’s this deep patriarchal energy we’ve had to deal with for thousands of years.” Greenwood engineered the album but even though “he sat in the studio with me and pushed the buttons I wanted to be pushed, I questioned myself. Am I really [producing], if I’m not touching the mouse? If I’m not going in and doing the thing that I need doing [physically] does that mean that I’m not really creating it? But no, I am, 100%. Of course James would suggest stuff, but I have to give myself the credit.” It’s why, like Björk, she contributed a photo of herself at the controls to the blog Visibility, which was set up to show the number of women working behind the mixing desk. And why she’s “definitely going to document my time [in the studio] more, for my second album. I don’t understand why men think women aren’t capable of that.” So it must feel gratifying that the Icelandic pop powerhouse included Owens’s track Anxi on a recent Mixmag DJ mix, featuring subversive musings from Norwegian artist Jenny Hval such as “what is soft dick rock?” atop an elastic bass line. “It’s the cherry on the top of this year,” says Owens.

The case of Paulette Wilson, 61, who was detained for a week at Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre last month, has focused attention on other UK residents, now retired, who have lived in Britain since they were in primary school, who are being pursued by the Home Office. Most had no idea that there was anything wrong with their immigration status. Wilson received a letter from the Home Office in 2015 informing her that she was an illegal immigrant and needed to leave the country. She arrived in Britain in 1968, went to primary and secondary school in the country and has 34 years’ worth of national insurance records to prove that she has been working and paying taxes for decades. She raised her daughter and helped bring up her granddaughter here, and has never been back to Jamaica, where she now has no family ties. She had been trying to collate the necessary information to prove that she was not here illegally but was sent to the detention centre before she had gathered all the documents required by the Home Office. Although she was released after an intervention from the Refugee and Migrant Centre in Wolverhampton, she has to report again to the Home Office in December and still faces the prospect of deportation. She has lost her benefits for the past two years and also lost her flat, as a result of the Home Office decision to categorise her as an illegal immigrant, and is reliant on the financial support of her daughter, Natalie Barnes, who works part-time as a school lunchtime supervisor. Barnes said both she and her mother were devastated by the decision to begin deportation proceedings. “We need an apology from the Home Office. This has broken her heart,” she said. Wilson’s MP, Labour’s Emma Reynolds, has written to the immigration minister Brandon Lewis asking for an urgent clarification of her situation, so that the family can “draw a line under this dreadful experience”. She supported the family’s request for an apology. “Paulette has been in the UK for 50 years. It is my understanding that she is here legally. The government should apologise for the unacceptable way in which she has been treated,” Reynolds said. The Home Office said staff were in ongoing discussions with Wilson about how to regularise her immigration status. Officials did not respond to the family’s request for an apology. Lawyers at the Refugee and Migrant Centre in Wolverhampton believe Wilson has a legal right to stay in the UK because she moved here before the 1971 Immigration Act gave people who had already settled in Britain indefinite leave to remain. In a similar case, last week the former boxer Johnny Nelson sent a tweet to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, telling her: “My 68-year-old brother has been in the UK for 53 years. He has received a letter stating he has 10 days to leave or appeal. He received indefinite stay on his passport, lost in a house fire over 20 years ago. He’s an OAP and will have to find hundreds of pounds for legal representation.” After his tweet triggered widespread concern for his brother, Nelson subsequently tweeted that the situation was “currently being dealt with correctly and swiftly”. Immigration lawyers say there is a significant but unquantifiable group of older British residents, who may have arrived here from Commonwealth countries in the 1950s or 1960s as children, whose immigration status is unclear because they have never needed to get a passport and never formally applied for British citizenship. “It isn’t well understood by politicians, who think there are just two groups: illegal immigrants and the rest of us. But there is a whole grey area of people who can’t prove their status. Ironically, it’s often the people who have been here longest who have the least awareness of the need to regularise their situation,” Fiona Bawdon, the author of Chasing Status, a report into this generation of older people surprised to discover they are undocumented. “They have been working, paying taxes and so it doesn’t occur to them that there is an issue with their immigration status. Often they are people who haven’t got a massive amount of income, haven’t travelled abroad and so have have never had to renew a passport.” Tim Lawrence, a solicitor advising on immigration at the Southwark Law Centre in London, said he was dealing with similar cases with clients who had arrived before the 1971 Immigration Act came into force. “Clients have suffered from numerous problems resulting from the lack of documentation and approach by the Home Office, including denial of NHS treatment, loss of welfare benefits including housing benefit leading to rent arrears and threat of loss of tenancy. Invariably, the clients are advanced in years, have limited understanding of the problem and taken by surprise by it, having paid into national insurance and the tax system for many years.” He said clients often encountered problems when they applied for pension credits on retiring. Since Theresa May pledged to create a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants in 2012, more documentation is required for making benefit claims and opening bank accounts. “The Home Office has been consistently hostile in the last five years or so at least; the wider climate has certainly become more hostile hence the problems with healthcare, welfare and housing,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/29/matt-lauer-nbc-fired-misconduct","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T16:36:04Z","webTitle":"Matt Lauer is gone.

He's left heartbreak in his wake","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Another one bites the dust. Today Show host Matt Lauer was fired from NBC over sexual misconduct allegations that the company says were probably not an isolated incident (Lauer’s alleged bad behavior has not been publicly described in any detail). He is only the latest in a string of high-profile men brought down by accusations of handsiness or inappropriate behavior toward female colleagues. What’s stunning about the Lauer firing, though, is how decisively NBC acted – especially considering that Lauer is one of their marquee names, and has anchored one of their most-watched and profitable shows for two decades. The evidence for his misbehavior must be pretty solid (a video? A hot mic?), but so too must be NBC’s conviction that keeping a harasser or assailant on staff would be financial and reputational suicide. This is new. And it’s a feminist victory. Today Show co-host Savannah Guthrie captured what so many women feel when men we like, admire, or love commit harassment or assault. “All we can say is we are heartbroken; I’m heartbroken,” she said. That heartbreak extended to Lauer, her “dear, dear friend”, as well as the women he wronged. Guthrie said she was “heartbroken for the brave colleague who came forward to tell her story”. A decade ago – heck, a year ago – media executives and network decision-makers would have taken the heartbreak that so many of us feel when a person we like is accused of wrongdoing, and extended it primarily to the man accused of harassment. Women who accuse powerful men of wrongdoing have rarely been viewed sympathetically. Instead, we are troublemakers, creating problems for well-meaning and admirable men, forcing HR to step in, creating a public relations problem. It has long been a woman’s decision to speak out, rather than a man’s decision to behave inappropriately, that has been seen as the catalyst for whatever unpleasantness follows. That unpleasantness was too often a warning or a talking-to; a moment of embarrassment, but no real change. It’s been women’s careers and even senses of personal safety that have long been the casualties of our impulse to absolve men. That’s changing. Maybe it was seeing it happen to Hillary Clinton when the stakes were as high as they’ve ever been. Maybe we’re just collectively fed up. Maybe more women in positions of power means that accusers garner a bit more sympathy from the higher-ups – maybe female executives feel toward more junior women that same heart-pull male ones felt toward accused colleagues. Maybe more women in newsrooms means cases like these get covered with greater depth and nuance, sparking real change. Maybe companies are simply terrified of the avalanche of bad press that will come if they look the other way. Whatever the case, it’s new. It’s powerful. And it’s the direct result of feminist work to get sexual harassment taken more seriously and to put more women in positions of power across industries. Powerful too are Guthrie’s heartfelt and nuanced comments about Lauer and the colleague he is alleged to have mistreated. It’s tempting to demand black-and-white reactions, and to fit narratives into neat boxes – to say that Lauer is a bad man who should be universally condemned. But the danger in demanding such stark and definitive responses is that it doesn’t account for the complexities of human emotions and reactions. It sets us up for a wholesale refusal to deal with harassment and assault when the accused is someone we can’t bring ourselves to fully condemn and revile. Guthrie owns her muddled reaction – her pain not just at seeing a beloved colleague go down, but of being blind to the worst sides of him, of not seeing the pain he was causing others in their shared workplace. It’s a moment of reckoning not just with the behavior of another, but with oneself: why didn’t I see? What else am I missing? These are the conversations we need to have. Most people who do terrible things don’t present themselves as monsters, least of all those whose terribleness can seem pretty banal in a deeply misogynist society where the overwhelming majority of women have been subject to some kind of sexism. We must be able to hold these two things simultaneously: I can love, like or admire a man; that same man may have done something awful and should be held accountable for it. Until we are able to see this reality, men will continue to be able to behave badly, and they will be excused because someone else says they’re a gentleman, or a nice guy or a respectable father. Guthrie also didn’t dwell on Lauer alone. She extended her sympathy and heartbreak to the woman who he allegedly wronged. That woman remains anonymous. Maybe she’s also a familiar television face; maybe she’s someone whose work was invisible to viewing audiences but was vital in ensuring that Lauer and Guthrie beamed into our living rooms every morning. Either way, Guthrie seemed to relate to her, to empathize with how hard it must have been for her to come forward and speak about against such a well-liked and respected television personality. I suspect most men wouldn’t be so readily able to see themselves in that woman, and to feel their hearts break for her, too. Lauer won’t be the last man to be pushed off his perch for his own decision to act badly. It’s easy to watch these cases stack up and become inured to it all, or to start to feel like maybe things are changing too quickly, that a witch-hunt is on, that good men are probably afraid and that’s somehow worse than centuries of female fear and abasement. Instead, we should take a page from Guthrie, and allow our reactions to be complex and our hearts to be pulled in opposing directions – and in the end, to do what’s right by embracing victims and holding men accountable, even when it hurts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/29/tories-briefed-on-new-policies-after-fears-about-compassionless-image","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T22:00:11Z","webTitle":"Tories briefed on new policies after fears about 'compassionless' image","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/29/tories-briefed-on-new-policies-after-fears-about-compassionless-image","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/29/tories-briefed-on-new-policies-after-fears-about-compassionless-image","fields":{"headline":"Tories briefed on new policies after fears about 'compassionless' image","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Conservative MPs have been briefed by No 10 on seven new policy principles underpinned by a focus on the environment, after internal polling suggested the party is not seen as caring enough. Groups of Tories were called in to Downing Street for meetings with Gavin Barwell, the prime minister’s chief of staff, this week to be told about the party’s political narrative, entitled “Building a Britain fit for the future”. They were told polling suggests Conservatives are viewed as competent and having many of the right policies but that they were not caring enough when it comes to their values. The party has been particularly stung in recent weeks by a social media campaign claiming Tory MPs voted against recognising animal sentience, after they rejected an amendment to write the principle into UK law tabled by Green MP Caroline Lucas. Since then, Tory social media accounts have been pumping out video rebuttals stressing that Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is committed to recognising animal sentience in EU law. One Conservative MP, Ross Thomson, has gone so far as to record a clip featuring his dog, Poppy, in which he stresses how much the party cares for animals. It comes after the Tories were also taken by surprise at the election by the strength of feeling on animal welfare issues, with a huge online backlash against Theresa May’s promise of a free vote on foxhunting and the manifesto’s omission of a promise to ban the ivory trade. The foxhunting vote has since been dropped and the party has committed to outlawing trade in ivory, however antique. The new briefing document for MPs, seen by the Guardian, lists seven policies on issues such as housing, schools, a balanced approach to public spending and tackling injustices, while care for the environment will be a guiding principle under it all. “Underpinning all this is our commitment to protect our environment so we leave our planet in a better state than we found it, with cleaner air, stronger protections for animal welfare and greener spaces,” it says. The MPs were told there will be an emphasis on improving school standards, rather than extra financial sums going into the education system, and taking a “balanced approach to public spending”, which weighs bringing down debt with concern for public services like the NHS. One of the messages on the economy will be about “better, high paying jobs” as the polling suggested the Conservatives were seen as financially capable but not the party of jobs, despite low unemployment. Conservative strategists have prepared the document as the party tries to recover following the election result, which saw Labour gain seats due to a surge in support for Jeremy Corbyn among younger and middle-aged voters. However, one person present said they believed the elephant in the room was unease over whether Theresa May was the woman to get this caring message across after her performance at the election. No 10 has recently hired a new digital special adviser, Mario Creatura, to improve the party’s social media output, including May’s own Twitter feed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/30/uk-class-action-accuses-google-of-unlawfully-harvesting-personal-data","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T06:01:21Z","webTitle":"UK class action accuses Google of unlawfully harvesting personal data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/30/uk-class-action-accuses-google-of-unlawfully-harvesting-personal-data","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/30/uk-class-action-accuses-google-of-unlawfully-harvesting-personal-data","fields":{"headline":"UK class action accuses Google of unlawfully harvesting personal data","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 5 million people in the UK could be entitled to compensation from Google if a class action against the internet giant for allegedly harvesting personal data is successful. A group led by the former executive director of consumer body Which?, Richard Lloyd, and advised by City law firm Mischon de Reya claims Google unlawfully collected personal information by bypassing the default privacy settings on the iPhone between June 2011 and February 2012. They have launched a legal action with the aim of securing compensation for those affected. The group, called Google You Owe Us, says that approximately 5.4 million people in Britain used the iPhone during this period and could be entitled to compensation. Google is accused of breaching principles in the UK’s data protection laws in a “violation of trust” against iPhone users. The lawsuit was unprecedented and represented “one of the biggest fights of my life”, said Lloyd, who has led legal actions against companies before. “I believe that what Google did was simply against the law. Their actions have affected millions, and we’ll be asking the courts to remedy this major breach of trust. “Through this action, we will send a strong message to Google and other tech giants in Silicon Valley that we’re not afraid to fight back if our laws are broken. “In all my years speaking up for consumers, I’ve rarely seen such as massive abuse of trust where so many people have no way to seek redress on their own.” He added: “This is … the first case of its kind in the UK against a major tech company for misusing our valuable personal data. “I want to spread the world about our claim. Google owes all of those affected fairness, trust and money. By joining together, we can show Google that they can’t get away with taking our data without our consent, and that no matter how large and powerful they are, nobody is above the law.” A Google spokesperson said: “This is not new.

Married and the mother of two kids, she had lived a comfortable life in north Texas. But after her 17-year marriage ended and she became her family’s main provider, she struggled to make ends meet. “I needed support,” Townson said. “I felt like I was starting over with nothing.” A support group and the folks at Catholic Charities of Fort Worth encouraged her to apply for government assistance, including food stamps for groceries and Medicaid for her kids. But she didn’t check the box in her application that would have allowed her to apply for cash assistance. Working a part-time job that brought home $200 to $230 a month, she might not have qualified anyway. Townson’s predicament is not unusual for Texans in need. Poor Texans will often find jobs and work to advance out of poverty, but then be disqualified from receiving public benefits well before leaving poverty behind, said Heather Reynolds, president and CEO of Catholic Charities of Fort Worth. “I don’t think that’s what anybody intends to do,” said Reynolds, whose clients are mostly classified as working poor. “It’s just the reality of what we face sometimes.” Though Texas’s poverty rates have remained mostly consistent, it has significantly curtailed the amount of traditional welfare it provides to poor Texans through cash assistance over the last two decades, instead putting more of its federal anti-poverty dollars toward funding core state services, plugging budget holes or funding other programs that provide services to residents with higher incomes than those who qualify for cash welfare. Federal law allows such disbursements, and state officials say those spending choices are spurred in part by a drop in the number of Texans qualifying for cash assistance. But social workers and service providers who help poor Texas families say those decisions result in a porous safety net that complicates the struggles of residents like Townson, who are too poor to make ends meet but make too much to qualify for temporary cash aid from the government. “There’s this myth that welfare exists,” said Rachel Cooper, a senior policy analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning thinktank. “In Texas, it doesn’t.” To qualify for $290 a month, you can’t make more than $188 Texas’s reduction in traditional welfare rolls dates to 1996, when Congress reformed welfare and created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (Tanf) program, which gives Texas hundreds of millions of dollars a year to combat poverty. At the program’s inception, hundreds of thousands of poor single-parent families and children – a monthly average of 479,000 in 1998 – received cash aid through federal Tanf dollars. But the number of poor residents who receive help has plummeted. As of July 2017, the latest available count, fewer than 60,000 Texans – most of them children – remained on the welfare rolls, usually receiving at most a few hundred dollars a month. Welfare reform was designed to reduce the number of people on welfare by emphasizing temporary assistance and getting people into work. But the drop in the state’s welfare rolls isn’t necessarily the result of a concerted effort to pull Texans out of poverty. The state’s poverty rate has hovered between 16% and 18% for the last decade. It wasn’t until recent years that Texas saw a larger drop in its poverty rate – currently at 15.6% – mostly due to rising incomes and not because of more welfare recipients moving out of poverty. Instead, the number of low-income Texans who can get help has been reduced by caps on how long a family can obtain benefits, which are based on a person’s education or recent work experience, and strict income eligibility rules that make qualifying for cash aid a tall order for even the poorest families, advocates say. To qualify for a maximum of $290 in monthly cash aid today, a family of three – with one parent and two children – cannot make more than $188 a month, barring a few exceptions. That income eligibility – several hundred dollars less than what a family of three can make and still be considered to be living in poverty – has hardly been adjusted since welfare reform. “It’s been frozen, and 20 years of inflation has meant fewer and fewer people can qualify because it’s so low you really have to be destitute,” Cooper said. By 2015, only four out of every 100 poor families with children in Texas received cash assistance – down from 47 in 1996, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research institute. Texas has a long history of regarding welfare as a last resort for needy Texans. Even before federal welfare reform, state lawmakers were working to tighten limits for assistance in Texas. And modest increases to benefits enacted soon after welfare reform were passed because they were approved with little fanfare, appropriations officials said at the time. Texas’s approach to welfare benefits has pushed it toward the bottom of state rankings for the percentage of households receiving public cash assistance, according to US Census Bureau data dating back a decade. In 2016, Texas ranked last. That’s despite Texas being home to almost one out of every 10 poor Americans. ‘We spend our dollars on anything but poor families’ While the drop in cash assistance has left Texans in need with a less secure safety net, it has freed up hundreds of millions of federal dollars for legislative budget writers. Welfare reform set Texas up to receive federal anti-poverty funds in the form of block grants meant to give state governments more flexibility in how they spent those dollars. That spending had to fit within four broad categories: to assist needy families so children can be cared for in their homes or homes of relatives; to reduce dependency on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work and marriage; to prevent or reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and to encourage two-parent families. With declining welfare rolls, lawmakers have used federal Tanf dollars to cover a range of expenses, including core state functions like Child Protective Services (CPS). Of the more than $520m in federal Tanf funds that state legislators appropriated for each of the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, more than $358m was earmarked for the department of family and protective services, which includes CPS. Tanf dollars will make up approximately 17.5% of the agency’s entire budget for the 2018-19 budget years. The current state budget also uses Tanf funding to prop up the budgets for early childhood intervention services and mental health state hospitals. Another $3m a year will go toward the Alternatives to Abortion program. The Texas Education Agency will also receive almost $4m a year in Tanf dollars for “school improvement and support programs”. “We spend our Tanf dollars on anything but poor families,” said Will Francis, government relations director for the Texas chapter of the National Association of Social Workers. Those spending decisions will probably perpetuate a negative trend in the share of total Tanf dollars Texas spends on basic assistance to poor families, which dropped from 59% in 1997 to about 7% in 2014, according to spending data collected by the US Department of Health and Human Services. State budget writers push back against the notion that the legislature chose to spend less on cash assistance for poor Texans. Texas’s spending on cash aid depends completely on the number of people who qualify and sign up for benefits, they argued. And that drop has freed up more money to spend on other state needs, said the state senator Jane Nelson, a Republican of the town of Flower Mound and the senate’s chief budget writer. “The good thing about block grants is that we are able to provide benefits to everyone who qualifies and allocate the remaining funds to address important needs such as Child Protective Services,” Nelson said in a statement. “These are appropriate uses of Tanf funds, and they are an essential part of our effort to better protect endangered children.” Advocates for low-income Texans don’t argue that these aren’t worthy causes. But they say they’re just not the best use for dollars meant to combat poverty in the state. “It’s this $500m-a-year piggy bank,” said Celia Cole, CEO of Feeding Texas, a not-for-profit organization that oversees a statewide network of food banks. “It’s totally taken away from meaningful services … It leaves very little to cash assistance or employment and training that could help people get out of poverty.” Where should the money go? Once Tanf dollars are used to fund critical services like CPS, it’s tough to advocate for a change that will create a hole in the budget and put the delivery of other human services in a bind, Cole added. In 2016, Tanf ranked as the state’s ninth-biggest federal funding source. Others have gone farther in their characterizations of the state’s Tanf spending priorities. During a 2013 US House ways and means subcommittee hearing, representative Lloyd Doggett, an Austin Democrat, referred to Tanf as a “slush fund” that states use to fund services they were or should have been funding themselves and questioned whether states had been given “too much flexibility” under welfare reform. Not all those who are helping low-income Texans make ends meet oppose the state’s Tanf spending priorities. Some not-for-profit providers underlined the importance of flexibility and allowing states to be nimble with federal resources in ways that can best serve local communities. Others pointed out that some of the services funded through Tanf dollars back up a “holistic approach” to addressing the needs of poor Texans. “I do think that there are some great strategies that are funded with Tanf dollars that impact vulnerable populations,” said Eric Cooper, president and CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank, which helps low-income Texans sign up for public benefits. But Cooper added he sees the “temptation” the state’s spending flexibility presents at a time when poor Texans “could use more dollars to gap-fill” their needs. He echoed other providers who expressed reservations about the state’s wide discretion with disbursements. “What we need to make sure is that that money actually gets to nonprofit and government providers who will actually use it to improve outcomes for those living in poverty,” said Reynolds of Catholic Charities of Fort Worth. “And I do think there has been the temptation to use it to help with other budget crunches and we need to make sure to stay away from that.” Jim Malewitz contributed to this report Disclosure: The Center for Public Policy Priorities and Feeding Texas have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune.

Diary entries from the key whistleblower in the Russian doping scandal have been published, detailing meetings with Vitaly Mutko, who was the country’s sports minister at the time. Mutko remains president of Russia’s FA, headed the bid for the 2018 World Cup, and will be a key figure in the draw on Friday in Moscow. The diary entries of Grigory Rodchenkov, former head of the Moscow anti-doping lab and now living under federal protection in the United States, directly implicate Mutko. The timing is particularly damaging with the sporting world’s focus on Russia in the run-up to the World Cup and coming a week before the International Olympic Committee will rule on Russia’s involvement at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang next year. Mutko did not seem particularly perturbed by publication of the Rodchenkov diaries by the New York Times. “I have no time to read it right now,” he said. In a separate interview with the BBC, Mutko said Russia had become accustomed to dealing with such allegations. “Of course that’s a huge disappointment that we have to pay so much attention to such problems in the context of Russia. The same situation happened with the Olympic Games in Sochi. Now it’s happening again right before the World Cup.” Britain’s four-man bobsleigh team are set to be awarded a retrospective bronze medal from the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi after the International Olympic Committee announced more doping sanctions for Russian athletes. The crew of John Jackson, Bruce Tasker, Stuart Benson and Joel Fearon initially finished fifth in Sochi. But the IOC has now confirmed that Aleksandr Kasyanov, Aleksei Pushkarev and Ilvir Khuzin – who all competed for Russia’s B team that originally finished fourth – have been disqualified over their involvement in the Russian doping scandal. With Russia’s A team also being disqualified this week by an IOC disciplinary commission over the Sochi 2014 doping scandal, the GB team look certain to be upgraded to bronze, with Latvia taking gold and the US silver. The latest verdicts bring the total of Russian athletes sanctioned by the IOC for being involved in a state-sponsored programme in Sochi to 22 – and will increase the pressure on the IOC to ban Russia from 2018 Winter Olympics when it meets on Tuesday in Lausanne. Benson and Jackson have since retired. Jackson revealed he cried when his wife told him the news of his impending promotion. “When Paula told me, there was not much I could say back to her,” he said. “I was pretty speechless and didn’t really know what to think. “There’s no point being annoyed or angry about not being able to stand on the Olympic podium because that moment has gone and it doesn’t matter how much we dwell on it, we’ll never get it back. It’s just looking forward to getting to that point that, once all the appeals have gone through and hopefully we do get upgraded to the medal, we can stand on a podium somewhere or receive the medals together rather than through the post.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/10/best-art-2017-laura-cumming-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T08:00:30Z","webTitle":"Laura Cumming’s best art of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/10/best-art-2017-laura-cumming-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/10/best-art-2017-laura-cumming-review","fields":{"headline":"Laura Cumming’s best art of 2017","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The highest price for the ugliest painting: that was the supposed Leonardo sold for $450m last month. Does anyone really want to look at this monstrous Jesus, a heavily restored hippy scarcely anybody believes in? This was an alarming low point, where art sank from mere investment to cultural boast: Abu Dhabi buying a surprisingly un-Islamic painting for its new Louvre, all sides presumably insured against the future discovery that the painting is no better than it looks. A shameful year for the art trade, then, but a golden year for art. 2017 gave us Russia and America as never before. A tremendous succession of masterpieces flew in from the US, including Grant Wood’s deathless American Gothic – the long-faced couple standing sentry before their wooden house, pitchfork in hand – in Britain for the first time at the Royal Academy, along with Charles Sheeler’s eerie Ford plant in winter and Edward Hopper’s hauntingly mysterious New York Movie. The Royal Academy also brought us Jasper Johns’s famous flag paintings, their mood running from funereal to magnificent, while the Barbican’s first British Jean-Michel Basquiat survey showed the art to be as vivid and volatile as the dead art star himself. The American Dream was questioned by artists from Rauschenberg to Ruscha in mordant prints at the British Museum, and by a generation of black artists in Tate Modern’s rousing Soul of a Nation. The films of LA artist Arthur Jafa were a revelation at the Serpentine Gallery and particularly at the Store Studios, where his collage of found footage, from civil rights marches to slam dunks, set to a Kanye West anthem, built into an operatic aria for black America. Several shows marked the Russian Revolution, but none so dramatically as the Royal Academy’s Revolution: Russian Art 1917-32, where one saw avant garde masterpieces in the opening galleries and learned their makers’ fate – suicide, murder, disappearance – at the end. Tate Modern’s terrific Red Star Over Russia, showing how art influenced politics, and vice versa, is still on. It includes some of the very few images of Trotsky that weren’t Stalinised. Tristram Hunt quit politics to take over the V&amp;A, escaping Corbyn for culture. Maria Balshaw succeeded Nicholas Serota at the world’s largest art empire. Tates Liverpool and Modern had great art aplenty, if not always well curated. But Tate Britain (Hockney’s sell-out show an exception) remains unmoored, with some truly blind curating: the timid and chaotic Queer British Art and Impressionists in London, which lacked almost everything, including the necessary impressionists. The Turner prize came of age, lifting the bar on artists over 50, and instantly renewed itself (indeed the dynamic Lubaina Himid, 63, is its oldest winner). John Berger died at 90, still working, and Howard Hodgkin at 84, just before his acclaimed National Portrait Gallery retrospective. Stars on the rise included Artangel’s Andy Holden, with a brilliant show about bird’s eggs (and his father), and Emma Hart, whose darkly humorous ceramics won the Max Mara prize. Galleries exchanged art for our benefit: Caravaggio went from London to Edinburgh; Glasgow sent Degas to London; Sidney Nolan, Claude Cahun and Matisse are still touring Britain. But above all, 2017 was a year of faces I can’t forget. Käthe Kollwicz’s profound self-portraits, head in hand, in charcoal and chalk, at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham. Hokusai’s late self-portrait, face creased with mirth. Wolfgang Tillmans’s shot of Neil MacGregor as an ascetic saint (Tate Modern), and Barkley L Hendricks’s smooth self-portrait as a black superman in aviator shades (Soul of a Nation). Practically all of Chaïm Soutine’s awkward and mutinous bellhops and pastry chefs at the Courtauld. Most of all, Cézanne’s great self-portrait in bowler hat and overcoat, looking quickly back over his shoulder, as if suddenly aware of us but still on his way to somewhere else, in this case the luminous, claggy mass of his paint.

And another one. And a-nother-one.” Wise words. None of us will live to verify Busted’s vision of a boyband-populated future but the recent past is more tangible: from the Jackson 5 to Take That and One Direction, bands of boys have delivered more than half a century’s worth of pop pandemonium, evolving with the times while staying true to the core boyband values of top harmonies and impressive cheekbones. Pop’s present, meanwhile, includes X Factor frontrunners Rak-Su and US outfit PrettyMuch, both with their eyes on 1D’s recently vacated boyband throne – but how did we get here? And what hairstyles arrived on the way? Beatlesamia The Beatles set the blueprint for screaming fans, signature hairstyles, decent tunes and preposterous merch opportunities, but the Monkees were a manufactured marvel, having formed for a US TV comedy show. During this period, bands such as the Four Seasons and the Temptations made headway in a different strand of boyband pop; the Monkees, meanwhile, grew into themselves as a band after the TV show ended and – because it was the 60s and everyone was off their tits – committed career suicide via ludicrous psychedelic motion picture Head. Defining haircut The Beatles v Anna Wintour. Musical style Folk, pop and psychedelia. Further listening The Dave Clark Five, Freddie &amp; the Dreamers, the Turtles. And they called it brotherly love The Osmonds’ musical career actually kicked off in the late 1950s, when four brothers set up a barbershop quartet that eventually turned into the Osmond Brothers, who became TV regulars during the 1960s. Chart success came during the 1970s (by which point the Jackson 5 had also taken off and, helpfully, Donny Osmond had been born), thanks to smash hit One Bad Apple – a song originally written for the Jackson 5. Defining haircut Lego. Musical style Bubblegum gave way to rock, with fiery enviro-banger Crazy Horses the Osmonds’ crowning achievement. Further listening If you’re amenable to some era-hopping, try Hanson, Next of Kin, the Moffatts, 3T and the Noise Next Door. They had it (the right stuff) By 1984, the rise of the style press meant the UK’s boyband scene involved conventional bands such as Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet and Wham! – chaps who just so happened to have cheekbones as sharp as their exquisite hair. In the States something else was brewing. Buoyed by early success with R&amp;B vocal group New Edition, manager Maurice Starr invented New Kids on the Block, who had a bunch of hits and marked the dawn of the modern boyband era, directly inspiring Take That, which in turn led to East 17 and, sadly, Boyzone. Defining haircut Can we pause to consider the fact that not one member of New Kids had blond hair? Very strange. Musical style Untough declarations of toughness, limp ballads. Boyz II Men were better. Further listening Bad Boys Inc, Code Red, Northern Line, Worlds Apart, Upside Down. One Swede day In 1993, US businessman Lou Pearlman launched Backstreet Boys then, later, NSync. Both defined the boyband sound of the late-1990s and sold a combined 200m records, thanks to work with Swedish producers such as Denniz Pop and Max Martin. Martin would go on to save the world; Pearlman, meanwhile, would be sued by most of his acts, some of whom also accused him of being a serial sexual predator and paedophile, and was unmasked as the man behind a $300m fraud debacle, after which he declared bankruptcy and went on the run, only to be spotted in Indonesia by two German tourists, which led to his being sentenced to 25 years in jail, where he died of cardiac arrest. “Those who knew him best,” noted a carefully worded Billboard obituary, “were pretty much satisfied with that ending.” Defining haircut The less said about NSync’s follicular adventures the better, but Kevin Backstreet always kept things tidy. Musical style Chunky, dramatic production combined with strong harmonising. Further listening O-Town, LFO, 5ive, Take 5, Human Nature. The axemen cometh By the early 2000s the UK boyband scene was – Blue aside – rather impenetrable, partly due to the nasty taste in the mouth left by dated and 100% terrible failures such as E-Male, whose “USP” was that they were all Starlight Express cast members and would therefore perform on rollerskates. A boyband called Skandal weren’t faring well either, but their management took leftover auditionees and invented Busted – ostensibly a proper band, and definitely (according to the band) not a boyband, with not a dance routine in sight. This led to McFly and, thanks to Disney, the Jonas Brothers, whose cover of Busted’s Year 3000 sadly omitted the line about triple-breasted women. Defining haircut Let’s just say Busted weren’t immune to the lure of GHDs. Musical style Blink-182 and Fountains of Wayne have a lot to answer for. Further listening The Noise Next door, Ultra, Let Loose. ‘More Cowell’ One Direction are the modern talent show era’s tentpole boyband, but it was former X Factor alumni JLS who made the first transition from a Saturday Night talent show to chart-conquering real-life fan frenzies. Important: they had their own range of condoms. JLS briefly brought dancing back to the UK boyband scene, only for 1D to shut it down again by insisting that jumping up and down a bit was enough; both bands benefited from the brief point in time when rocketing social media use overlapped with teenagers still buying music downloads. Defining haircut Sorry, Harry, this era belongs to Marvin Humes’s early barnet, which involved two separate haircuts, one on each side of his head. Musical style JLS boasted a Capital FM-friendly mix of pop and R&amp;B; One Direction brought guitars back into the mix. Further listening G4, Phixx, One True Voice, Union J, “Kingsland Road”. Screaming fans v streaming plans 1D’s spliatus left a massive hole in pop – one that’s been filled back in by five simultaneous 1D solo careers. Potential replacements are coming anyway and PrettyMuch, a US boyband from the team behind One Direction, lead the pack. Mindful that the charts are now dominated by legitimate streams rather than sales achieved through fan loyalty, PrettyMuch’s new jack swing-inspired debut Would You Mind was accompanied by real-life Spotify billboards and some curiously prominent placement on the service’s new music playlists; current single Open Arms mixes modern R&amp;B with Backstreet harmonies. Another act with a penchant for over-sized sweaters are potential X Factor winners Rak-Su, whose mix of Drake, reggaeton and dancehall feels like streaming-stat catnip. Defining haircut PrettyMuch’s Austin has a strong Hanson thing happening atop his bonce. Musical style Early Backstreet Boys meets new jack swing. Further listening Citizen Four, Why Don’t We, Midnight Red, Mic Lowry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/29/meghan-markle-wacky-relatives-prince-harry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T17:01:34Z","webTitle":"Meghan Markle, where are your wacky relatives? | Peter Bradshaw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/29/meghan-markle-wacky-relatives-prince-harry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/29/meghan-markle-wacky-relatives-prince-harry","fields":{"headline":"Meghan Markle, where are your wacky relatives?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When someone new is catapulted into a position of public prominence, either through democratic success or a royal wedding, it is traditional for their wacky relatives to be publicised in a spirit of mischief. Jimmy Carter’s embarrassing brother Billy became famous, and so did John Major’s Pooterish sibling, Terry. During the last royal wedding, Kate Middleton’s sister Pippa was complimented on her figure in the most indelicate and impertinent way, and afterwards her party planning business was mocked. So what of Meghan? The obvious candidate here is her half-brother Thomas Markle Jr, who was arrested in January after a drunken row during which he is alleged to have brandished a gun. But then Meghan Markle isn’t thought to be particularly close to Thomas, so nothing can be read into him not getting a stiff white envelope through the post. Perhaps the wedding of Meghan and Harry will finally mean the end of this tradition and all the sly giggling, because she’s preempted it by being that non-stereotypical figure that makes reactionary bores uncomfortable: vivacious, glamorous, informal and relaxed. She may not convert anyone away from republicanism. But it’s worth pointing out that Donald Trump has still not tweeted any congratulations to her, evidently not caring for something in Markle or her politics. And that makes her all right in my book. Weapons of mass discussion The word of the year has been announced by dictionary.com. It is “complicit”. Good choice. In April, Saturday Night Live ran a spoof television advertisement for a fragrance marketed by Ivanka Trump named Complicit – because everything she did was perfumed by nepotism and promoted the sinister politics of her husband and father. Since the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal and the #MeToo campaign, the idea of complicity has spread like a miasma among those preeningly prestigious showbiz males whose careers were advanced by the film producer and who kept quiet about what they knew. I have a runner-up choice, however. A silver medal word of the year: “weaponise”. It’s become a cliche, and I have to admit to using it in reviews. But it’s become a very tricky form of argument in febrile social media debate. If you think something is causing suffering, and someone disagrees, that someone can accuse you of “weaponising” the suffering. Adducing something in debate, referring to it, drawing on it as evidence, can be recast as “weaponising” it. The word itself has become – well, weaponised. We have to speak out against this tendency, or we will end up being … what’s the word I’m looking for? A Whish and a Wizzard A Russell Whish recently had a meal at The Man Behind the Curtain restaurant in Leeds; he declared it to be bland and salty and demanded his money back. The restaurant’s Michelin-starred chef, Michael O’Hare, emailed him haughtily: “You didn’t like the food but plenty do. I do, I love it, I’m very proud of it and my palate is about 10 million times better than yours! Remember, Led Zeppelin didn’t write songs that everyone liked, they left that to the Beatles.” Whish emailed back: “We paid for a Led Zeppelin concert and got Wizzard.” At this point, O’Hare’s reply included a brutal monosyllable. Being compared to Wizzard was evidently too much for him, despite the fact Wizzard are held in affectionate esteem. These are people who badly need the yuletide spirit. A re-release of Wizzard’s I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day is surely in order. • Peter Bradshaw is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/26/fox-hunting-activists-claim-trail-hunts-are-a-cover-for-continued-bloodsport","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T06:00:40Z","webTitle":"Fox hunting: activists claim trail-hunts are a cover for continued bloodsport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/26/fox-hunting-activists-claim-trail-hunts-are-a-cover-for-continued-bloodsport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/26/fox-hunting-activists-claim-trail-hunts-are-a-cover-for-continued-bloodsport","fields":{"headline":"Fox hunting: activists claim trail-hunts are a cover for continued bloodsport","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As horses, hounds and hunters gather on the busiest day of the year for fox hunting, activists have raised concerns that trail-hunting is being used as a cover for bloodsport more than a decade after it was banned in the UK. At least 300 hunts are expected to take place across the country on Boxing Day. Riders on horseback gallop behind a pack of hounds directed by a huntsman while terriermen, whose traditional role was to dig foxes out of holes so they could be hunted, follow on quad bikes. Hunt supporters bring up the rear on foot. They all say they’re legally trail-hunting – following an animal-based scent, often fox urine – with hounds for sport. Engaged in a half-century game of cat and mouse with the hunters are the Hunt Saboteurs, a nonviolent direct action group who attempt to document and prevent the killing of animals. They say these hunts are not obeying the law and that recent videos apparently showing a huntswoman whipping an activist repeatedly and a female saboteur being assaulted requiring hospital treatment are just the tip of the iceberg. The saboteurs believe hunting for bloodsport is continuing and that trail-hunting is an effective cover. Before the ban, saboteurs would try to disrupt the hunt using horns and voice calls in an effort to gain control of the hounds. Citronella spray would be used to prevent the hounds getting on to the scent of the animals. Their main tool now is a videocamera and they act as monitors, since they believe filming acts as a deterrent to illegal hunting. According to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, no genuine trail hunting was witnessed at 98% of the hunts observed in 2015, with trails seen being laid at just eight of the 478 hunts monitored. The Countryside Alliance, who lobby for the repeal of the Hunting Act, said that since just 27 convictions in relation to registered hunts had been recorded since 2005, “there is no indication from this evidence that hunts continuously break the law as is claimed by IFAW.” Freedom of information requests made to the Animal and Plant Health Agency revealed they have issued just one import authorisation licence for fox urine or any other related animal by-product that could be used as an artificial scent for trail hunting since 2014. The Countryside Alliance say the majority of hunts use an ethically sourced, animal-based scent. However, significant amounts of the liquid would be necessary for each hunt and the group refused the Guardian’s requests to visit the preparation site. Hunting foxes with hounds was supposed to have ended in 2005, following the passage of the Hunting Act the year before. But loopholes in the law mean the burden of proof is exceptionally high; to be prosecuted, the huntsman has to be adjudged to have purposefully killed a fox. This may require video footage of the hounds being encouraged once a fox is in plain sight in order for a prosecution to stand a chance. Although numerous successful prosecutions are brought under the Hunting Act each year, this hasn’t stopped the process of hunting from continuing. The claims by the hunting fraternity pre-ban that hunts would close and be forced to put down all their dogs have come to nothing. Today about 45,000 people regularly take part and 250,000 turned out last Boxing Day for the traditional yuletide meet, according to hunting enthusiasts who claim numbers are higher than ever. At the last election, the Tories promised a free vote on the Hunting Act. Theresa May reportedly forced the issue into the manifesto against the advice of senior cabinet members, telling a campaign event she has “always been in favour of fox hunting”. The Countryside Alliance, to whom the move was understood to have been an olive branch in return for them getting out the vote, has since congratulated her for not bowing to animal rights groups in the misguided pursuit of “electoral nirvana”. Last year a poll commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports put opposition to hunting at 84% – an all-time high. Recently, there was a vote on whether to continue trail hunting on National Trust land. The charity used the proxy votes at its disposal to narrowly pass the motion, against the will of the majority of members who cast their votes in person. The Trust, which forbids the use of animal-based scents, publishes details of the meets but does not reveal specific routes, saying it does not want to encourage a climate of confrontation between followers and protesters. Opponents say this allows hunts to trail foxes. “You’ll occasionally see them pretending to lay a trail,” claims Lee Moon, spokesperson for the Hunt Saboteurs. “But as far as we’re concerned, trail hunting doesn’t exist. Clearly, the hounds are not trained to hunt trails.” “You’ll see hunts blatantly breaking the Hunting Act even when we are present. The law needs to be massively tightened to get rid of its multiple loopholes. It’s remarkable that it’s never been amended.” However, Tory MP and longtime animal welfare advocate Sir Roger Gale disagrees, arguing that although the Hunting Act is imperfect other issues are more worthy of attention. “My personal view is that, by and large, the majority of hunts embrace the spirit and the letter of the law,” said Gale, a trustee of the Conservatives Against Fox Hunting group. “There are instances where foxes are raised and hunted illegally, but the trouble is that much of the evidence is anecdotal.” Labour MP Chris Williamson, a long-serving trustee of the League Against Cruel Sports who previously served on the board of the Hunt Saboteurs Association, questioned where Gale got his information. “I’m told hunts are fragrantly disregarding the law,” he said. “The truth is that if they were genuinely trail hunting they would use an artificial scent rather than fox urine. The pretence of laying a trail is for show.” Will the clashes between hunts and saboteurs ever be resolved? “The legislation absolutely needs tightening to remove loopholes,” says Williamson. “Only an unambiguous law will stop these practices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/15/immigration-asylum-refugees-looking-back","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T12:00:16Z","webTitle":"Looking back: immigration and asylum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/15/immigration-asylum-refugees-looking-back","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/15/immigration-asylum-refugees-looking-back","fields":{"headline":"Looking back: immigration and asylum","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1915 German immigrants living in London and Manchester are attacked in retaliation for British fatalities during the first world war. 1937 Nearly 4,000 child refugees from Spain arrive in the UK following the aerial bombing of Guernica in the Spanish civil war. 1940 As war rages once more, a mass evacuation of British children to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa begins. 1948 West Indians arrive in Britain at Tilbury on board the Empire Windrush.

In stingingly topical style, the behaviours of its characters six decades ago, including George Smiley, are examined by the modern forces of political correctness. The long and enduring power of Le Carré leaves British espionage fiction a cramped space for newcomers.

In Spook Street (John Murray), this stable of unstable spies deal with a terrorist attack plus the risk that a retired agent with dementia may forget what he shouldn’t know. Chief cowboy of the slow horses, Jackson Lamb, whose vulgar hedonism would be enough to make Falstaff look like Philip Hammond, is becoming one of crime fiction’s great characters. Two corpses – one black, one white – are washed up in a Texan bayou in Attica Locke’s Bluebird, Bluebird (Serpent’s Tail), exposing African American Texas Ranger Darren Matthews to prejudices, loyalties and secrets, and forcing him to confront his own. Locke is progressively dramatising black US history; with this book she reaches the Obama era. Denise Mina, a worthy regular on crime book award shortlists, showed her range by taking the 2017 Gordon Burn prize, established to honour a great explorer of the borders between fact and fiction. In The Long Drop (Harvill Secker) Mina combines two genres unusual for her – faction and historical – in a superb recreation of a Glasgow serial murder trial (and risk of miscarriage of justice) in 1958. Australian first-timer Jane Harper suggested a potential torrent of talent with The Dry (Abacus), in which a man returns to the outback town from which he had been summarily exiled as a teenager. He is there to attend the funeral of a childhood best mate who is believed to have killed his wife and son, before turning the gun on himself. But the case is clearly not as simple as that and, in the tense setting of a landcape where it hasn’t rained for two years, Harper slowly but thrillingly reveals where the truth lies. Another exciting newcomer is British author Emma Flint, whose Little Deaths (Picador) fictionalises the real-life 1960s case of a New York mother suspected of killing her children: the story unfolds after a tabloid reporter worries that hacks, cops and gossips have rushed to judgment. Meanwhile, when it seemed that all the possible Sherlock variations had been done, Joe Ide’s debut IQ (W&amp;N) brilliantly relocated the world of 221B Baker St to contemporary LA. At the other end of a career, John Grisham, approaching 40 novels, surely has no financial or egotistical need to keep proving himself, but showed impressive creative hunger by releasing two smart books this year, Camino Island and The Rooster Bar (both Hodder). The first turns on a heist from a university vault containing F Scott Fitzgerald’s manuscripts, while in the second disillusioned law school students seek revenge on a fraudulent billionaire. Faber’s welcome republication of vintage crime bestsellers continued with An English Murder by Cyril Hare, a wintry country house whodunit from 1951. And in Celia Fremlin’s 1958 psychological thriller, The Hours Before Dawn, a mother with a baby who won’t stop crying must decide, in classic English mystery fashion, if fearful thoughts about her husband and a lodger are figments of a tired mind. Two of the most grieved-for recent ghosts in the crime fiction library continue a consoling publishing afterlife with posthumous volumes of short stories: PD James with Sleep No More: Six Murderous Tales (Faber), and Ruth Rendell with A Spot of Folly: Ten and a Quarter New Tales of Murder and Mayhem (Profile). The latter is introduced by Sophie Hannah, who confirmed that she is one of the strongest successors to the James-Rendell line with Did You See Melody? (Hodder). In this crisp who-did-what?, an Englishwoman at an Arizona resort hotel is convinced she sees the US’s most famous child murder victim. Susie Steiner solidified the promise of last year’s debut, Missing, Presumed, with another hyper-realistic police procedural, Persons Unknown (Borough). Now pregnant, the refreshingly original detective Manon Bradshaw embarks on a personally troubling investigation of a banker’s stabbing. With Magpie Murders, Anthony Horowitz established himself at the playful and experimental end of the mystery spectrum. The Word Is Murder (Century) raises the game-playing to Olympic level as a prolific novelist and TV screenwriter called Anthony Horowitz is tapped up by a disgraced detective to co-investigate a killing. Another author who likes to challenge generic expectations, Dennis Lehane seems to have abandoned the suspense form of his Mystic River and Shutter Island completely in the first half of Since We Fell (Little, Brown). At first it feels like a psycho-drama about Rachel, a TV reporter with PTSD and a controlling mother. Only in later sections detailing Rachel’s relationships is Lehane’s real Hitchcockian scheme revealed, with characteristically twisty action and crackling dialogue. Hitchcock would also have admired Joseph Finder’s The Switch (Head of Zeus). It spins enjoyable complications from someone accidentally picking up at an airport a laptop that belongs to a top politician who has taken a Hillary Clinton-like approach to cybersecurity. There have been increasing skirmishes across the historical border between mystery and non-genre fiction. Following last year’s Man Booker shortlisting of Graeme Macrae Burnet’s His Bloody Project, novelist-poet Adam Thorpe continued the trend with Missing Fay (Cape), an upmarket take on the gone girl mystery. And Macrae Burnet himself impressed again with the pleasantly tricksy Georges Simenon homage, The Accident on the A35 (Saraband)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/29/brexit-uk-white-flag-eu-divorce-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T17:20:12Z","webTitle":"Brexiters nowhere to be seen as UK raises white flag over EU divorce bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/29/brexit-uk-white-flag-eu-divorce-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/29/brexit-uk-white-flag-eu-divorce-bill","fields":{"headline":"Brexiters nowhere to be seen as UK raises white flag over EU divorce bill","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When the time came to hoist the white flag, the cabinet’s swashbuckling Brexiters were nowhere to be seen. Instead, it was left to civil servants to hammer out the terms of Britain’s expensive retreat from the EU, settling a divorce bill that could pave the way for a wider exit agreement struck almost entirely on terms demanded by Brussels. The secretive circumstances of the financial settlement, which were not even officially confirmed by ministers in parliament on Wednesday, are a far cry from the public fanfare that accompanied the start of the Brexit negotiations. When Theresa May invoked article 50 in March, she boasted that it was time to “make our own decisions and our own laws … to take control of the things that matter most to us”. As the formal talks ground on in the sterile surroundings of the Berlaymont building, the headquarters of the European commission, it became clear that it was Brussels bureaucrats who still called the shots, to the point of vetoing attempts to vary the venue on British turf occasionally. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, turned up nonetheless for six increasingly tetchy rounds of talks, accompanied by up to 100 British officials at a time and reportedly carrying his documents in a Faraday cage-protected briefcase to prevent electronic snooping. After the final such encounter, which shrunk from a week to a matter of hours, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, called time and declared that the UK had a fortnight to settle its debts or would miss any chance to give British business some breathing room with a transitional deal. Faced with such an ultimatum, Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform, said he believed Britain had little realistic choice but to cave in on money, citizens’ rights and the Irish border if it wanted to get to phase two talks on trade. “It is dressed up as a negotiation, but it’s really been a story of the British taking time to realise that they have got to accept what the EU demands of them,” he said. “The EU is intelligent enough not to pursue this in a humiliating way, but the truth is that we have to accept.” The final breakthrough did not come via another Davis and Barnier set piece at the Berlaymont. The final two rounds of talks expected before a European council meeting in December have not been scheduled. Instead, it was Olly Robbins, a low profile but ambitious official who left the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) after falling out with Davis, who appeared to have tied up the final loose ends in private this week, dealing largely with Barnier’s German deputy, Sabine Weyand. The two have been meeting behind the scenes for months and were formally tasked with leading parallel talks on Ireland, but it was since Robbins moved back to the Cabinet Office that he has been seen in Brussels as a more reliable channel to the prime minister. One British official said Robbins and a small team of negotiators who report directly to him have been able to straddle No 10 and DExEU, avoiding some of the political tensions that hampered ministerial-level talks. Meanwhile, the prime minister prepared the ground among her Brexit hardliners in government, first at a subcommittee of the cabinet last week and then a meeting of the full cabinet on Monday. If the final loose ends can be tied up by Robbins and Weyand on Ireland and the role of the European court of justice (ECJ) in protecting citizens’ rights, May is expected to present Britain’s final offer in person to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, next Monday. Another source close to the process said: “Davis is less important than he was and the move of Robbins was symptomatic of No 10 being much more in control. Brussels is happy about that. They didn’t have a high regard for Davis. They didn’t think he was a very serious figure, so the fact of his sidelining has gone down well. “British officials have got their act together and understand what needs to be done, and it’s a question of how quickly or not they can drag their political masters along with them.” Despite this, Davis maintains a visible presence, sitting confidently on the government frontbench during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, and his continued leadership of DExEU will be vital in persuading Brexit enthusiasts that May has not sold out in pursuit of a deal at any cost. Others blame the prime minister for setting an impossible challenge for the Brexit secretary. Speeches at Lancaster House and the 2016 Conservative party conference, drafted by her former adviser Nick Timothy, drew restrictive red lines on issues such as the ECJ that made compromise all but impossible. Britain’s former EU ambassador Sir Ivan Rogers is one of a number of senior officials openly questioning whether May rushed into triggering article 50 and criticising her predecessor David Cameron. Grant said: “The final outcome was predetermined by Britain’s red lines. Departing the EU has turned out to be very much like accession. It’s called a negotiation, but that is a way of trying to be polite. “The truth is if you want to join, you join on their terms. You can quibble about the details, but the broad lines are decided by the EU and dressed up as a negotiation. Similarly, when you leave the EU, once you declare your red lines, the ECJ and free movement being two important ones, then the range of opportunities for the future relationship are very limited.” Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told MPs on Wednesday it was “not in national interest to comment on speculation” about a deal, but insisted that “whatever happens, we are not going to be paying anything like what we would have been as an EU member”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/nov/29/government-picks-ex-channel-4-chair-lord-burns-ofcom-role","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T18:00:23Z","webTitle":"Government picks ex-Channel 4 chair Lord Burns for Ofcom role","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/29/government-picks-ex-channel-4-chair-lord-burns-ofcom-role","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/nov/29/government-picks-ex-channel-4-chair-lord-burns-ofcom-role","fields":{"headline":"Government picks ex-Channel 4 chair Lord Burns for Ofcom role","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government has chosen the former chairman of Channel 4, Lord Burns, to be the new chairman of the media regulator Ofcom. Burns will replace Patricia Hodgson in January if a pre-appointment hearing with the parliamentary digital, culture, media and sport select committee is successful. The government said in a statement that the committee’s conclusions from the hearing next month would be considered carefully before the appointment was formally approved. Burns is on course to be paid £120,000 a year in the job for working up to three days a week. He was chairman of Channel 4 for six years before it was announced in 2015 that he would leave as the government considered plans to privatise the broadcaster, which he opposed. It is understood the government vetoed Ofcom’s plans to allow him to extend his term in the job. Burns said the privatisation of Channel 4 would have “little financial benefit” and questioned how the-then culture secretary, John Whittingdale, was handling the job. He will work alongside Sharon White, the chief executive of Ofcom, at a crucial time for the regulator. This year it began regulating the BBC and it is also helping the Competition and Markets Authority with its investigation into whether 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by the Murdoch family, will be allowed to buy Sky. Burns held senior positions in the Treasury before moving to the private sector. He was chief economic adviser to the Treasury and head of the government economic service from 1980 to 1991, then permanent secretary to the Treasury between 1991 and 1998. He went on to become chairman of Santander UK, Marks &amp; Spencer, Welsh Water, the National Lottery Commission and the Royal Academy of Music. Burns is presently a non-executive member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides economic forecasts for the Treasury, and a senior adviser to Banco Santander. Ofcom welcomed the announcement. A spokesperson said: “We are pleased that the DCMS has announced a preferred candidate for the role of Ofcom chairman. We will await the outcome of the pre-appointment hearing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/nov/29/24-hour-putin-people-my-week-watching-kremlin-propaganda-channel-rt-russia-today","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T17:39:32Z","webTitle":"24-hour Putin people: my week watching Kremlin ‘propaganda channel’ RT","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/29/24-hour-putin-people-my-week-watching-kremlin-propaganda-channel-rt-russia-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/nov/29/24-hour-putin-people-my-week-watching-kremlin-propaganda-channel-rt-russia-today","fields":{"headline":"24-hour Putin people: my week watching Kremlin ‘propaganda channel’ RT","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The top story on the 9am news on RT – the Kremlin-backed English-language television channel formerly known as Russia Today – is about the EU’s renewed approval for a weedkiller produced by Monsanto. It includes rather elaborate coverage of a small-looking protest outside the European parliament, and excerpts from a debate on the safety or otherwise of glyphosates. On the strength of this opening five minutes, I might once have been tempted to conclude that it was a slow news day, but on RT every day is a slow news day. According to its detractors, RT is Vladimir Putin’s global disinformation service, countering one version of the truth with another in a bid to undermine the whole notion of empirical truth. And yet influential people from all walks of public life appear on it, or take its money. You can’t criticise RT’s standards, they say, if you don’t watch it. So I watched it. For a week. Following the Monsanto report, there is a roundup of anti-terrorist measures being implemented across Europe for the Christmas period – concrete barriers positioned outside Christmas markets, wrapped up like giant presents, that sort of thing – followed by a warning from newsreader Rory Suchet that 100% safety is “impossible to ensure”. Suchet, the son of former ITV newsreader John Suchet and the nephew of actor David Suchet, has been working for RT since 2009. The offspring of well-known people feature often on RT. Sophie Shevardnadze, who presents Sophie &amp; Co, is the granddaughter of former Georgian president and Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze. Tyrel Ventura, who presents Watching the Hawks on RT America, is the son of wrestler-turned-politician Jesse Ventura. His co-host is Oliver Stone’s son Sean. Russia Today was launched in 2005. Svetlana Mironyuk, the director of state-run RIA-Novosti, the news agency that oversees the channel, said at the time that western perceptions of Russia came down to three words: communism, snow and poverty. “We would like to present a more complete picture of life in our country,” she said. But Russia barely figures in RT’s coverage; its main stories tend to concern the Middle East, or European infighting or social injustice in the US. Its overarching narrative is a tale of the west’s unrelenting decline. Its regular financial programme is called Boom Bust. On the Keiser Report, former US stockbroker Max Keiser says that “Donald Trump is helping to ease America into being a second-tier country, and I think that’s the most responsible thing he could do”. He suggests that Americans will have to learn to live on $3,000 or $4,000 a year, “or give in to your Chinese overlords”. His guest agrees with him. On RT, everybody agrees with everybody. When Russia does make the news on RT, the Kremlin has little to worry about. Earlier this week, the main story was about a possible blanket ban on Russian Olympic athletes implicated in the doping scandal. Over the course of the day, reports repeatedly cited a “persistent lack of evidence” for a state-sponsored doping regime and sought to characterise the whole scandal as a western propaganda exercise aimed at undermining the next Russian presidential election. Foreign governments deploying disinformation to influence elections – where do they get this stuff? That day’s BBC Radio 4 lunchtime news did carry a brief report about the upcoming Winter Olympics, but it was about security concerns in South Korea; it didn’t mention the doping scandal at all. That is probably because the doping scandal wasn’t really news that day. Four Russian athletes had been banned for life the previous week; an announcement on further bans was still a week away. The McLaren report, which offered firm evidence that Russia operated a state-sponsored doping regime, came out last year. RT’s stated mission is to offer an “alternative perspective on major global events”, but the world according to RT is often downright surreal. Fringe opinion takes centre stage. Reporting is routinely bolstered by testimony from experts you have never heard of, representing institutions you have never heard of. A later update of that Christmas terrorist story gave ample airtime to “political commentator” Graham Moore, who turns out to belong to something called the “White Pendragons” and whose most recent YouTube posting on “civic nationalism” has garnered just 177 views at the time of writing, including mine. On Crosstalk, RT’s flagship discussion programme hosted by an American in a bow-tie called Peter Lavelle, one regular participant, Victor Olevich, is described as “a leading expert at the Centre for Actual Politics”. A Google search for “the centre for actual politics” produces precisely one hit – from a previous Crosstalk transcript. That is not to say the channel is peopled entirely by nonentities: lots of present and former UK politicians from the left and the right turn up on RT regularly. Nigel Farage has been on; so has Ann Widdicombe. George Galloway co-hosts a chatshow with his wife. The Commons register of interests shows that, in the past two years, MPs including David Davies, Rosie Duffield, Mike Freer and Nigel Evans have been paid up to £1,000 an hour to appear on RT programmes. Former Scottish leader Alex Salmond recently launched his own programme. And it’s not just politicians: Larry King and Stan Collymore both make programmes for RT. Germaine Greer and Peter Tatchell have appeared on it, along with a number a journalists who write for, among other publications, the Guardian. Some MPs, notably David Gauke, have refused to speak to RT. David Lammy has resolved not to appear on the channel in future. But David Davies (the Monmouth backbencher, not Brexit minister David Davis) has defended his appearances on the satirical show Sam Delaney’s News Thing. “The News Thing has given me a fair chance to explain my opinions on Brexit, immigration and transgender issues, for which I am grateful,” he told the Observer this month. “Sadly, I have not received the same courtesy from the British Broadcasting Corporation.” To be fair, much of what one sees on RT is pretty harmless, or at least inconsequential. Over the course of a week, I watched one debate on gender issues that seemed fairly sensible, even mildly enlightening. “The annoying thing about RT is that some of the reporting is very good and genuine,” says Misha Glenny, the author of McMafia. “The trick is trying to differentiate that from the propaganda. The Russians have moved on since the days of Pravda, the Soviet Communist party newspaper, or Radio Moscow International during the cold war – at least then you knew it was all guff, coming out of the Ideological Secretariat. RT is designed to confuse and muddy the waters. That mixture of genuine and guff leaves you baffled and disoriented, which, I guess, is the point.” In 2010, RT America was launched, followed by RT UK in 2014. Certain programmes are made under these auspices in Washington and London – and some RT America shows turn up on RT UK – but much of the time you are getting RT International programming from Moscow. Many of the British and American reporters on its roster have been with the channel since 2005; some were recruited straight from journalism school. According to a 2010 article in the Columbia Journalism Review, even from the beginning these inexperienced recruits were paid six-figure salaries for five days’ work a fortnight. While the exact nature of the relationship between RT and the Russian state is never made apparent, critics say it cannot be overplayed: for them, RT is the Russian state. The channel’s defenders – almost exclusively people who work for it and appear on it – say they are free from the Kremlin’s influence and unafraid to speak truth to power. But in the US, RT America has been obliged to register as a foreign agent. RT UK has been reprimanded by Ofcom a dozen times for lack of balance. Peter Pomerantsev, author of Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible, about Putin’s Russia, and now a senior visiting fellow in global affairs at the London School of Economics, was in Moscow working in television when Russia Today first started hiring graduates from Britain and the US. “The people were really bright, they were being paid well,” he says. But they soon found they were being ordered to change their copy, or instructed how to cover certain stories to reflect well on the Kremlin. “Everyone had their own moment when they first twigged that this wasn’t like the BBC,” he says. “That, actually, this is being dictated from above.” The coverage of Russia’s war with Georgia in 2008 was a lightbulb moment for many, he says. They quit. There are clearly varying levels of independence at RT. Larry King’s shows are produced by his own company, Ora TV. Galloway’s programme is preceded by a warning that “the views and opinions expressed in the following programme do not necessarily coincide with those of RT”. But some of the channel’s reporters have complained of interference and bias. In 2014, RT America newsreader Liz Wahl resigned on air over the channel’s coverage of the Crimea crisis. Later that year, correspondent Sara Firth also quit after tweeting: “We do work for Putin. We are asked on a daily basis, if not to totally ignore, then to obscure the truth.” One open question is: who is watching RT, besides me? The service claims to have access to a worldwide audience of 700 million people – you can get it online, on Sky, Freeview or in almost any hotel – but RT has never released actual UK viewing figures. The most recent figures available from the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board gave RT a weekly reach of 413,000 viewers for the week 13-19 November (compared with 4.4 million for Sky News, and 7.3 million for BBC News). That is an audience share of 0.02%. But RT is big on Twitter and YouTube. “Its social media is much more important than the channel, because no one really watches that,” says Pomerantsev. If you went by its adverts, you might initially think it was viewed exclusively by people who are desperate to buy gold bullion, over-50s travel insurance or funeral protection policies. But if you watch long enough, you will also see ads for Samsung, Maltesers, Whiskas and Extra gum. Evidently these brands think there is someone out there to sell to. The basic cycle of RT’s schedules is simple: the news comes every hour at the top of the hour, followed by some sort of analysis or documentary at half past. Even for a rolling news channel, it is insanely repetitive. The news reports often barely differ from one hour to the next, and its regular programmes – Going Underground, Crosstalk, On Contact, The Keiser Report – are broadcast with numbing frequency, and updated infrequently. In one 24-hour period, I caught the same documentary – about a mysterious sleeping sickness affecting residents of a former mining town in Kazakhstan – three times. It was made in 2015. RT is never more surreal than when the topic is RT itself. On a recent edition of Crosstalk, the panellists discussed RT America’s new status as a registered foreign agent. “Civil liberties groups, the mainstream media, they’re all silent on this,” said one. “Where is the ACLU [the American Civil Liberties Union]? This is a blatant infringement of free speech!” Everyone else, as usual, concurs. Even I agree that the ACLU’s lack of interest in the case is telling, but perhaps not in the way they think. In response to accusations a few weeks ago that the channel is a mere propaganda mouthpiece for Putin, Sam Delaney mounted an odd stunt on his satirical show. He produced what he called “Putin’s Lie Machine” – a vintage computer prop with blinking lights that churned out “fake news” headlines, challenging MP Michael Fabricant to guess whether they were true or not. It wasn’t remotely satirical, or even slightly funny (as you might imagine, Fabricant was no help), but it did treat the accusations against RT as if they were too preposterous to address head-on. And they are not preposterous. More than outright lies, RT deals in moral equivalency. Its defenders don’t deny bias; they deny the possibility of objectivity. They say western media is equally biased. They liken RT to state broadcasters such as the BBC, France 24 and al Jazeera. They say other news channels have been sanctioned by Ofcom. It’s a triumph of cynicism: we’re all just as bad as each other."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/29/john-king-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T16:55:35Z","webTitle":"John King obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/29/john-king-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/29/john-king-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John King obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My husband, John King, who has died aged 68 of a stroke, worked for Newcastle social services for 30 years, first with children and then leading a team of mental health social workers in the west end of the city. By 1994 John had realised that homeless people frequently suffered from mental illness but rarely received useful treatment, because NHS systems require an address. Without that address, homeless people remained on the outside, treated at A&amp;E but without joined-up care plans. He therefore based a mental health social worker at Hill Court in Pitt Street, where the old brewery flats intended for night-shift workers were being used to house homeless people. Before long, Hill Court became a model of good practice. Housing officers were on duty 24 hours a day; a GP ran sessions there; a health visitor was on call; and the social worker was able to build up a mental health record, enabling a care plan to be implemented. The work at Hill Court won national recognition when, in 1997, the Sainsbury prize for Inter-agency Co-operation in Mental Health was awarded to Newcastle city council. John was born in London, the son of Alfred, a miller, and Lily (nee Flack). Brought up in Wood Green, north London, he went to Glendale grammar school, which became Wood Green comprehensive, and trained as a social worker at Ipswich City College. His first job was as a social worker in Wolverhampton. In 1975 he left for Nairobi to work for a children’s charity, the Child Welfare Society of Kenya. It was in Kenya that we met. We made a surprising pair: I was a prim teacher of English in a girls’ boarding school, while he was enjoying his hippy phase, sporting shoulder-length golden ringlets and riding everywhere on a motorbike in a cloud of dust., We married in 1977. When John was 45 he was diagnosed with polycythaemia rubra vera, a rare blood disease, and told that he would live for 10 years. In fact, he lived for another 23, thanks partly to progress in treatment of the disease but also to his determination to keep fit by cycling to work and participating in the Great North Run. After retirement in 2013 John continued to support services for vulnerable people by volunteering, first at the east end food bank and more recently at the People’s Kitchen, a support centre for homeless and disadvantaged people in Newcastle. Four days before his death he cycled to Tweed Street allotments as usual, to harvest the remaining vegetables for the People’s Kitchen. He delighted in the shared pleasure of gardening and the companionship of breaks in the allotment shed. He was an avid Guardian reader, proud to be thrice winner of its prize crossword. He is survived by me, our sons, Aidan, Thomas and Barnabas, and a grandson, Finlay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/shortcuts/2017/nov/29/apples-should-be-kept-in-the-fridge-now-but-what-about-oranges-and-bananas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T16:36:10Z","webTitle":"Apples should be kept in the fridge now – but what about oranges and bananas?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/nov/29/apples-should-be-kept-in-the-fridge-now-but-what-about-oranges-and-bananas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/nov/29/apples-should-be-kept-in-the-fridge-now-but-what-about-oranges-and-bananas","fields":{"headline":"Apples should be kept in the fridge now – but what about oranges and bananas?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Is there anything more disappointing than biting into an apple, only to find it has gone all fluffy and soft? It happens all the time – and now we know why. According to a government initiative on food labelling, it is because we are not storing our Pink Lady apples in the fridge. As part of a drive to reduce annual household food waste in the UK by 350,000 tonnes, labelling is changing. In future, it will include, among other things, a “little blue fridge” icon for foods that keep for longer in the fridge, including apples and oranges. Can this be right? Well, yes – but it’s a matter of timing. Here’s a guide to when to let fruit chill. Apples There is so much anxiety around apples already: they are a year old when they reach the shops; there are no seasons any more; what happened to British varieties? If we must accept our preference for rock-hard, crunchy fruit, keeping them at 4C prolongs life by up to two weeks. Oranges Assuming they are ripe when you buy them (they’re one of the few products for which supermarkets don’t expect us to do the work), it is best to put oranges in the fridge, and not just because no one wants warm orange juice. Once ripe, they start to lose their vitamin C, a process that is slower when cold. Soft fruit Using a very unscientific sample – my kitchen – I find these have a 30-minute enjoyment window between unripe tastelessness and mould-covered slime. Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and melons should be kept out until they smell good, then put in the chiller to maintain freshness long enough to whip up a meringue. Bananas Bananas only taste of something once they are ripe and going brown, but their natural gases provide a useful ripening service for other fruits, so keep them in the bowl, next to that rock-hard avocado. If you are not going to eat them in time, put them in the freezer and make a cake or smoothie another day. Tomatoes The head of food preservation for AEG once told me that we arrange our fridges wrongly – meat should be where the salad drawers are, and fruit and veg should be placed on the top shelf. So there you go – but please don’t ever put tomatoes in the fridge unless you want to eat something resembling a sliced Comic Relief nose. The cold distorts the flavour and texture – keep them out at all costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/29/brexit-negotiators-believe-end-irish-border-impasse-near","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T19:35:12Z","webTitle":"Brexit negotiators believe end to Irish border impasse is near","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/29/brexit-negotiators-believe-end-irish-border-impasse-near","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/29/brexit-negotiators-believe-end-irish-border-impasse-near","fields":{"headline":"Brexit negotiators believe end to Irish border impasse is near","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"UK and EU negotiators are increasingly optimistic that sufficient agreement on the future of the Irish border can be reached in the coming days to progress Brexit talks to the next stage. Sources indicate the ground has now been laid for political agreement on the question of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland after Brexit, which would allow both sides to start discussing the UK’s future trading relationship with the bloc. “Yesterday was a substantial breakthrough and has given everyone a sense of optimism that a landing zone is in sight,” said an EU source familiar with the negotiations. Theresa May has been given until Monday, when she meets the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, to table satisfactory offers on three issues – the divorce bill, Ireland and EU citizens rights – before Brexit talks can move to a second phase. Sources say that, behind the scenes at official level, the potential draft wording is being circulated, although the “magic formula of words has yet to materialise”. It is understood there has been an acceptance on the British side over the need to “clear a pathway” towards a solution and a “recognition that the issue of regulatory divergence has to be addressed” in relation to Ireland. Of particular concern is whether the UK would try to pursue a different, light-touch approach to the regulation of agri-business after Brexit. On the Irish side there is recognition that , now is the time of maximum leverage to secure an agreement and that “a good deal for the UK is a good deal for Ireland” because Britain is Ireland’s largest export market. Both sides hope they can find a mutually agreed set of words that will allay Irish fears about the return of a hard border, while leaving the final details to be determined once there is a clearer sense of what trade relationship the EU will have with the UK after Brexit. The negotiations had descended into a war of words this month after an internal EU paper suggested that it was essential for Northern Ireland to remain in the single market and the customs union to avoid a hard border. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, reiterated government policy that Britain would leave the customs union and the single market on exiting the bloc. The Democratic Unionist party, which holds the balance of power in the House of Commons, said it would not tolerate anything that decoupled Northern Ireland from the UK. But since then there have been more positive developments. Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said on Wednesday that “progress is being made”, though differences remain. “We are not at a decision point at the moment. Things are changing on a daily basis and are rapidly evolving,” said Varadkar. While Ireland’s situation has generated sympathy in the rest of the EU, there is also wariness about any special arrangement on the border that could give British companies, and smugglers, a backdoor into the EU market, or compromise EU standards on animal welfare. “There is a lot of solidarity for Ireland here, but everyone is worried about the issue,” said one diplomat. “If there is no border we might as well do away with the internal market. The UK is already the biggest source of counterfeit goods. “It brought ‘mad cow disease’, it is not like they have a glorious past to lean on. Everyone is very worried about this for very good reasons.” The UK environment secretary, Michael Gove, has said that while he would like to see the British regulatory regime diverge from the rest of the EU, animal welfare standards are likely to be strengthened, not weakened. There is concern on both sides that if there is regulatory divergence, cross-border trade and social cohesion that has flourished since the Good Friday agreement will be jeopardised. Agriculture leaders in the region have said that farmers, who get 87% of their income from EU subsidies, will be wiped out by Brexit if cross-border production in milk, cheese, meat and livestock is disrupted. One senior EU source said the final agreement was unlikely to emerge before the weekend as the Irish push for last-minute concessions before the progress meeting between May and Juncker on Monday. “The Irish want to extract some kind of commitments from the UK that are more than a general promise about the fact that you could maintain regulatory convergence on the island,” they said. “The question is how detailed should this be and how it should be formulated.” All sides are agreed on their objective to move forward without jeopardising peace in Ireland and there is widespread agreement on continuing the longstanding “common travel area” that allows free movement between the two countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/05/farc-rebels-civilian-life-colombia-peace-deal-one-year-later","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T09:00:12Z","webTitle":"'There's nothing for us': Farc rebels search for purpose a year after historic deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/05/farc-rebels-civilian-life-colombia-peace-deal-one-year-later","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/05/farc-rebels-civilian-life-colombia-peace-deal-one-year-later","fields":{"headline":"'There's nothing for us': Farc rebels search for purpose a year after historic deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Until recently, Sofía, a slight, unassuming 22-year-old, was a member of Latin America’s most powerful guerrilla army: the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). At the height of its powers, the group mounted devastating ambushes on government soldiers, kidnapped thousands of ordinary civilians and shifted shipments of drugs worth millions. But today, after a peace deal signed one year ago, Sofía now lives in a demobilisation camp in Mesetas, where the edges of Colombia’s dense southern jungle meet the country’s rolling eastern plains. Like many former fighters, she is struggling to fill her empty days, and increasingly anxious that the government has abandoned them now they have laid down their rifles. “Where do I begin? The government hasn’t kept up so many of its promises,” said Sofía, who has spent over half of her life with the guerrillas. “It makes me wonder if we made a mistake handing in our weapons.” The peace deal formally ended 52 years of bitter war that left 220,000 dead and more than 7 million displaced. But while they are hopeful the accord will help rebuild the country, many disarmed rebels are worried about the glacial pace of its implementation. More than half of the 500 rebels that moved to the camp in January have since left. Though they are now free to move around the country, the idea was that they would stay and work with the Farc’s new political party. Some are suspected of joining dissident factions that have refused to disarm, though Sofía maintains that is not an option for her. “I have left all that behind,” she said. But many in the camp share her view that the government has little incentive to comply with outstanding aspects of the deal now the rebels have laid down their weapons. A common complaint in Mesetas is that the camp, where the rebels were obliged to remain until their weapons were handed over in September, was not fit for purpose until after the deadline. While all are now housed in self-built homes – with the materials provided by the government – two months ago many were living in makeshift tarpaulin tents that would reach unbearable temperatures. “Imagine the heat, and then the mud and the rain,” said Jenny, a former fighter, as she waited in line to sign documents that would excuse her crimes of rebellion and sedition. Others complain that land on which to farm has not been handed over, and that the paperwork required to receive Colombian identification cards has still not arrived. For now, they sit around, talking to their families via Whatsapp and Facebook – social media tools they did not know existed until recently. A number have taken up smoking to pass the time. “There’s nothing for us to do,” said Jenny. “During wartime we lived hard but we had everything we needed. Here it’s very tough.” The peace accord was reached after three years of tense talks in Havana, Cuba, and includes components aimed at tackling root causes of the conflict, such as land distribution and political participation. Initially it failed to pass a referendum in October last year, with many voters unhappy with the deal’s promises of blanket amnesty for rebellion, and unelected seats in congress. The deal was amended and passed through congress a month later, though retaining its most contentious parts. Many of the Farc’s leadership stand accused of human rights abuses and war crimes that will be tried in special transitional courts, and a broader perception of the rebels as drug traffickers and terrorists persists. That same mistrust has caused some – including President Juan Manuel Santos – to cast doubt on the Farc’s current complaints. “The Farc’s leadership is playing politics,” said Santos in a meeting with journalists earlier this month. “For example, we deliver some construction materials ahead of the agreed time, and they refuse to accept them, claiming they are the wrong size,” the Nobel peace prize winner said. “Their strategy is to say we are not fulfilling our side of the deal.” Analysts note that while the peace process has taken on a stuttering pace, it has been successful in many respects. “In one important sense it has gone very well,” said Ariel Ávila, the director of the Peace and Reconciliation Foundation, a Bogotá-based thinktank. “The Farc no longer exist, and just one year after the deal was signed we are seeing fewer kidnappings, fewer landmine victims, fewer murders.” According to one study, by another group, the Resource Centre for Conflict Analysis, the deal may already have prevented about 2,800 deaths. And despite the malaise, some Farc members in Mesetas are enjoying the prospect of civilian life. There is a growing number of new mothers around the camp, after Farc rules forbidding pregnancy during wartime were lifted. Other rebels are excited to start business ventures, albeit with roots in their Marxist background. Einer López, a senior Farc member at the Mesetas demobilisation camp, is directing his team as build a hotel they plan to open to adventurous tourists keen to “live the guerrilla life”. “We are now reincorporating so we want to show people our way of life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/30/readers-recommend-playlist-your-unlikely-collaborations","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T12:00:13Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: your unlikely collaborations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/30/readers-recommend-playlist-your-unlikely-collaborations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/30/readers-recommend-playlist-your-unlikely-collaborations","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: your unlikely collaborations","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from hundreds of suggestions on last week’s callout. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. The KLF, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, the world’s biggest-selling singles act of 1991, were never short of ideas. Some were good, some were decadence on a bun. It’s hard to get away from their burning of a million quid and then making a house brick from the ashes. Fortunately, they were rarely short of musical ideas, and their chart success bought them an appointment with Tammy Wynette for the Illuminatus-inspired Justified and Ancient, with which we begin this list. Magnus Pyke, scientist and nutritionist, was employed in 1941 at the Ministry of Food and once famously suggested using excess human blood supplies to make black pudding for the masses. Pyke went on to work in the food and drink industry before washing up on TV as resident barmy scientist on the show Don’t Ask Me. Thomas Dolby, impressed by all this, wrote a video storyboard around Pyke, thought of a title, and then wrote She Blinded Me With Science – recruiting Pyke for the recording. Did the Stranglers need George Melly’s help with Old Codger? Did Melly need to sing lead vocal for them on the B-side of Walk on By? Probably not. So what we have here is a marriage made in Hades; the band thumping around while old George drags the tune around in a bucket. Makes you think what a fine rock singer the old jazzer might have made. Cornershop’s Tjinder Singh channels Kris Kristofferson for his duet with Tarnation’s Paula Frazer on It’s Good to Be on the Road Back Home Again. There’s some Troggs-type ocarina in the mix, which is no surprise from a band as eclectic as this. Electronic duo 1 Giant Leap’s I Love The Way You Dream, features both the world’s most recorded singer, Asha Bhosle (our previous act’s Brimful of Asha was about her) and Michael Stipe. Stipe’s wistful dreaminess and Bhosle’s ethereal control blend perfectly. Usually, where duets are concerned, one singer has to take the back seat and sing in an inappropriate key. In this case they complement each other like brother and sister. The soundtrack of the film Dead Man Walking is overladen with starry contributions, yet among all the glitter sits a nugget, The Long Road, a collaboration of Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder and Pakistani Qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. By some strange chance, these musicians from opposite parts of the world and completely different heritages just melded together perfectly. With our feet still planted in the subcontinent, we discover Trilok Gurtu and Roop Kumar’s The Beat of Love. Gurtu has been described as the world’s greatest tabla player, though he has drummed with swords, buckets and a western kit. A noted composer, his collaborations are legion, though probably his least predictable was with popular and prolific playback singer Kumar on this North African-tinged creation Jan Garbarek and the Hilliard Ensemble combined to introduce Gregorian chant to jazz saxophone on Parce Mihi Domine. This is jazz sax with a difference, though. Garbarek’s playing has a sidereal, weightless, quality perfectly suited to the Gregorian mode. The vocalists are anchored in timeless tradition, providing a solid base for the yearning tones of the instrument. British electronic band Ultramarine managed to snag Robert Wyatt for Happy Land, their sardonic take on a popular Victorian song. Wyatt waltzes through the vocals, always happy with an anti-establishment lyric. For their part, Ultramarine provide a jerky rhythm which forces Wyatt into an unusually bright melody. Until 1990 it would have been difficult to have conceived of a stranger pairing than the Grateful Dead and Branford Marsalis, but that was the year they first came together. Marsalis joined the Dead onstage for their Bird Song, weaving and intertwining his spell among the band’s airborne melodies. It’s a perfectly pitched balance of master musicians – light, fun and airy. Bono was asked to help make a film about people trying to live under siege during a civil war. To his credit, he did much more than that. Among his efforts was Miss Sarajevo, a song about a beauty pageant that really was held in the battlefield. Brian Eno was roped in, and the song was released under the pseudonym Passengers. It explodes the moment Luciano Pavarotti starts singing. It’s as if time stood still, waiting for Pavarotti’s vocal entrance, when it’s our turn to freeze, numbed by the emotion evoked by a single human voice. Being human, what do we do? We fall apart, or come together. We check eye colour, tone of skin, clothes and hair, shake hands, make music, dance. Then we grow up and the world gets in the way. Youssou N’Dour and Neneh Cherry’s 7 Seconds freezes a moment in a baby’s life, a time when everyone is equally human, before knowledge of good and evil. Zaz Turned Blue by Was (Not Was) and Mel Torme closes the list. It’s hard to think of anything new to write about such icons, except that somehow they got together. For however short a time, they were a match, each understanding one another’s input. No rush, no panic, just a gentle lilt towards inevitable closure.

Bolivia scraps term limits as critics blast 'coup' to keep Morales in power","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Orinoca, a tiny, poor village in south-west Bolivia, is an unlikely home for the monolithic Museum of the Democratic and Cultural Revolution. But this is is the birthplace of Evo Morales, the country’s president since 2006, and he remains the star of the show. The museum houses personal belongings – including a pair of shoes he wore as a child and a roomfull of football shirts – and about 5,000 keepsakes from around the indigenous-majority country. But the focus on Morales also hints at what critics call mounting authoritarianism by the president and his Movement Toward Socialism (Mas). This week, the country’s highest court overruled the constitution, scrapping term limits altogether for every office. Morales can now run for a fourth term in 2019 – and for every election thereafter. Morales, 58 – an Aymara former coca grower – was elected in 2006. The country’s first indigenous president, his 2009 constitution refounded Bolivia as a “plurinational state”. A partial nationalisation of Bolivia’s oil and gas helped create a middle class from scratch. Bolivia is Latin America’s fastest-growing economy; 53% of its legislators are women and a fifth are under 30. “From being a republic of classes, castes, skin colours, Bolivia today has become a country that by law has to be inclusive,” said Valeria Silva Guzmán, 27, a Mas congresswoman. Through slashing school truancy, infant and maternal mortality, and old-age poverty, she argued, Morales has “definitively changed the everyday reality of Bolivians”. Yet Bolivia, along with Nicaragua, is now the only presidential democracy in the Americas to place no limits on re-election. Last month, a senior minister shared an image of a placard which invited Morales to stay in power until 2050. “This is a coup against the constitution and a mockery of the referendum results,” conservative senator Óscar Ortiz told the Guardian – referring to a plebiscite 18 months ago in which Bolivians narrowly rejected presidential re-election. Ortiz called for citizens to spoil their votes in this Sunday’s judicial elections and vowed to challenge the case abroad. The US state department expressed “deep concern” over the ruling, and some Bolivian opposition leaders, warning of an imminent “Venezuelan-Cuban-style” dictatorship, have called for street demonstrations, although few expect serious unrest. Yet despite the referendum results – which the government claims were invalid due to an opposition smear campaign directed by Washington – it is unclear that a majority prefer the alternative. Recent demonstrations against re-election were reportedly dwarfed by subsequent pro-Morales rallies. The main opposition leaders, “all with roots in upper-class, mostly white, elite families, have been unable to generate a discourse that would appeal to a broad base of Bolivians,” said Diego von Vacano, a Bolivian political scientist at Yale University. Morales has, meanwhile, used his active social media presence to label his opponents agents of “the empire”. The sharpest criticisms of Morales have come from erstwhile allies, however. Felipe Quispe, an indigenous leader who once branded Mas policies “capitalism with an Indian face”, is in hiding after police quashed recent anti-corruption protests. Mas is a “soulless, disgusting corpse” that “stinks” of corruption, he said in a recording this month. “The outlook is bleak,” said Roger Chambi, 27, a student and radical Aymara activist. “It’s an outrage against the decision of the people. You see where politics and justice has got to in Bolivia. The worst thing is that we saw this coming, but could only watch.” Guzmán blames the movement against re-election on “hegemonic media” and a “post-truth” environment. “It is caudillos [strong men] that have changed the history of this part of the world,” she argues. “Men like Evo Morales, that fight for the majority, aren’t born every two or three years.” While Bolivian democracy will survive, said Von Vacano, “it now faces a new legitimation crisis”. Some sense a wasted opportunity for Bolivia’s longest-serving president, who has often promised to retire to a farmer’s life. “Morales could have attained the moral stature of a Mandela or a Simón Bolívar,” said Von Vacano, “had he chosen that route.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/29/jeremy-hunt-reforms-childbirth-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T15:22:49Z","webTitle":"Until hospitals learn from their mistakes, babies like my son will continue to die | James Titcombe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/29/jeremy-hunt-reforms-childbirth-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/29/jeremy-hunt-reforms-childbirth-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Until hospitals learn from their mistakes, babies like my son will continue to die","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Between 2004 and 2013, 16 babies and three mothers died in a maternity unit at Furness general hospital. One of those babies was my own son. Joshua died on 5 November 2008 of profuse internal bleeding to his left lung. A series of serious failures before and after his birth resulted in an infection that could have easily been cured with antibiotics going untreated until he collapsed 24 hours after he was born. After nine days of fighting for his life, Joshua died at the Freeman hospital in Newcastle despite the very best efforts of the dedicated neonatal intensive care staff. The trauma of Joshua’s death will be forever etched on our minds, but it is no exaggeration to say that the hardest part of coming to terms with his loss was the way Morecambe Bay NHS trust (responsible for the hospital) and the wider healthcare system, responded. Critical medical records mysteriously went “missing”, and various local investigations were less than honest. In March 2015, Dr Bill Kirkup published his long-awaited report looking at provision of maternity care at Furness general hospital (FGH) between 2004 and 2013. It found “a lethal mix” of failings had contributed to the deaths of babies and mothers. Ultimately, other babies have continued to die in the years since Joshua’s death, and I’ve met dozens of families whose experience has, sadly, been strikingly similar. While we have now finally seen transformational progress at the hospital that failed Joshua, yet another report was published this week highlighting the urgent need for national change. It looked at the quality of care in the case of stillbirths and neonatal deaths that occurred in 2015, reviewing a sample of 78 of the 225 cases. The report echoes the findings of a number of other recent maternity reports, concluding that eight in 10 of the deaths were potentially avoidable, and that in around a quarter of deaths there was ineffective communication between the health professionals delivering care. The report found a “common issue” of staff failing to recognise an evolving problem, or the transition from normal to abnormal. Although the report falls short of spelling it out, these findings highlight the importance of the recent move away from the national Royal College of Midwives campaign for “normal” – in other words, non-medical birth – towards a focus on ensuring women and their babies get the best and most appropriate care for them. The report also highlights that in around a quarter of cases, “capacity issues” were identified as a problem. Having the right number of appropriately skilled staff is crucial for the provision of all safe healthcare, but the issues affecting maternity safety are clearly much wider and complex than whether we have enough midwives and obstetricians. Perhaps of most concern, the report found that most local investigations into the cases reviewed were of poor quality, with 90% failing to fully follow the existing guidelines. This shows the extent to which our health system isn’t learning from serious errors that lead to tragic and unnecessary deaths; rather, these sorts of mistakes continue to repeat themselves. The Morecambe Bay inquiry recommended that all stillbirths and neonatal deaths should in future be subject to a standardised process of independent investigation, including input from and feedback to families. While it can certainly be argued that progress could have been quicker, this week the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has announced some monumental changes that I’ve long campaigned for. From April 2018 all cases of term stillbirths, neonatal deaths, brain-damaged babies and mothers who die giving birth will be independently investigated under the leadership of the new Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB). This is the ultimate response to Morecambe Bay and many other tragic cases that we know could be avoided with safer maternity care. These expert investigations will be a major step towards ensuring that no bereaved family is left having to fight for answers about what happened and why, and will hopefully provide a framework that can be expanded to other areas of healthcare in the future. Such expertise should provide great reassurance to healthcare staff by ensuring the focus is on system learning and not unwarranted blame. As Bill Kirkup wrote in his report, “all healthcare – everywhere – includes the possibility of error. The great majority of NHS staff know this and work hard to avoid it. They should not be blamed or criticised when errors occur despite their best efforts. But in return, those who work for the NHS owe the public a duty to be open and honest when things go wrong … to learn from what has happened. This is the contract that was broken in Morecambe Bay.” Providing safe healthcare is a hugely complex task; overnight transformation is unlikely. But I believe that the reforms announced by Jeremy Hunt this week offer by far the best hope yet of ensuring that in future the unwritten contract Kirkup describes in his report is never broken again. While we may never be able to eradicate NHS tragedies like Joshua’s death, we can and must ensure we do everything possible to learn from them. • James Titcombe OBE is a patient safety campaigner and father of Joshua Titcombe, who died nine days after being born in 2008 at Furness general hospital Comments will be premoderated"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/brain-flapping/2017/nov/30/seven-signs-that-you-might-be-a-mammal","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T07:30:01Z","webTitle":"Seven signs that you might be a mammal | Liam Drew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2017/nov/30/seven-signs-that-you-might-be-a-mammal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/brain-flapping/2017/nov/30/seven-signs-that-you-might-be-a-mammal","fields":{"headline":"Seven signs that you might be a mammal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"You likely know that you’re a mammal. You have neither feathers nor a shell, you cannot breathe underwater and you only have to look at an ant to feel the vast spans of evolutionary time that lie between you and insects. But are you absolutely sure? Are you 100% confident that you’re a mammal, and not some exotic form of mollusc? Well, now you can be, with this easy-to-use guide! 1) You have hair Although we humans are no longer particularly hairy, we retain patches of this uniquely mammalian structure in a number of places. Among mammals, only dolphins – after they’ve shed the few whiskers they’re born with – are completely bald. For most mammals, hair is elemental to their warm-blooded lifestyles. And, certainly for the first mammals – tiny little creatures that lived about 200m years ago – acquiring fur coats that slowed down heat loss was necessary for the evolution of warm blood. It is, though, still uncertain how hair first evolved – the usefulness of a few straggly prototype hairs is hard to fathom. They certainly wouldn’t have kept anyone warm. It’s now thought that these fine protrusions may originally have acted as either sensory structures – like whiskers do today – or they may have been wicks for getting sweat-like secretions out of the sweat glands and onto the body. And that only later did a thicker coating of them became insulating. Retaining hair on our human heads makes sense. Given how much energy a brain devours, one wouldn’t want to lose too much heat there. The hair beneath our arms and on our pubis is more surprising – one theory has it that it helps waft body scents around between members of our species. 2) Your first meal was milk When you were born, you were unable to digest anything other than this vital mammalian invention. Indeed, mammals are named after the glands from which we all take our first meals. Marsupials are born at a ludicrously early stage of development, then spend weeks or months permanently attached to one of their mother’s teats. How exactly mammals evolved lactation is another murky subject, but if you look closely, it’s clear that a mammary gland is a hypertrophied sweat gland (appetising, I know). Most researchers now believe that before there was nutritious milk, there was a sort of sweated abdominal secretion that pre-mammalian mothers used to coat their eggs. Such a procedure may have protected against dehydration or fought off infections – some of today’s milk proteins are suspiciously like naturally occurring antimicrobials (even more appetising, right?). 3) You did not depart your mother inside an egg Nope, at birth you were screaming and wriggling, and ready to go. This said, a little too much has been made of mammalian live birth. Entering this world unencased in eggshell doesn’t necessarily make you a mammal – numerous reptiles and fish have dispensed with laying eggs – while platypuses and their spiny cousins, echidnas, still lay eggs, as all mammalian ancestors did, and as the first mammals also did. You are, though, a placental mammal and a placenta establishes a very dynamic relationship between foetal mammal and its mother from the get-go. 4) As an infant, an adult looked after you Despite the absence of an eggshell, as a baby you couldn’t really do anything for yourself. While some newborn mammals are way more capable – baby wildebeests are up and running with the herd within minutes – all of them rely on their mothers for some initial postnatal care. Having all your dietary needs met by your mother’s mammaries is a very privileged upbringing. Contrast that to the majority of young reptiles who crack themselves free from their eggy origins and immediately have to fend for their themselves. (Though birds, like mammals, are also very diligent parents.) The close bond between mother and young that was founded on milk also allowed the possibility of culture exchange between generations to evolve. And the neurobiology of these bonds may have provided the foundations for further social (and romantic) bonds between mammals. 5) You have a diaphragm As a mammal, you have – unlike any other type of animal – a sheet of muscle across the bottom of your rib-cage. Leonardo da Vinci thought the diaphragm functioned to keep your body’s spiritual parts – your heart and lungs – separated from your baser parts – such as your stomach and guts. But what the diaphragm actually does is make you breathe far more powerfully. Being a mammal is a demanding task – your organs demand constant fuelling – so, you need to breathe and eat six to ten times more than a cold-blooded animal. Given this cost, the advantages of being warm-blooded are actually pretty hard to pin down. Some have suggested it’s actually just a by-product of being able to occasionally run hard, fast and long; others have said the demands of parenting might have required warm blood. 6) Your brain is strikingly large You’re a human, so of course you consider your abundance of cranial contents a zoological triumph. This said, whales and elephants have substantially bigger brains than you do. What makes yours special is its size relative to that of your body – it is about four-times bigger than a chimp’s and three times bigger than a gorilla’s, whose body-sizes are roughly comparable to yours. However, while ancient hominids made quite the cerebral leap forward, the evolution of mammals saw an even greater hike in brain size. As mammals first emerged, becoming increasingly warm-blooded, fossils of their craniums reveal a quite rapid expansion. Today, compared to a similarly sized reptile, a mammal’s brain is 10 times larger. Additionally, while there’s clearly something unique about human brains, it’s actually quite difficult to identify stark anatomical or genetic differences between our brain and those of other primates. But the grey matter that covers a human brain – the wrinkled mass of microscopically layered cerebral cortex – is a tissue that exists only in mammals. It’s thought to have evolved just before the arrival of true mammals as a new way of building a brain. Made mainly of this tissue, and dependent on own warm-bloodedness for its high running costs, the human brain is very, very much a mammalian brain. 7) You are an animal whose biology was profoundly shaped by a 100m year stretch of evolution that ran from about 300m to 200m years ago, and which sculpted from some reptile-like ancestors (who’d recently evolved from the earliest ever land-living vertebrates) a new type of animal – a mammal – that possessed a suite of traits that continue both to define how you live today, and which enabled the emergence of all the quirky traits that make your human life so very, very interesting. Yes, to understand what makes our curious species tick, you need to understand the evolution of human-only traits like our brains and complex language, our nimble hands and upright posture. But to fully understand how we got wo where we are today, it’s good to acknowledge our mammalian heritage and how we share this with the other five-and-a-half-thousand species of mammal with whom we share this planet.

The prime minister arrived in an RAF Hercules plane at the Taji base, north of Baghdad, on Wednesday morning, flying in from Jordan. While it had been announced that May was in the Middle East, information about her visit to Iraq was kept secret until she had departed for security reasons. At Taji, May met some of the 100 or so UK military personnel stationed at the predominantly Iraqi base, where they have helped train local forces, including some of the Iraqi troops who took part in the recently completed battle for Mosul against Isis. May, who was the first British leader in the country since Gordon Brown, talked to an Iraqi soldier who had taken part in the brutal campaign. She later flew to Baghdad for talks with the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, before flying on to Saudi Arabia. To coincide with the visit, Downing Street announced a series of joint security measures with Iraq, including £10m in extra funding for anti-terrorism efforts, moves to improve cross-border security, and work to tackle extremist material on the internet. The UK has about 600 troops in Iraq, almost all involved in training Iraqi forces. At the Taji base, May said this was vital to ensure the forces “are able to conduct the operations they need to” against Islamic State. May told Sky News: “We need to continue to work with the Iraqi forces to ensure that they are able to provide the security and stability for the country in future.” Part of the work involved trying to keep track of Isis fighters as they dispersed after the collapse of their self-styled caliphate in Mosul, the prime minister said. “We do need to ensure that we address the possibility of individuals from Daesh trying to set up elsewhere, and that is about ensuring there are no unstable areas where they can set up,” she said, using the government’s preferred term for Islamic State. “But it is also about dealing with the terrorist threat in all the ways we can. That includes, for example, working to ensure that their hateful material is not being spread across the internet and inspiring others to conduct attacks.” Asked about spending to meet such commitments, May said the government remained committed to spending at least 2% of GDP on defence, and indicated this could rise. “We will see an increase in the defence budget over the years,” she said. “Of course we need to look at the threats we face and ensure we have the capabilities to meet those threats as they emerge.” Speaking before her arrival in Iraq, May told reporters traveling with her that one remaining risk from Islamic State was cyber-attacks, and the group’s wider online presence. “As we deal with Daesh it’s not just about military action that is taken. It’s about addressing the terrorist threat across a whole range of aspects we need to deal with, including, for example, access to the internet,” she said. At Taji base, May watched royal engineers training Iraqi forces in how to detect and removed improvised explosive devices. She also talked to medical personnel who have been training Iraqi forces, largely those involved at Mosul, where the level of injuries and deaths has been significant in house-to-house fighting. Her 45-minute talk with Abadi took place at a government palace in the capital, preceded by a full ceremonial welcome. As she arrived, Abadi thanked her for Britain’s support: “Her visit is proof of the United Kingdom’s support in the fight against Daesh.” In Saudi Arabia, May was due to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has recently cemented his hold on power with the arrest of a number of princes and other wealthy Saudis for alleged corruption. The talks will focus on Yemen, where Saudi Arabia is accused of complicity in mass human rights abuses amid a three-year civil war. An already critical humanitarian position has worsened since a blockade halted vital aid supplies. Speaking in Iraq, May said she planned to “give a very clear message to Saudi Arabia” that the port of Hodeida must be allowed to reopen to humanitarian supplies. She told BBC News: “I am very concerned about the humanitarian crisis that has developed in Yemen, particularly most recently. “That is why one strong message I will be giving to Saudi Arabia tonight is that we want to see Hodeida port opened for humanitarian and commercial access, that is important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/nov/29/kevin-spacey-christopher-plummer-all-the-money-in-the-world-trailer","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T16:49:04Z","webTitle":"Kevin Spacey replaced by Christopher Plummer in trailer for All the Money in the World","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/29/kevin-spacey-christopher-plummer-all-the-money-in-the-world-trailer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/nov/29/kevin-spacey-christopher-plummer-all-the-money-in-the-world-trailer","fields":{"headline":"Kevin Spacey replaced by Christopher Plummer in trailer for All the Money in the World","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A new trailer for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World has offered up a first glimpse of Christopher Plummer as billionaire John Paul Getty, following the replacement of Kevin Spacey in the role. Scott made the decision earlier this month to remove Spacey from the crime drama and replace him with Plummer, after Spacey was accused of multiple instances of sexual misconduct. Despite principal photography for the film having concluded in August, scenes featuring Spacey were reshot at short notice, in order for it to be completed in time for its scheduled US release date of 22 December. The reshoots are said to have cost around $10m, a significant addition to the film’s original $40m budget. All the Money in the World tells the true story of the kidnapping of Getty’s grandson John Paul Getty III in 1973, and the billionaire’s refusal to pay the ransom. The film stars Michelle Williams as Getty III’s mother Gail Harris and Mark Wahlberg as Fletcher Chase, the former CIA operative who tried to persuade Getty Sr to co-operate with the kidnappers’ demands. Both Wahlberg and Williams are thought to have been involved in the reshoots. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Scott said that he made the decision to remove Spacey as soon as he first heard the allegations made against the actor. “I sat and thought about it and realised, we cannot. You can’t tolerate any kind of behaviour like that,” the director said. “And it will affect the film. We cannot let one person’s action affect the good work of all these other people. It’s that simple.” Police in London are believed to be investigating two claims of sexual assault made against Spacey, who has been accused of misconduct by a number of men. Earlier this week, the Old Vic theatre, which employed Spacey as its artistic director between the years 2004 and 2015, said it had been contacted by 56 people about Spacey, and received 20 allegations of inappropriate conduct. The theatre apologised “wholeheartedly” for failing to create an environment in which people could raise concerns about Spacey’s behaviour. A statement released by Spacey’s former spokeswoman said he was “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment”. All the Money in the World is not the only production to have cut ties with Spacey. Last month, Netflix said that it would not release a film in which the actor played Gore Vidal, and had also dropped him from the sixth and final season of its popular drama House of Cards. All the Money in the World is scheduled for release in the UK on 5 January 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/nov/29/eli-manningnew-york-giants-benching-nfl","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T14:13:42Z","webTitle":"Eli Manning's messy downfall a symbol of turbulent times for Giants and NFL","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/29/eli-manningnew-york-giants-benching-nfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/29/eli-manningnew-york-giants-benching-nfl","fields":{"headline":"Eli Manning's messy downfall a symbol of turbulent times for Giants and NFL","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This wasn’t how it was supposed to end for Eli Manning. Unceremoniously benched on a Tuesday afternoon in late November after 14 years with the Giants. There’s no good or “ceremonious” way to be benched, of course. Eli’s older brother Peyton’s career concluded in storybook fashion as a Super Bowl champion and that kind of ending was not on the cards for Eli with a Giants team that at 2-9 is nowhere near being a contender any time soon. But Eli’s Giants career definitely wasn’t supposed to end like this, cast aside by a failed head coach who will almost certainly be fired at season’s end, and replaced by a quarterback who washed out three years ago with the Jets, the Giants’ dopey little brother. The Eli to their Peyton, if you want to be especially cruel. This is not how anyone saw it ending, though, even those who saw it ending more than two months ago. A trade to Tom Coughlin and the Jaguars so Eli could make one more Super Bowl run would have been better than this. Even a minor injury that pushed him out of the lineup would have been better. But this – kicked aside for Geno Smith, absolutely no one’s idea of the future for the Giants – was not in the script and the surprise and disappointment was evident when Manning addressed the media on Tuesday afternoon. It is over, though. After 14 years, two Super Bowl championships and 210 consecutive starts, Eli Manning will watch from the sideline on Sunday while Smith and Webb Davis take on the Raiders to kick off the final five games and the last chapter of Ben McAdoo’s pathetic tenure as head coach. The Jets had Rich Kotite two decades ago and now the Giants have their own in McAdoo, a man flailing wildly down the stretch towards a 2-14 season, making a move that has been almost universally panned. “This is so much bigger than Eli Manning,” said Kurt Warner, the man who Eli replaced in New York, on NFL Network. “This is about an entire organization that has gone sideways.” “Surprised is no the word. My sentiments are totally with Eli Manning,” Coughlin told WJXL-AM in Jacksonville, Florida. “I love the kid. He’s a class act. I know it’s a disappointing year, but my thoughts are strictly with Eli. I’m very upset when I heard that.” Even actor Kate Mara, neice of team owner John Mara, shared her thoughts: A fitting tweet for sure, but when discussing the 2017 New York Giants, the go-to emoji should always be poop. Because whatever Eli’s contributions are to getting the Giants to the depths of 2-9 – and accuracy issues, inconsistency and baffling decision-making have always been part of his package – absolutely no quarterback alive was going to have much success in an offense when the top weapons are Sterling Shepard, Roger Lewis, Orleans Darkwa and a rookie tight end. Not Smith, not Peyton Manning, not even Eli’s Super Bowl plaything Tom Brady. With Eli’s Giants career, and possibly NFL career, at a close, a full-on debate has already broken out about his Hall of Fame credentials. Whether he will make the Hall or whether he should make the Hall are two different questions. Only the biggest Eli fanboy would claim that he has consistently been a top-five quarterback throughout his career. Brady, Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees have always been clearly ahead of him, while fellow 2004 draft class member Ben Roethlisberger is his equal in championships and his better in most every meaningful statistic. Yet Manning is seventh all-time in the NFL in passing yards with 50,629 yards and seventh all-time in passing touchdowns. Those facts, and the two Super Bowl rings, will likely get him into the Hall. Playing his entire career in the New York media spotlight helps, too. That said, Phil Simms was also a big-name Giants quarterback with two Super Bowl rings and yet he still hasn’t made it to Canton. But that debate can be had five years after Eli’s career ends – so possibly five years from today. For now, the Giants are a disaster and the NFL loses another big name and familiar face. In fact, maybe its most familiar and entertaining face. Eli Face. This season the NFL has lost Rodgers, Odell Beckham, JJ Watt, DeShaun Watson and David Johnson to injury, and Ezekiel Elliott to suspension. It’s a who’s who of people who the casual fan has heard of. And now Eli is gone, too, not long after his brother – probably the biggest modern football star of all – exited the scene. The reasons for the drop in NFL TV ratings are complex, but losing so many prominent players surely hasn’t helped. The masses weren’t tuning in to watch Manning and his awful 2-9 Giants play out the string. But Manning is a well-known name from football’s most prominent family. His constant presence served as comfort food for NFL fans. The NFL has its share of problems, and now add to it the sudden exit of the Mannings, the sport’s official family. It’s hard as a football fan to not feel a little sad and shocked and confused about that. It’s hard to face today with anything other than an Eli Face."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/29/i-benefitted-social-mobility-still-feel-permanent-outsider","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T14:56:39Z","webTitle":"I benefited from social mobility – and I still feel like a permanent outsider | Rebecca Nicholson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/29/i-benefitted-social-mobility-still-feel-permanent-outsider","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/29/i-benefitted-social-mobility-still-feel-permanent-outsider","fields":{"headline":"I benefited from social mobility – and I still feel like a permanent outsider","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A few years ago, I interviewed Nicola Roberts, the best member of Girls Aloud, to talk about her underrated debut solo album Cinderella’s Eyes. She discussed what it was like to be on Popstars: The Rivals, the TV singing competition that predated The X Factor and gave birth to the band. What stood out most to me was how it felt for her to ricochet between two worlds. She was 16 and split her time between TV studios in London, and hanging out at the chippie in her home town of Runcorn. She remembered being taken to a fancy dinner at an expensive restaurant where none of the girls could understand the menu. She had to ask the head of Universal Records: “What the fuck’s coriander?” It doesn’t take much to get me on to Girls Aloud, but I thought of that particular anecdote when I saw the State of the Nation report by the Social Mobility Commission this week. Its findings are a sobering confirmation of what is apparent to anyone whose world is not centred on London or the slim area surrounding it. Social divisions are deeply entrenched in British society, and social mobility, this notion that you can be born “disadvantaged” and step outside of such circumstances given the right opportunities, increasingly looks about as achievable as the UK’s chances of walking away from the EU without self-destructing in the process. Alienation and resentment are growing, and for rural, coastal and formerly industrial areas in particular, the outlook is grim. In some ways, the urgency of the report and its insistence on a “new level of effort”, its assertion that “tinkering around the edges will not do the trick”, should be a cause for optimism, if not a clear call to action. But it left me feeling certain of the idea that Britain’s relationship with class is as rigid and immovable as it ever was. I have some experience of what social mobility feels like, and it’s a complicated road to travel, filled with “what the fuck’s coriander?” moments and a constant sense of performance anxiety: as with wealth, opportunities and privilege are almost entirely hereditary, and passed on from one generation to the next. To come to them suddenly means that you are expected to learn a new set of rules and a new way of being, and the pressure of fitting in to that can be exhausting. I was born into a working-class family in north Lincolnshire, an area of the UK that, according to the Social Mobility Commission’s map, is a concentration of what it calls “cold spots”. The report ranks 324 local authorities in order of their chances of social mobility; where I grew up, the areas range from 165th on the list to 309th (17 of the top 20 are in London). I was the first in my family to get A-levels, and then the first to go to university. A scheme set up with the explicit aim of improving social mobility directly changed the course of my life: the Sutton Trust paid for me to attend a summer school in Oxford to get some experience of what university life was like. In that sense, it actively replicated hereditary privilege and stood in for what might have been passed down to me by relatives, say, if university had been a family tradition. Largely as a result of this scheme, I went to university, to Oxford, where I learned that one of the key markers of the class divide is confidence – if you’re born into an advantaged background, confidence practically comes home with you from the hospital; otherwise, you have to learn it as carefully as you would a musical instrument. As a result of that education, my life is now middle class by most standards, though if you’ve been socially mobile, the question of identity is perpetually tricky: are you the class in which you were born, or the one you’ve become? Moving around makes you a permanent outsider, even if you’ve learned the rules. Nothing quite fits right. You’ll see again and again that the class system is not built for people to question, or bend. From the food you know to the accent you have to the holidays you’re familiar with, it’s all different, whether barely perceptible or glaringly obvious. I remember having to teach people at university that gravy went on chips. You are constantly reading the menu and asking, what the fuck’s coriander? When Theresa May became prime minister in 2016, her speech promised to usher in a new age of social mobility, and a levelling of the playing field. “When it comes to opportunity, we won’t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few. We will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you,” she said. But letting the odd person pull themselves up by their “talents” – bootstraps, by any other name – is not only insufficient and inadequate, it’s insulting to those who, for whatever reason, simply don’t have access to the opportunities. Instead, her government’s austerity-driven policies may have slammed the door closed for generations. The Social Mobility Commission’s latest report should serve as a rude awakening. Privilege deepens like a coastal shelf, and a fantasy of meritocracy, always just out of reach, isn’t nearly enough to paper over the cracks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/05/jake-shears-scissor-sisters-cher-dolly-parton","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T09:00:12Z","webTitle":"Jake Shears: ‘I just found out I’m related to Dolly Parton!’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/05/jake-shears-scissor-sisters-cher-dolly-parton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/05/jake-shears-scissor-sisters-cher-dolly-parton","fields":{"headline":"Jake Shears: ‘I just found out I’m related to Dolly Parton!’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jake Shears is hungover. The night before our interview in the bar of a fancy west London hotel, the former frontman of the multi-million-selling glam-pop practitioners Scissor Sisters, performed his first UK solo show at nightclub Heaven. He stayed up until 3am, knocking out renditions of his former band’s hits at a piano bar he can’t remember the name of with some friends he’d probably struggle to pick out of a lineup. It’s 4pm now but his eyes suggest he’s not been up long. “I’ll have a Negroni with vodka, please,” he says to the waiter with a smile. The previous night’s show was in support of new single Creep City, a 70s-inspired rock stomp and taster of his solo debut album next year. It marks his first proper release – beyond the occasional collaboration – since Magic Hour, the last Scissor Sisters record before their amicable split in 2012. The as-yet-untitled album was recorded in New Orleans and Kentucky, which might explain today’s outfit choice of puffed gilet, plaid shirt and trucker cap. “I’ve come dressed as Kentucky!” he snorts. It’s also an album he didn’t think he’d ever make. He originally worried that releasing a solo album would be “cheesy”. So what changed? “What did change?” he asks, following a pause so long I fear he’s asleep. “I think I stopped worrying. I decided to just be me.” Before that realisation, though, Shears had to readjust to post-band life. After Scissor Sisters parted ways, Shears moved from New York to Los Angeles. “I felt lost. There were a couple of years where I don’t know what happened.” During one particularly lonely night he was rescued by Cher. “I was scrolling through Twitter – I only follow a thousand people – and I stopped at one of Cher’s all-caps tweets and it said: “JAKE, I’VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR YOUR NUMBER, PLEASE GET HOLD OF ME’. It was so random I even saw the thing – she didn’t @ me in it.” Two days later, he was recording their almost illegally camp 2013 duet Take It Like a Man with her in Malibu. Following his collaborations with both Cher and Kylie Minogue (on 2004’s exquisite I Believe in You) we discuss whether or not he’s reached gay pop nirvana, before Shears drops a bombshell. “I just found out I’m related to Dolly Parton!” he honks, suddenly lurching forward in his chair. It turns out his cousin is a fan of family trees and uncovered they share a distant grandfather from the 1800s. “Isn’t that amazing?” Shears’s artistic existence wasn’t always so glamorous, however. In 1999, at the age of 21, he moved to New York from Seattle. To make ends meet he waited tables, wrote for Paper magazine and was a go-go dancer at a gay strip bar called IC Guys. “I wanted to perform,” he remembers. “I also wanted to go to Europe so I needed money. I had shoeboxes under my bed that I’d fill up with all my stripper cash. It was great.” Eventually, however, he got bored (“I was like: ‘Should I be a singing go-go dancer?’”), choosing to focus on the music project – originally named Dead Lesbian, later Scissor Sisters – he’d started with Scott “Babydaddy” Hoffman. “It was a week after 9/11 and we just decided to perform these silly songs we’d been working on. I came out in a kimono, super stupid, and people loved it.” That was Scissor Sisters’s MO: big, smile-inducing performances of smile-inducing songs that felt universal. Having acquired some more members and some better songs, including the bouncy Laura, the band steamrollered their way to success. Their self-titled debut in 2004 – which finished ahead of Keane’s MOR Hopes &amp; Fears as that year’s biggest-selling album in the UK – was like a vomit of rainbow-coloured glitter across beige-pop’s boringness. It was followed by Ta-Dah and the UK No 1 single I Don’t Feel Like Dancin’, which sounded like Leo Sayer and was a massive cry for help. “The pressure was so hard,” he says. “I suddenly had all these major responsibilities, with people counting on me from all sides.” Worried the band were becoming a caricature, Shears swapped the camp, more straight-friendly eccentricity of the first two albums for 2010’s sweaty, Berlin-inspired Night Work (by this point they’d given up on breaking their more conservative homeland, with their debut banned by supermarket chain Walmart for featuring “a snarling, swaggering attack on conservatism” in the shape of song Tits on the Radio). For its cover, Shears used a Robert Mapplethorpe photo: a closeup of dancer Peter Reed’s clenched buttocks that friend Elton John suggested they avoid. “He was supportive but he knew it was going to make it harder for us,” says Shears. “But the great place to reach is where you don’t care.” New perspectives and Parton family reunions aside, 2018 is going to be a busy year for Shears. As well as the album, he’ll star in Kinky Boots on Broadway and has just finished his memoir. “I didn’t want to write it with my parents still on this earth because I’d feel so bad with my mum reading it,” he explains. “But I did it anyway. It’s not graphic, but it definitely spills some tea.” Despite his fuzzy head, he seems ludicrously happy. “I think this could be a special record for a lot of people,” he smiles. “It’s the closest to the first Scissors album in a way; I haven’t had to filter it through anyone else.” He orders a celebratory rosé. “I call the shots now.” Creep City is out now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/03/clive-myrie-bbc-should-be-treasured-interview-bbc-yemen","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T09:00:37Z","webTitle":"Clive Myrie: ‘You can always do more to increase diversity’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/03/clive-myrie-bbc-should-be-treasured-interview-bbc-yemen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/03/clive-myrie-bbc-should-be-treasured-interview-bbc-yemen","fields":{"headline":"Clive Myrie: ‘You can always do more to increase diversity’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Born in Bolton, Lancashire, in 1964, Clive Myrie has worked for the BBC as a news presenter and an award-winning foreign correspondent for more than 30 years. His career has taken him to war zones in Croatia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. Most recently, his reports from Bangladesh and Yemen on News at Ten have made harrowing viewing. His account of the desperate flight from Myanmar of more than half-a-million Rohingya Muslims showed the refugee crisis morphing into a full-blown humanitarian disaster. A few weeks later, his rare, shocking footage from inside war-torn Yemen revealed an abandoned people on the brink of starvation and despair. You have reported from some of the world’s most troubled regions; what is your perspective on the situation in Myanmar and Yemen? What struck me, particularly with Yemen, was this sense that there is no one out there with any influence who actually cares. At least the Rohingya are being given safe haven by the people across the border in Bangladesh. In Yemen, that is not the case. The borders are sealed, the air space is under the control of Saudi Arabia, you can’t escape. You have people trying to escape to Somalia: that’s how bad it is. What should the international community be doing? It feels to me that Saudi Arabia is being allowed to prosecute the war in this way because of the perceived threat from Iran. One can understand the Saudis responding to the attack on Riyadh airport by closing down the airspace but that in turn prevents aid getting into Yemen, which affects millions of people. There have been various attempts to bring both sides together but there seems to be no real determination to get talks off the ground again. A diplomatic track needs to be much more vigorously pursued. It feels as though the world is turning away and millions of civilians are being left in the middle, trapped. What’s the hardest aspect for you of reporting on these desperate situations? Is it the children? It’s seeing people who are suffering, whether children or adults, and having this sense that no one is bothering to do anything about it. Obviously, if you see a malnourished child in an intensive-care ward struggling to breathe, it’s horrific. But when you know help is on the way you can deal with it. I was walking along one day at a refugee camp and saw a little girl at the side of the road. She had her little brother with her who was limp and floppy, almost dead. We managed to get them to the Unicef hospital. He was terribly malnourished, but within four or five days, after a dose of Plumpy’Nut [a high-protein peanut-based paste for treatment of acute malnutrition], he was absolutely fine. What I find most heartbreaking is when there is no one to help these children in time. Is it hard, when you get home, to get places like Yemen and its people out of your head? The images stay with you. One piece we did from Yemen featured a girl I will never forget. She was no more than eight or nine. She was in a beautiful long blue dress, as though she had put on her very best clothes for some reason. Nicky, the cameraman, panned down from her face to her feet and we saw she only had one leg and she didn’t have a prosthetic. A shell from an airstrike had blown her leg off. That image, probably of all of them, stands out the most for me. You weren’t drawn into the recent controversy over BBC presenters’ pay because you didn’t feature on the list of highest paid. What’s your view? As far as I am concerned, the salary that I get is way above what your average teacher or doctor or nurse or policeman – someone doing a proper job, frankly – would get. So I am happy where I am. Certain other people get more – well, good luck to them. So you think it’s a storm in a teacup? No, because public sector workers have had just a 1% pay rise for several years now and when they see some of the salaries at the BBC, which is publicly funded, there can be a lot of anger. I understand that. You’ve worked at the BBC for pretty much your whole career. Do you feel loyal to the corporation? Yeah, I do, actually. I think it is an organisation with its heart in the right place absolutely 100% and I defend it to the hilt. It makes mistakes, like any other organisation, but it should be treasured because of what it brings to people’s everyday lives. I don’t think enough people appreciate that. They will miss us when we’re gone. You grew up in Bolton in the 1960s and 70s. Where has your accent gone? When I joined the BBC in 1986, the only northern voice you heard was Andy Kershaw. At Sussex University, I was surrounded by people from the home counties, so my flat vowels got elongated because it felt as if that was what I needed to do. Now, of course, the flatter my vowels, the better off I would probably be. But those were very different days. How did you get interested in news and current affairs? By watching Trevor McDonald on television when I was a small boy. Here was this guy who looked like me, on the TV, travelling the world and looking like he was having a really interesting time. I thought, maybe I could do that. The only other times you saw black people on the television would be on the news when there was something horrific happening in Africa or some crime story. Or in shows like The Black and White Minstrel Show. How much have things changed as far as black presenters are concerned since Sir Trevor was on the screen? They’re a lot better. There are far more positive role models out there who can signal to a young viewer that this could be a career for them. But in news broadcasting there are a limited number of slots out front, so it is always going to be difficult to break in, as much for a white, working-class person as for a black person. Could broadcasters do more to increase diversity? You can always do more and this idea that managers and bosses tend to recruit in their own image is something I know is being looked at very closely by the BBC, ITN and Channel 4. You’ve worked all over the world. Which posting do you have the fondest memories of? Being based in Los Angeles during the Clinton years. The USA, pre-9/11, was a much more carefree place and the Clinton White House was incredible to cover. Because I was based in Los Angeles, I wasn’t just covering hard news; I covered Central America, hurricanes in Honduras, the Oscars, three times, so there was a breadth of story-telling. Strangely enough, I would say America is the most alien place I have ever reported from. I think we have far more in common with northern Europeans than we will ever have with Americans. What’s the most memorable moment from your life in broadcasting? The victory of Barack Obama in the 2008 US elections. I was covering the story from Morehouse College in Georgia. It’s where Martin Luther King studied, Samuel L Jackson, Spike Lee – they all went there. Everyone around me was in tears and I remember saying, before handing back to David Dimbleby in London: “I have to tell you, it’s a privilege for me to be here at this particular moment in time”; as soon as I said that, I thought: “Damn, I’ve crossed the line. This is the BBC and I’ve become too emotional.” Then I turned around to see the ABC News reporter Steve Osunsami in tears live on air. So I thought: “I haven’t crossed any line at all.” How and where did you learn to love classical music and opera? During my schooldays at Haywood Grammar School in Bolton. We had a fantastic music department. I played violin and trumpet and our school orchestra went on these great tours and even made records as The Bolton Sound. It gave me a lifelong appreciation of classical music and opera. I go to Verona Opera Festival every year with my wife and a group of friends. It’s always a joy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/01/kidney-disease-patients-should-keep-taking-their-medicines","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T18:56:22Z","webTitle":"Kidney disease patients should keep taking their medicines | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/01/kidney-disease-patients-should-keep-taking-their-medicines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/01/kidney-disease-patients-should-keep-taking-their-medicines","fields":{"headline":"Kidney disease patients should keep taking their medicines","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We are concerned that the headline on your article (Kidney drug ‘may do more harm than good’, say experts, 25 November) is misleading and could result in kidney patients stopping taking their medicines. When your kidneys do not work properly, dangerous levels of chemicals like potassium or phosphate can build up in your body. People who have kidney disease are usually given dietary advice as to how to help restrict their intake alongside medicines that bind these chemicals so that they can be excreted; and there is clear evidence that phosphate binders reduce levels of phosphate. Diet alone is not usually enough to reduce these levels, so medicines to help do this are important as without them levels could become too high and result in an increased chance of death. Nobody should stop taking their medicines after reading this article. If any of your readers are concerned then they need to speak to their doctor about the best ways to reduce phosphate in their diet in combination with taking the right phosphate binder for them and if they should swap to a calcium-free version. Undoubtedly more research is required because evidence in this area is changing all the time and what patients need is clear, simple guidance that they know they can trust – not misleading and potentially dangerous headlines.

Alan Pardew and West Brom got there first. In any case, there’s no point making a big deal over it, he’ll have resigned by Christmas if the last couple of years are anything to go by. “Sam Allardyce will be at Finch Farm this afternoon to finalise terms on becoming the new manager of Everton,” blathered a club suit. PEPE, ALAN, TONY, ALAN During the 70s and 80s, West Bromwich Albion employed a series of managers whose first names fairly tripped off the tongue. Listing out loud the monikers bestowed upon Mr Giles, Allen, Wile, Atkinson, Allen, Wylie, Giles (again), Stiles, Saunders and Atkinson (again) guaranteed the speaker a whole world of tongue-twisting fun: Johnny, Ronnie, John, Ron, Ronnie, Ron, Johnny, Nobby, Ron, Ron. Hoo hoo! In fact, if you rattled them off quickly enough, folk would often wonder whether you’d just broken into song. Specifically the a cappella breakdown towards the climax of Chas and Dave’s 1980 hit platter Rabbit. Hey kids, mock The Fiver if you must, but back in the day you had to make your own entertainment. Despite the Baggies going on to employ two Brians and a Bryan, plus a Ray, Rob, Roberto and Roy, sequential sobriquet-based hi-jinks have been thin on the ground in recent years. Nothing’s ever quite come off: there’s always been a Gary, Denis or Osvaldo getting in the way, mauling the metre, ruining the riff. So hats off to the West Brom board for attempting to get some mouth music going again by naming Alan Pardew as the successor to Tony Pulis. It’s just a shame about the Alan Irvine interregnum between Pulis and Pepe Mel, or they’d already be well on the way to completing the first bar of a new P-ditty. Whether this is the sole reason Pardew got the gig is open to conjecture and interpretation. Could there really be any other? It’s certainly the case that chairman John Williams also happens to think Pardew – West Brom’s second Alan in three years, and fourth full-time Alan in history, perhaps they can make something out of that, too – will end a winless run stretching back to the second week of the season. “Alan brings the experience of more than 300 Premier League games and the kind of dynamic leadership from which our club can benefit,” he said, with Pardew adding that he’s “thrilled with the opportunity … to work with what I consider to be a talented group of players.” So there is that. But whatever the reason, The Fiver wishes Pardew well. And fervently hopes he’ll one day be succeeded in appropriate fashion. By Claude Puel, perhaps. Or Phil Parkinson. Or Guardiola, Pep. Anyone like that would do.

QUOTE OF THE DAY “I think it’s fantastic for Conner as a player to play in the first team and credit should be given to the manager for taking the chance on youth, as it doesn’t always happen at other clubs. He’s tall, brave and dedicated to training and works very hard with the coaches. The physical side has to be managed, but the flip-side is that the game is not as physical as it maybe was 20 or 30 years ago, when goalkeepers got clattered. He’s also marshalled by experienced players who will look after him” – the head of Glenavon’s academy, Ryan Prentince, waxes lyrical about goalkeeper Conner Byrne, who made his first-team debut in the Mid-Ulster Cup win over Portadown aged 14, yes that’s F-O-U-R-T-E-E-N.

More than 19,000 under-18s applied to join the army between January, when the glossy This Is Belonging campaign began, and October. Of these just over 500 have begun training. The campaign attracted criticism when the Guardian revealed it was designed to attract young people from working-class backgrounds, despite defence chiefs insisting that they do not specifically target deprived areas. New figures obtained by the charity Child Soldiers International reveal that more than 19,041 16- and 17-year-olds applied to join the army after the launch of the advert – an average of about 9,500 per year group. In comparison, almost 49,000 18- to 24-year-olds applied, an average of about 7,000 for each year group. No comparison figures for previous years were immediately available. The charity said it was concerned that the campaign had appealed to some of the youngest possible recruits. Rachel Taylor, the charity’s director of programmes, said the army wanted young people to sign up because they were “more psychologically malleable”. “They are more likely to submit unquestioningly to what they are told to do. They are in the process of forming their adult identity. Some veterans say the army wants people in that age group because they can be psychologically and emotionally manipulated into unquestioning loyalty. This is an age group that shouldn’t be targeted because of those psychological vulnerabilities,” she said. “When they leave the armed forces they have no civilian identity to go back to, which makes reintegration very difficult. People who are older when they join up have a much greater sense of self. They can go through that very intense armed forces experience but when it’s time to leave they have something else to go home to.” A total of 92,000 people across all age groups applied to the army between January and October. Taylor said this showed that in fact there was no need to recruit the youngest applicants at all. “You could take out the under-18s and still have 70,000 applicants.” The campaign includes beautifully produced 30-second films showing fictional scenes of young soldiers in various training and combat situations helping and supporting each other, facing difficult challenges with camaraderie and good humour. The films were disseminated via social media, television and cinema. A briefing campaign document seen by the Guardian in the summer spelled out that the key audience was 16- to 24-year-old “C2DEs” – marketing speak for the lowest three social and economic groups. The document also made it clear that while the campaign was UK-wide, there were “up-weights” to cities in northern England including Manchester and Sheffield, and to Birmingham, Belfast and Cardiff. Under-18s make up about a quarter of the total untrained intake. The Ministry of Defence argues that soldiers who are under 18 are not deployed on operations that would expose them to hostilities and can choose to leave the army up to their 18th birthdays. It also insists it aims to attract recruits from across the UK and works hard at recruiting a diverse workforce that reflects all of society. On the This Is Belonging campaign, an MoD spokesperson said: “This is a national recruitment campaign designed to reach a broad audience, helping to achieve an armed forces which represents the people they serve.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/live/2017/nov/30/nhs-leaders-meet-to-discuss-cutting-services-amid-funding-gap-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T17:35:42Z","webTitle":"Row breaks out as Jeremy Hunt says NHS must stick to targets - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/live/2017/nov/30/nhs-leaders-meet-to-discuss-cutting-services-amid-funding-gap-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/live/2017/nov/30/nhs-leaders-meet-to-discuss-cutting-services-amid-funding-gap-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Row breaks out as Jeremy Hunt says NHS must stick to targets - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Thanks for following the blog today and all your comments. Here is a summary of the day’s events. Jeremy Hunt has said NHS England (NHSE) must still strive to meet the waiting time targets in its constitution after its leaders said they could not be met, placing him at loggerheads with health service bosses. Earlier, NHSE bosses said waiting times standards would be neither fully funded nor met next year, at a meeting to discuss their response to the budget settlement. Chief executive Simon Stevens had asked for £4bn for the health service in 2018/19 but was granted only £1.6bn. Labour, Lib Dems and health experts claimed the move, which they said was a consequence of government underfunding, would lead to long waits for routine operations like hip and knee replacements. NHSE also warned that guidelines from the health regulator, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, on new drugs and treatments may not be implemented in future unless “they are accompanied by a clear and agreed affordability and workforce assessment at the time they are drawn up”. The decision to protect planned investment in mental health care was welcomed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) and Mind. However, the RCPsych said a longer-term spending commitment was needed. NHSE chief executive Simon Stevens said as well as mental health services, planned investment in primary care and cancer services would also be protected. Three heart surgery units have be saved from closure, after NHSE made a U-turn on their future. Units at the Royal Brompton in London, in Leicester and Newcastle had been earmarked for closure as part of plans to consolidate services offering specialist surgery and care for congenital heart disease patients. The decision to keep them open comes after years of campaigning. One, in Manchester, will still close and be consolidated with services offered in Liverpool. The board recommended that low value treatments, including fish oil, herbal remedies and homeopathy no longer be provided on the NHS. It said it would save the health service hundreds of millions of pounds a year and also free up millions of GP appointments currently taken up with prescribing such medicines. And with that rejection of what the NHS bosses said that morning, the conference ends not on a note of harmony between health service leaders and politicians, as King’s Fund chief executive Chris Ham earlier said was needed, but with Jeremy Hunt and the NHS board at loggerheads. A Press Association reporter has asked Hunt about the NHS England board meeting earlier and the fact that health service leaders said that waiting time targets would have to be abandoned next year (which Labour suggested the NHS had been pushed into through insufficient funding but might not be legal under its constitution). In response the health secretary, reaffirmed his commitment to the constitution and the established targets. Earlier, NHS England was highlighting its productivity increases of 1.7% a year, much better than the wider economy, warning that there was only so much more - if any more at all staff could do. Hunt is pointing out where he things the NHS can do better: He moves on to safety: He suggests that money is not the most important thing holding the NHS back but staffing levels, although many would argue the two are inextricably linked: Hunt is defending the performance of the NHS (and by definition the government) in the face of increasing demand: The health secretary is about to begin. Chris Ham, chief Executive of the King’s Fund, where Jeremy Hunt will shortly be speaking, said in response to events earlier today, imploring NHS leaders and politicians to work together: Today’s NHS England Board meeting is welcome recognition that we need to begin a discussion with the public about what the NHS can be expected to provide with the funds it has been given. The NHS must play its part by continuing to seek and deliver improvements in efficiency but these will not be sufficient to bridge the funding gap. Politicians and NHS leaders need to find common cause in engaging with the public and avoid adopting adversarial positions which will undermine public confidence in their stewardship of the NHS. We’re about 20 minutes away from the health secretary’s speech. While we wait, doctors’ union, the British Medical Association (BMA), has added its voice to those expressing concern at the impact of underfunding. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said: “It is deeply worrying that the body with responsibility for running the NHS is warning of the service’s inability to meet national standards of care. Unfortunately, it is patients who are unfairly suffering the consequences of a clearly underfunded service. Waiting time targets for hospital care haven’t been met for years and patients face growing delays to see their GP as general practice struggles to cope with demand. “Doctors always want to deliver the best possible care for our patients, but we can’t continuously plug gaps by penny pinching and poaching from elsewhere in an overstretched service. Ministers must listen to the warnings of doctors, and to the NHS’ own leaders, and take urgent steps to put the NHS on a sustainable footing.” I’m going to put the blog on hold now until 4.50pm when Jeremy Hunt is giving a speech at the King’s Fund annual conference, in which he will have the chance to respond to what NHS England leaders said this morning. In the meantime, you can read the news story by my colleague, Denis Campbell, on today’s developments so far: Unite, which has 100,000 members in the NHS has complained bitterly about the impact of government funding on its members. The union’s head of health, Sarah Carpenter, said: We should not have to be juggling, as the world’s sixth largest economy, between lengthening waiting lists or whether to direct resources to A&amp;E departments. Staff morale is on the ropes as they are asked to do more with fewer resources – and there is only so much extra that you can ask dedicated professionals to do. ‘Recruitment and retention’ is now a major problem for NHS trusts. The pay austerity that NHS staff have endured since 2010 needs to be addressed and, as yet, it is not clear how this will play out. The next stage after the budget announcement is for the NHS unions to explore what this actually means and what such a deal could look like. Philip Hammond’s budget has not solved the cash crisis facing the NHS – the same set of stark challenges still remain and they need to be tackled urgently. The Royal College of Surgeons, in this case jointly with the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery, has also responded to the reconfiguration of congenital heart disease services in England, announced at this morning’s meeting, bemoaning how long it took to happen. Services at the Royal Brompton in London, and in Leicester and Newcastle, which have been under threat for some time won a reprieve but a heart surgery unit in Manchester will close. In a joint statement, the college and society said: These changes should have happened decades ago. The endless delays to a decision being made on this reconfiguration has caused great uncertainty to all of the hospitals involved, their staff and the children they care for. Currently, some smaller teams are very stretched in their ability to provide a comprehensive 24/7 service and to develop sustainably. It is fundamentally important that specialist surgical centres are large enough and treat patients regularly enough to develop full expertise to treat all conditions. It is vital that centres have adequate resources to support patients with increasingly complex needs, especially access to paediatric intensive care beds.” It’s vital centres are properly staffed to provide on-call rotas and teams have the time to create a supportive environment where new techniques are shared and future specialists can learn. Reacting to this morning’s meeting and the admission that waiting time targets cannot be funded or met, the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) has said that delaying treatment is a false economy RCS president Prof Derek Alderson said: While last week’s Budget increase for NHS funding was welcome, NHS England’s analysis is clear that it is still insufficient to help meet the current needs of patients within existing targets. It is disappointing that the progress the whole NHS has made over the last decade on planned waiting times, such as for heart and brain surgery, now risks being lost. We accept that difficult decisions will need to be made but we believe more of the money released by the government should be targeted at waiting times in the NHS before they deteriorate further. Rationing and delaying surgical treatment are false economies. For example, current commissioning group policies designed to delay surgical access for obese patients and smokers only defers treatment and potentially adds costs through increased use of painkillers, physiotherapy, and welfare support for out-of-work patients. The RCS does not accept that such policies either save money or help patients. We are prepared to continue working with the NHS to determine where genuine savings can be made where the evidence proves intervention does not benefit patient care. Such options have not yet been exhausted. The public part of the meeting has concluded so here’s a summary of what happened and what is still to happen (namely Jeremy Hunt’s response): Waiting times standards will not be fully funded and met next year, NHS England (NHSE) has said, at a meeting to discuss its response to the budget settlement. Chief executive Simon Stevens had asked for £4bn for the health service in 2018/19 but was granted only £1.6bn. Labour, Lib Dems and health experts said this was a consequence of underfunding by the Conservative government and would lead to long waits for routine operations like hip and knee replacements. NHSE also warned that guidelines from the health regulator, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, may not be implemented in future unless “they are accompanied by a clear and agreed affordability and workforce assessment at the time they are drawn up”. The decision to protect planned investment in mental health care was welcomed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) and Mind. However, the RCPsych said a longer-term spending commitment was needed. NHSE chief executive Simon Stevens said as well as mental health services, planned investment in primary care and cancer services would also be protected. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will have a chance to respond to NHSE’s plans for next year when he gives a speech at the King’s Fund health charity this afternoon. Three heart surgery units have be saved from closure, after NHSE made a U-turn on their future. Units at the Royal Brompton in London, in Leicester and Newcastle had been earmarked for closure as part of plans to consolidate services offering specialist surgery and care for congenital heart disease patients. The decision to keep them open comes after years of campaigning. One, in Manchester, will still close and be consolidated with services offered in Liverpool. The board recommended that low value treatments, including fish oil, herbal remedies and homeopathy no longer be provided on the NHS. It said it would save the health service hundreds of millions of pounds a year and also free up millions of GP appointments currently taken up with prescribing such medicines. Another significant passage in the paper about planning for next year is the suggestion that guidelines from the health regulator, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, may be ignored. The relevant passage says: New advisory Nice guidelines can only expect to be implemented locally across the NHS if in future they are accompanied by a clear and agreed affordability and workforce assessment at the time they are drawn up. NHS England has released more details of the decision taken today to end routine prescription of certain medicines. It says by ending the provision of “low value treatments, including fish oil, herbal remedies and homeopathy” on the NHS, hundreds of millions of pounds will be saved each year. It will also also free up millions of GP appointments that are currently taken up with prescribing these medicines, it says. The treatments the board agreed should no longer be routinely prescribed are (together with the reason for doing so): Homeopathy – no clear or robust evidence to support its use Herbal treatments – no clear or robust evidence to support its use Omega-3 Fatty Acid Compounds (fish oil) – essential fatty acids which can be obtained through diet, low clinical effectiveness Co-proxamol – pain killer which has had its marketing authorisation withdrawn due to safety concerns Rubefacients (excluding topical NSAIDS) – warming muscle rub products, limited evidence Lutein and Antioxidants – used to treat the eye condition age related macular degeneration, low clinical effectiveness Glucosamine and Chondroitin – used for joint pain, low clinical effectiveness Proposals were also presented to stop the routine prescribing of products that: Can be purchased over the counter, and sometimes at a lower cost than that which would be incurred by the NHS – paracetamol is an average of four times as expensive when provided on prescription by the NHS, compared to when it is purchased in pharmacies or supermarkets. It can costs around £34 for 32 on prescription including dispensing and GP consultation fees. Treat a condition that is considered to be self-limiting, so does not need treatment as it will heal/be cured of its own accord, such as a common cold. Treat a condition which could be managed by self-care, i.e. that the person does not need to seek medical care or could visit a pharmacist. Pointing the finger of blame at the Conservatives, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth MP, says effectively abandoning waiting time targets may be illegal. He said: “NHS England’s unprecedented confirmation that NHS constitution waiting times standards ‘will not be fully funded and met next year’ is the direct result of Philip Hammond’s failure to give the NHS the funding it needed in the recent Budget. “Today NHS bosses have effectively conceded that the 18 week target for treatment can’t be met given continued underfunding of the NHS. “This will mean more and more patients waiting longer and longer in pain, discomfort and distress for elective operations. This is the real debilitating impact on patients’ quality of life as a result of Tory austerity. “What’s more, there are serious questions about the legality of effectively abandoning a standard of care enshrined in the NHS constitution. As a matter of urgency Jeremy Hunt must now tell us whether he intends to amend the law and the NHS Constitution through legislation and publicly accept his government’s funding squeeze is jeopardising legally guaranteed standards of patient care.” Readers have been in touch to tell us about their experiences and the concerns they have for the future given the funding gap and their views on the tough decisions which have to be made. A 29-year-old nurse working in Cornwall said she doesn’t think everyone realises quite how bad the situation is. No-one in the NHS wants to ration care when it means putting our patients at risk, but some services are so stretched now that people are already at risk. In the last few weeks I have had genuine fears for the lives of some of my patients in hospital. It is a terrible decision and one I am glad I don’t have to make, but without more funding it’s just not possible to keep going like this. It comes down to would we rather have half a hospital working safely, or a whole hospital working dangerously? It’s very scary. One GP in south-east London said the cuts over the last couple of years have affected the way they care for their patients: I once referred a patient for an urgent appointment and it was made for six months time. Some people can wait a whole year. The situation looks dire. A 50-year-old emergency physician said in their department there are often ill people in corridors and ambulances “queuing up like a serpent’s tail”. One of my colleagues collapsed yesterday from exhaustion and refused to go home as she wanted to carry on working! I worry that unsafe practices will become routine, that we will somehow get ‘used to’ working under such circumstances, and that the morale will break down completely. There has been a more positive response to the decision to protect planned investment on mental health services (and cancer and primary care services). Prof Wendy Burn, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: Mental health patients and staff across the country can breathe a sigh of relief today. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said vital plans to improve mental health services will be kept on track for at least the next financial year. But the promise is to spend an extra £1 billion on frontline mental health services and treat one million more people by 2021 – so we need a commitment to take us beyond 2019. The next step is to make sure that money gets to patients on the front line. We’re very worried that local healthcare commissioners are being allowed to divert cash intended for mental health services to pay for debts elsewhere. Commissioners must be held properly to account for the decisions that they make. And Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, independent chair of the NHS Mental Health Taskforce and chair of the advisory and oversight board for the delivery of the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, said: We are pleased that the NHS has restated its commitments around mental health. The delivery of the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health is essential to bringing mental health services up to a basic standard, to start building the support we have lacked for many, many decades. We know that the NHS has to make difficult decisions at the moment – it is the right choice to invest in mental health because the sooner people who are struggling get the help they need, the more likely it is that they will avoid needing more intensive and expensive support further down the line. The Nuffield Trust has also raised concerns about the extent to which waiting lists will grow next year. Prof John Appleby, the thinktank’s chief economist, said: It is clear from today’s board meeting that the big question emerging from last week’s budget is how far waiting lists for routine operations like hip and knee replacements are allowed to grow in order to preserve and improve other services like A&amp;E and cancer care. With the NHS under severe financial pressure – and, as NHS England acknowledges, already spending money it doesn’t have to keep the show on the road – today’s meeting puts down a clear marker that something will have to give. As we and the other health think tanks have warned, the budget settlement fills around just half of the funding gap for next year. Lots of responses are coming in to the plans for 2018/19. The Lib Dems have homed in on page four of the board paper, which says: NHS constitution waiting times standards, in the round, will not be fully funded and met next year. Additionally, on page four, it says: Factoring in England’s growing and ageing patient population, age-weighted NHS revenue growth per person becomes 0.9% in 2018/19 and -0.4% in 2019/20. The Lib Dems’ former health minister, Norman Lamb, said: This is the inevitable consequence of the government’s continued underfunding of our NHS. Patients will suffer longer waiting times for routine operations, while progress towards improving mental health care risks being reversed. The public very clearly wants to see more investment in the NHS as a national priority. The Liberal Democrats have set out a clear plan to raise £6bn for the NHS and care by putting a penny on income tax. We need to be honest with the British people that securing the best possible standards of care will mean all chipping in a little more. The board have voted that, subject to certain conditions, heart surgery units at the Royal Brompton, London, and in Leicester and Newcastle will not close as was previously mooted. A unit at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust will stop offering specialist surgery and care for congenital heart disease patients but the services previously offered there will be consolidated in Liverpool instead. Keogh has now excused himself from the discussion because he when he leaves the board at the end of this year he is to be chairman of Birmingham women’s and children’s NHS Foundation Trust. Four trusts have been identified as not meeting acceptable standards for level 1 services, i.e. providing specialist surgery and care for congenital heart disease patients, the board hears: Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (formerly Central Manchester NHS Foundation Trust) University Hospitals Of Leicester NHS Trust Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield NHS Foundation Trust Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. All of these level one centres had previously earmarked for closure but the new recommendation is that only Manchester, which only has one surgeon, should do so, with services, in that case, consolidated in Liverpool. Leicester was said to have presented a “a convincing plan for meeting the co-location standards”, Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield was said to have presented an ambitious plan to collaborate with Guy’s and St Thomas’ and services at Newcastle will also be kept open until at least 2021. This is the reaction from Leicester West MP, Liz Kendall: They are onto agenda item six now: “Congenital Heart Disease Services for Adults and Children: Future Commissioning Arrangements.” Medical director Bruce Keogh is giving some context, namely the deaths in the 1990s of babies at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, whose heart surgeons were not as skilled as others elsewhere. Referring to the 2001 Kennedy review into the tragedy, he says one of the recommendations was to rationalise services to safeguard standards. He says: We are reaching crunch time, this has been going on since 2001, we need a decision... The uncertainty that has surrounded the past 17 years has been highly counterproductive for people working in this speciality. This is what the shadow health secretary thinks of the discussion on planning for next year (Jeremy Hunt is giving a speech at the King’s Fund health charity this afternoon): Medical director Bruce Keogh makes clear that the guidance on “items which should not be routinely prescribed in primary care” is just that, i.e. it is not a ban but about “judicious” prescribing. A consultation between July and October received more than 5,000 responses online and more than 200 through the post. Keogh says the guidance, previewed earlier this year, remains largely unchanged. He says there was no evidence to support the prescribing of homeopathic remedies on the NHS. They have identified 26 conditions where over the counter medicine is sufficient, says Keogh. Non-exec director Lord Victor Adebowale CBE asks “how we will monitor for unintended consequences?” Keogh says they will consider that. The recommendations are passed. Dame Moira Gibb, another non-executive director, says the public must understand that not everything can be done, staff can’t be continually pushed to do more and more. Her view is echoed by NHS England chair Prof Sir Malcolm Grant, who says: We should not set out blindly imagining that our staff can do everything. He says chief executive Simon Stevens needs to carry out a “rigorous process” reflecting the discussion. We have to find an accommodation of all of these conflicts ...to ensure that when we enter the financial year 2018/19, we are confident of our ability to deliver. That is the end of that agenda item and there was not the detail that many anticipated after the post-budget warnings. There was detail of the services to be prioritised but no flesh on the bones about those that will be cut. Next up is “Items which should not be routinely prescribed in primary care”, which should reach concrete conclusions. Non-exec director Lord Victor Adebowale CBE refers to the amount allocated in the budget as a “tough settlement” and seeks extra reassurance from chief executive Simon Stevens that mental health will be protected, as he suggested it should be, given that historically it has been underfunded. Another non-exec director Prof John Burn says it’s “enlightened self-interest” to put money into mental health and primary care. We’d like to hear from NHS staff about how you have been affected by cuts. How has funding helped in the past and what will the proposed changes mean?

Stevens is asked about how the public and patients will be involved in discussions. He says patient groups have already been engaged when coming up with priorities over the next two years. Healthwatch is also being engaged. There will be public consultation by NHS England as well as a formal public consultation ultimately by the Department of Health, he adds. Matthew Swindells, national director – operations and information, says: There are going to be some really difficult decisions that we need to make. Chief executive Simon Stevens said the recommendation is to uphold the planned investment in mental health, cancer care and primary care next year. He says the working principle is to be as “stretching but realistic” about what can be achieved in other areas so that frontline staff already under pressure are not overwhelmed. We have until March 31st to get this combination of judgements right. Paul Baumann, NHS England’s chief financial officer, says the assessment is the budget settlement won’t enable the health service to deliver all the expectations place upon it while still living within its means. Before chief executive Simon Stevens begins on agenda item four, the big issue of “planning for 2018/19 in light of budget”, chair Prof Sir Malcolm Grant says the duty of NHS England leaders is stewardship, “to use scarce resources to obtain best benefits for patients”. He adds: We are not a political entity, we are not politically aligned. Grant says there will always be “difficult choices”. He highlights the “extraordinary productivity of the NHS”. He says there is a rolling productivity increase per year of 1.7%, which he says is well above the economy as a whole. This is significant because the NHS is continually being put under pressure to make productivity increases to save money. They discuss preparedness for winter. Chief executive Simon Steven says there is “an enormous mobilisation going on across the NHS” for winter. He says NHS England was fortunate to receive an extra £350m for winter in the budget. Addressing the public, he says there is still time to get your flu jab and says uptake is higher than last year. Bruce Keogh, NHS England medical director, says “with a following wind” he hopes everything will go “okay” but cautions that events are unpredictable. The meeting is just starting now. You can watch the livestream at this link. NHS England chair Prof Sir Malcolm Grant is explaining the format of the meeting, including that there will be a section held in private later. He says 1,000 papers have come into the board for the meeting. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has tweeted about the meeting this morning with foreboding: National Voices, an umbrella group of more than 100 health and social care charities, has already warned the NHS against making decisions it feels lie outside its remit. In an open letter to Simon Stevens, published on Friday, the coalition’s chief executive, Jeremy Taylor, wrote: On the one hand, we recognise that NHS England and local commissioners will have to make some very difficult budgeting decisions. On the other hand, NHS England and local commissioners arguably have no mandate to make significant reductions to the NHS offer. This is properly a matter for ministers and Parliament. No political party proposed such reductions in their general election manifesto and nobody voted for such. Ahead of the meeting, NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare system, has published results of a poll of its members, which shows the level of pessimism among them. It received 107 responses from health leaders to the question: “How much of a difference will today’s Budget make to your organisation’s ability to give good care?” Just 3% answered “big improvement”, half (50%) said “small improvement” and 47% responded “no improvement”. NHS Confederation chief executive Niall Dickson said: The fact that nearly every senior leader in the NHS felt that the budget will make little or no difference says it all. We gathered together the largest coalition of doctors, patients, carers, voluntary groups as well as our NHS organisations and social care partners to plead with the chancellor to take a bold step – no such step was taken. History tells us that the NHS needs around 4% a year above inflation just to keep up with demographic and technological demand. Today we are facing major challenges in both of these areas. The government is now planning around 1.4% on the NHS in England, with a promise to meet any additional cost pressures caused by lifting the pay cap for nursing and other support staff. “Health ministers and NHS England officials also did their best to make the case to the Treasury but with limited success. The lack of adequate funding for both health and social care remains one of the great social issues of this time – and patients and those who rely on social care are suffering every day as a result. We cannot go on staggering from year to year. We need a grown up and honest debate about the long-term funding needs of both the NHS and social care. Here is some background on some of the key figures likely to be prominent at the meeting. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens. An expert at putting his wishes for the health service with diplomatic subtlety, Stevens, who has been in the job for three-and-a-half-years, has radically changed course. His public warnings this year of the danger of underfunding, including if his request for £4bn extra in 2018-19 was not met, have put him on a collision course with Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May after years of treading on eggshells. My colleague, Denis Campbell, wrote: He has upped the ante by giving May a choice: fund the NHS properly – as independent bodies such as the Office for Budget Responsibility, Institute for Fiscal Studies and the National Audit Office would define it – or risk it visibly deteriorating as plans to improve cancer and mental health care (a subject close to May’s heart) are halted, more patients are forced to wait longer for operations in hospital, and GPs, hospitals and community services end up “retrenching and retreating”. NHS England chair Prof Sir Malcolm Grant. While it was Stevens who made the demand for £4bn and warned of the consequences if it was not fulfilled, it was Grant who subsequently said that it would lead to “difficult debate about what it is possible to deliver for patients with the money available”. This has led Health Service Journal’s bureau chief Dave West to suggest (£) it is “a sign, that, with the mud already flying in Mr Stevens’ direction, more of the noise will be made by Sir Malcolm in the run up to his term on the board ending next autumn”. NHS England medical director Bruce Keogh. After announcing that he will stand down at the end of this year, after 10 years in the role, Keogh may feel he has little to lose from speaking out. After the budget, he tweeted: The meeting, which is being held at NHS England’s HQ in Elephant Castle, south London, is scheduled to begin at 10.45am. The most interesting agenda items are: 4. Planning for 2018/19 in light of the Budget This is where we can expect to hear the debate about increased rationing and longer waiting times for treatment 5. Items which should not be routinely prescribed in primary care: findings of consultation and next steps. There was a preview of this earlier this year when the NHSE chief executive, Simon Stevens, detailed plans to stop giving patients travel vaccinations, gluten-free foods and some drugs that can be bought over the counter. He said GPs would be told to not prescribe medications such as those for upset stomachs, travel sickness and haemorrhoids in the drive to eliminate waste. 6. Congenital Heart Disease Services for Adults and Children: Future Commissioning Arrangements This relates to NHS England’s controversial plans to close heart surgery units. Those previoulsy earmarke for closure are children’s units at the Royal Brompton in London and Glenfield hospital in Leicester, and a unit at Central Manchester - which has just one surgeon for congenital heart defects - which treats adults and children. There has been a long running debate over which should close and the Royal Brompton and Glenfield have defied the plans, campaigning fiercely to stay open A critical meeting of NHS leaders is taking place today at which they will decide their response to the £1.6bn granted to the health service in England for 2018-19 in last week’s budget - less than half the £4bn minimum chief executive Simon Stevens said was needed. On 8 November, Stevens warned that without the requested extra funding, cancer and mental health care could deteriorate and the waiting list for hospital operations could hit 5 million. After the budget, NHS England released a statement by its chair, Sir Malcolm Grant, indicating that the settlement given to the health service meant that this board meeting would take on added significance, suggesting it would spell out what the what the NHS can no longer do - or afford to do - in the light of the £2.4bn funding gap. Grant said: The extra money the chancellor has found for the NHS is welcome and will go some way towards filling the widely accepted funding gap. However, we can no longer avoid the difficult debate about what it is possible to deliver for patients with the money available. The NHS England board will need to lead this discussion when we meet on November. We will be providing live updates from the crucial meeting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/29/chris-woakes-england-curfew-pink-ball-bouncers--ashes-second-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T18:00:06Z","webTitle":"Chris Woakes bats away Ashes curfew to focus on pink balls and bouncers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/29/chris-woakes-england-curfew-pink-ball-bouncers--ashes-second-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/29/chris-woakes-england-curfew-pink-ball-bouncers--ashes-second-test","fields":{"headline":"Chris Woakes bats away Ashes curfew to focus on pink balls and bouncers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is a game going on here on Saturday. It may be even more relevant than the one taking place in Canterbury, New Zealand, on Sunday and it was Chris Woakes, who was plucked out to remind us of the importance of the second Test in Adelaide. It was always going to be Woakes. The Warwickshire all-rounder has many assets; he can bowl brisk away-swingers, he bats properly and when the England and Wales Cricket Board requires someone to chat to the press at a time when there is a bit too much going on for its liking, he is No1 on the list. He has safer hands than David Seaman ever possessed. Woakes is engaging, cheerful, cooperative and measured. He was never going to embarrass the England tour party in a week when they have seemed ever more open to ridicule. Woakes dealt with the inevitable questions politely before moving on to the Test. “Any team would be stronger with Ben Stokes in it,” he said. Soon he was directed towards the thorny issue of the curfew. He confirmed one had been imposed by the ECB’s cricket director, Andrew Strauss. “Yes, the curfew is midnight but that does not change much. It doesn’t affect us greatly at all. There is no alcohol ban but I’m not a huge drinker anyway.” The precise logistics of the new regulations were not explored but on reflection your correspondent has calculated there could be a nasty race against time throughout the Adelaide Test. It is, of course, a day/night match. Play can go on until 10pm, whereupon the players have to warm down and brush up while one or two must satisfy the demands of TV, radio, and the written press, who desperately crave their interpretation of events on the field after the close of play. Fortunately the England team are staying conveniently near the Adelaide Oval but they will struggle to get back to their hotel before 11pm. Then they may need a bite to eat before the Ovaltine, all of which has to be done by midnight. It could be a bit of a scramble for our brave boys. Remember Brian Hanrahan of the BBC “counting them all out and counting them all back” during the Falklands war. Please do not expect your Guardian reporters to perform a similar role. On a more serious note, winning teams seldom have curfews. Woakes, denied the suggestion the tourists must have felt as if they had been dragooned into the headmaster’s study when addressed by Strauss after the Brisbane Test. “He just reminded us of the fact we are England players and we have a responsibility to the cap, the jumper and the nation, and that Ashes series are always built up to be something more than a normal series.” Obviously the way out of the trough is to win in Adelaide and Woakes dutifully found reasons to be optimistic. “The ball might move around a little bit more here,” he said, “and that might suit our strengths as a bowling attack. We are stepping into the unknown with the pink ball. Every game has thrown up something different.” England won a low-scoring match here against an inexperienced side three weeks ago. “The pink Duke [which England used at Edgbaston last August] felt more plasticky,” he said, “whereas the pink Kookaburra feels the same as the red Kookaburra. It doesn’t necessarily shine too well but it does move a little bit. But we have not bowled a huge amount with it.” It will be another voyage of discovery but the expectation is it will be easier – for both sides – to take the 20 wickets necessary to win. No one expects a draw at Adelaide any more. Can England score enough runs and how can they cope with the bouncer barrage that has been promised time and time again by Australia once they reach the lower order, which usually coincides with the presence of Woakes at the crease? Again he displayed an engaging candour. “I feel as comfortable as you can be against the short ball,” he said. “No one enjoys short bowling consistently around your earholes. You want some on the front foot but you are not always going to get that, particularly in Australia. You have to have plans to score runs, not just survive.” It is possible to envisage Woakes doing that but not so easy to imagine those further down the order having much success against the barrage. Finally there was one more reference to the problems that have been haunting the tour party. It seemed somehow preposterous to suggest to Woakes, of all people, that England were being perceived as a thuggish side. Of course he declined to take offence. “We are not a group of thugs; we’re a very good bunch of guys, a very good team that is willing to do the right things to try to win the Ashes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/01/most-beautiful-island-review-new-york-immigrant-thriller","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T06:00:35Z","webTitle":"Most Beautiful Island review – New York  thriller cranks up the suspense","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/01/most-beautiful-island-review-new-york-immigrant-thriller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/01/most-beautiful-island-review-new-york-immigrant-thriller","fields":{"headline":"Most Beautiful Island review – New York  thriller cranks up the suspense","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Spanish actor Ana Asensio multitasks as star, writer-director and producer of this arresting feature, a gritty, ominous thriller that’s winning awards on the festival and independent film circuit. Like a million other immigrants in New York City, Luciana (Asensio) feels she can’t go back to wherever she came from (hints are dropped about a tragic accident involving a child). But she’s not exactly thriving, working two or three cruddy low-wage jobs, from handing out flyers in the street while dressed as a chicken to babysitting bratty posh kids. Chicken-costume colleague Olga (Natasha Romanova) asks whether she could cover for her at an evening gig where all she has to do is stand around looking pretty at a party in a black dress, but it turns out there’s rather more to it than that. Asensio adroitly ratchets up the suspense over what happens next behind the locked door at the scuzzy warehouse, working with little more than her cast’s and her own subtle features and a few tiny, creepy-crawly props. However, beyond the unease driving the plot, there’s a real affection here for the city where it was shot and its fundamentally decent denizens, many played by obvious non-professionals, while the digital cinematography captures the sweaty textures of this world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/29/ireland-brexit-northern-ireland-border","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T13:11:43Z","webTitle":"Ireland is right not to trust the British on the border.

History shows why","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There has been outrage in certain quarters of the British media regarding the insistence of the Irish government that Westminster provide a detailed outline of how it plans to deal with the border dividing Northern Ireland from Ireland. From an Irish point of view, the Dublin government’s position is understandable. Many Irish people are aware that the last time the British government refused to make its position on the border clear, it caused considerable problems. In 1920, with the Anglo-Irish war raging, Westminster belatedly sought to introduce Irish home rule. The Government of Ireland Act essentially provided for two home rule parliaments, one in Dublin and one in Belfast. Six of Ireland’s 32 counties became Northern Ireland, with the old county boundaries serving as the border between the two states. From the beginning, the line of partition was arbitrary. Most of the county lines in Ulster were drawn up in the early 1600s. Using county borders to form the basis of the boundary meant that several nationalist and unionist communities got left on the “wrong side” of the line. This issue came to a head during the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations in 1921. Once they accepted that some form of partition was inevitable, Sinn Féin representatives pressed for clarification about where exactly the border between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland would lie. Just as supporters of Brexit today insist that the specifics of the Irish border can be addressed at some time in the future, the British negotiators refused to tackle and solve the question of the border during these talks. Instead, they proposed a boundary commission to decide the exact position of the border after the Anglo-Irish Treaty had been signed. This is the current Westminster approach to its negotiations with the EU, saying, “Let’s make a deal first, and we can figure out the details later.” Nor is this the only parallel in discussions about the border today and a century ago. In 2017, Brexiteers have taken a contradictory position in insisting that the UK will leave the customs union, but that a frictionless border will be in operation between Ireland and Northern Ireland. In the early 1920s, the British government adopted an even more duplicitous stance, assuring nationalists in Dublin that the border of 1920 would be drastically revised, while promising unionists in Belfast that the frontier would remain unchanged. The outbreak of the Irish civil war meant that the boundary commission to redraw the border did not convene until 1924. Initially, the commission was to include three members, representing the Dublin, Belfast and London governments respectively. But Northern Ireland refused to appoint a representative. Why would it? Unionists had already been assured that the border would not change. In the end, the Labour government in Westminster had to choose Northern Ireland’s commissioner. In Dublin, there was considerable confidence that the boundary commission would transfer large parts of Northern Ireland that had nationalist majorities to the Free State. But in 1925, the conclusions of the boundary commission were leaked. These revealed that the proposed changes to the border would be minimal and that some territory in Donegal would transfer to Stormont rule. The loss of a portion of Donegal was too much of a humiliation for the Free State government to take, and it struck a deal with Westminster to suppress the commission’s report. In return for the cancellation of the imperial debt that the Free State had agreed to pay in 1921, the border remained unchanged. But the feeling lingered in Ireland that “perfidious Albion” had tricked the Free State into accepting a borderline it did not want. In the long term, this border was problematic. In making Northern Ireland, unionists had sought as big a hinterland for Belfast as possible, to create an economically viable state, while ensuring that the nationalist population trapped in its borders would not be large enough to challenge unionists in elections. This approach resulted in counties with nationalist majorities, Fermanagh and Tyrone, being included in Northern Ireland. The resentment and tension that this created was to eventually reap a terrible harvest in 1969. Had the British government taken direct responsibility for drawing the border in 1921 and sought to respect the wishes of local communities regarding which state they wanted to join, it is quite possible that the Troubles would never have broken out. A reduced Northern Ireland with an overwhelming unionist majority would have had nothing to fear from its small nationalist population. It may have treated this minority with the tolerance and fairness that the six-county state failed to do, thereby removing the root cause of the Northern Irish conflict. The lesson for the British government is that failing to address issues surrounding the border question can have ugly and unforeseen long-term consequences. Let’s hope it is one they heed. • Caoimhín de Barra is assistant professor of history at Drew University in New Jersey, and author of The Coming of the Celts, AD1860: Celtic Nationalism in Ireland and Wales (University of Notre Dame Press), to be published next year"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/shortcuts/2017/nov/29/the-thought-police-five-works-of-philosophy-that-every-cop-should-read","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T14:39:20Z","webTitle":"The thought police: five works of philosophy that every cop should read","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2017/nov/29/the-thought-police-five-works-of-philosophy-that-every-cop-should-read","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2017/nov/29/the-thought-police-five-works-of-philosophy-that-every-cop-should-read","fields":{"headline":"The thought police: five works of philosophy that every cop should read","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Police officers in Baltimore have been making novel use of their notebooks. Anything Plato has said may be taken down and used, not as evidence against him, but in the classroom, where detective Ed Gillespie has made the ancient Greek philosopher part of the force’s annual in-service training. Gillespie gets his students to discuss cases of police misconduct in terms of Plato’s tripartite model of the soul, which holds that our behaviour is governed, at times, by either the intellect, the “spirit” or the “appetites”. Any further education would be a good thing, since research shows that the more educated officers are, the less likely they are to use force. But philosophy has more valuable insights to offer. Here are some suggestions for what should be on any police department’s reading list. Fear and Trembling by Søren Kierkegaard If you want to understand why “I was just following orders” is never a good enough excuse, consider Abraham, told to sacrifice his own son by the supreme law enforcer, God almighty. Far from shrugging his shoulders and picking up the knife, Kierkegaard shows Abraham rightly questioning whether there is an absolute duty to obey God. Surely we can then ask if there is absolute duty to obey our chiefs of police? The Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle Laws are all very well, but you need to be of good character to want to follow them and have the wisdom to interpret them fairly. The good police officer therefore needs phronēsis – practical wisdom – and this book will help them to develop it. A Question of Trust by Onora O’Neill Policing by consent is the principle of UK law enforcement. If the police force wishes to understand how it can retain, and in some cases rebuild, trust, Onora O’Neill’s lucid and insightful Reith lectures are a good place to look. She argues that audits, transparency and procedures only go so far. If you want to be trusted, the most important thing is that you are, in fact, trustworthy. On the Genealogy of Morals by Freidrich Nietzsche A police officer with fantasies of being Superman is the last thing we need, but there is much more to Nietzsche than the misunderstood Übermensch. There is no more powerful licence to abuse power than to believe you are on the right side of a neat divide between good and evil. Far better to realise that we are all merely doing better or worse at making life go well for ourselves and others. The Analects by Confucius By reading more than just western philosophy, the police could gain greater awareness of cultural diversity than most academic philosophers. The Analects is a good reminder not only that different cultures have different core values, but that using the force of the law is always a last resort. “I could try a civil suit as well as anyone,” said Confucius. “But better still to bring it about that there were no civil suits!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/29/how-many-boris-buses-does-a-brexit-divorce-bill-buy-you","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T13:40:56Z","webTitle":"How many Boris buses does a Brexit divorce bill buy you?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/29/how-many-boris-buses-does-a-brexit-divorce-bill-buy-you","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/29/how-many-boris-buses-does-a-brexit-divorce-bill-buy-you","fields":{"headline":"How many Boris buses does a Brexit divorce bill buy you?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Now that the cost of the UK’s Brexit divorce is beginning to emerge, we can calculate exactly how many Boris buses £50bn could buy. No, we are not referring to the London Routemasters – although we have worked out that with that sum you could buy 141,542 of them. We mean the “£350m weekly EU cost” that was emblazoned on the side of Vote Leave’s battlebus during the EU referendum campaign. And here’s the answer: It equates to nearly three years’ worth of the promised weekly gain. The UK’s Brexit bill is being calculated on the basis of its share of the the EU’s unpaid bills, loans, pension and other liabilities, and the gross figure is thought to be as high as £89bn. However, this sum will be reduced after taking into account payments that would have been made to EU projects in the UK, including structural funds. Divorce payments will continue to be made for many years, as the UK will assume liability for EU pensions due to be paid to those British citizens eligible, which includes MEPs who will lose their positions as a result of Brexit. Leave campaigners have repeatedly claimed that the £350m referred to on the battlebus was not a promise to give the NHS a Brexit dividend, but merely a suggestion as to how the money could be spent. The sum was a matter of dispute – it was based on the Treasury’s estimation of the gross amount the UK contributed to the EU in 2015. However, since Margaret Thatcher negotiated a British rebate in 1984, the UK has paid significantly less than the 1% of national GDP member states normally pay into the EU budget. The UK’s contribution was therefore more accurately recognised to be about £248m a week. On that basis, a £50bn exit bill equals 201 weeks’ worth of contributions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/live/2017/nov/28/aria-awards-2017-gang-of-youths-paul-kelly-ab-original-harry-styles-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T11:29:10Z","webTitle":"Aria awards 2017: Gang of Youths win album of the year – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2017/nov/28/aria-awards-2017-gang-of-youths-paul-kelly-ab-original-harry-styles-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/live/2017/nov/28/aria-awards-2017-gang-of-youths-paul-kelly-ab-original-harry-styles-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Aria awards 2017: Gang of Youths win album of the year – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That’s it for the 2017 Aria awards. Thank you for joining us through this wonderful journey of great suits, better music, and even better opinions about Australia’s best bird. (Polls close 9 December!) The big winners of the night were Gang of Youths which won four awards including album of the year, best group, and best rock album for Go Farther in Lightness. Paul Kelly also took home four awards, including best male artist and best adult contemporary album for Life is Fine. Song of the year went to Peking Duk for ‘Stranger (feat. Elliphant). Illy was named best Australian live act, while Harry Styles won best International Act. Both those categories are voted by the public. Amy Shark won best breakthrough artist and best pop release. PNAU won best dance track. A.B. Original took out two awards, best urban album and best independent release, for Reclaim Australia. Sia won best female artist but did not collect her award in person. You can read our full wrap of the night here. ‘Rock and roll saved our fucking lives’ Gang of Youths frontman Dave Le’aupepe, so eloquent on stage, continues in the press room in a roving, honest interview that touches on the power of rock and roll and the beauty of diversity. He starts by addressing the journalists in the room: Don’t capitulate, don’t equivocate, write honest things. We need a good and honest fourth estate. For this band of migrants, he says the award means a lot: My family came with nothing. To be heralded as something that is significant within the cultural landscape in Australia is quite amazing for us. The assumption about Pacific Islanders in this country is that they play footy or they work security or they sing RnB, and that’s not the case. He also opened up about his experience with mental health issues: Rock and roll saved our fucking lives, and it saved my fucking life ... I tried to kill myself in 2014 and a mate of mine who works with Sony, gave me a room and told me not to. I channeled all the horrible nervous energy I’d been channeling into alcohol and self-destruction into something that I thought was worthwhile. People are cynical...but it’s actually something that gave me hope and life that I didn’t have before. He shouts out to the other Pacific Islander journalists in the room, who congratulate him, beaming and as proud of him and the band as anyone. Because it seems we cannot get through a public event without something like this happening, it behooves me to tell you that Kirin J. Callinan, who you may remember from earlier in the blog because Jimmy Barnes talked about being in his video clip, exposed his penis on the red carpet. I don’t know why. On the broadcast, Peking Duk are trying to remember their speech. I love that they have decided to dress in matching outfits based off John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. It’s a strong look and one more people should emulate. And that’s it for the awards. Now for a tribute to Malcolm and George Young. Malcolm Young’s funeral was held in Sydney today. Kurt Pengilly and Jon Farriss from INXS, who just presented best live act, tell us in the media room that they miss performing live. Farriss says: I don’t get out much. I’ve been watching some of the live acts tonight and going, ‘oh, I remember that’. There’s something special about it. Robbie Buck asks them how they feel on the 20th anniversary of the death of bandmate Michael Hutchence. Said Pengilly: We tend to reflect on the fact that it’s 40 years since we’ve been together. Everyone else keeps bringing up Michael’s death and that sort of thing. For us, we remember all the fun times. He was our brother, our partner in crime. We try and avoid the anniversary, it’s not something I want to celebrate. It’s more the fun times. Peking Duk has won the song of the year for ‘Stranger (feat. Elliphant). Lorde presented the award. On TV, Gang of Youths has just accepted their Aria for album of the year. David Le’aupepe says the award is significant for the Pacific Islander community. Most of the band are Pacific Islanders. We’re not just useful on the footy field. Also, Buzzfeed has made this important point: We are barrelling toward the end here. ‘Every now and then you have one of those years that’s just non stop’ In his brilliant speech accepting the award for album of the year for Gang of Youths, David Le’aupepe said of Paul Kelly: “the heart of Australia beats through [his] music”. Speaking in the media room, Kelly talked about the commercial and critical success of his latest album Life is Fine: It’s not something you aim for but it’s always good when you get it. We’ve had a big year - things jumped up, [we started getting] big crowds, we’re still in the middle of it ... every now and then you have one of those years that’s just non stop. He was quite sanguine about success, describing it as almost random: Some records are more popular than others; sometimes the light gets shined on you for a little while and it moves on. It comes and goes. I still keep making records and some are a little bit more difficult for people than others. Some are more popular. Of his collaboration with AB Original for their update of Dumb Things, which was the highlight of the Arias broadcast, he said: I love getting up with those guys ... they’re very funny guys to be with, and I just love the way they raise a ruckus. I like the idea that two groups or two people can come together and make something that neither of them could have made on their own ... Sometimes when you’re just working with yourself you just bore yourself and you’ve got to find ways to surprise yourself. Gang of Youths have swept this night’s awards, and can now add album of the year to tonight’s gongs for best group and best rock album. They take to the stage and deliver the best speech of the night, hands down. Says lead singer Dave Le’aupepe: We’re all immigrants to this country, every single one of us. This country was built on a strong Indigenous people and on the backs of immigrants. A.B. Original thank you for making an incendiary, important record for the brown boys. We fucking love you. Amy Shark you are one of the strongest women and thank you for making the strongest music. Paul Kelly, the heart of Australia beats through your music. It’s a wonderful, moving speech, and Le’aupepe continues to pay tribute to his own migrant background, as well as those of his bandmates: Pacific Islander, Korean and Jewish. We’re Pacific Islanders and we’re very proud of our heritage. We are a loving community and we’re not just useful on the footy field, and we hope this proves something. My grandparents came on a boat after the Holocaust, they came as refugees to this country and thank you for welcoming us. We love this country. Fuck yeah. Thanks. In case you missed it: Amy Shark has won her second award for the night – this time for breakthrough artist. She spoke earlier in the night about how much winning these awards mean to her, and this second win has only added to the emotion. She says: There are a lot of years that I was frustrated with the industry. I just wanted everyone to hear my music so bad. My heart can’t handle this. This is an incredible night for me. Thank you. Katie Noonan, who won this award in 2002, presented the award to Shark, but not before delivering a wonderful acknowledgment of country. It’s a crowded field, including a lot of artists who’ve already taken home awards tonight, but Melbourne rapper Illy, as voted by the fans, has won best live act. He pays tribute to Triple J for their decision to move the date of the Hottest 100, announced yesterday. Shout out to Triple J for their last 24 hours, it’s been a big thing, so congrats to those guys. Harry Styles is Wolfmother: a theory We haven’t spoken about Harry Styles for a while, so please enjoy this despatch from Naaman Zhou about Styles’s live performance, with bonus 2006 Australian festival circuit content. Writes Naaman: Harry Styles, resplendent in purple suit and gold swirls [it’s paisley, Naaman, we discussed this], has just delivered the performance, that let’s be fair, a huge chunk of the audience has been waiting for. It’s a rollicking, high-energy rendition of his single Kiwi, which, coming in the middle of this night of Aussie music, suddenly sounds a lot like Wolfmother’s Joker and the Thief. A deliberate choice? Am I the only one who’s noticed this? Anyway, it’s another great performance on a night of great performances. The stans can rest easy, and if he releases some music next year, he’s a shoo-in for a 7th straight award for best international act. The only story that matters, from Daryl Braithwaite’s Hall of Fame speech: As a child, my twin brother Glen and I used to love singing along to the songs on the radio at the time. We joined the choir at Christchurch Grammar School in Melbourne, with Olivia Newton-John in my class, and we went out for a week. Braithwaite says his dad was “upset for a long time” when he gave up his fitting and turning apprenticeship to join Sherbet. He talks about going on the dole after Sherbet and the difficulty of getting back into music. That record changed my life. Thirty years on, I’m eternally grateful. He’s about to perform Horses with Guy Sebastian and Vera Blue. In real time, I am hearing from Steph Harmon that Harry Styles’s live performance was excellent and involved a lot of screaming. (From fans, not from Styles.) Here’s Daryl Braithwaite being inducted into the hall of fame by Jimmy Barnes. If you want to expand your solo Braithwaite repertoire beyond Horses, may I suggest One Summer? I promise you already know it. Barnes is talking about all the girls that loved Braithwaite in the 70s. He wasn’t just a pretty face, he could sing as well... despite their neatly-brushed hair and the satin jackets, they were actually really good. And Daryl had a serious set of pipes. I used to go see them playing in pubs in Adelaide and pubs where people would get shot and stabbed, and they would kill it. He tells a story about seeing Sherbet perform at Victoria Park in Sydney, when they were so heavily mobbed by fans that he thought they would not out alive. I’m standing there watching, and Daryl must have spotted me. He said to me, ‘Hey, come here. Come with us. If you don’t come with us, you are going to get killed’. So suddenly from standing there with my jaw open I was in the back of an armoured van with Sherbet. This was the peak of their career and Daryl took me into the van and shared it with me and I remember driving away and there were girls throwing themselves in front of the van. They were going nuts. That day, Daryl Braithwaite gave me a glimpse of what it was like to be a rock star. He shared his moment with me, and I was a nobody. I was a nobody, and I was a nobody. I was a nobody, and he shared it with me. That’s the sort of guy that Daryl Braithwaite is. In real time, the ceremony has just started up again after a dinner break. The big hitters - album of the year and best Australian live act - are coming up. In TV time, AB Original, is accepting the Aria for best independent record. It’s the best. It’s worth repeating this quote from Briggs’s acceptance speech: We weren’t saying we are going to make it through the struggle, we’re saying we’ve made it, we’ve persisted, we’ve been here for 80,000 years. Jimmy Barnes: ‘I’ve lived my life in the public eye’ Jimmy Barnes has joined us in the media suite, where he shed some light on his appearance in one of the strangest film clips of the year: Sydney musician Kirin J Callinan’s video for Big Enough. Barnes: Kirin J Callinan is an awesome, awesome, awesome artist. He’s a friend of my kids’ and asked me to scream on one of his records. I did it for fun. The record recently went viral, after a very perplexed Jimmy Fallon played it – and mocked it – on The Tonight Show’s segment Do Not Play. Barnsey again: I think Kirin is a really great creative mind, and a really fun spirit, so I was happy to do it. But I could see where Jimmy Fallon was coming from when he put it on: suddenly he’s got two guys dressed as cowboys in Australia, and me in a cowboy hat screaming in the clouds. I could see where he was coming from. Barnes has recently published two acclaimed memoirs that detail his life with addiction and depression. “For 40 years, in front of the public, I was drinking myself to death,” he told Guardian Australia in October. Speaking in the media room he said: To look back at it and make some sense out of it, and let it go, has been a really good thing. You probably could have done this with a therapist, which I was doing as well, but I’ve had to do it in the public eye obviously ... I’ve lived my life in the public eye. Most people remember more about those days than I do. But it’s been very cathartic. It’s a really nice thing to do. Barnes won an Aria for his children’s album, which his son said was “so rock and roll”. Update: it turns out Steph Harmon did tell me about the kilt and I forgot. Sorry, Steph. Teachers get Arias too In a lovely new category, the Arias is now recognising Australia’s best music teachers. The winner is Renee McCarthy from South Australia’s Woodcroft College. She has already been given her pointy statue and is not allowed on stage, but Josh Pyke did visit her school earlier this year and reads it out on stage. That’s all happening in TV time, by the way. Happened hours ago in real life. Also in TV time, Jimmy Barnes just accepted the Aria for best children’s album. (In a kilt! How did no one tell me he was in a kilt?) More on Barnsey in a bit... ‘Going through a divorce, for a country singer – there’s nothing better than that’ Kasey Chambers won best country album earlier tonight for Dragonfly, which was produced by Paul Kelly and includes collaborations with Ed Sheeran and Paul Vance. This brings the insanely talented, insanely successful country singer up to 12 Arias in total: I’m very committed to the Arias – and the after-party. I went through a lot of different things leading up to [Dragonfly], both personally and vocally. I had nodules on my voice for 20 years, and then I got rid of them. That was like discovering a whole new part of myself. Chambers split up with her husband, country singer Shane Nicholson, in 2013. Going through a divorce, for a country singer – there’s nothing better than that. It’s basically the reason us country singers get married: so we can go through a divorce and make another record. So I’m looking for a husband tonight – gotta get another record out soon! He’s got a few albums too. It’s helped both of us. We banded together at the very least. ‘Darryl Braithwaite gave me a glimpse of what its like to be a rock star’ Technical difficulties prevent us from bringing you much of Daryl Braithwaite’s speech as it happened (we’ll get it to it later) but Naaman Zhou has brought us these comments from Jimmy Barnes, who did the induction. You couldn’t turn on the radio in the 70s without hearing Darryl Brairhwaite and Sherbet. They were the biggest act in the country by a mile. Cold Chisel tried to start to break into the scene around the same time. We were a support act at the time. We got asked to open up for a lot of bands, they treated us like shit, but Sherbet didn’t. Darryl Braithwaite gave me a glimpse of what its like to be a rock star. He shared his moment with me. On TV, A.B. Original, Paul Kelly, and Dan Sultan just delivered what I reckon is going to be the performance of the night. Daryl Braithwaite is being inducted into the hall of fame, and he just revealed this AMAZING fact: Guess she really likes horses. Political manicures and 90s nostalgia All Our Exes Live In Texas – who were responsible for one of this writer’s favourite albums this year, When We Fall – have joined us in the media room, after winning in the blues and roots category. Hannah Croft’s Arias manicure spells out Save Manus, and Katie Wighton’s spells #metoo. Wighton: As a feminist band it’s very important for us - particularly at the moment, particularly at the moment. The band recently supported Backstreet Boys’ Australian tour – which landed moments as surreal as this one, Wighton says. We stood side of stage to watch them, and every night AJ would jump off the stage and come and dance with us. And every time that happened we would be like, ‘What. Is. Happening’. He touched Hannah’s jacket, and she just never washed it. The band picked their band name by “googling the worst country song titles of all time,” Elana Stone says, “and we’ve been stuck with it for five years. But it’s been serving us well.” On TV, Vance Joy presents the award for best adult contemporary album to Paul Kelly. In real life, All Our Exes Live In Texas have just stopped by the media room and Steph and Naaman are VERY excited. More on that soon. Meanwhile, on television The Channel 9 broadcast is really flying through the awards, which is probably a good thing. So far we’ve seen Sophie Monk present the Aria for best pop release to Amy Shark, who spent 15 years on the pub circuit before breaking through and had these lovely words for struggling musicians: Up next was the award for best group, presented by Mick Fleetwood to Gang of Youths. And now Lorde’s performing a mashup of Liability and Green Light. She is sitting down in front of a stage that has been fitted with moody venetian blinds, because she’s Lorde and, like Angel from Buffy, can always find moody flattering lighting. Paul Kelly has just been named male artist of the year – the third time he’s won this particular award, which he was nominated for at the first Arias awards in 1987. It’s his second Aria award tonight, but his record Life Is Fine won two earlier in the artisan categories, for best engineer (Steven Schram) and best cover art (Peter Salmon-Lomas). I admire all the other nominees tonight – and it’s a real honour to be among them. He was nominated alongside DD Dumbo, Dan Sultan, Illy and Vance Joy. Kelly: A trick to being best male is just to pick good people to work with. He continued, shouting out his label, his crew, his partner and his band. My band, I’ve mentioned them before, they’re just so good to be with and we spent a lot of time travelling this year and we never got sick of each other. Jimmy Barnes, another best male, will be joining us shortly in the media room... While the Arias broadcast plays catchup, Pnau have dropped by the media room to talk about how they nabbed Elton John for their 2012 remix album Good Morning to the Night. Said Nick Littlemore: I was getting a massage in Balmain, and Elton called. I was having a physio session and I answered the phone and he said: ‘Hello it’s Elton.’ Working with him is surreal, you give him a few pages of lyrics and he looks at them vaguely, then he plays a whole entire song, and you think, why am I in music? They’ve also paid tribute to Kira Divine, who worked with them on their latest album. We made three albums to make this one album. Two bad ones and then Changa is alright. We really did do two crappy albums and only really struck it because Kira came on board, she was really the inspiration. Will they keep working together in the future? Pnau just wont go away. We’re schoolmates, we keep doing it, can’t stop it. We’re like magnets, we attract each other. A few more awards All Our Exes Live in Texas (which is a great name for a band) have won best blues and roots album for When We Fall. It’s their first Aria award. As well as having an excellent name, All Our Exes Live in Texas have strong feminist ideals, boycotting Perth’s Ellington Jazz Club after its owner said you just “nod your head and listen with your understanding face on” when female artists talk about the obstacles they face in the music industry. Band member Hannah Crofts explained the decision here. Also, Muslim rom-com Ali’s Wedding has won for best original soundtrack. Meanwhile, the TV broadcast of the ceremony has begun with a performance of Chameleon by Pnau, which in real time (not TV time) just won the Aria for best dance release. AB Original have won best independent release, their second award of the night. They were visibly shocked as they took the stage. Briggs: Whose big idea was this? Wow … We didn’t expect to win the first one. We really didn’t expect to win this one. The main point of this whole record was to spark an idea and change the expectation of what an Indigenous artist could be. Because we weren’t saying we’ve gotta make it through the struggle; we said, we’ve made it, we’ve persisted, we’ve been here for 80,000 years. Trials said: This moment is not lost on us, trust me. The idea of writing a record for your nephews and nieces and it resonating through a crowd and an industry like this is not lost on us. Briggs dedicated the award to his friend Dr G Yunupingu, who died in July this year. I know he would love that – he loves things that are famous, he loved being famous. I love you … I miss you every day. Thank you everybody. Earlier, Sia won best female artist – but didn’t appear, or even send a recorded message with a banana superimposed on her face. Disappointing. Wins for Kasey Chambers and Pnau Kasey Chambers has won best country album for Dragonfly and delivered an excellent, funny and fairly chaotic speech. At first, there’s a bit of a wait, as Chambers is nowhere to be seen and confusion reigns. After a few seconds, she appears on stage. I’m sorry. They told me to go backstage to present an award, but I gather it’s not this one. Now I’m really nervous because I had to run in these shoes. It’s her eighth solo Aria win, and Chambers is proud of it. My life is so weird. I was literally getting nits out of my kid’s hair this morning and now I’m holding this. There’s a lot of negative stuff said about being a woman in the industry over 40 years old, but I fucking love it!” Pnau won best dance release for Chameleon. The original duo, Nick Littlemore and Peter Mayes take to the stage with newly-minted third member Sam Littlemore. Now that there’s three of them, there’s a lot of people to thank, but Sam has the last word: Thank you to you two for letting me help you out. On the red carpet earlier, our interview with Pnau was interrupted when it was thought Harry Styles had arrived. That’s always been the story of our lives – being ushered aside as someone actually important, talented, gifted [shows up]. Jimmy Barnes has just won his first Aria since 1992, and it’s for a children’s album: Och Aye the G’Nu! He brought an actual real life child to the stage: his grandson Dylan who, wearing a leather jacket, was looking as sharp as Barnes himself (who was wearing a kilt). Barnes wrote the album for him. Said Barnes: If you’re going to make a kid’s record, why not go to the top: the Wiggles helped me do it. The Wiggles indeed recorded the album with Barnes, and competed against it in the same category with their own album of duets. Speaking of duets, this is not a duet, but it is worth posting again: Earlier, Amy Shark gave a wonderful, intimate performance of Adore, which came in at #2 on this year’s Hottest 100; the record it’s from, Night Thinker, has already won Shark best pop release. While I recover from the sheer embarrassment of accidentally declaring Harry Styles the “best international event,” let’s enjoy this pitch for an Australian buddy cop movie starring Rebel Wilson and Sophie Monk. Wilson is there along with Ruby Rose as part of the Pitch Perfect 3 promo tour. Not sure how I feel about that as a concept, but who cares because she looks GREAT. You cannot beat Harry Styles fandom at this game. They mobilise. They have online voting parties. They are ever so slightly terrifying. They have won Styles the best international artist for the sixth time in a row. My colleague Naaman Zhou has sent the following report: Harry Styles has won best international artist for his self-titled debut album, to the cheers of many, many fans in the crowd. Incredibly, this brings Styles to record-breaking six wins in a row in the same category, after winning five straight gongs with One Direction. Cheering punctuates his speech as he accepts the award, and the British superstar immediately references the recent same-sex marriage postal survey. “Congratulations on your recent political decision,” he says. “I love you all, thank you so much.” Thanks, Harry. We think you’re alright too. Paul Kelly has taken to the stage to sing Life Is Fine, the title track of his 23rd studio album – which, remarkably, is the first of his to have ever debuted at #1 on the Aria charts. He’s followed up, of course, with Dumb Things featuring AB Original and Dan Sultan – an update of Kelly’s own song, which touches on Don Dale, asylum seekers, and blackface, and includes a prescient line from Briggs: “The date’s changin’”. You can listen here. Meanwhile, they announced they would be serving booze in the media room – which pretty much never happens – garnering a bigger applause than even Lorde. A music history lesson Mick Fleetwood has just spoken in the press room, promoting his latest book, Love That Burns, which tells the story of the early years of Fleetwood Mac. “Most of you do not know how that band started,” he says, wearing a bright blue suit, yellow shirt and feathered hat – looking more like a Wiggle than a legendary drummer. This book is about a sort of unknown period in the life and career of Fleetwood Mac. The chronicle from 1967, when Peter and myself and John and Jeremy Spencer formed Fleetwood Mac right through to just before Stevie and Lindsay, the band that you probably know about. There are only 2,000 copies available, says Fleetwood, who then reminisces about his early years in 60s London, which sound pretty amazing. England was aglow with fashion, hairstyles, sociological changes, a whole revolution. We were just a little part of that with this strange blues movement, the likes of Eric Clapton and the Yardbirds and even Elton John had a band called Bluesology. Can you believe it’s been 50 years, asks media host Robbie Buck. “I can,” Fleetwood says, taking off his hat to reveal his bald head. “It’s been a long road.” Incidentally, why isn’t this happening? Best video – Bliss n Eso, Moments Look, I know Australian hip hop is not everyone’s cup of tea, but this video is adorable. Best rock album – Gang of Youths, Go Farther in Lightness Gang of Youths have just won best rock album for Go Farther In Lightness – their second win for tonight and their third in total so far, after winning producer of the year in the artisan categories. Lead singer David Le’aupepe accepted the award, saying: We believe in the redemptive power of rock and roll music. Rock and roll saves a lot of lives, in my opinion. To those who tell us how much we helped them, thank you. Paul Kelly has won for best adult contemporary album, for Life is Fine. The rock legend has seven nominations tonight. This is his 4th win in this category. Said Kelly: A lot of people helped make this record. It’s a big team effort, first of all my band, Peter, Bill, Ash, Dan, Cameron, Vicky and Linda. It was a fun record to make. We reviewed the album back in August. Reviewer Andrew Stafford said it had “some of his best songs in years”. A good point: Meanwhile, Lorde is performing Liability, from her album Melodrama. She wrapped up her Australian tour with a show in Melbourne on Sunday night. Those following at home will be able to watch her performance in an hour or so, when the broadcast begins. Lorde skipped the red carpet. She is also up for best international artist, but if twitter is any indication her fans were severely outvoted by Harry stans. A.B. Original have just won in the best urban category for their 2016 release Reclaim Australia, which also took out the Triple J J award for album of the year last week. Said Briggs: We made this album for our community, in our community, from our community. Change doesn’t come from everyone being comfortable. We made ourselves extremely uncomfortable trying to make this record, trying to upset all those rednecks, but we did it ... They were vocal, but we just had the better album. Sydney metalcore band Northlane have won best hard rock and heavy metal album for their 2017 release Mesmer. It’s their fourth album. Harry Styles is team lyrebird, confirmed. Back on Harry for a second, because photos of his suit have come through and it is excellent. While there are no Australian birds that are a direct parallel to this double-breasted purple paisley delight, I think it is spiritually closest to the lyrebird and am hereby registering that as Styles’s official Bird of the Year vote. A number of these fans, some of whom began openly sobbing when Harry arrived, have been waiting on this hot patch of concrete for more than 24 hours. Here’s a full look at that suit, which is excellent. One of the Wiggles (I can’t remember which) said that they had heard he had been accused of copying Cate Blanchett, which is probably the best style decision any of us can make. For our international readers attracted by the glittering bait of Harry Styles, this is what a lyrebird looks like. They are excellent mimics. Amy Shark has just won best pop release for her album Night Thinker. We have no audio in the media room, so Calla will have to fill you in on her speech, but on the red carpet earlier she told Guardian Australia: I have been watching these awards my whole life, and I never thought that I would get to play them or be up for any of them. So I’m overwhelmed. Playing US talkshow The Late Late Show, hosted by James Corden, this month was “such an amazing experience”. The same night that I was on Kim Kardashian was there and Ludacris was there, and I think that was a real moment for me to realise, This was such a big deal. Everyone’s treated like queens on that show.” She says Kardashian gave her a little wave in the dressing room. I think she knew I’m this little Australian that’s playing on this big show, had to give me a bit of encouragement. She was lovely, and really funny too. An update from inside the media bunker The media have been swept up from the red carpet outside into a new room at the Star Casino, from which we will be covering it: the Iain Shedden Memorial Media Suite, named for the Australian’s well-respected and well-loved music writer who died last month. All media assembled have been handed out cider – “his favourite drink” – to toast to Sheddy, who the media room’s host, Robbie Buck, called “an extraordinary man, an extraordinary journalist, an extraordinary music journalist, and also a great musician”. Said Buck: Iain was a fellow who lived music. He was able to write about music in a way that brought you into the very essence of it ... at the heart of it, outside of all the glitz and the glamour, he was able to share that thrumming joy of what good music does to all of us, to give us that sense of electricity. As the night proceeds, Aria winners will be wrangled and brought to this room so we can hassle them with more questions about birds. In real time, the actual awards start very soon ... ‘These are old issues’ Before offering their very important views on the negative profiling involved in Bird of the Year and calling the noble ibis a bin chicken, AB Original’s Briggs and Trials also weighed in on Triple J’s decision. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, has already said he wants the ABC board to reject the change, which called a “political decision” that would “delegitimise Australia Day.” To which I assume Triple J would respond: Yes. That was the point. Said Briggs to Steph Harmon: I think it’s a good trajectory for the industry, and it’s also a good indication of how the majority of people feel. They’re reasonable folks who know that Australia Day is trash and we can’t enjoy the countdown that includes our songs on that day. So it was a smart thing for the Js to do, so we appreciate their step towards equity and inclusivity. Steph: Do you think the pressure you put on it was part of the decision? Briggs: Yeah I put many bricks through their window [laughs]. Many bricks. Trials: The brick budget was out of control. A lot of people were consulted and that’s what we found beautiful about the process, was that they spoke to community and spoke to a lot of voices that are important, that we look up to. We’re just a sounding booth for our communities you know. The AB Original song January 26 has been seen as a galvanising force for the Change The Date movement, and it certainly gave it an anthem. But they say they did not write it with the intention of riding a growing wave of dissent about Australia Day. It’s a “very old issue”, Trials says. We made this record because it didn’t exist. To birds: Briggs and Trials are both #teamcassowary, but say it is unfair to call the ibis a bin chicken when it has been displaced and moved to the margins because humans have invaded its habitat. No political message there. ‘It’s a beautiful gesture’ Before Harrymania struck, Naaman Zhou had the opportunity to chat to Dan Sultan about Triple J’s decision to move the Hottest 100 from 26 January to a floating date centred around the fourth weekend in January. Said Sultan: It’s a beautiful gesture. It’s not the answer but it’s a step in the right direction. For anyone to not show any empathy towards Aboriginal people and what we go through, particularly on that day … that day commemorates the beginning of the ongoing genocide of our people. Empathy is important, it shows a sign of intelligence and it shows a sign of compassion and it’s the difference between whether you’re an arsehole or a nice person … Just because it doesn’t affect you doesn’t mean that you can’t be affected by it. It’s very important, it’s magnificent and I’m very proud to be an Australian. And I’m very proud to have a bit to do with Triple J as well. And anyone who doesn’t like it, they’re not necessarily bigots or racists, but they can get fucked. Sultan is up for three Arias for his latest album Killer, including best male artist, but he also featured on AB Original’s track January 26 about changing the date of Australia Day to one less offensive to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. He’ll be performing later tonight with Paul Kelly and AB Original, so watch this to get in the mood. Some people in the Harry crowd (let’s be honest, they are not here for anyone else) have been waiting outside the venue since noon YESTERDAY. One young woman says Harry stole her pen, and she seems ecstatic about it. Harry fan: I saw him and it changed my life. Joel Creasey: How did it change your life? Fan: Because I saw him and it fulfilled me forever. That seems to have wrapped up the red carpet. Owing to a rather confusing quirk of programming the ceremony will begin in real time very shortly but will not be broadcast until 7.30pm. So we will bring you the awards as they are announced, and then again as they happen in TV land. Feels rather ridiculous to make this a key event, but red carpet interviews just abandoned an interview with Briggs and Trials of AB Original (up for six awards including album of the year for Reclaim Australia) to RUN to where Styles is signing autographs. We have now entered the post Harry part of the evening. I’m keen for a closer look at that suit, which appears to be some kind of purple patterned number. More important Sophie Monk news: Sophie Monk can’t read a teleprompter, and other charming facts Sadly, technical difficulties prevent us from bringing you an interview with Bachelorette Sophie Monk and publican/group date winner Stu. But please enjoy these excerpts from Sophie’s red carpet interview with Joel Creasy. Monk is presenting an award tonight, although she can’t remember which. More birds! Guardian Australia’s culture editor, Steph Harmon, has encouraged the objective best band in the country, the Wiggles, into an exclusive bird-themed live a cappella performance. You are welcome. In other bird news, we have one vote for the sulphur-crested cockatoo and one that I’m going to give to the rainbow lorikeet, because frankly the ibis doesn’t need the help. I’m also going to take this coordinated dressing by the Preatures as a vote for the flame robin. So, who’s actually nominated? Gang of Youths is heading into the night with the most nominations, with a stake in eight categories. It’s already won one for producer of the year. Paul Kelly is next with seven nominations, including album of the year and best male artist. His album Life Is Fine has already won two, for best engineer and best cover art. The Gold Coast singer Amy Shark is up for six nominations, including album of the year for Night Walker. AB Original is also up for six nominations, as is Jessica Mauboy and Illy. Illy has just walked down the red carpet with a bittersweet reminder about the ephemeral nature of Arias nominations. He tells the red carpet hosts that he was nominated for six last time around and walked away with none. The one he’s really after is best live act because, he says, his tour was so extensive that it even went to Exmouth, which is about 1,200km north of Perth. This evening looks set to be divided into two halves: before Harry Styles arrives, and after. Styles is nominated for best international artist for his debut, self-titled album. The category is decided by Twitter vote and the highly motivated global Harry fandom has responded in force. If Styles wins, it will be his sixth international Aria in a row. The award was only created in 2010, and One Direction, his former band, won for five years straight from 2012. But before the Harrymania begins, let’s take a quick look at the red carpet. It’s the Australian music industry’s night of nights and the eyes of the world are on Sydney’s Star Event Centre to see if Harry Styles has arrived yet. My Guardian colleagues Steph Harmon and Naaman Zhou are lassoing stars as they walk down the red carpet to ask them very important questions, like who they voted for in the inaugural Bird of the Year poll. Dave Le’aupepe, frontman for Gang of Youths which is nominated for eight Arias including album of the year, has voted AGAINST the ibis, which is leading the poll. I think this counts as a musical bird vote: No word yet on Harry’s favourite bird, but I expect Steph to elbow her way to the front and bring the people what they want. Also yet to give his crucial bird of the year vote is Hall of Fame inductee Daryl Braithwaite. Braithwaite will perform Horses, because of course. He says being inducted is an honour but he did not embark on a musical career with the aim of getting into the Aria hall of fame, which would admittedly be a very specific and lofty goal. He says: It really is an honour, you don’t really start out with this in mind, your start out with a love of music. The red-carpet host Joel Creasey asks if Braithwaite thinks he can top Tina Arena’s 2015 hall of fame performance of Chains, which you can watch here. He is not sure, but says he will have two “special guests”. The red carpet is being livestreamed on Twitter, but the broadcast doesn’t start on Channel Nine until 7.30pm. Grab some fizzy water, your birds of Australia guide, and settle in. It’s going to be a big night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/29/australian-shareholders-should-be-told-climate-risk-to-profits-says-thinktank","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T17:01:10Z","webTitle":"Australian shareholders should be told of climate risk to profits, says thinktank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/29/australian-shareholders-should-be-told-climate-risk-to-profits-says-thinktank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/29/australian-shareholders-should-be-told-climate-risk-to-profits-says-thinktank","fields":{"headline":"Australian shareholders should be told of climate risk to profits, says thinktank","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australian companies need to start developing sophisticated scenario-based analyses of climate risks, and incorporating them into their business outlooks so shareholders know how climate change will affect profitability, a thinktank has said. However, the Centre for Policy Development (CPD) said companies needed to do so in a standardised way, so investors and regulators were able to easily understand economy-wide risks to whole industries. The progressive thinktank urged Australia’s biggest businesses to use the Paris climate agreement as the centrepiece for their scenario planning, saying it provided a credible, long-term anchor for policies that limit global warming to well below 2C. The group has released a discussion paper, called “Climate horizons: next steps for scenario analysis in Australia”, explaining the best way to do so. Australia’s financial regulator warned in February that climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Geoff Summerhayes, from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), told the Insurance Council of Australia’s annual forum in Sydney in February that Apra wanted companies to start incorporating “scenario-based analysis” of climate risks into their business outlooks. He said Apra intended to start running stress tests of the financial system to see if it would survive various climate shocks, and all Apra-regulated entities would need to adapt to the coming regulatory changes. “I think the days of viewing climate change within a purely ethical, environmental or long-term frame have passed,” Summerhayes said. The CPD’s new discussion paper suggested how Australian businesses could be consistent with the country’s international climate commitments under the Paris agreement and with the leading international framework for robust climate disclosures, the Financial Stability Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD). It said businesses ought to try to develop a standardised approach to scenario-based analysis, and that all scenario analyses should include: A scenario that is genuinely consistent with Paris targets. It should therefore incorporate a high probability of limiting warming to below 2C, and towards 1.5C A scenario that includes the physical impacts of climate change, not just transition risks Engage with the most relevant sectoral or regional scenarios and resources available Be transparent about assumptions and parameters used to develop the scenarios, in line with the TCFD disclosure framework Show evidence that management is overhauling their business models in response to scenario analysis results Sam Hurley, the CPD’s policy director, said shareholders, courts and regulators like Apra clearly expected businesses and investors to prepare for climate change and also for the major physical impacts that are likely even if severe global warming of 2C or more is avoided. CPD fellow Kate Mackenzie, a co-author of the paper, said many of the climate reference scenarios used by businesses only had a 50% chance of keeping global warming to 2C or less. “Business-as-usual approaches have us on track for warming of three degrees or more, which would be incredibly damaging both economically and environmentally,” she said. “Scenario analysis work that does not factor in robust Paris-consistent scenarios will mean companies and investors underestimate the scale of the risks present and transitions required to meet Paris targets – and the opportunities that this transition will also create.” The CPD discussion paper will be discussed at a public forum in Sydney on Wednesday. Summerhayes will be speaking at the event, along with Steven Skala, the chair of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Christina Tonkin, the managing director of specialised finance at ANZ, and new CPD board member Sam Mostyn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/28/america-crisis-republican-tax-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T15:05:38Z","webTitle":"America is in crisis.

The Republican tax plan will make that worse","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Donald Trump was sworn in as president last January, the nation faced several domestic crises. In many places, infrastructure is a disaster, highlighted by the I-35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Flint’s perilous water system and New York’s decaying, delay-plagued subways. Then there’s the largely unrecognized retirement crisis. One-third of American workers are saving nothing for retirement, and more and more workers in their late 60s and early 70s say they simply don’t have the money to retire. The US also faces a college affordability and student debt crisis. A year at a public university typically costs more than $20,000 – a hefty price tag for many families when median household income is $59,000. Total student loan debt has soared above $1.3tn, and more than two-thirds of college graduates borrow to go to school. Their average debt upon graduation is about $35,000, triple the level of two decades ago. And the poverty crisis has not gone away. Nearly 41 million Americans live below the poverty line, with nearly one in five children living in poverty. Unfortunately, Mr Trump and Congress have largely ignored these crises since inauguration day. Instead, turning their backs on good governance, the president and congressional Republicans are focused like a laser beam on heaping riches on two constituencies that are definitely not in crisis: corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Corporation profits are near their highest levels in history, while revenues from the corporate income tax have dropped to just 2% of GDP, down from 6% in the 1950s. And the richest 1% of Americans now receive 20% of overall national income, double the level in 1980 and the highest level in nearly a century – since the Roaring Twenties. Real after-tax income for households in the top 1% has nearly tripled since 1980, rising more than four times faster than for middle-class households. Even though corporate America and the rich are doing more than fine, the Trump administration and Congress are rushing to push through tax cuts that mainly help business and the wealthiest Americans. A recent Washington Post headline said it all: “Senate tax bill would cut taxes of wealthy and increase taxes on families earning less than $75,000 by 2027.” The Republican tax plan goes out of its way to reward those who least need additional financial rewards, and there is evidently only one reason Republican lawmakers are doing this – to please ultra-wealthy campaign donors and corporate donors who hate taxes and are demanding that Trump and the Republicans rack up some, indeed any, legislative “win”. Sadly, there have not been congressional hearings to examine and shine some light on what would be the biggest tax overhaul in three decades. A very unfortunate, but little-discussed aspect of the legislation is that by increasing the national debt by a projected $1.5tn, and perhaps $2tn, the plan would make it far harder for the nation to address the pressing domestic crises I mentioned above – and that doesn’t even include the damage from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. In some ways, the tax plan, believe it or not, would worsen several of our domestic crises. Amazingly, Congress’s own joint committee on taxation has found that the Senate plan would, in the out years, raise taxes most percentage-wise on the poorest households, specifically those making less than $30,000 a year. With millions of senior citizens facing a financial squeeze or downright poverty, the tax bill would make things worse for many seniors by triggering an automatic $25bn cut in Medicare next year – and probably more such cuts in subsequent years. As the federal deficit and debt soar because of the tax plan, congressional Republicans will no doubt push all the harder to rein in deficits by cutting social security and Medicare, further hurting the nation’s senior citizens. And that at a time when social security is a lifeline for millions of seniors – one-third of Americans over age 65 receive 90% or more of their income from social security. The tax bill would unarguably exacerbate the college affordability crisis. In what looks like a concerted assault on higher education, the legislation would vastly increase taxes on more than 100,000 graduate students, end the tax break for student loans and make employer-provided tuition assistance taxable. Moreover, by taxing university endowments for the first time, the legislation would mean that many schools have less money for student financial aid. During last year’s campaign, in a move cheered by blue-collar voters, Mr Trump vowed to spend $1tn on infrastructure – to rebuild the nation’s decaying roads, bridges, airports and rails. But the Trump administration has consigned infrastructure to the back burner, and Mr Trump’s promise of $1tn has mysteriously been replaced by talk of just $200bn. With the tax plan expected to balloon the national debt by $1.5tn, don’t be surprised if many Republican lawmakers – who traditionally rail against increased spending – end up fighting all out against any halfway ambitious infrastructure plan. In many ways, the Republican tax plan is a hypocrisy generator. Many Republicans who repeatedly thundered against deficits when Obama was president now can’t wait to increase the nation’s deficits and debt so long as it means tax cuts. Bob Corker has said he would oppose a tax plan that increases the deficit – will he stay true to his word or be hypocritical? Susan Collins has said she’ll oppose any tax bill that cuts taxes for millionaires – will she adhere to that promise or turn hypocritical. John McCain says he will oppose legislation unless the Senate returns to regular order with real hearings – will he be true to his word? Jeff Flake has denounced the ocean of Trump lies. Will he now vote for a bill that’s marketed with falsehood after falsehood, among them that the bill will only increase taxes on millionaires and that the tax cuts will somehow pay for themselves? In short, the Republicans’ tax plan is a rejection of good governance and sound policy. It would comfort the already very comfortable and further afflict many of the afflicted – all while causing the national debt to soar and leaving less money to address the true crises our nation faces."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/27/aung-san-suu-kyi-loses-freedom-of-oxford-over-rohingya-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T22:02:51Z","webTitle":"Aung San Suu Kyi loses Freedom of Oxford over Rohingya crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/27/aung-san-suu-kyi-loses-freedom-of-oxford-over-rohingya-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/27/aung-san-suu-kyi-loses-freedom-of-oxford-over-rohingya-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Aung San Suu Kyi loses Freedom of Oxford over Rohingya crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Aung San Suu Kyi has been formally stripped of the Freedom of the City of Oxford award over her response to the repression of her country’s Rohingya Muslims. Oxford city council voted unanimously to permanently remove the honour given to the de facto leader of Myanmar in 1997, and said it did not want to celebrate “those who turn a blind eye to violence”. Oxford councillors had previously voted to support a cross-party motion to remove the award, and made the decision official in a vote on Monday evening. The vote comes on the same day Myanmar’s powerful army chief told Pope Francis there is “no religious discrimination” in Myanmar. Over 600,00 Rohingya Muslims have been driven from Rakhine state in western Myanmar into neighbouring Bangladesh through a series of military operations, which the United Nations has described as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”. Cllr Mary Clarkson (Lab), who proposed the motion, told the BBC: “Oxford has a long tradition of being a diverse and humane city, and our reputation is tarnished by honouring those who turn a blind eye to violence. We hope that today we have added our small voice to others calling for human rights and justice for the Rohingya people.” In 2012, Suu Kyi was celebrated with an honorary doctorate from Oxford, and held her 67th birthday party at St Hugh’s college, where she studied politics, philosophy and economics between 1964 and 1967. But in recent months she has attracted growing criticism for her response to the Rohingya humanitarian crisis. In September, the governing body of St Hugh’s decided to remove a painting of her from its main entrance, days before the start of the university term and the arrival of new students. In October, undergraduates at St Hugh’s voted to remove the Myanmar leader’s name from the title of their junior common room. So far, Oxford has decided not to reconsider Suu Kyi’s honorary degree.

Addressing Native American veterans, Trump repeated a favorite taunt about Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, a political opponent who he refers to derisively as “Pocahontas”. “You were here long before any of us were here,” Trump said, speaking to the veterans from a podium placed in front of a portrait of US president Andrew Jackson. “Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas.” Trump has repeatedly mocked Warren over her claim of Cherokee ancestry by calling her Pocahontas, who was the daughter of a powerful Native American leader in 17th century colonial Virginia whose legacy was romanticized in the Disney film of the same name. During the campaign, Trump’s use of the nickname drew loud whoops and cheers. But on Monday, the audience remained silent. Warren, a progressive icon from Massachusetts who has a long record of sparring with Trump, later said it was “deeply unfortunate” that “the president of the United States cannot even make it through a ceremony honoring these heroes without having to throw out a racial slur”. The White House disputed that characterization and blamed the senator for not being forthright about her ancestry. “I think what most people find offensive is Senator Warren lying about her heritage to advance her career,” Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary said on Monday. Challenged over Warren’s description of it as a “racial slur”, Sanders replied: “I think that’s a ridiculous response.” She denied that the president had insulted elderly guests who served the nation during the war. “The president certainly finds an extreme amount of value and respect for these individuals which is why he brought them and invited them to come to the White House, spent time with them, recognizing and honoring them today.” As Sanders left the briefing room, a reporter shouted a question about why Trump’s remarks took place under a portrait of Andrew Jackson, notorious for forced removals of Indians. She did not respond. The line of attack of Warren’s ancestry stretches back to her 2012 senatorial campaign, when it was revealed that she had listed herself as a minority while working at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Harvard Law School. Warren has said that she believed her family had Cherokee ancestors, though critics have argued that she sought to gain an unfair advantage by claiming Native American roots. Both universities have denied that race was a factor in her hiring. Trump held the ceremony honoring the Navajo code talkers in the Oval Office, where he has hung a large portrait of Jackson, who in 1830 signed the Indian Removal Act that led to the forced removal, relocation and deaths of thousands of Native Americans from the American South. The Navajo “code talkers” used their native language to create a secret means of communication that helped the Allied forces gain on Japan in the Pacific theater. At the ceremony, the three code talkers described their experience during the battle of Iwo Jima. Trump hailed the men as “special people”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/27/brighton-crystal-palace-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T22:30:13Z","webTitle":"Brighton and Crystal Palace get set for latest bout in the oddest of rivalries | Dominic Fifield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/27/brighton-crystal-palace-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/27/brighton-crystal-palace-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Brighton and Crystal Palace get set for latest bout in the oddest of rivalries","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"To many the rivalry is a peculiarity. There is no real geographical proximity to explain the loathing that exists between Crystal Palace and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Even Roy Hodgson, born and bred in Croydon but whose time as a youth-team player at the south London club predates the animosity, needed a history lesson from Jason Puncheon before he truly understood. The same could be said of some of his players. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who hails from up the road in Lewisham, was blissfully unaware of the significance of the fixture until he attended a fans’ event at Boxpark last week and his team-mate Wilfried Zaha took the microphone to address the 1,500 crammed inside the hall. “Wilf was being interviewed and the guy asked him how much he hated Brighton on a scale of one to 10,” said the Chelsea loanee. “Wilf just went: ‘11’, so that tells me everything. I didn’t have a clue before but, when Wilf said that, I realised, OK, they don’t like each other.” The din inside the Amex on Tuesday night should convince any doubters of the depth of feeling surrounding this fixture. Strangely, given this will be only the 11th meeting in 28 years and the first in the top flight since 1981, the animosity is born of familiarity and stems from the clubs rising in tandem from third tier to elite in the late 1970s under the stewardships of Alan Mullery and Terry Venables, team-mates but never friends during their playing days at Tottenham Hotspur. It festered through tussles near the top of the lower divisions, meetings played out to a backdrop of smoke bombs and trouble on the terraces, and a series of FA Cup first-round replays, two of which were aborted because of bad weather, in 1976. The fifth attempt to resolve the fixture, on a neutral venue at Stamford Bridge, was won 1-0 by Palace, though Brighton ended up livid with the performance of the referee, Ron Challis (dubbed “Challis of the Palace” thereafter). The official disallowed Peter Ward’s equaliser for a handball – his marker, Jim Cannon, later admitted to having pushed the striker to force the contact – and then made Brian Horton retake a 78th-minute penalty after spying encroachment, mostly by Palace players. Paul Hammond duly saved Horton’s second attempt. Mullery confronted the referee at the final whistle and had coffee thrown over him by a Palace fan as he departed up the tunnel. “So I pulled a handful of change out of my pocket, threw it on the floor and shouted: ‘That’s all you’re worth, Crystal Palace!’” he said. There was also a two-fingered gesture as he was led away by police, and a subsequent £100 fine for bringing the game into disrepute. Relations have never improved, with collisions forever spiky on and off the pitch. There was a horrific tackle from Palace’s Henry Hughton, brother of the current Brighton manager Chris, which broke Gerry Ryan’s left leg in three places and ended the winger’s career in 1985. Ryan, 29 and a father of two at the time, was in plaster for 15 months. Fast-forward to a second-tier game in 1989 when five penalties were awarded by Kelvin Morton – Palace comically missed three of their four, with John Pemberton’s effort presumably still in orbit – or the mucky intrigue of “poogate” in the play-offs. Brighton, whose nickname “Seagulls” was apparently taken on to drown out the visitors’ recently adopted “Eagles”, have revelled in a 10-game unbeaten run against their bitter rivals that extended eight years into the mid-1980s, including a 3-0 win at Selhurst Park in April 1981 en route to finishing two points above the relegation zone. Palace went down with 19 points. The London club would rather not recall Mullery’s two-year tenure as their manager under the chairmanship of Ron Noades but can point to claiming the Second Division title at Albion’s expense in 1979, to Andy Johnson’s hat-trick in a 5-0 victory in 2002 or to becoming the first visiting team to win a league game at the Amex Stadium in the autumn of 2011. Glenn Murray, a veteran of more than 100 games in his first spell with Albion and now leading their line for a second time, scored for Palace that evening. He registered 31 goals in the following Championship campaign but rupture a cruciate ligament in the first leg of the play-off semi-finals between the clubs at Selhurst Park and was heckled by visiting fans as he departed on a stretcher. He celebrated the victory on the south coast a few days later on crutches. Despite playing such a key part in Albion’s promotion last season, some have never forgiven that defection. “It’s difficult to change people’s perception,” said the striker. “I would like to think the goals would do it but there are still people out there who doubt me and just don’t like me for that one reason – that I joined a rival club.” The Palace chairman, Steve Parish, has since publicly regretted the forward’s sale to Bournemouth in 2015 – he would rejoin Brighton, initially on loan, a year later – and the visitors will be wary of the threat he poses on this reunion. “I had four fantastic years at Palace and was supported really well by the fans so I wouldn’t celebrate, no,” said Murray when asked how he would react to scoring. Palace have their own talisman to whom they can cling on a first visit to the Amex in four years, six months and 15 days. It had been Zaha whose brace dispatched Albion in the play-offs, the visitors having arrived in their dressing room that night to discover human excrement all over the floor in one of the cubicles. The Brighton manager at the time, Gus Poyet, emailed staff trying to discover who had wound up the opposition in such a way but has since suggested it must have been “a lucky poo – it was in their dressing room and they won”. The suspicion is a member of Palace’s entourage had been guilty of the offence but had kept shtum out of embarrassment while Ian Holloway, disgusted by the welcome, was going ballistic. Zaha, developed in Palace’s academy, had his own motivation that night. “The stakes were high and I was nervous because we had played them away before the play-offs and they beat us 3-0, and we did nothing – it was literally like a training-ground game,” he said. “It was a bit nerve-racking not having Muzza going into the second leg but someone had to step up. Scoring those two goals was crazy because I was getting so much stick, even in the warm-up. There was one guy that will always stick in my head – just as I went into the changing room before the game he shouted ‘It’s over’ and I heard him above everyone, so it was nice beating them that day after all the chat.” Few at Selhurst Park failed to note the regular chants of “We’re coming for you” emanating from near the top of the Championship last season as Hughton’s supremely drilled side returned to the elite for the first time in 34 years. “There’s all the chat, them saying they’re coming for us,” Zaha offered up in pre-season. “But we’ve been waiting in the Premier League for you, for ages. Now you’re finally here, you want to talk ...” This fixture will mean as much to the Ivory Coast international as it does to Brighton’s fine centre-half Lewis Dunk, who progressed through Albion’s youth set-up and will be a direct opponent on Tuesday. Each will seek to carry his side’s hopes. Yet, to date, Brighton have had good reason to crow. Hughton’s side have been hugely impressive at the higher level, a well-drilled unit in the top half of the table who have conceded only 14 goals in 13 matches, have lost only once at home and whose defeat at Old Trafford on Saturday was a first in six matches. Palace, in contrast, have fired Frank de Boer after four matches, endured the worst start to a season in top-flight history and have not scored a league goal away from home since April, let alone claimed a point. At least Hodgson is instigating a recovery, with hope fuelled by Saturday’s last-minute success over Stoke. The manager inevitably has plenty of experience of derbies, from San Siro to the Black Country. He never lost to Milan while in charge of Internazionale, despite missing the teams’ first meeting because of the only touchline suspension he has served. “I’d made a cynical remark in the previous match,” said Hodgson. “We were winning at Lazio and the referee added on eight minutes of time, so I said to the fourth official: ‘Why don’t you just play on until they score?’” His first game at West Bromwich Albion was a 1-1 draw with Wolves, and his last taste of a derby on English soil was a 5-1 win at Molineux. This rivalry is less established but all parties will find it just as ferocious."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/27/meghan-on-harry-i-didnt-know-much-about-him-i-just-asked-is-he-nice","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T20:29:54Z","webTitle":"Meghan on Harry: 'I didn’t know much about him, I just asked, \"Is he nice?\"'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/meghan-on-harry-i-didnt-know-much-about-him-i-just-asked-is-he-nice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/meghan-on-harry-i-didnt-know-much-about-him-i-just-asked-is-he-nice","fields":{"headline":"Meghan on Harry: 'I didn’t know much about him, I just asked, \"Is he nice?\"'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Well, I thought they were lovely together, didn’t you, Maureen?” I don’t know a Maureen, but this was nevertheless the conclusion reached by the tiny, soft recess deep in my mind that has somehow resisted calcification by the cynicism that has spread so thickly through the rest that I am almost permanently ballasted by my own contempt. Mishal Husain, who had landed the gig of conducting the post-engagement announcement interview with Prince Harry and his new fiancée, Meghan Markle, was perhaps struggling with a similar tension as she didn’t seem to quite know what to do with her face. She ranged from polite interest to Hard News Sceptic to – by the end – charmed guest. But ’twas no great matter. All eyes were, after all, on the happy couple. And they were happy. They sat close – her holding his hand, rather than the other way around – and added bits to each other’s accounts of how they met (a mutual friend set them up – Meghan “didn’t know much about him – I just asked, ‘Is he nice?’ Because if he wasn’t kind I didn’t really see there was any point”), how Harry proposed (“He got down on one knee!” she said. “Of COURSE!” said he, to make her laugh) and if she’d met the Queen. She has. What was it like, asked Husain. “It was amazing to meet her through his lens; the honour and respect he has for her as the monarch, but also the love he has for her as his grandmother.” “And the corgis,” added Harry, “took to you straight away! I’ve spent the last 30 years being barked at and this one walks in and NOTHING. Just wagging their tails.” “And lying on my feet!” added Meghan gleefully. “I was just like, uh,” said Harry with disgust. This will be one they tell the grandkids. Don’t you think, Maureen? Markle spoke briefly and elegantly about the inelegance, particularly about her mixed race heritage, that they dealt with from the tabloids when their relationship first became public (“Of course it was disheartening…”) and at the end Harry spoke about Diana. Two of the diamonds in the engagement ring are from her collection, “To make sure she’s with us on this crazy journey together!” he said, grinning at Meghan. He thinks his mother and Meghan would be “as thick as thieves” but added, unsmiling for the first time that it was days like today that “I really miss having her around.” Then he rallied. “But with the ring and everything else going on I’m sure she’s with us.” “She’s with us,” Meghan said, with confidence and without sentimentality. Those of us old enough to remember his parents’ anxious, unnatural performance on their engagement day – including the infamous “Whatever love means” response from the 32-year-old Prince Charles standing next to his 20-year-old fiancee barely able to look at the cameras – couldn’t help but notice the contrast. The difference between them and the two articulate, assured equals before us made you faintly believe that progress is possible. That we can learn from past mistakes and not be trapped by or doomed to repeat history. I’m no monarchist, but this is what they’re there for. And ‘Markle and Spencer’, as Twitter user @OverallRichard neatly has them, are lovely together. I know you think so too, Maureen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/06/these-are-my-hardest-moments-as-a-mother-what-are-yours","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"These are my hardest moments as a mother.

What are yours?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A week ago, my five-year-old daughter drew me a map. It was early afternoon and I was in bed, struggling against a migraine and crossing my fingers that my ridiculously expensive prescription medication would kick in soon. The migraine had begun early that morning and by the time I picked her up from kindergarten it was relentlessly hammering away at the right side of my skull; bringing with it the strong nausea and aversion to light, sound and smell it always does. I lay down with a cold washcloth over my eyes, and my daughter busied herself with the intricate work of colouring, taping and cutting paper into dozens of infinitesimally small pieces that are impossible to sweep up. I’d been in my room for perhaps half an hour when I heard the door swing open and her footsteps pad over to the side of my bed. She tapped my shoulder and pulled the washcloth off my eyes. “Mummy, I made you something,” she said in an urgent whisper. I hauled myself up to my elbows and took the paper she offered me, a strangely underwhelming thing made up of dotted lines and a few urgent scribbles. “It’s a map,” she explained. “It shows you what you need to do.” Then, patiently, she pointed at one scribble and explained that this was me, in bed. She told me that I needed to get up and used her finger to trace the dotted line leading from my bed to the second scribble – the stove, as it turns out. “You need to make me something to eat and then go here …” – her finger traced the second dotted line all the way to its final destination – “to my room and read me stories.” All at once, this map became everything terrible and wonderful about being a parent. It was the embodiment of a child’s singular, necessarily self-centered nature; concerned with having their own wants and needs met above all else. It was stark, embarrassing proof that my child felt she needed to draw me instructions for how to properly parent her – to remind me that she needed to eat lunch (of course she needed to eat lunch, how had I forgotten to prepare lunch?) and wanted to have stories read to her instead of entertaining herself alone. It was the frustrating result of the paradox you get used to as a single parent, where no matter how much you love your life as two (or three or four) there are times when things just really would work better with another grownup around, someone to pick her up from school and make lunch and rub my back and convince me to take a second pill if the first one hasn’t worked yet, for God’s sake. I’ve been a single mother since just after my daughter’s second birthday, and this map isn’t the first failed parenting moment I wish could be erased from the registers of time. There was the period of time when she was two and a half and she wouldn’t wear anything but a puppy costume and I just let her, because it was warm, and she was dressed, and who cares, really? There was the time she fell down the steps of a stone patio and sliced her teeth through her bottom lip while I stood just a few feet away, making sure a friend’s wobbly new-walking child didn’t fall. There was the time that she wouldn’t stop talking during my little sister’s wedding and had to be removed from the ceremony by my brother, making the strangest-sounding monotonous moan as she was fireman-carried away under his arm. For me, every single one of these moments comes down to me running out of something I desperately wish I had more of – time, patience, understanding, awareness, forethought, sleep. It’s hard being the only one to predict and remember and anticipate and discipline. Sometimes I would give anything to be able to say to a partner, “Your turn” and check out. Of course, parenting lows aren’t exclusively the result of parenting solo, they’re the result of parenting while working more than a full-time job, parenting while poor, parenting when your extended family lives a continent away rather than down the block. Often, these low points are simply a result of parenting, period. This gig is hard, and it’s sometimes hard to talk about too because the cliches about motherhood are just as tired as we are. We all have these moments. That’s the admission you pay to join the club of parenthood: the cheeks burning while strangers judge your parenting skills; the child shrieking in the post office line; you doing exactly the thing you judged other parents for in your pre-children life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/28/fat-cats-britains-universities-vice-chancellors-salaries-pay","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"The fat cats have got their claws into our universities, and will eat them up | Aditya Chakrabortty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/fat-cats-britains-universities-vice-chancellors-salaries-pay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/fat-cats-britains-universities-vice-chancellors-salaries-pay","fields":{"headline":"The fat cats have got their claws into our universities, and will eat them up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Scandals aren’t meant to happen in British universities. Parliament, tabloid newsrooms, the City … those we expect to spew out sleaze. Not the gown-wearing, exam-sitting, quiet-in-the-library surrounds of higher education. Yet we should all be scandalised by what is happening in academia. It is a tale of vast greed and of vandalism – and it is being committed right at the top, by the very people who are meant to be custodians of these institutions. If it continues, it will wreck one of the few world-beating industries Britain has left. Big claims, I know, but easily supportable. Let me start with greed. You may have heard of Professor Dame Glynis Breakwell. As vice-chancellor of Bath University, her salary went up this year by £17,500 – which is to say, she got more in just one pay rise than some of her staff earn in a year. Her annual salary and benefits now total over £468,000, not including an interest-free car loan of £31,000. Then there’s the £20,000 in expenses she claimed last year, with almost £5,000 for the gas bill – and £2 for biscuits. I knew there had to be a reason they call them rich tea. Breakwell is now the lightning rod for Westminster’s fury over vice-chancellor pay. As the best paid in Britain, she’s the vice-chancellor that Tony Blair’s former education minister, Andrew Adonis, tweets angrily about. She’s the focus of a regulator’s report that slams both her and the university. She’s already had to apologise to staff and students for a lack of transparency in the university’s pay processes – and may even be forced out this week. But she’s not the only one. The sector is peppered with other vice-chancellors on the make. At Bangor University, John Hughes gets £245,000 a year – and lives in a grace-and-favour country house that cost his university almost £750,000, including £700-worth of Laura Ashley cushions. Two years ago, the University of Bolton gave its head, George Holmes, a £960,000 loan to buy a mansion close by. The owner of both a yacht and a Bentley, Holmes enjoys asking such questions as: “Do you want to be successful or a failure?” Yet as the Times Higher Education observed recently, he counts as a failure, having overseen a drop last year in student numbers, even while being awarded an 11.5% pay rise. Compare these fortunes to that of rank-and-file university teachers, who have seen only a 1% rise in their basic pay in the last year. Or consider that on the sector’s own statistics, most academics are on some form of casual contract, including being paid by the hour for marking and teaching. It is not uncommon in English and Welsh universities for students to pay £9,000 a year to be taught by an academic who isn’t earning that much. Reporting last year, I met one lecturer at a Russell Group university who had until recently worked a total of five jobs a week, including as a binman. Bring up such examples and the universities will spin you a version of what Rick Trainor, former principal of King’s College London, once said: “If you want the best, you have to pay the best.” What they won’t mention is the finding of the University and College Union that more than seven out of 10 vice-chancellors are either members of the committees that set their pay, or can sit on them – as Bath’s Breakwell did. If this were just about individual greed, we could sling out a few bad apples and carry on. But what’s rotten in universities is the rules observed by the people at the top. And what’s at risk is the reputation of our entire higher education system. Let us revisit Bath. Like nearly all British universities, it is a charity that is committed to serving the public good, as recognised by the public with tax exemptions. As with most charities, the buck stops not with its vice-chancellor but with the trustees – or, as they are termed at Bath, the council. These are the people the public rely on to challenge management and uphold the institution’s values. Bath has 26 councillors, including the vice-chancellor and a smattering of representatives from faculties and students. By far the biggest number – 14 – come from outside the university, and what’s striking about them is how many are from finance or business: the CVs burst with names including Rothschild Asset Management. Councillors from the auditing giant PwC alone outnumber student representatives. The committee that sets Breakwell’s pay is chaired by a commercial lawyer, with two other positions held by someone from PwC, along with the head of a construction company. These aren’t people who will argue with a vice-chancellor getting half a million pounds. They won’t bat an eye over jacking up rents for students, even though Bath is already making millions out of its accommodation. I wouldn’t expect such a narrow club to raise questions over the university’s use of zero-hours contracts. Nor are they representative of Bath, where there is a serious housing shortage and growing resentment over local inequalities. Directors of an accountancy? Sure. But not guarding the values of a charitable enterprise and a place of intellectual enquiry. Ten years ago, British finance was held up to the rest of the world as a joke – full of flyboys paying themselves truckloads of money and running some fine old institutions into the ground. The result was a crash, a bailout and an economic slump that still drags on. Yet the people running our universities are now busy importing that failed model, along with all its business bullshit. If they succeed, they will trash our higher education system. At Manchester University, half the outside trustees come from business and finance. There is no major non-profit figure, nor a housing association representative (which would make sense, given the university provides a lot of student housing). There is, however, a lot of AstraZeneca, where the university’s vice-chancellor Nancy Rothwell has served as a non-executive director: two members of her leadership team come from the pharmaceutical firm, while three trustees are either current or former employees. The university justifies this as just deserts for “a big, local employer”. What they couldn’t tell me was why they didn’t offer such representation to the Bishop of Manchester (as the university used to do) or to a major trade unionist. When the university managers launched a plan to make 140 academics redundant, they didn’t even bother to consult the senior academic body of the senate. Rothwell also sat on her university’s pay committee, according to the UCU, as did Hughes and Holmes. They talk about making the university world-class while threatening its world-class school of languages with swingeing cuts. The result has been extraordinary: just as happened at Bath, staff at the school of languages have passed a vote of no confidence in their university’s management. Some have left; others have simply lost the goodwill that traditionally underpins academia. Our universities, the NHS and the BBC: three things that the rest of the world admires about Britain. It is no coincidence that all of them derive their values and ethics from outside the marketplace. If we want to ruin them, the quickest way is to bring in the values of finance and business – of profiteering from students, sweating academics and handing riches to the management. • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/there-are-lessons-to-learn-from-a-decade-of-political-instability","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T04:52:43Z","webTitle":"There are lessons to learn from a decade of political instability | Peter Lewis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/there-are-lessons-to-learn-from-a-decade-of-political-instability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/there-are-lessons-to-learn-from-a-decade-of-political-instability","fields":{"headline":"There are lessons to learn from a decade of political instability","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This weekend marks the 10th anniversary of the swearing in of the Rudd government and the beginning of a lost decade for Australian progressives. It’s easy to remember the excitement of the times – a wild election night that had seen only the fifth change of government since 1949, the ascension of Australia’s first baby boom leader and a sitting prime minster rejected by his own electorate. With a promise to restore workers rights, a bipartisan commitment to action on climate change and a community sector that had staked out homelessness as a national priority, Australia felt on the verge of a great leap forward. 10 years on, we have a union movement under unprecedented attack by a new government agency politically focussed on its annihilation, a resurgent coal lobby not just blocking climate action but proposing new mines and rising levels of inequality across the society. What we didn’t know then was that Australia was on the cusp of a period of political instability not experienced since the early days of federation; a decade that has seen five changes of prime Ministers (and counting), all but one of them outside the usual; electoral processes. Having squandered its time in power in two short and largely miserable terms, Labor now stands like an optimist at the pulpit ready to embark on a second marriage, aware of their limitations but hopeful of learning from their mistakes. 2007 was also the year that Essential started the weekly opinion poll, charting national voting intention – plus a bunch of other questions designed to give us a read on the attitudes of the Australian electorate. These figures give us the opportunity to look in the rear view mirror and ask ourselves, where did it all go wrong? And more importantly, what can we learn to make sure it doesn’t happen again? Looking back on the primary vote over the past decade, the most striking thing to note is the increase in voters turning from the major parties. In 2007 the Labor and Coalition shared around 80% of the primary vote – today that share is closer to 70%. Put another way, the minor parties have increased their share of market by 50% over the past 10 years. The rise of the outsider creates different challenges for the two parties. On the left the Greens have consolidated a national vote in the early teens – taking lower house seats off Labor in the inner city at both federal and state level, secured Senate positions in all states, and were part of what was to all intents and purposes a progressive coalition from 2010-13. For Labor, where the differences tend to be of degree rather than direction, the Greens influence is to push Labor further to the left, to move harder and faster than if they were simply focussed on the centre ground. The Greens threat is targeted in the high-income inner city areas, where the most progressive Labor candidates tend to hold seats. While threatening these candidates at the ballot box, they also empower them to push their parties to bolder economic and social policies. With the mature leadership on both sides, the opportunity exists for the Greens to push into high-income Liberal areas and begin to shift the electoral needle in more fundamental ways. The challenge to the right is more complex and existential. The rise, fall and rise again of One Nation, the brief emergence of Palmer United, the clustering around high-profile independents like Jacquie Lambie, Bob Katter and Nick Xenophon, and now the emergence of the Australian Conservatives, represent a nativist political force. Rather than a contest of degrees, these candidates represent a fundamental challenge to the Coalition’s pro-business growth model and a practical challenge to the rural National party at the accommodations they make to maintain the Coalition. On economic policy, the their economic protectionism is at odds with the Liberal market fundamentalism; on immigration their creeping xenophobia is an affront to affluent Liberals. As the Queensland LNP discovered on the weekend, there is no obvious way of reconciling these contradictions. The real disruption of these new players though is their impact in the way the major parties engage in the political contest: no longer just with each other, but with their energised fringes. And if fighting elections against these new forces is a challenge, finding ways of building alliances in government will prove even more challenging, though inevitable. Another symptom of the instability has been the wild fortunes of our political leaders. Like a series of slippery slides, political leadership over the past decade has been one of high hopes and rapid disillusionment. Kevin Rudd set the standard with his extended honeymoon, which abruptly ended when he walked away from an emissions trading scheme. Julia Gillard was dragged down by a mixture of her own political shortcomings and the ruthless negative campaigning of her opponents (both external and within). Rudd came back with a short burst but was gone as soon as people remembered why they had rejected him. In power the Liberals fared no better. Abbott himself rose more modestly but fell just as sharply over the litany of broken promises that constituted the 2014 budget. Turnbull’s ratings jumped off a cliff the moment it became apparent he had traded in his values for political power. The lesson of the decade is that with the fragmentation of media, the constant news cycle and a decline of party loyalty, the ship of government has become too unstable for one person to steer. When every ship ends up like the Titanic, you can’t really go blaming the captain. If there is one good thing about Bill Shorten’s modest approval levels at the moment, it’s that they prevent him putting himself forward as yet another presidential Messiah-like candidate Instead, Shorten’s Labor dominates the current political cycle as a team effort, a stronger bench and a leader who signals he is prepared to play the team game. He’d hate the comparison, but like John Howard he promises less in the way of excitement. This could be a good thing. And the irony here is the one person he can thank is Kevin Rudd who in his final act – perhaps as an apology to Labor’s lost generation – changed the party rules to deliver structural stability to the Labor leadership. The final trend of the past decade worth contemplating is the drop in trust of public institutions – the web of organisations that constitute civil society. With the significant exception of the ABC, all these institutions have experienced a dramatic demise in public standing, with the majority experiencing single digit high trust levels. The sharp drop was first apparent around 2012, when the hung parliament descended into swamp warfare and the dynamic has not recovered in subsequent years. The problem of a trust deficit for progressive parties is it starves the electorate of faith in the capacity of government to build something better. Even today, when people say they want the government to intervene in areas like energy and economics, low trust undermines their capacity to believe that things can be better. Cynicism has always been the friend of conservatism. As we enter the final weeks of the political year, with all conditions appearing conducive to a new era of Labor government, the lessons of the lost decade are worth re-stating. In a fragmented political world, a pragmatic progressive alliance that focuses on a shared agenda, rather than personality, governing calmly but decisively, ready to rebuild trust in public institutions is the only viable strategy to longevity. Because living through another decade like the one we’ve just had is just not worth contemplating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/28/man-arrested-over-alleged-plan-for-terror-act-in-melbourne-on-new-years-eve","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T05:58:59Z","webTitle":"Man charged over alleged plan for terror act on New Year's Eve in Melbourne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/28/man-arrested-over-alleged-plan-for-terror-act-in-melbourne-on-new-years-eve","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/28/man-arrested-over-alleged-plan-for-terror-act-in-melbourne-on-new-years-eve","fields":{"headline":"Man charged over alleged plan for terror act on New Year's Eve in Melbourne","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A 20-year-old man has been charged in Victoria after counter-terrorism raids on Monday, with police alleging he was involved in preparing for planning a terrorist act in Melbourne on New Year’s Eve. Ali Ali is accused of preparing to commit a terrorist attack and collecting documents to facilitate a terrorist attack. During an appearance at Melbourne magistrates court on Tuesday afternoon he did not apply for bail and is to reappear for a committal mention on 13 March. The Victoria police deputy commissioner Shane Patton said on Tuesday morning the suspect “was intending to use a firearm to shoot and kill as many people as he could in Federation Square area on New Year’s Eve”. “The male is one of our high-risk persons of interest. We have been monitoring him for a very lengthy period of time. He’s an Australian citizen and he is of Somalian parents.” In a joint counter-terrorism operation between state and federal police and intelligence agencies, searches were conducted at two residential properties in the south-western suburb of Werribee and the northern suburb of Meadow Heights, as well as a commercial property in Footscray, in Melbourne’s inner west. The man was arrested just before 3pm on Monday. The search at his home would be “complex”, Patton said. “This male did not access a firearm. I think it is very important that I provide that reassurance to the public,” said Patton. “He has been subject to our active investigation and at no stage did he access a firearm … The arrest means that this threat has been removed. “We are quite confident that there is no risk or no threat to the Victorian community now that we have removed him from society … there is no ongoing threat posed in respect to New Year’s Eve, Christmas or any other area.” Police do not anticipate further arrests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/28/guide-to-britain-princess-meg-prince-harry-fiancee","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"My guide to Britain for Princess Meghan | Terence Blacker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/guide-to-britain-princess-meg-prince-harry-fiancee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/guide-to-britain-princess-meg-prince-harry-fiancee","fields":{"headline":"My guide to Britain for Princess Meghan","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Dear Meghan, May I first of all, with the rest of the nation, offer my heartfelt congratulations to you on your engagement to our very own Prince Harry. When the announcement was issued on Monday by Clarence House, spontaneous applause broke out in the newsrooms of our national newspapers. I’m not ashamed to admit that there were tears in the Royal Affairs Department of this one. Beyond the joy and the laughter, though, there are serious matters to consider. The family that you are about to join cannot be described as entirely normal. Your future father-in-law, for instance, exudes the tense and gloomy dissatisfaction of a man ill at ease with himself and the world. Outside the palace walls, the media gazes in. Already the popular press is gushing about you in a way that old hands will see as oddly menacing – it is waiting for your first wrong move. Elsewhere the dreary old establishment, steeped in snobbery about race, nationality and class, have already found you wanting in all three areas. Within hours of your engagement being announced, a Spectator columnist set the tone, writing: “Obviously, 70 years ago, Meghan Markle would have been the kind of woman the prince would have had for a mistress, not a wife.” You get the picture. It will be a bumpy ride. The British are in a confused state right now, longing to belong to the outside world yet in love with borders; hankering for celebrity and glamour while also disapproving of them. To be honest, we are in a bad place psychologically and, in this sense at least, we have the perfect representatives in the family you are about to join. I would like to cut through the emotion and the carping to offer some practical advice about royal life. Frankly, if you avert your eyes from the gurning contortions of the press and follow these simple guidelines, you won’t go far wrong. On a positive note, you have done very well bringing Guy and Bogart here. This is a nation that likes to believe it is good with animals, and four-legged creatures, canine and equine, are an essential part of the royal image. To avoid confusion, you should probably avoid referring to your dogs as “my boys”, the phrase Princess Diana used to describe your future husband and his brother. Let it be known that Guy and Bogart are rescue dogs, recommended by the American television star Ellen DeGeneres. That mixture of the grim and the glitzy – “from refugee camps to red carpets”, as you once beautifully put it – always plays very well in Britain. You will also be required to kill animals, or at least be around when they are killed. In the royal family, shooting and hunting animals are a valid expression of your love for them. Paradoxically, fans of the Windsors not only forgive the killing but see it as something rather special and distinguished about the family. To be squeamish about these things can cause difficulties. On the subject of families, it would probably be sensible not to talk too much about your own. When it comes to the monarchy, admirers of the royal family are quite traditional: they tend to be suspicious of any new member not belonging to a family of aristocrats who own half of Northamptonshire. And whatever you do, avoid repeating your description of your mother Doria as “free-spirited”. The British, who can be surprisingly sensitive to linguistic nuance, will take this to be code for mad, promiscuous or both. Your new status will involve a change of name, and you will mercifully be able to bid farewell to Markle, which for many Britons sounds uncomfortably close to Merkel. Just as the last royal bride became Princess Kate, a usefully classless name, you should quietly encourage the use of Princess Meg, which has a jaunty lack of pretension without being downright common. Be careful not to say or do anything that might invite the deployment of the expression “Princess Pushy”, a favourite of the press that has not been used for a while. All that may sound rather bland, and so it is. Dullness should be your friend. If you must sparkle, for heaven’s sake do it behind closed doors. The last thing the Windsor family needs is another strong, opinionated, charismatic young woman. That always ends in tears. One final, slightly personal point. Your teeth: they are just a little too white. As a nation that is not dentally blessed, we are sensitive about such things and see excessive oral dazzle (Justin Bieber, Penélope Cruz, Donald Trump) as a sign of vulgarity. Good luck, Princess Meg. We’ll be watching you. • Terence Blacker is the author of Yours, E.R."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/27/sam-allardyce-everton-manager","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T21:01:38Z","webTitle":"Sam Allardyce back in contention to be the next Everton manager","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/27/sam-allardyce-everton-manager","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/27/sam-allardyce-everton-manager","fields":{"headline":"Sam Allardyce back in contention to be the next Everton manager","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Everton are considering fresh discussions with Sam Allardyce regarding him becoming their new manager, after initial talks with the 63-year-old previously broke down when he was first approached earlier this month. Allardyce’s status as a potential candidate once more indicates how desperate Everton have become to find a permanent successor to Ronald Koeman after the first contact with him is thought to have broken down due to the length and terms of the contract he was offered. Five weeks have passed since the Dutchman was sacked on 23 October and David Unsworth, the Everton Under-23 manager, was appointed as caretaker. Yet the team’s form has continued the downward spiral that led to Koeman’s removal. Unsworth has overseen five defeats in his seven games in charge in all competitions, managing just one win. Sunday’s 4-1 loss at Southampton left Everton with 12 points, two above the relegation zone, after 13 matches. After the first round of talks broke down it is understood Allardyce was minded to reject any further overtures from Everton. So if the club is to try and engage with him again, Fahad Moshiri, the owner, may have to offer far better terms for him to reconsider. The move would also signal that Everton have given up on trying to prise Marco Silva from Watford. The Hertfordshire club have made it clear they are not minded to allow the Portuguese to depart, which has narrowed Everton’s options. Should Allardyce be open to any Everton approach he may also ask for a level of control over transfers following what has proved to be the disastrous policy of the summer window, which was overseen by Steve Walsh, the director of football. Walsh joined from Leicester City in what was viewed as coup for the Merseyside club. But following Romelu Lukaku’s £75m sale to Manchester United, Walsh failed to sign a centre-forward to replace a striker whose tally of 88 Premier League goals since 2012 was second only to Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero. After Everton saw their interest in buying Olivier Giroud from Arsenal rebuffed, three players who are natural No10s were instead signed – Wayne Rooney from Manchester United, Gylfi Sigurdsson from Swansea City, and Ajax’s Davy Klaassen. This resulted in Koeman being forced into playing Oumar Niasse on occasion, a No9 who had been out of the first-team picture last year. While the Senegalese has scored six times in nine appearances in all competitions, Everton have only managed 13 league goals this term."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/01/never-send-nudes-whatsapp-groups-survival-guide","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T12:00:42Z","webTitle":"'Never send nudes, and keep swearing tame': a WhatsApp survival guide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/01/never-send-nudes-whatsapp-groups-survival-guide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/01/never-send-nudes-whatsapp-groups-survival-guide","fields":{"headline":"'Never send nudes, and keep swearing tame': a WhatsApp survival guide","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s funny how quickly apps have become shorthand for everyday tasks: we now go on “Tinder dates”, a takeaway is “a Deliveroo”, taxis give way to “getting an Uber”. And when it comes to sharing confidences and keeping in touch, we’re all WhatsApping. The preposterously named app, which sounds like an unwelcome thumbs-up across the dance floor, has become the preferred method of communication for 1.2 billion of us – leaving emails, texts and (obviously) face-to-face conversation in the dust. WhatsApp’s main plus – and quite a big minus, if you think about it – is that anyone can use it. It’s free, and makes chatting in a group really easy – almost too easy, in fact, as you spend half your time being added to random groups and trying desperately to catch up and decipher their in-jokes. Leaving is not an option unless you want to be accused of flouncing. There are unwritten rules waiting to catch you out. How to leave a group is the first thing you need to learn: it’s like checking where all the exits are when you board a plane. Yes, you can mute the group (stopping notifications unless you check); but if you want to cut all ties, seasoned quitters advise making an exit first thing in a morning, when everyone’s too busy commuting to care or re-add you, or slipping out during a particularly busy chat flurry. Or you can be upfront-ish, with language any WhatsApper would understand: no data left to chat, taking a break because of work commitments, jealous partners. A few promises that they can re-add you soon (they’ll forget) and you’ll be blissfully out of the loop but still on everyone’s Christmas card list. If you’re committed to sticking around, you’ll need to locate the mute option pretty fast (group info at top of screen; option is halfway down): perfectly acceptable if you’ve said all you have to say, or the last three replies have been gifs from the same Netflix TV show that you’ve never seen. You’ll also need to prepare your best excuses for when you inevitably forget which group you’re in, and send a message to the wrong people. Pro tip: never send nudes, and keep swearing cheery and tame, in case someone’s screenshotting you and sending it to Mum. And as for anxiety ticks (the blue checks that tell others when you’ve read their message), they’re easy to turn off; but then your friends will set up a private chat about why you’re so secretive and shady. Plus, you won’t be able to see their ticks either, so you’ll never know for sure if they’re ghosting you. Here’s my guide to negotiating the eight groups you’re most probably avoiding right now. Family Flown the nest and feeling nostalgic for Dad’s after-dinner flatulence and Mum’s constant questions about the location of the adjustable spanner? All the “living at home” conversations carry on, in broken grammar and misused emoji. Just like a family Christmas, everyone immediately reverts to type in a WhatsApp chat. Yes, you have a job and a mortgage, but in this group – tweely titled Parentals, Mothership or La Famille Jones – you’re a stroppy teenager again. Eyes roll at your parents’ screeds – “fgs just press SEND after every sentence, Dad” – and molars grind at Mum’s accidental cry-laughing emoji in response to the death of a relative, or use of “selfie” to describe any photo with a face in it. It’s enough to immunise you permanently against homesickness. Say “Mum, please don’t use the aubergine emoji when talking about your dinner.” Don’t say “I’m thinking of spending Christmas abroad this year. That’s OK, right?” *sends gif of Mariah in Santa hat* Arm’s-length friendships You’ve nothing in common any more, other than having been at university together, and there’s enough blackmail material between you to sink all your respective careers, so what better way to maintain the illusion of a friendship than WhatsApp? Group chats play out like soap operas – houses are bought, babies are born, vague promises of catch-up drinks are made – without you ever having to reunite in the flesh. Perfect. Say “Need to catch up soooon. I’ll ping over some dates.” Don’t say “OK, so I’m free on the 20th, 21st and then any day the week after that. Any good? Let’s get it in the diary.” Secret work groups Work email is no longer a thing. It’s too… official. Want to flout HR’s watertight social media policy? WhatsApp to the rescue! Workmates are going underground to share outré opinions, slag off the tea bags in the “shared breakout area” (one clapped-out toaster and a flock-patterned feature wall) and lightly bully each other – the kind of conversations even the office Slack dare not host. The bubble usually bursts around Christmas time, when one excitable colleague gets on the complimentary house red and blurts out a WhatsApp-only secret. It’s over, shut it down. And update your CV. Say Whatever you like, but don’t forget to give all bosses codenames. Don’t say “Hi, this is Ciaran from HR – I think you added me by mistake a couple of weeks ago?” Not cute, mate. Not. Cute. The travel organisers Starting with an ominous “SO GUYS…” the group’s self-appointed senior planner – someone who likes “icebreakers” and company away days – gets to work. Whether they’re arranging a stag or hen weekend, a group holiday or, worse, a wedding, buckle in for repeated deposit requests, “I’ll be online from 3am looking for flights”, “Guys, are we definitely skipping life drawing? What about paintballing?” and rumblings about differing income levels within the group. Not going and never intended to anyway? Cool, but it’s not over for you. Leaving the group makes you a buzzkill, so you’ll have to endure the endless preamble of, “I’m on my way! Line me up a Singapore sling!”, drunken pics of the basics on tour, and banter-packed, hungover reminiscences as everyone makes their way home. Say “Sounds great. Such a shame I can’t make it. Have fun.” Then throw your phone into a body of water. Don’t say “Let me know how much and I’ll see you at the airport.” Again: Phone. Throw. Splash. Streamlined groups WhatsApp’s curse? Any group set up for a specific purpose soon descends into chaos, like “off-topic general discussion” internet forums of yore. Glued to headphones all day, we’re so starved of ephemeral, inconsequential chitchat that even the most specialist of groups – “Enthusiasts of correct orientation for text on a PowerPoint slide” – will soon brim with restaurant recommendations, reviews of last weekend’s Strictly and murky political opinion. Oh, and gifs: there’s always someone who responds to a serious question with a Real Housewives gif. Does this mean yes? Or no? This lack of focus necessitates, eventually, the creation of another group – “TEXT ORIENTATION ONLY PLS” – which goes brilliantly until Anwar from the Wakefield office digs out that gif again. Say “Great! Big fan of centred text for headings.” Don’t say “Slightly off-topic, but…” Bitchy splinter groups Daunting fact: whichever WhatsApp group you’re in, there’s an offshoot dedicated to slagging everyone off. Sometimes you want to bitch about the bitching. And, yeah, Mark is really annoying, isn’t he? And screw what Julia said just now, amiright?! Flipping between the two requires wily efficiency and sharp attention to detail, so you don’t drop a truth bomb in the wrong thread. What’s that? Your group doesn’t have a toxic tributary? I have some bad news: the call is coming from inside the house. Say “I just think Phil’s gif of me spilling tomato juice down myself was in poor taste. He’s a bastard. And so is everyone else, except us.” Don’t say “I’ve screenshotted EVERY word and I am messaging this to Phil NOW.” Housemates Same old arguments – unpaid council tax, washing-up rotas, pleas to stop leaving boxer shorts on the bathroom floor – but this time with the added drama of distance and technology, bitchy digs sent out into the ether and met with deafening silence, with nobody daring to break as the anxiety ticks stack up. See also the drunken message sent out at closing time warning you your housemate will be “bringing a few mates back” or, “I’ve pulled, so best wear some earplugs.” Forewarned is forearmed, and WhatsApp is the perfect set-up for a fiery showdown in the shared kitchen. One could almost become wistful for a good old-fashioned passive-aggressive note taped to the fridge. Say “Sorry about last night. How about a big house dinner to make it up to you guys?” Don’t say “Dunno who owned that chablis in the fridge, but it’s given me gut-rot.” Competitive parents Now that child-rearing is a vocation, rather than something people do to fill up their spare bedrooms, social media is essential for successful, performative parenting. That NCT or nursery group WhatsApp chat might start off as a place to share useful advice, cute pics or meet-up dates, but it’s soon a hive of birthsplaining, endless comparison and thinly veiled poisonous pile-ons. Members lacking, perhaps, regular adult conversation and all sense of nuance means even the most innocent tips or pointers are dismissed with acidic jokes, boasting, gaslighting and derisive contradictions starting, “Well, actually…” until it’s all-out war. Say “Proud mummy!” “Just gorgeous! Well done!” “What would we do without your tips, Stephanie?” Don’t say “Actually I’m FINE with my Hugo’s vocabulary and BTW, Stephanie, your Lola looks like John Bercow.” • Commenting on this piece?

Thanks again for staying with me today. Amy Remeikis will happily be back for all your blogging needs tomorrow. There’s been a fair bit of movement today, most notably on same-sex marriage and the banking inquiry: the same-sex marriage bill passed its second reading stage. It’s the first time either house of parliament has voted in favour of same-sex marriage. The first lot of conservative amendments to the bill were soundly defeated in the Senate, a good sign for Dean Smith and fellow moderates. Earlier today, Labor warned the amendments could stymie the progress of the bill. But quick progress is being made in the Senate. We’re still debating further amendments designed to protect freedom of expression and parental choice (that will continue into the evening). But it now looks likely that the bill will be finished in the Senate by the end of the week and sent to the lower house. The attorney general, George Brandis, delivered a powerful speech to mark the same-sex marriage bill. He described the legalisation of same-sex marriage as one of those “occasional shining moments which stand out in our nation’s history”. The Nationals have put Malcolm Turnbull in a tricky position on the banking inquiry. Two lower-house Nationals MPs are now prepared to cross the floor to support such an inquiry, giving proponents the numbers, so long as the Greens continue to offer their support. Turnbull insisted today that he would not support a royal commission into the banks. He’s holding the line. Senior Nationals such as Matt Canavan and Darren Chester have also spoken against the inquiry, saying it would be a waste of money and time, given 17 inquiries have already been held into the sector. Labor sounds like it is looking favourably on a federal anti-corruption body. It will reveal its formal position before the federal election. But the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the party recognised the growing calls for its creation. An audit of the AFP’s unlawful access of a journalist’s metadata has called for greater training of police on their legal obligations. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, continued his attack on the ABC for changing the date of the Triple J Hottest 100. He has written to the ABC expressing his displeasure and asking for the decision to be reversed. We’ll be back here the same time tomorrow. Please do join us. The Labor senator Sam Dastyari had a short speech on the amendments on parental choice and freedom of expression. He doesn’t support them but thinks they have been put forward in good faith. Some of the commentary about the amendments has been unfair, Dastyari said. The Liberal senator Eric Abetz is back up on his feet shortly after. He says Dastyari’s speech was designed for the ears of western Sydney, a region that opposed same-sex marriage overwhelmingly. Abetz is saying the same-sex marriage bill is compromising basic fundamental human rights. Same-sex marriage, Abetz says, is not a fundamental human right. The simple fact is that the right of parents to guide the moral education of their children is an established right under international law. Nobody disputes that. Same with freedom of speech. Same with conscientious objection. What we are embarking up on with this legislation potentially is to compromise those fundamental rights in favour of something that has been shown time and again not to be a fundamental human right. The international law on that is clear. The Greens have written to the Senate president in protest of the visit of Milo Yiannopoulos to attend and speak at Parliament House. Liberal democratic party senator David Leyonhjelm invited Yiannopoulos. The Greens want his invitation revoked. David Fawcett is on his feet, talking about the anti-detriment shield he is proposing alongside James Paterson. The shield is designed to protect people who oppose same-sex marriage from unfavourable treatment by public authorities. It would, for example, prevent a public service agency from dismissing or threatening to dismiss a public servant for holding a view on same-sex marriage. It doesn’t protect people who threaten or harass someone. Fawcett said: We’re talking here about a view of marriage that has been around for millennia. The concern that is being raised and was raised during the Senate select committee ... is that we have already seen actions by advocates here ... where action has been taken against people, not because they’ve been discriminating but because they have expressed their view. Moving back to the Senate for the moment, where the debate on the same-sex marriage bill has resumed. The Liberal senator James Paterson has introduced amendments to protect freedom of speech, create an anti-detriment shield and protect the rights of parents to pull their children from lessons they don’t like on sexuality or gender. Just a bit more on the ombudsman’s report. It has found the breach was only detected as a result of prompting of the AFP from an external agency. The ombudsman has also warned there is ambiguity about when a journalist information warrant is required, which will no doubt cause concern among media outlets. The ombudsman found: During the course of our inspection, we also identified that there is ambiguity surrounding the circumstances of when a journalist information warrant is required. It appears that the intention of the journalist information warrant provisions is to require a warrant prior to authorising the disclosure of metadata to identify a journalist’s source. It is arguable, however, that those provisions only apply in the more limited circumstance where the authorisation is seeking to access the metadata of a journalist or their employer. That is, if an authorisation was issued for the purpose of identifying a journalist’s source but is not made directly in relation to that journalist or their employer, a warrant is not required. The commonwealth ombudsman has released its report on the federal police’s unauthorised access of a journalist’s metadata earlier this year. In April, the AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin, revealed his officers had inadvertently accessed the metadata of a journalist without the special warrant needed. The professional standards unit (PRS) had accessed the metadata to identify the journalist’s source. Colvin’s office waited three days after informing the ombudsman’s office to tell the public. He was yet to tell the journalist at the time of the public announcement. The ombudsman’s office found a number of factors were involved in the breach, including: insufficient awareness of the requirements for a journalist information warrant within the PRS A failure by the PRS to appreciate their responsibilities when exercising their metadata powers the AFP relied too heavily on manual checks and did not have “strong system controls” in place to prevent unauthorised access It asked the AFP to review its approach to metadata awareness and training. The attorney general, George Brandis, welcomed the report and said the AFP had already made significant progress in implementing its advice. I congratulate the AFP for the cooperative, open and transparent approach it has taken in engaging with the ombudsman throughout this inspection. Metadata is a vital investigative tool, used in virtually all counter-terrorism and serious criminal investigations. Journalist information warrants were one of the additional safeguards introduced as part of the government’s data retention legislation. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, says Labor is closely considering support for a federal anti-corruption body. He said a formal position would be adopted one way or another before the federal election. But he appears to be speaking favourably about the concept. Dreyfus spoke to Sky News a little earlier. We’ve certainly never ruled this out. Labor senators participated in a Senate select committee, which was unfortunately interrupted by the election last year. It was reconstituted after the election and reported in September and the call that that all-party committee made was for the federal government to examine a broad-based anti-corruption agency. The federal government has not responded to that recommendation made in September. We’re looking very closely at this and could not but be impressed by the call from retired judges of the eminence of those you interviewed yesterday. They are but two of a larger group of very eminent retired judges. Between now and the next election, I can say that Labor will adopt a formal position one way or another. And I think I can say on behalf of my colleagues that we are looking and listening to what appear to be rising calls for such a body at the federal level. Watch this space. We witnessed history this morning when the same-sex marriage bill passed its second reading stage. It was the first time either chamber has voted in favour of proceeding with marriage equality. There have been 23 bills dealing with same-sex marriage in the past but only four have previously come to a vote. Photographer Mike Bowers has spent most of the day capturing the colour and movement in the Senate, where same-sex marriage has again dominated. We’re nearly ready to resume the debate on the bill. Until then, have a look at the day through Bowers’ eyes. Liberal senator James Paterson revealed to the Senate earlier today he was a fan of electronic dance music (EDM). The internet, as it tends to do, has taken that morsel and run with it. Good times abound. We mentioned the powerful address given by George Brandis a bit earlier today. We’ve just got some vision through of some of the highlights. And my colleague Paul Karp has written a fuller take on the speech here: The government is using the last of question time to give a Dixer to the communications minister Mitch Fifield on the Hottest 100. The question is met with groans from the opposite side of the chamber. Fifield uses it as another chance to kick the ABC. The ABC shouldn’t be inserting themselves into political debates, apparently. It’s been the soundtrack for Australia Day. The decision taken by the ABC to remove the hottest 100 from Australia Day is quite frankly bewildering. It is one that the government does not support. The questioner, Liberal senator James Paterson, goes on to reveal he doesn’t listen to Triple J. He’s more of an EDM (electronic dance music) fan, he tells the Senate. Lucky there’s nothing important to talk about. Fifield later says he has written to the ABC in protest of the decision. The attorney general, George Brandis, is asked about his comments on Monday, describing One Nation as “poison” for his side of politics. Labor’s Penny Wong asks why, given those comments, the government allowed the Queensland LNP to preference One Nation in 49 seats in the state election. Brandis tells Wong that she is “the last person to be asking that question”. From you of all people, whose government has apparently been elected in Queensland on One Nation preferences, on One Nation preferences. Let that never be forgotten, Mr President. Mike Bowers was down in the chamber for the vote on the same-sex marriage bill amendments earlier this afternoon. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells is using another Dixer to attack Kristina Keneally. I sense a theme emerging. During her attack, Fierravanti-Wells describes Keneally as Bill Shorten’s “girl”. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young jumps to her feet to ask Fierravanti-Wells to reflect on the wording. I’d just ask the minister reflect on the wording ‘his girl’. I’m not sure it’s appropriate. Fierravanti-Wells responds: Considering they were the words that Bill Shorten used the other day, I’m only quoting him. Labor’s Chris Ketter asks the attorney general, George Brandis, whether he can rule out a royal commission or commission of inquiry into the banks. Brandis initially ducks the question. He says there have been 17 inquiries since the global financial crisis. The government has been very, very active in implementing the recommendations of those inquiries. These royal commissions go for years, they report at the end and aggrieved customers would have years to wait until they got any relief. Years to wait until they got any compensation or recompense. Then he follows the line of Malcolm Turnbull earlier today. He says the policy is not to have a royal commission. He says nothing of a commission of inquiry. The new Greens senator Jordon Steele-John has asked why Australia is falling so far behind other nations in improving employment of people with a disability. Steele-John, a noted disability advocate, entered the Senate earlier this month. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, takes his question on behalf of the government. He speaks of the importance of the national disability insurance scheme and the government’s investments in the disability employment services (DES) program. Fifield: I well recall from my period as minister for disabilities, that if you were an Australian with a disability, you were twice as likely to be unemployed than other Australians. I don’t think that there’s anyone in this chamber that would be or could be satisfied by the rates of employment in relation to Australians who have disability. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, is using a dixer on school funding to launch an attack on Kristina Keneally, Labor’s candidate for Bennelong. He’s saying she was responsible for funding cuts to schools in New South Wales in 2010. Labor immediately launches an attack on the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, over the national broadband network (NBN). They are slamming him for delays to some NBN broadband customers – those who use existing pay television cables via the hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) network. Technical issues mean the NBN will be delayed by up to another nine months for such customers. Fifield defends HFC: HFC is and will remain an important technology for the NBN as the CEO of NBN has identified, there are some issues that are being addressed that are readily fixable to do with interference, in terms of spectrum. These are all very fixable, HFC is a good product. Question time is about to start in the Senate. The Senate president, Scott Ryan, is ruling on a fiery question from Greens senator Nick McKim on Monday. McKim asked the government whether it toasted its offshore detention policy as the men on Manus Island were being beaten with metal poles. Ryan rules the question was not out of order. But he tells McKim that he’ll need to be prepared to accept similarly provocative questions and statements about his own actions from the government without complaint. The government spent a fair chunk of question time yesterday attacking McKim for going to Manus and allegedly encouraging men to disobey authorities and remain in the camp. The first amendments to the same-sex marriage bill have been soundly defeated, 41 against to 24 in favour. It’s a strong win for the moderates who want Dean Smith’s bill to pass unchanged. The Senate considered two amendments. One protected civil celebrants for conscientiously objecting to same-sex marriage, without a religious reason necessary. The second amendment created separate sections for man-woman marriage and two-person marriage. There are more amendments on civil celebrants to come at a later stage. Labor’s Penny Wong has warned against amendments for conscientious objection. Those amendments would protect those who conscientiously object to participating in same-sex marriage. This is a very big concept to introduce, to suggest that we should actually have different treatment of Australians, not on the basis of an identified religious belief ... but we should somehow in this debate about marriage equality introduce a new notion of conscientious objection as a basis for not applying the law universally. That is a very unorthodox step and I agree it is an illiberal step. The moderate Liberal senator Dean Smith is in the Senate arguing against the amendments. He says his bill has been in the public sphere for months. It is responsible, it is sensible, it has the support of the community. Smith then slams the amendments proposed by Liberal senators James Paterson and David Fawcett. Beware the Paterson bill was unorthodox, it was illiberal. The Paterson-Fawcett amendments are born of that same ilk. Illiberal, unorthodox. We’re right into the debate on same-sex marriage bill amendments here. The Senate is discussing an amendment that would give civil celebrants protections for refusing to marry same-sex couples. The Greens senator Janet Rice is asking what that would mean, in practice, for her and her partner, who is a trans woman. [Would they be able] to blatantly and quite discriminatingly be able to say, ‘No, we’re not able to marry you’? Rice, as with many on the yes side, has urged against introducing one form of discrimination to replace another. The resources minister, Matt Canavan, a no voter, said the argument works the other way, too. He said without the protections people who held traditional views about same-sex marriage would be discriminated against. It would be “incredibly discriminatory” to people who want to pursue a career as a civil celebrant but don’t agree with same-sex marriage, he said. I think it’s unfortunate therefore that in trying to remove one form of discrimination we would be establishing another form. He said there has been a lack of engagement and consideration for those who do not agree with same-sex marriage. A bit earlier, one of the more vocal Liberal no campaigners, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, accused Labor of abandoning its base in western Sydney by refusing to support amendments to the bill. You’ll remember western Sydney voted strongly against same-sex marriage, including in many Labor seats. I have to say to those opposite you have well and truly forgotten your heartland. You have well and truly forgotten particularly all those people in western Sydney. What is so wrong to afford them now the opportunity of having an equal say? We’ve just heard from another Nationals MP on the banking inquiry. The party is divided over the plan. Two Nationals – senator Barry O’Sullivan and lower house MP Llew O’Brien – are supporting a banking inquiry. The Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, has left open the door to the party supporting the inquiry. Others are not so keen. The transport minister, Darren Chester, is the latest to express his displeasure. He’s told Sky News that the inquiry would be an $150m “lawyers’ picnic”. That $150m could be building better, safer roads in regional communities. It could be saving lives in my community. Kristina Keneally has just appeared in Bennelong alongside the opposition leader, Bill Shorten. Early voting began in the byelection today. Keneally’s opponent, the Liberal MP John Alexander, and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, appeared in Bennelong earlier today. They promised $100m to build a major transport hub in the electorate, designed to relieve congestion. Keneally and Shorten matched the promise. “Does anyone even think he would have visited Bennelong except for Kristina’s determined campaign and Labor’s commitment?” Shorten said. “Kristina Keneally is already paying dividends for the voters of Bennelong and she hasn’t even been elected.” Labor has continued to put pressure on the government over Medicare, delays to the NBN and internal divisions over the banking inquiry. Keneally said Alexander is preferencing a One Nation party member ahead of Labor candidates. Alexander earlier today said he was unaware of any such preference arrangement. The Greens’ party room met earlier this morning. They have considering throwing a wildcard into the quickly changing saga of the banking commission of inquiry. They are increasingly of the view that the Liberal National senator Barry O’Sullivan is not serious about pursuing a proper parliamentary inquiry into the banks. At this stage, they say they are unlikely to support his private member’s bill in the Senate. They say the Senate has already passed a bill to establish a commission of inquiry (co-sponsored by the Greens, Labor, the Nick Xenophon Team, and others) and they are thinking of introducing that bill to the House of Representatives next week. They say if the LNP backbencher George Christensen, and his colleague Llew O’Brien, are serious about crossing the floor to support a banking inquiry then they will have the opportunity to do so with the Greens bill. They acknowledge there’s a chance that such a tactic could upset the momentum for an inquiry. So watch this space. On Milo Yiannopoulos: Apart from the banks, they’re still angry about Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm inviting the alt-right poster boy Milo Yiannopoulos to Parliament House next month. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said one thing people need to realise is that the publicist for Leyonhjelm’s book is the same publicist for Yiannopoulos’s book. But the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, is going to write to the presiding officers in Parliament House to ask them why they have granted access to Yiannopoulos in the first place and to ask them to rescind the offer. On Don Burke: The Greens say they are so disturbed by the allegations about Don Burke, and revelations that Channel Nine executives were aware of his behaviour for years, that they have started investigating what types of penalties could be put in place for media executives – and boards – that don’t act on allegations of sexual harassment and assault. They say television broadcasters and radio stations are allowed to access the public airwaves, with regulations and restrictions governing that access. “Stay tuned for that,” Sarah Hanson-Young said. Right, folks. Some progress with the same-sex marriage bill. We’re now into debating the amendments in the Senate. The attorney general, George Brandis, has really claimed the mantle of removing discriminatory laws for the Liberal party and conservatives. He starts in 1972 when Murray Hill moved a bill to decriminalise gay sex in South Australia and takes us through Here Comes the Groom, an article published in 1989 that he says shows gay marriage originated from the conservative side of politics. Brandis says that same-sex marriage will finally give gay people full equality and access to marriage but its significance is far greater: “After centuries of prejudice, discrimination rejection and ridicule, it is an expiation of past wrongs and a final act of acceptance and embrace.” The message it sends to young people is potent: “You are a normal person and like every other normal person you have a need to love ... Who you love is for you to decide and others to respect.” Brandis credits Malcolm Turnbull for being the first prime minister to have advocated and prosecuted this cause and says it will be a signature achievement and “imperishable legacy” of his prime ministership. The attorney general, George Brandis, is currently making a powerful speech on same-sex marriage in the Senate. It’s the standout of the various contributions today. My colleague Paul Karp is in the chamber and will bring you a more comprehensive report on his words. But here’s a flavour: This decision by the Australian people – enabled by their government and enacted by their parliament – will come to be seen as one of those occasional shining moments which stand out in our nation’s history. About which people will still speak with admiration in decades, indeed centuries to come. One of those breakthroughs which have, as the wheel of history turns, defined us as a people. Success has many fathers. And although this achievement was brought to fulfilment by a Liberal government and a Liberal prime minister, it would be churlish not to acknowledge so many in the Labor party in also promoting this cause. I can well imagine their frustration during the six years of the Rudd and Gillard governments, when the cause was delayed, because it is the same frustration I have felt at times with leaders on my own side of politics. But in the end, through long years and many false steps on both sides of politics, through many stops and starts, we have come, at last, to this end. As Martin Luther King famously said, the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice. An interesting story is emerging from Barnaby Joyce’s electorate of New England. Barnaby Joyce has reportedly claimed he is being stalked, according to the Northern Daily Leader. The paper reports that Joyce was confronted and questioned about family matters in the Graman Hotel, near Inverell, on Monday night. Joyce told the paper he’s had “death threats and now we’ve got stalkers”. He didn’t deny flicking the man’s hat off during a heated exchange. The Labor senator Jacinta Collins has dropped a small bomb by saying that Labor MPs and senators are not bound to vote against substantive marriage amendments. But she’s said that nobody intends to exercise their conscience vote on the amendments, so she is still substantially in line with Labor Senate leader Penny Wong and shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus who have said Labor will vote down all substantive amendments. Collins said on the final bill she would exercise her conscience - and vote no. She said she last expressed the view in 2012 and “that view has not changed”. She will vote no by pairing her vote to senator Gavin Marshall, who is in New York. Collins accused some unnamed Coalition senators of being “quite partisan” by suggesting Labor senators who shared their views about traditional marriage were “gutless”. Communications minister, Mitch Fifield, told the Senate he previously opposed same-sex marriage but had changed his mind. He said there were “some cogent arguments for some additional protections” but reserved his position. Still in the Senate, we heard a little earlier from the One Nation senator Brian Burston. Burston reveals he didn’t vote in the poll because he didn’t receive his form. There are many who did not receive their forms and so were deprived of their right of participating in this survey. I was one of those Australians robbed and denied the opportunity of expressing my democratic right. The Australian bureau of statistics did make a number of options available for those who didn’t receive their form. That included requesting a new form. It appears Burston did not take up those options. He adds that he would have voted no, in case you were wondering. A note on Pauline Hanson’s speech on same-sex marriage. The Labor senator Sam Dastyari made his way across the Senate to speak with Hanson after she had finished. If only Mike Bowers could lip read ... The justice minister, Michael Keenan, has just spoken on the foiled alleged terror plot in Victoria. A 20-year-old man was arrested in Melbourne this morning. It is alleged he planned a terror plot on new year’s eve. Keenan dismisses any notion that Australia has been lucky to avoid an attack. This is the 14th time that our authorities have stopped an attack from occurring in Australia since 2014. That hasn’t happened because of luck, that’s happened because our agencies are very, very good at what they do. Back to the prime minister ruling out a royal commission into the banks for a moment. As Chris has noted, Malcolm Turnbull has not actually ruled out the live option – which is a commission of inquiry into the banks. Julie Bishop this morning also had a slightly hedged statement on the question, making an in-principle argument against an inquiry (they don’t provide immediate solutions to problems), but leaving the issue of whether the government might ultimately support one, open. “This is a matter for cabinet and the party room to discuss,” Bishop told reporters. These utterances may prove to be a distinction without a difference but, given the cabinet has already had one discussion about whether or not to flip on the banking inquiry, and Barnaby Joyce has signalled the Nationals might flip when they meet next Monday, it pays to watch the various words and formulations very closely. We’re back in the Senate on the same-sex marriage debate. In a remarkable feat of logic, the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, has used what she says is “reverse racism” against white Australians to argue against same-sex marriage. Bear with me here. I’ll do my best to get to the bottom of that. She has likened the same-sex marriage postal survey to the 1967 referendum on including Indigenous Australians in the census. Hanson says people thought they were voting to give Indigenous Australian equality. But, alas, we were all tricked and Indigenous Australians now have it better than white Australians. Now white Australians face reverse racism, she says. We have now made laws that is giving them more rights than other Australians. There is a division in Australia, there is reverse racism. People did not vote for that. Hence my concerns about this plebiscite. People say they want equality, they want the right to marry. I have no problem with that ... if it was to be called a civil ceremony, Australians would not worry about that. But why is it that this push for people where the last census in 2011 there was 33,700 gay couples. And I can tell you all those gay couples don’t want to get married. So ... yeah. Make what you will from that. Also, the children. What happens when they’re asked to draw a picture of mum and dad? What do we do as a society when these going to school ... so the kid’s there saying ‘well what do I do, I don’t have a mum or a dad, it’s Peter and Sam, or it’s Elizabeth and Amanda. They’re not known as mum and dad’. So are we then going to say well we can’t discriminate against these children, so we must call that person by their real names. Is this the impact it’s going to have on our educational system, in our school rooms. What about grandma and granddad, it’s alright for this generation, but what about the next generation? Just as a postscript. Hanson asks why we are being “dictated to by the minority”. It’s a good question. One that the 61% of Australians who voted for same-sex marriage may well ask of One Nation. Labor Senate leader, Penny Wong, and shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, have just announced that Labor has reached a party position to vote down all substantive amendments to the marriage bill - both those advanced by conservatives, and those released by the Greens. Dreyfus said that no Labor MPs and Senators had sought a conscience vote on amendments, although they have a conscience vote on the final vote on a marriage bill. It is significant that this is a binding decision - because votes from half a dozen or so Labor MPs who had reserved their position would have been necessary for Coalition conservatives to get any of their changes approved. Last night Labor senator Helen Polley told the Senate she was in favour of more protections for religious freedom, freedom of speech and parental rights, but she also said it’s time to move on and get same-sex marriage done. Wong thanked her colleagues for the collegiate, collective approach to the issue. So obviously Polley and others with concerns have agreed to raise them through the religious freedom inquiry and will not be voting for conservative amendments and imperilling the same-sex marriage bill. Malcolm Turnbull has just spoken in Bennelong, alongside his candidate, John Alexander, and the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian. It’s the first time Turnbull has appeared in Bennelong alongside Alexander, despite the importance of the byelection campaign for the Coalition. The questions quickly turn to the banking inquiry. Can Turnbull categorically rule out an inquiry into the banks? After a few questions, he eventually says the government will not establish a royal commission. He makes no specific mention of his position on another form of inquiry, a parliamentary inquiry, which is a live option. We have made it clear we are not going to establish a royal commission and the reason for that is simply because we want to get on with the job now. Let me tell you, if we had set up a royal commission into banks two years ago, up in of the reforms that we have undertaken would have been able to be achieved. John Alexander is thrown a curly question on a tennis trip he took to South Africa during apartheid. Why did he choose to play tennis in the country, at a time when many sportspeople refused to do so? Alexander said he had played there with Arthur Ashe, an African-American tennis champion. The pair had played at a time when South Africa first made its grandstands available to both black and white fans. I think that was the commencement of the breaking down of apartheid. I think that Arthur was a great champion as a tennis player and he was very instrumental with what then happened in South Africa. I thought we were doing, as a group of tennis players, we were demonstrating how we, who came from every country on the earth, that we had a great mix of people and we went to South Africa with our champion Arthur Ashe. Right, we’ve just heard a little more on the same-sex marriage debate. The Senate will resume its consideration of the bill from 10.30am. Conservative MPs have proposed a series of amendments to Dean Smith’s bill. They’re designed to give stronger protections on freedom of religion, conscience, parental choice, and expression. In a nutshell, they’re designed to protect people who don’t like or believe in same-sex marriage and give them the right to express such views without retribution. Labor are concerned the amendments might derail the smooth passage of the same-sex marriage bill proposed by Dean Smith, which has cross-party support. Labor’s Penny Wong said the Dean Smith bill, while not perfect, was a sensible and workable bill. She said the bill was giving effect to the will of the Australian people, and warned against any amendments that would hinder its progress. I hope and believe that the majority of senators respect the view of the Australian people, so emphatically put in these last couple of weeks, that they want marriage equality. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the bill hadcross-party support and was “an acceptable compromise”. It’s not exactly the bill that Labor would have put forward, “but that’s in the nature of compromises”. A little earlier, the Liberal senator James Paterson was on Sky News to explain the amendments. They include: The definition of marriage should separately recognises both man-woman marriage and “two-person marriage” as valid. Stronger protections for civil celebrants and conscientious objectors. Paterson wants to protect civil celebrants who are opposed to same-sex marriage and don’t want to be involved in such ceremonies. Protections for freedom of expression and to recognise legitimate beliefs. An anti-detriment shield protecting individuals and organisations with genuine convictions about traditional marriage. This would ensure they are not subject to unfavourable treatment by public authorities owing to their views. Freedom from being required to express, associate with, or endorse statement or opinion about marriage, which conflicts with genuine religious or conscientious convictions about marriage. Protections for charities that hold traditional views on marriage. This would allow charities like St Vincent de Paul’s, for example, to continue to express their views. It would not allow them to refuse to offer services to same-sex couples. Protection of religious bodies and schools and parents to have the right to withdraw children from certain classes. Paterson argues that parents now have the right to pull their kids from religious classes. He just wants the same for parents who don’t agree with same-sex marriage. Just casting our gaze over to the national broadband network for a moment. You’ll remember yesterday NBN Co announced that new delays will affect millions of their broadband customers. Customers who are having their NBN connected via existing pay television or internet cables – via the hybrid fibre coaxial network – will have to wait up to nine more months to be connected. The delay is necessary because a small number of customers have experienced technical difficulties with the HFC cables, according to the NBN. A bit earlier, the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, was asked on Sky News whether it was a mistake to use the HFC cables to deliver NBN broadband. No, absolutely not. And it is one of the reasons why the NBN will be completed by 2020, which is still the case, which is six to eight years sooner than would have been the case under our predecessors. He’s asked whether the HFC pay television cables are up to the task. Absolutely, there are hundreds of thousands of Australians who in the pre-NBN world are already accessing fast broadband over the HFC pay tv cables. In fact, in the United States most people who have broadband access it over the HFC pay tv cables. So it’s a good product. The issues with HFC are “very fixable” and the cables are cheaper and still allows 100 megabits per second. The energy operator says it has found extra power to cover shortfalls over summer, and says it is ready to “regain that confidence of the public”. The Australian Energy Market Operator has identified almost 2,000 megawatts of extra power, which it says will replace the 1,600MW that went offline when Victoria’s Hazelwood power station closed in March, according to AAP. It is now as confident as possible Australia enters this summer with many of the problems from last year resolved, says its chief executive, Audrey Zibelman. “What we all want to do, and I think I can speak for the entire energy industry, is to get through the summer and regain that confidence of the public,” she told ABC radio on Tuesday. “We want to get back to the point where energy is boring and nobody’s interested just because we’re doing it so well.” The extra power will be necessary, as research also found consumers weren’t likely to cut their power usage during heatwaves as much as previously thought. More than 800MW will come from gas generators that were previously offline or not operating at full capacity last summer. A further 1,000MW can come from asking large energy users to either use less power or generate their own. The summer plans also include the massive new lithium battery that the billionaire businessman Elon Musk has built in South Australia, which is being tested this week and should be ready to join the grid on Friday. One of the senior Nationals opposed to a banking inquiry is the resources minister, Matt Canavan. Regardless of his position, the inquiry appears to have the numbers to pass. He’s asked why the government, given it no longer has the numbers, doesn’t just change its position, push ahead with an inquiry, and take control of the issue. Canavan responds: You’ve got to stick to your ground on these sort of debates, you don’t just change your position because of a couple of members. Now ultimately if that’s the way a votes goes in the parliament, or is going to go, that’s something we’ll have to deal with at the time. Canavan said he doesn’t support a royal commission because it will not achieve anything, will cost a lot, and will take a long time. He also thinks there’s a risk to the banking sector’s reputation. Canavan is asked about a story in the Courier-Mail this morning, which describes a “pineapple rebellion” of Queensland LNP Nationals. They want to run a separate campaign and differentiate themselves from the Liberal party at the next federal election. Canavan says: Well the pineapple rebellion is not the brand name we’re running under, I can clarify that. I do think we need to do a better job in Queensland of marketing and selling what we do here in Canberra. We need to tell the Queensland people in a crowded marketplace, a crowded political marketplace, tell them what we do and what we achieve for them. Clearly in regional Queensland there’s a demand for a party that sticks up for them, that is in their corner, fighting for them. Some of that has gone to One Nation and Katter as well, in north Queensland. Mitch Fifield has launched another broadside at the ABC. He says the ABC shouldn’t change the date just because “a few people” don’t think Australia Day should be on 26 January. He was speaking to Sky News’s Kieran Gilbert. The ABC should just leave the Hottest 100 alone. The ABC and Triple J should not seek to politicise Australia Day by removing the Hottest 100 from Australia Day because there are a few people who don’t think Australia Day should be celebrated on the 26th of January. You’ll no doubt have seen that the ABC surveyed almost 65,000 of people and found 60% support for changing the date of the Hottest 100. So it’s a bit of a stretch for Fifield to describe that as a “few people”. Kieran Gilbert challenges him on the statement: But they did a voluntary non-binding survey. You guys know a little bit about that? Fifield responds: Well the ABC has a broader responsibility to the whole community, not just to one particular entire market segment. Kieran, there are some days in this gig as minister when I slap my forehead and say what were these guys thinking. You might remember Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg appeared in Port Kembla yesterday to spruik their national energy guarantee. In doing so, Frydenberg channelled the Australian rock star Jimmy Barnes. More than 30 years ago Jimmy Barnes came to Port Kembla to make the film clip for Working Class Man. Today the prime minister has come to Port Kembla to create jobs for Australia’s working-class men and women. Well, that hasn’t impressed Jimmy. Far from it. He’s just tweeted his anger at being used to sell the government’s “shitty policies”. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, has insisted to a Senate inquiry that he was not the cabinet minister who told the former Senate president Stephen Parry to keep his concerns quiet about his dual citizenship. Appearing before the Senate legal and constitutional affairs references committee on Monday evening, Fifield said he had encouraged Parry to check his family records when Parry had raised the issue with him but it was not his responsibility to ensure that Parry followed through. He said he had told no one about their conversation, including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, because that would have been breaching Parry’s confidence. “Claims that I directed, told, advised, or suggested that he not take any steps he deemed appropriate until after the high court decision are false,” Fifield said. “It is the responsibility of each senator to assess their own eligibility to stand for, and to sit in, the parliament.” Fifield had been asked to appear before the committee on Monday after admitting this month that he knew Parry was concerned about his possible dual citizenship weeks before he resigned from parliament. Parry made a shock announcement on 1 November after being told by UK authorities that he held British citizenship. He admitted he had waited for last month’s high court judgment on the eligibility of seven parliamentary colleagues before seeking advice from British authorities on his own citizenship. The revelation angered his senior Coalition colleagues, including Turnbull, because it came at a time when the government believed the citizenship saga was behind it. Days afterwards, the ABC reported that Parry had actually told some senior colleagues, including a cabinet colleague, about his citizenship concerns in mid-August and had been advised not to raise the alarm until after the high court ruling. He was reportedly told to sit tight because the solicitor general’s advice was that the government would win the citizenship case. Fifield told the committee on Monday that he objected to the political motivations behind his being summoned to appear before the committee. He said it did not set a “sensible precedent”. Staying with banking for a moment. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has just been asked whether the government would reconsider its opposition to an inquiry. She responds: This is a matter for cabinet and the party room to discuss. Bishop said an inquiry would achieve little. She said it may hold out “false hope” of compensation and dispute resolution for victims of banking misconduct. The point that I’m making is that a royal commission or an inquiry, depending on its powers, won’t recover compensation, won’t resolve disputes. All it can do is make recommendations to regulators. The regulators are already taking action on the government’s direction to resolve these disputes and ensure that any failures in the system are addressed. These commissions of inquiry can take months, even years, so I don’t want the Australian government to be holding out false hope for people. She described the Coalition between the Liberals and the Nationals as a positive relationship. The two parties have their differences from time to time, but: We’re a very successful political movement as a Coalition. The Nationals MP Llew O’Brien has all but confirmed he will cross the floor to support a banking commission of inquiry, meaning the Nationals senator Barry O’Sullivan’s bill has the numbers to pass the Senate and the lower house if it were voted on. I just can’t see how I wouldn’t vote for it. O’Brien has agreed to support the inquiry on the condition that it is expanded to look at the discrimination against people with mental health issues by insurance companies. O’Brien: When you have 45% of Australians anticipated to have some kind of mental ill health throughout their life and then you’ve got insurance companies discriminating in the way that they do, that must have an effect on our country. O’Brien, a former police officer, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and told ABC AM this “valuable experience” was one he would “not waste” now he was in a position to legislate. Asked when the inquiry would get up and if it was disloyal to support it, he said: It could be next week – who knows. It could have been this week, but it vanished … I’m in parliament to serve both my constituents and the people of Australia, they’re the people I answer to. Hello and welcome to the second day of the sitting week. It’s Christopher Knaus with you again, here for the last day before Amy Remeikis returns and resumes your normal blogging service. Between the bank inquiry, same-sex marriage, Manus Island and the Hottest 100, the government looks to have a fairly full dance card again today. Here’s what we’re expecting this morning: An inquiry into the banks is now looking more and more certain. A second Nationals MP, Llew O’Brien, has said he’d be prepared to cross the floor. That gives proponents of an inquiry the numbers in the lower house. We’ll wait to see how Malcolm Turnbull will respond this morning. The PM and other senior ministers have consistently resisted calls for such an inquiry. But he could face an embarrassing vote on the floor of parliament unless the Coalition changes its position. The debate on same-sex marriage will continue in the Senate today. The attention continues to be on the amendments proposed by conservatives. Those amendments, they argue, are needed to ensure those opposed to same-sex marriage do not have their freedom of religion, speech or conscience restricted. The conservatives say parents also need protections to take their children out of classes they don’t agree with. Labor largely wants the Dean Smith bill passed as it is. The Greens have proposed their own amendments but say they’re happy with Dean Smith’s bill as a minimum. The debate will continue in the Senate this morning from 10.30am. The debate over the change of the Hottest 100 date is likely to continue this morning. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, has again expressed his anger over the decision this morning. I sense another day of culture warring and ABC bashing. Strap yourselves in. The Greens are also planning to introduce legislation on assisted dying. Their bill hopes to give the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory the right to make their own laws on euthanasia. There have you have it. It’s shaping up as another fascinating day in parliament. We’ll take you through the news as it develops throughout the day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/nov/27/harvey-weinstein-sued-for-alleged-sex-trafficking-in-cannes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T21:12:57Z","webTitle":"Harvey Weinstein sued for alleged 'sex trafficking' in Cannes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/27/harvey-weinstein-sued-for-alleged-sex-trafficking-in-cannes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/nov/27/harvey-weinstein-sued-for-alleged-sex-trafficking-in-cannes","fields":{"headline":"Harvey Weinstein sued for alleged 'sex trafficking' in Cannes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Harvey Weinstein has been accused of violating sex trafficking laws as an aspiring actor has launched a lawsuit against him. Kadian Noble alleges that the disgraced producer invited her to his hotel room during the Cannes film festival in 2004 claiming that he wanted to cast her in a forthcoming movie. She claims that he proceeded to grope her before trapping her in the bathroom and forcing her to perform sexual acts. Noble’s suit alleges that during the encounter, he told her: “Everything will be taken care of for you if you relax.” The suit is aimed not only at Harvey Weinstein but also his brother, Bob, and their company the Weinstein Company, citing “reckless disregard” on their parts. The suit details the involvement of an unnamed producer at the company who spoke to Noble on the phone, instructing her to be “a good girl and do whatever he wished”. In response, Weinstein’s spokesperson has denied the claims. “Mr Weinstein denies allegations of non-consensual sex,” his representative said. “Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.” The suit arrives in the same day as a civil claim in the UK from an anonymous woman who alleges that she was also sexually assaulted by Weinstein. Both cases arrive after dozens of other women around the world have revealed similar stories about their experiences with Weinstein, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Rose McGowan. It is believed that authorities in different cities are collaborating to try and build a legal case against the producer. Los Angeles detectives have been interviewing witnesses in preparation for a case to present to the district attorney; the NYPD has been investigating two rape complaints; and in London, three other cases are being handled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/27/fifa-trial-ex-president-of-colombias-football-federation-discussed-bribes","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T20:55:45Z","webTitle":"Fifa trial: ex-president of Colombia football discussed Qatar 2022 bribes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/27/fifa-trial-ex-president-of-colombias-football-federation-discussed-bribes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/27/fifa-trial-ex-president-of-colombias-football-federation-discussed-bribes","fields":{"headline":"Fifa trial: ex-president of Colombia football discussed Qatar 2022 bribes","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The former president of Colombia’s football federation told a New York City courtroom on Monday that he was approached over potential bribe payments to back Qatar’s bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Luis Bedoya, who has pled guilty to corruption charges filed as part of a sprawling US government investigation into Fifa, the sport’s governing body, said that he and two other senior South American football officials discussed potential bribes during a conversation with an intermediary in Madrid in 2010. Bedoya, a former member of the Fifa executive committee, was handed a lifetime ban in 2016 and is now testifying as a key government witness in the trial of three former South American football officials who have pled not guilty to multiple corruption charges. The Colombian national told the court through a translator that he had travelled to Madrid in May 2010 to watch the final of the Champions League and was approached at a hotel by an unnamed “important person from Qatari television” and the Argentine businessman Mariano Jinkis, the owner of the sports marketing company Full Play. Jinkis, Bedoya told the court, wanted to introduce the Qatari official to Bedoya and his two colleagues, Juan Angel Napout, the former head of football in Paraguay, and Luis Chiriboga, his counterpart in Ecuador, as the unnamed Qatari “wanted to know if South America was willing to support them” in their bid for the World Cup. Bedoya characterized the introduction as short but added that after the Qatari official left the conversation Jinkis moved the discussion on to potential bribes. The marketing executive, who along with his father Hugo Jinkis has also been charged on multiple counts of corruption by US prosecutors but has so far avoided extradition to the US, suggested to the trio that Qatar’s bid for the tournament could be “important … for business”. He told the officials “he could ask for 10 or 15m [in bribes] and could divide it up between the group of six”. Jinkis’s referral to the “group of six” was a nod to the bloc of six influential officials at South American football’s governing body Conmebol, which at that time included Bedoya, Napout and Chiriboga. Despite the discussion, Bedoya said, none of the officials took the matter any further. “That is too complicated, you shouldn’t get into it,” Napout told the group, according to Bedoya. None of the “group of six” at the time were on Fifa’s executive committee and so did not have World Cup voting rights. Nonetheless the bloc’s growing power in Conmebol has been discussed at length by prosecutors throughout proceedings. Bedoya said he ended up backing the United States’ bid for 2022 and told the court he submitted a formal letter to Conmebol expressing his national association’s position before the World Cup vote. He described handing the letter to Conmebol’s former secretary general Eduardo Deluca, who told him: “You’re always with the losers.” The trial, now entering its third week, has seen some of the most detailed allegations of corruption associated with Qatar’s bid for the tournament. The influential former marketing executive Alejandro Burzaco told the court earlier in the month he had witnessed former Argentine football chief and Fifa senior vice president Julio Grondona discuss receiving at least $1m in exchange for his vote for Qatar. Burzaco indicated that the two other senior South American officials with World Cup voting rights at Fifa, Ricardo Teixeira of Brazil and Nicolás Leoz of Paraguay, had also been bribed for their vote. The court has also heard that a powerful Qatari sports investment company was in secretive talks to purchase Full Play, the Jinkis’s marketing company. The multimillion-dollar deal, nicknamed “the New York Project”, was aborted after the Argentines were indicted by US prosecutors in May 2015. Bedoya is one of around two dozen former officials and marketing executives to have pled guilty after US prosecutors have charged over 40 people in relation to the scandal involving at least $150m in bribes paid over two decades. He told the court he had begun receiving bribes in 2007 for the rights to an array of Colombian national team-friendly matches. He also received six-figure bribes later in his tenure in exchange for rights to popular regional tournaments including the Copa America and the Copa Libertadoras. The former football chief also implicated the sportswear company Nike, who he claimed offered him a bribe in exchange for the Colombian national team kit sponsorship rights in 2010. But the official said that the bribe was never paid as the assocation took up a contract with Adidas instead. Nike spokeswoman Ilana Finley said: “Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery. We have been cooperating, and will continue to cooperate, with the authorities.” Juan Angel Napout, along with former Peruvian football chief Manuel Burga and Brazilian Jose Maria Marin, the defendants in the ongoing trial, have all pled not guilty to multiple corruption charges. The trial is expected to last six weeks in total."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/28/it-shouldnt-have-taken-a-survey-to-move-the-hottest-100-from-invasion-day","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T21:04:02Z","webTitle":"It shouldn't have taken a survey to move the Hottest 100 from Invasion Day | Celeste Liddle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/it-shouldnt-have-taken-a-survey-to-move-the-hottest-100-from-invasion-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/it-shouldnt-have-taken-a-survey-to-move-the-hottest-100-from-invasion-day","fields":{"headline":"It shouldn't have taken a survey to move the Hottest 100 from Invasion Day","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I admit it: I have not listened to the Triple J Hottest 100 for a number of years, despite my sworn love for independent Australian music and media. And no, it’s not because nowadays I am more the Double J demographic. Triple J has been my go-to radio station while I travel all over the country for a long time now. Rather, I haven’t been listening because due to the fact that the countdown has been held on 26 January, I have been otherwise engaged. This year, for example, I was busy helping 50,000 other people shut down the streets of Melbourne at the Invasion Day rally. Last year I attended a protest and speak-out in Alice Springs. The year before, I was at the Invasion Day protest in Melbourne before we headed down the road to the annual Share the Spirit Festival. As an Aboriginal woman, 26 January has always been, and will always be, a day of protest to me. I can therefore imagine many other music-loving Aboriginal people will have been similarly excluded by the choice of date when it came to this countdown. I am therefore happy to hear that next year I won’t have to wait until the countdown repeat the following week to get my music fix. With Monday’s news from Triple J that the countdown will be moving to 27 January next year, and will be subsequently held on the fourth weekend of every month, it means that I will have an opportunity to join in the festivities. Without the ability to cheer for your favourites, whinge when some terrible novelty track gets top billing and interact with other passionate music fans, the countdown experience has seemed empty. It’s more than this though – I know just what an institution the Hottest 100 is. Indeed, when I have been talking about “Australia Day” and why any celebration of it is offensive, I have often been met with the response that to many, it’s just “Hottest 100 Day”. To therefore see that 60% of the people who responded to the Triple J survey supported a change of date for the countdown suggests that at least as far as younger generations are concerned, society is becoming more aware. Unfortunately though, it seems that for Triple J itself, there’s still a way to go before the message permeates its own ranks. While its statement detailed that this was about “celebrating the music”, it does not even mention that the major reason 26 January has become contentious is due to what the date means to Indigenous groups. In fact, the statement still mentions celebrating Australia Day with some “new programming”. Had there not been an online petition mounted by a pair of young activists to change the countdown date, Triple J might not have moved to do its own survey and consultation in the first place. Despite there now being majority support for a date change, Triple J states that it “expected a lot of different opinions, this is a complicated issue with no one correct answer.” To me, it’s not a “complicated issue”. It’s a very simple one and one the Indigenous community have been trying to educate the public on for decades. To celebrate “Australia Day” requires historical erasure or even flat-out ignorance with regards to how this landmass was “settled” and what happened next. It requires the reinforcement of the false doctrine of terra nullius and the negation of Indigenous sovereignty. Triple J’s Hottest 100 countdown had not always been held on Invasion Day but the fact that this date was eventually chosen amounts to Triple J capitalising on a holiday with this kind of baggage for its own ratings gain. This date change should never have taken a survey. This year, I saw some pubs and small businesses I frequent announce on social media that they would not be opening on “Australia Day” because they planned to join Invasion Day marches. I saw bands issue statements of solidarity with Indigenous people in a bid to educate their fans. Protests have been running since 1938 and this year’s ones saw record numbers in most capital cities. The awareness is there and growing at a steady rate. Triple J could have chosen instead to make a stand and use the opportunity, as a national youth broadcaster committed to local content, to educate its listeners. Instead, its listeners have ended up educating it. So while I applaud this move and look forward to hearing the countdown live for the first time in years, I also hope that it leads to further education within the ranks of Triple J and a stronger commitment to engaging in political discussions with Indigenous groups. And possibly a few more listens of January 26 by AB Original."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/27/the-guardian-view-on-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-theyre-engaged-thats-nice","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T18:56:34Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: they’re engaged.

The younger Harry could often be foolish, but there’s rightly a lot of affection for him these days – and everyone likes a wedding. When the big day comes, some will look in the other direction, but a lot more will tune in. It will be a public celebration. There’s nothing wrong with either response. In a constitutional sense, this wedding is not really an important event. It isn’t epochal. It shouldn’t be asked to bear too much weight. Prince Harry is only fifth in line to the throne, and about to sink to sixth. He is not going to be head of state. Presidents and premiers need not be invited. Ms Markle’s Americanness, mixed race, acting career and divorce are all interesting. None of them, though, is unprecedented among the royals. The striking thing is that such issues do not matter in the way they might once have done. This marriage will tell us little about the state of the monarchy or the nation beyond the obvious truth that most people enjoy a glamorous wedding. Most people will also keep it in perspective.

Alongside Alex Karras and Frank Gifford in the ABC commentators’ booth, legendary broadcaster Howard Cosell described the venue as “the most magnificent football structure of its kind … the finest edifice of its type known to mankind”. Over the course of the following 20 years the Pontiac Silverdome, as it was quickly rebranded, staged huge events: Super Bowl XVI, WrestleMania III, the 1994 World Cup as well as concerts from artists such as The Who, Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Pink Floyd. Pope John Paul II even staged a mass in the arena in front of a reported 93,682 people in 1987. This Sunday, the process of demolishing the once great arena, now abandoned and dilapidated, will begin. Within eight months a stadium used in this year’s Transformers movie to illustrate a post-apocalyptic world – with little editing, it seems – will be consigned to the dustbin of history. Few tears will be shed for facility that has recently been described as an “eyesore”, an “embarrassment” and even “like a war zone”. To many, the decline and decay of the Silverdome has come to symbolize the decline of southeast Michigan, a once booming region ravaged by the collapse of the automobile industry in the United States (although, in truth, the area’s problems started before the Silverdome was built). Indeed, just six months after strong winds and snow fatally damaged the Silverdome’s inflatable roof in January 2013, the city of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy after reported debts of $18-20bn. While Pontiac is a city in itself, some 30 miles northwest of downtown Detroit so deep are the sporting ties between the Silverdome and Motor City that the two have become inextricably linked. It is now hoped that the Silverdome’s demolition will help usher in a new start not just for the 127-acre site but for Detroit itself, which has begun the process of regeneration. The fact that Ikea is looking at the site for a second store in southeast Michigan indicates the promise of a bright future ahead. The Silverdome was the brainchild of Pontiac resident Don Davidson, an architect who was determined to revive his local city after returning to the area in 1965 and observing: “It looks as if someone has dropped a bomb on [it].” A sports stadium was a key part of Davidson’s plan for urban renewal and, after being conceived in 1966, the Pontiac Metropolitan Stadium was completed in 1975 at the cost of $55.7m (about $250m in today’s money). “I think it’s the best stadium in the world right now,” said Davidson of the 80,311 arena, which contained 102 luxury suites and 7,384 club seats. Having secured the Detroit Lions as anchor tenants, it was the largest stadium in the NFL until FedExField (91,000 capacity) in suburban Washington DC opened in 1997. The Teflon-coated inflatable roof was the stadium’s most famous feature – leading the way to its new name ‘the Silverdome’ in 1976 – but also its biggest problem. The roof was not even finished for the Lions’ first game in the venue, a pre-season meeting with the Kansas City Chiefs in August 1975. The following summer it partially collapsed after a thunderstorm; it was a huge embarrassment but proved an unexpected boon to two local soccer enthusiasts, Englishmen Roger Faulkner and Gordon Preston, who had arranged for Pele’s New York Cosmos to play NASL rivals the Dallas Tornado at the Silverdome shortly after, on Labor Day. Faulkner, a former tennis player from England who has promoted soccer in Detroit since the 1960s, told the Guardian: “The week of the event I met Gordon and he had this enormous smile on his face. I said, ‘What’s happened? Something terrible has happened hasn’t it?’ and he was just laughing away. He said the roof of the Silverdome has collapsed and I laughed too. It was an English reaction. “He said, ‘Let’s get to the car and get to the Silverdome’ and we were on the news on every channel. It was wonderful promotion for the game. We got 28,000 people and a lot of attention to become a potential NASL team. The roof came down 20 or 30 feet but they were able to get it up again.” After Faulkner and Preston succeeded in securing Pele’s return to the Silverdome in 1977 – for a friendly between the Cosmos and Brazilian club Santos – the NASL awarded Detroit an expansion team, who were co-owned by Faulkner and compatriot Jimmy Hill, the Coventry City chairman and broadcaster. With a lack of other suitable venues, the Detroit Express played at the Silverdome for three years in front of crowds averaging just 14,000 in the 80,000 capacity venue. “It is a mistake to play in a stadium when your capacity far exceeds your attendance but we didn’t have the sophistication to drape parts of the stadium like they can today,” Faulkner admits. “But there was no other stadium. There was no suitable facility in the metropolitan area so we had to go to the Silverdome.” From the outset, the Silverdome was a multi-purpose stadium – it was also used for supercross, Jehovah’s Witnesses conventions and a Billy Graham Crusade among other events – but the key to its success for so long was having the Detroit Lions and the Detroit Pistons as tenants. When the Pistons moved further north to the The Palace in Auburn Hills in 1988, it was a devastating blow for the arena, not least because it came just before the so-called ‘Bad Boys’ won back-to-back NBA titles. (Ironically, following the Pistons’ move to Little Caesars Arena in downtown Detroit this year, the Palace, now closed, appears in danger of going the same way as the Silverdome.) The main reason for the Pistons’ decision to move to their own arena was because they were forced to play the final 15 games of the 1984-85 season at the Joe Louis Arena (yet another defunct sports arena in Detroit – go figure) after the Silverdome’s roof collapsed under the weight of snow following a heavy overnight storm in March 1985. “It looked just like an avalanche,” said Lions quarterback Gary Danielson, who was practising in the arena at the time. “It looked like somebody threw hand grenades in there. All we did was start pointing ... then it started coming down all at once, and we ran like hell to the tunnel.” An improved replacement roof was installed at a cost of $8.5m but the damage done to the wooden basketball floor coupled with delays to the repairs led to the Pistons moving out. The Silverdome weathered the storm to some extent and two years later it staged two of the biggest events in its history in quick succession – WrestleMania III and mass with Pope John Paul II. Officially, the attendances were 93,173 for WrestleMania and 93,682 for the Pope but it has since been claimed that both figures were massaged upwards, with His Holiness given the higher figure to avoid the appearance of wrestling outdoing religion. Nonetheless, Wrestlemania was a huge hit. B Brian Blair, a former wrestler and member of the tag team the Killer Bees, recalled: “It was the largest crowd I had ever wrestled in front of. Man, it’s probably the greatest event I’ve had, and I’ve had over 6,000 wrestling matches. It was amazing. The whole building was electric. It’s about as high as you’re gonna get.” Soccer returned to the Silverdome in 1994, with the help of Faulkner, when most unexpectedly the stadium became an official venue for the World Cup finals. In the height of the summer, conditions in the indoor facility were unbearable for both players and fans alike. The Silverdome staged four group matches, including the United States’ opener against Switzerland. “It was a very hot summer and Detroit was extremely humid,” recalled former USA midfielder Paul Caligiuiri. “The Silverdome was built for turf, they brought grass in these big octagons and they had to water it. It added to the humidity and the texture of the grass, it was too soft ... The combination of hot weather — 90 degrees with 90% humidity in an unventilated dome with grass that shouldn’t be there that was watered, it made for severe conditions.” Fellow midfielder Thomas Dooley bluntly added: “It was the worst place I have ever played.” The 1994 World Cup was in many ways the beginning of the end for the stadium. Inspired by running-back Barry Sanders, the Detroit Lions were a solid play-off team in the 1990s but the team had begun making plans to relocate to a new venue in 1995; money from parking, concessions and luxury boxes went to the city to pay off stadium debt and not the Lions. Eventually the Lions moved to Ford Field in downtown Detroit in 2002. With the absence of an anchor tenant, sparse events and huge maintenance costs, the city of Pontiac, in the midst of a financial crisis, put the Silverdome up for auction just to get it off its books. The Greek-born Canadian real estate developer Andreas Apostolopoulos won the auction to buy the stadium with a bid of just $583,000 - around 1% of its original cost - much to the dismay of local residents. Apostolopoulos reportedly spent $6m on upgrading the Silverdome and had some success in bringing sporting events back to the venue, including boxing, monster trucks and a soccer friendly between AC Milan and Panathinaikos in 2010. There were tentative plans to bring Major League Soccer to the Silverdome - as well as a team in the revived NASL - but a further roof collapse in January 2013 proved to be the death-knell for the venue, which in the past four years has laid empty and abandoned save for a few photographers keen to record haunting pictures of its ghost-like state. The last few valuable items, including end zone turf, were sold off at an auction in 2014. The last professional athlete to perform at the Silverdome was BMX rider Tyler Fernengel in June 2015 . “It brought back a lot of good memories,” Fernengel recalled. “Being out on the field, it was crazy to think that there once was a motorcycle track there, every year, with all the fans, but now it’s nowhere near the same — it’s like a war zone.” The final use for the venue? The Silverdome parking lot this year served as a storage space for 9,000 recalled Volkswagen diesel cars. Not only was this done without the correct permits but a number of cars were subsequently stolen. Pontiac mayor Deirdre Waterman won a battle to force Apostolopoulos’s Triple Investment Group to demolish the Silverdome, a process that will begin on Sunday with a partial implosion of the mechanical equipment platform atop the 400,000-square-foot stadium. Waterman could not be happier. “Farewell Silverdome,” she said recently. “Hello world of new opportunity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/03/peter-horsfall-nighthawks-review-giacomo-smith","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T08:00:36Z","webTitle":"Peter Horsfall: Nighthawks review – bring on the lonely nights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/03/peter-horsfall-nighthawks-review-giacomo-smith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/03/peter-horsfall-nighthawks-review-giacomo-smith","fields":{"headline":"Peter Horsfall: Nighthawks review – bring on the lonely nights","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Edward Hopper painted it, Frank Sinatra conjured it with One for My Baby, Tom Waits anatomised it in forensic detail.

In 1997, her drama documentary Beyond Fear was shown on the opening night of Channel 5.

In early 1965, while still a student, she interviewed Malcolm X, founder of the Nation of Islam, then visiting Britain. A few days after returning to the US he was assassinated and Jenny’s piece rose to prominence. She then worked as a researcher with Rediffusion Television and its successor broadcaster, Thames TV. She mostly made children’s programmes, but in 1978 she was the associate producer on the film The One and Only Phyllis Dixey, about the famous fan dancer and entertainer; she also co-authored, with Philip Purser, a book based on the film. In search of more professional autonomy, she returned to college in 1977 to train as a film director at the National Film School. Jenny’s life was transformed in the early 1980s when she met and married the radical American historian Bradley Smith. For many years the couple alternated their lives between his teaching base in California and her apartment overlooking Primrose Hill, in north London. From the mid-1990s Jenny cared for Bradley, who developed Alzheimer’s disease. She studied drama therapy at the (now Royal) Central School of Speech and Drama, to help them cope, and, combining her old and new skills, she shot more than 200 hours of film with Bradley to show the effectiveness of drama therapy. At the time of her death, she was editing this material into short training films and a documentary, A Love Story, to show how their relationship had deepened during his illness. Bradley died in 2012. One of her last, and happier, projects was Imogen and Kanishka’s Wedding in Kolkata, the film she directed of my daughter and son-in-law’s wedding in 2015. In 1970, she informally adopted a small boy, Mark Ugbomah, who lived in Wood Green, north London, enrolling him at the Michael Hall Steiner school, in Forest Row, East Sussex, and later becoming godmother to many members of Mark’s extended family in the UK, Jamaica and the US. Wilful, capricious, determined and bossy, Jenny had a lovely voice and a joyous laugh. The loyalty and support of friends and family during her final illness testified to her ability to inspire respect and affection. Mark survives her."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/02/when-we-banish-the-kidults-so-we-can-have-a-dinner-party-for-real-grownups-disaster-strikes-","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T06:45:05Z","webTitle":"When we banish the kidults so we can have a dinner party for real grownups, disaster strikes …","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/02/when-we-banish-the-kidults-so-we-can-have-a-dinner-party-for-real-grownups-disaster-strikes-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/02/when-we-banish-the-kidults-so-we-can-have-a-dinner-party-for-real-grownups-disaster-strikes-","fields":{"headline":"When we banish the kidults so we can have a dinner party for real grownups, disaster strikes …","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of the advantages of living with four kidults is that preparing supper is not my exclusive duty any more. I taught them all to cook when they were little, standing on stools at the kitchen table, up to their elbows in flour. My kids are rebel cooks, never following recipes, each with their own vegan style: Jake listens to loud music as he chops and stirs, chucking in ingredients overarm. The kitchen is filled with the nose-prickling hit of chillies and clouds of steam. Zac cooks only pasta, leaving sauce splatters and bits of dried pasta stuck to the cooker, and other, stranger places. Lily’s food reflects her mood: it is either terrible or wonderful. But Megan is consistently brilliant: she is inventive and quick, with a natural talent for combining flavours. I’m always happy when it is her turn to make supper. Having done my share of cooking over the years, I am relieved to hand over to the younger generation. But my partner, Ed, is a frustrated chef. When I met him, he was known for his dinner parties, and when we moved in together he came with a library of cookbooks and an array of professional pans, heavy enough to flatten a burglar. Nowadays, he doesn’t get a look-in in our kitchen. There is always a twentysomething rustling up dinner with an air of entitled authority. Ed is relegated to chief bottle-washer, and harbours some resentment at his demotion. When Ed and I decide to throw our annual supper for some proper grown-ups, he volunteers enthusiastically to cook. The kids promise to leave the kitchen tidy and not to interfere. Ed gets out piles of his cookery books and spends a happy hour poring over lengthy recipes and glossy pictures. “What about this?” he asks me. “An Ottolenghi recipe with artichoke hearts. Sounds delicious.” “Artichokes? But we’re feeding 10 people.” He gives me a withering look – one that clearly says that I’m a culinary coward. Artichokes it is, then. Ed goes to the supermarket, returning laden with bags, his eyes gleaming. A huge pile of globe artichokes sits in the sink. The kidults, banished from the kitchen, are skulking in their rooms with bowls of cereal and Netflix. Our guests are due at 8pm. I am expecting Ed to start his preparations after lunch. But apparently there is something important he has to do for work first, and then something urgent that needs sorting out in the garden. I look at my watch nervously. By the time he begins to prepare the artichokes, I have changed, laid the table and am on my second glass of wine. Every single leaf from each cooked artichoke needs plucking to reveal the heart. The time it takes to do this has been underestimated: for a start, the hot vegetables are impossible to handle. We yelp and drop them on the floor. After they have cooled, Ed and I stand shoulder to shoulder, silently plucking as if we are denuding a clutch of small chickens. Once we have got all the tiny, slippery hearts out, our sink is piled high with a mountain of leaves and fibrous material. Ed decides to put the lot in our waste disposal unit. It grinds, whirs, and stops with a gasp. Ed gets on to his knees, spreading the contents of the undersink cupboard around him: boxes of old dog biscuits, bottles of disinfectant and forgotten clutter. As he undoes the pipe, there is the sound of rushing water. Dirty, scummy liquid floods the floor. We gaze at floating artichoke petals and some unrecognisable organic matter. “Soup?” Ed suggests with a hint of hysteria. “Oh, God.” I’m pouring my fourth glass. “They’ll be here soon!” “I can still save the day,” he says. “Or …” I suggest quickly. “… we could ask Megan to rustle something up? The thing is,” I confess. “I don’t really fancy artichokes any more.” Sometimes it is useful to have a semi-professional vegan cook to hand. “Megan!” we both yell up the stairs. I just hope she can hear us over Netflix.

Caroline Dinenage, a work and pensions minister, confirmed that the benefit freeze for working age people will remain in place, while the state pension and some other benefits will increase by the rate of inflation at 3%. The freeze, which has been in place since 2015, means a real-terms cut in income for millions of people because of rising living costs. Before the budget, the Resolution Foundation thinktank calculated that a typical working family with two children would lose £315 a year as a result of the policy, while the Institute for Fiscal Studies found benefit entitlements would be lower by an average of £450 per year for 10.5m households affected by 2020. Those on the minimum wage in receipt of benefits will see at least part of the cut offset by a higher wage rate of £7.83 per hour from April. But the freeze will still bite for millions of people in a move that saves the Treasury about £1.9bn next year. Philip Hammond had been facing calls to scrap the four-year benefit freeze promised by George Osborne in 2015 but he did not overturn the policy at last week’s autumn budget. The freeze – affecting benefits including tax credits, child benefit, jobseeker’s allowance, part of employment and support allowance and universal credit – was then confirmed in a written statement to parliament on Monday morning at a time when media attention was focused on the announcement of the royal engagement. Debbie Abrahams, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said it showed the prime minister has “failed to make good on her promise to help those struggling to get by, at a time when Britain is facing an unprecedented two lost decades of earnings growth”. “By continuing to freeze working-age benefits when inflation is soaring, the government is subjecting 10.5 million households to an average cut of £450 a year,” she said. “The government should end the freeze on social security to support those with the least in our society and lift people out of poverty.” Stephen Lloyd, the Liberal Democrats work and pensions spokesman, added: “The Tories seem to be shamelessly using the royal engagement to bury bad news. Millions of hard-pressed families are set to be pushed over the edge into poverty by these cruel cuts.” Charities and thinktanks have been warning that the impact of the cut will be severe for many households. The Joseph Rowntree foundation has predicted the freeze is set to drive almost half a million more people into poverty by 2020. After the budget, Torsten Bell, director of Resolution Foundation, said the chancellor had “made the wrong call to press ahead with a damaging freeze on benefits” as the outlook for family finances is worsening."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/nov/28/daisy-pulls-it-off-pauline-mclynn-anna-shaffer-paulette-randall-park-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T15:01:33Z","webTitle":"Daisy Pulls It Off: Pauline McLynn, Anna Shaffer and more on a spiffing school assembly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/28/daisy-pulls-it-off-pauline-mclynn-anna-shaffer-paulette-randall-park-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/nov/28/daisy-pulls-it-off-pauline-mclynn-anna-shaffer-paulette-randall-park-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Daisy Pulls It Off: Pauline McLynn, Anna Shaffer and more on a spiffing school assembly","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s day five of rehearsals for Daisy Pulls It Off. In slink the Upper 4th Form of Grangewood School for Young Ladies, clutching coffees or their heads, comically contrite after one too many lashings of pop on a class outing the previous night. The outing was to David Mamet’s Glengarry Glen Ross in London’s West End. “It was very male. There was a lot of this …” declares head girl, AKA director Paulette Randall, slouching back into a dramatic manspread. “Ah but it was lovely, lovely …” chorus the girls, pulling themselves up a little tighter in their chairs. The “girls” in this production of Denise Deegan’s award-winning boarding school comedy span three decades in age and include one boy, as well as a small furry fox, called in to ventriloquise a pupil named Dora. It’s the sort of ingenuity that’s required to mount an intimate fringe revival of a show that originally ran for three years in the West End with a cast of 17. A parody of Angela Brazil’s boarding-school novels of the 1920s, Daisy was a surprise hit, which began life at Southampton’s Nuffield theatre in 1983 and went on to make the names of a glittering roll call of promising unknowns including Samantha Bond, Lia Williams and Gabrielle Glaister. “When I got the script, I said ‘Why have they sent this to me?’” says Randall, who deputised for Danny Boyle on the London Olympics opening ceremony. “My kneejerk reaction was that I wouldn’t want to go and see a bunch of girls being all jolly hockey-sticks. And then I thought they wouldn’t expect me to do it as it was written.” She quickly realised that the pocket-handkerchief size of the stage offered a chance to reinvent the play. “It’s not in a proscenium arch and there’s no revolve, so we’re doing it as a bunch of girls putting on a show in a school assembly.” The clincher, she says, was “being with a bunch of women having a laugh. That’s how I started out really – doing sketches and getting my friends to perform them.” It all began to go wrong when, in 1982 at the age of 21, she had a play, Fishing, staged at the Royal Court. “I started taking myself a bit too seriously – saying ‘I am a Theatrician’…” Randall went on to become one of the UK’s leading female directors, heading the black theatre company Talawa, chairing the board of the female prisoners’ ensemble Clean Break and becoming the first black woman to direct a play in the West End, August Wilson’s Fences, in 2013. Though comedy has always played an important role in her life – her TV credits include the sitcom Desmonds and the sketch show The Real McCoy – she was into her 50s before she discovered the broader pleasures of pantomime, through two well-received rock’n’roll pantos at the Stafford Gatehouse theatre. “I thought, this isn’t what I do – I do drama and comedy. But I found I loved it.” Daisy’s a bit of a nod to panto, pipes up actor Clare Perkins (EastEnders, Family Affairs), who has turned up in squashy hat, shades and breeches like a hungover Jack in search of a beanstalk. “It has the two ugly sisters and the beautiful and good heroine.” “It’s a licence to ‘do the acting – let’s just pretend to be someone tonight’,” quips Pauline McLynn (Mrs Doyle from Father Ted). “Paulette is always saying ‘more’: the word you never hear,” riffs Perkins. “It’s very, very exciting that … ‘Just. Do. More,’” adds Shobna Gulati (Anita in Victoria Wood’s Dinnerladies). Part of the reason for this licence to overact is that the classroom scenes require a lot of “back acting”, as the pupils are facing away from the audience and towards the fearsome Miss Granville. “Make it bigger … even bigger,” commands Randall, as they squirm, snigger and jostle for attention, uniting in a communal shoulder-sneer at Daisy’s breathless recitation of a naval ode. “Mind you,” cautions the director, “By the time an audience sees it the ‘more’ might have been taken out” – as indeed might Dora’s fox persona. The point is to distribute Dora’s lines among the cast. They all agree that the extravagant retro spiffiness of Daisy chimes with a society that has staked its future on a return to a mythical innocence. In Randall’s words: “All those Brexiteers saying we want to go back to the time before, when most of them wouldn’t have experienced it anyway – it’s all from books.” Though the comedy is broad, it’s not devoid of social conscience – indeed the plot revolves around it: new arrival Daisy is a scholarship girl, and as one appalled “dormi-mate” remarks, “Scholarship girls – they’re poor. Perhaps not intellectually, but definitely morally.” . “It’s not Chekhov, so let’s not pretend it is,” says Randall. “But I’m a black working-class woman from south London and incredibly proud of it, so it’s important to me that there is a sense of social justice in there – that just because you’ve got a posh accent doesn’t mean you have a great brain.” Mention of posh accents gets the “girls” going again, reminiscing about their own schooldays and their memories of being 14. Gulati, whose family emigrated from the Punjab to Lancashire, has fond memories of devouring boarding-school stories beneath the blankets for their sense of camaraderie and for adventures that didn’t happen at her Oldham grammar school. Her nostalgia for “that stage between girlhood and adulthood with no exams when I was completely, stupidly naive, but happily so” provokes a snort of laughter from Perkins, for whom being 14 on a Peckham housing estate in the 1970s was all “2 Tone and Rock Against Racism and running around with raging hormones thinking I just wanted to leave home – and then I got pregnant at 16 and did leave home.” Twenty-five-year-old north Londoner Anna Shaffer, who came to fame as the besotted Romilda Vane in the Harry Potter films, wasn’t even born when the play premiered. Her Daisy is a picture of innocence, but Shaffer disconcertingly throws in: “It’s the age when you discover you can lie, because you’re growing up and you’re a bit more of a manipulator than you were.” “Yes, well,” sniffs Sligo-born, convent-educated McLynn with mock disdain, “some of us take it to the Nth degree and lie for a living. That’s acting.” The great set piece of the play is a hockey match, which particularly pleases Gulati, who boasts of acquiring “two fat knees” from the sport and having once been the proud possessor of a hockey stick with her surname stamped on it. “It was made by a Gulati in India.” This revelation prompts a lively debate as to who invented the game, only resolved when someone has the brainwave of consulting Google. “OK, so Canada actually invented hockey,” concedes Gulati, who has put up a spirited case for India. “We’re just incredibly good at it.” As the wisecracks fly around the rehearsal room, it becomes increasingly hard to work out who is in character as whom, given that most of the cast play at least two people. “We’ve got a licence to play every stereotype in the book,” says Gulati, happily. “They’re not stereotypes, they’re archetypes,” Randall fires back. “I might argue with that,” replies Gulati, “because we’re children playing what they imagine children to be like, so we can be stereotypes and archetypes.” Even at 10am, with a hangover, it’s all very silly and very good fun. “A lot of the time we’re not proud of being silly,” says Randall. “But we should celebrate the fact that we can make each other laugh – it’s such a beautiful, healing thing.” Daisy Pulls It Off is at the Park theatre, London, from 5 December to 13 January.

Emenalo had stepped down at Stamford Bridge after the win against Manchester United having apparently first expressed a desire to end his 10-year association with Chelsea over the summer. The owner, Roman Abramovich, had personally attempted to persuade him to stay on, without success, and considered the former Nigeria defender one of his most trusted lieutenants. The club and Emenalo, 52, subsequently pointed to his desire to spend more time with his young family when explaining the parting of the ways. Whether he will be able to do that in his new role in the Principality is not clear – he will “take charge of all sport matters”, according to Monaco’s statement – with Emenalo taking up his duties immediately. “This is a wonderful opportunity for me in a high-quality project,” he said. “AS Monaco has shown great progress for several seasons and I am convinced that the future will be just as ambitious. “[The club’s vice-president] Vadim Vasilyev’s willingness to see me join AS Monaco was decisive and for me, the choice was natural after my decision to leave Chelsea. I will work here with humility and try my best to bring my experience in this club which is a reference of French and European football.” Chelsea are considering whether to appoint a direct replacement for Emenalo or split his responsibilities – from recruitment to the academy and loan players – across a number of roles at Cobham. The influential director Marina Granovskaia, who previously concentrated largely on player purchases and sales, has taken on much of Emenalo’s workload, with her influence at the club having effectively increased as a result of his departure. “I have been following Michael Emenalo’s work for a long time and I am very happy to have him here after he chose to quit Chelsea,” Vasilyev said. “His know-how in the scouting network, as well as the technical skills he developed working in one of the most successful clubs in the world in the past few years, are the main reasons leading us to present him our ambitious challenge. Through this appointment it is a further sign that we are ambitious and competitive in our model.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/nov/27/weinstein-predatory-stars-films-tv-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T18:55:08Z","webTitle":"What next for the TV shows caught in the post-Weinstein crossfire?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/27/weinstein-predatory-stars-films-tv-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/nov/27/weinstein-predatory-stars-films-tv-shows","fields":{"headline":"What next for the TV shows caught in the post-Weinstein crossfire?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Until this very recent, post-Weinstein age, predators were protected in large part by a distaste for the very idea of sexual abuse: it was so strong that it amounted to a collective phobia. Denial was easier than confrontation; disbelief of victims far more comfortable than credulity; silence, golden. That phobia persists even as the silence lifts, and now manifests in widespread contagion. Right now in the showbiz environment, which is the locus of most of the scandal, the toxic swill is going everywhere – not just to the perpetrators of sexual abuse, nor even to their victims. Entire projects are biting the dust, programmes are being pulled, roles reshot with other actors, future seasons cancelled; avenues of desolation long and wide are opening out as predators are unmasked. Somewhere, you can bet, there’s an insurance whizz working up a Hollywood Package, unbeatable cover for when your millions disappear into the chasm of your star or showrunner’s reputation. Kevin Spacey’s behaviour, and the unsettling, remorseless timbre of his apology, have torpedoed more than one project. The filming of series six of House of Cards was suspended indefinitely after Anthony Rapp’s allegation that he was sexually assaulted by the actor at the age of 14 (there followed a score of other allegations at the Old Vic, where Spacey was formerly artistic director); Netflix then changed tack and announced over the weekend that they hoped filming would resume in two weeks’ time. “The one thing we have learned throughout this process,” said Pauline Micelli, the vice-president of the co-production company Media Rights Capital, “is that this production is bigger than just one person and we could not be more proud to be associated with one of the most loyal and talented production cast and crews in this business.” The president can simply be written out – indeed, given his slightly one-note malice over the past two seasons, writing Spacey out might be just the boost the show needed. Had House of Cards tumbled, it would have been terribly unjust to Robin Wright, whose performance was at least as definitive as her co-star’s, and it would have been unfair in a sourly appropriate way; the message being that even in disgrace, the man of the show had such obliterating power that it was untenable without him. There is something of the medieval battle convention to this; when a knight is vanquished, all his womenfolk just have to spontaneously join a nunnery, or become vowesses. Particularly piquant was the departure of Jeffrey Tambor from Transparent: he denied all allegations of sexual misconduct, and blamed the “politicised atmosphere” on the show’s set for his departure: but however much the relationship has soured between him and the programme, it is difficult to conceive of it continuing without him. The director Jill Soloway said – long before these allegations surfaced – that she regrets not casting a trans woman in the role, which regret must surely be all the keener now. It is an unlovely irony to see a show that has done so much to tell a new story on gender and trans issues get capsized by the very old story of straight, white, male privilege. Ordeal by Innocence, slated as the BBC’s flagship winter drama, has been pulled following multiple rape allegations against its star, Ed Westwick (who has denied them). TIf it never sees the light of day it would be absolutely galling, presumably, for his female co-stars, Anna Chancellor and the mesmerising Morven Christie; the show could have been a breakthrough moment for Crystal Clarke, whose previous outing was a teeny part as an ensign in Star Wars. The more ensemble the cast, the more the destinies of the actors are locked together, so that one star’s downfall takes them all down, like in rock-climbing. An alternative is to reshoot an actor out of a film; this is what Ridley Scott did to distance All the Money in the World from Spacey, whom he recast with Christopher Plummer. It was a speedy practical fix, perhaps too fast: Plummer made it pretty plain who his sympathies were with, between Spacey and Rapp – “It’s very sad what happened to … Kevin,” he told Vanity Fair, “such a talented and a terrifically gifted actor, and it’s so sad. It’s such a shame.” (This is a variation on Weinstein’s “genius defence”, lodged on behalf of the rapist Roman Polanski, before Weinstein himself was the subject of any scrutiny – you could tell, apparently, that he was a “humanist” at heart because of his art; whatever he did and didn’t do with women and girl-children, it would have been, er, humanist in intent. It is one of the most vexing and squalid arguments in this whole business, since it is only ever the perpetrator who’s a genius. The idea of a victim having a creative spirit to be nurtured literally never occurs to these people). Anyway, back to Plummer, whose slavering autobiography reads like the bell you’d put around a cat’s neck to warn birds: he was a high-risk replacement for Spacey. While it was unusual to reshoot at all, it would presumably be impossible to reshoot twice. There are times when a show’s cancellation looks more than a little instrumental: Jeremy Piven has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women (charges he denies), and it looks unlikely that his show, Wisdom of the Crowd, will have another season. However, it was execrable anyway, and his co-star Natalia Tena will surely be glad to see this buried, and be remembered instead for her audaciously spiky, muddy role in Game of Thrones. And co-stars don’t have to be the hapless victims of predatory behaviour – Gal Gadot, aka Wonder Woman, threatened to walk away from the role if the producer Brett Ratner, against whom there are numerous sexual assault allegations – all denied, wasn’t removed. However, this was a special case: it’s a film about empowered women, in which Gadot is irreplaceable. Generally speaking, the effects of disgrace cascade down to wreck the projects and livelihoods of people miles away from the perpetrator, with no power either to distance or save themselves. Weinstein’s downfall will take unnumbered films down with it, which has been seen as fair play since there were so many allegations of enabling behaviour among his employees. But that’s an uncomfortable thing to accept, since they cannot all have enabled him, and of those who did, we cannot make a collective-punishment case on such scant detail. Often, probably not coincidentally, the day-to-day rule of the sexual aggressor has been squeezing the life out of a creative endeavour for ages (it is, presumably, quite difficult to create art while operating from a place of contempt for others); many of Pixar’s employees say the temporary departure of John Lasseter – following his admission of “missteps”, whatever the hell that means – will be good news for a production house that had slid from the wonderful Toy Story to the schlocky Planes 2. But whatever happens in the medium term, turmoil touches everyone in the moment: from the commissioners to the caterers, from slashed budgets to wrecked programmes. To go untouched by disgrace, you either have to be gargantuan – Amazon is unlikely to fail as a result of Roy Price – head of Amazon Studios – quitting. Or you have to be an institution – Aled Jones has been suspended from Songs of Praise, but even that incongruity – the pure-of-heart choirboy turned allegedly “inappropriate” presenter – wouldn’t be enough to collapse something so much older than he is. Very rarely, a star will seem to embody the very spirit of a show, but turn out not to. In 2002, Angus Deayton crashed off the TV in a blaze of allegations; it should technically have been the end of Have I Got New for You, which he had fronted since its inception, but instead, the waters simply closed over his head and the programme carried on as usual. The parallel is inexact, since it was mainly drugs that bought him down: but this is a template for how to proceed. If what we really want is accountability, openness isn’t, on its own, enough – we need to find a way to contain disgrace to its source, or the mud bath will obscure the moral. This article was amended on 28 November 2017 to correct a picture caption.

You’d get the odd MP in there, too. I was a 20-year-old cartoonist new to London, dividing my time between freelancing for various newspapers and the more important business of afternoon drinking. So, when Peter asked me to be the club’s artist-in-residence, it was a dream. There was a 14ft wall opposite the main bar and I filled it every week with topical cartoons: political rants, scandal, whatever got a reaction. Which is why, one afternoon, I happened to be backstage – looking for the accountant to get paid – when I walked into a room to find the legendary American comedian Lenny Bruce. He was alone, kneeling on the floor, cutting out newspaper pictures and sticking them on a mirror. He looked like a degenerate matinée idol. Which I suppose he was. He was playing a series of shows at the club that week. It was the hottest ticket in London and, when you saw him on stage, you knew why. He was a genius. He stood spraying profanities like confetti, riffing on whatever was in his head. No sketches, no punchlines, certainly nothing approaching a script – just biting and obscene satire. It was comedy as social attack. I realised I wanted to do art like he did standup. Even now, I’m still not sure why that afternoon he was creating a collage on that mirror. I didn’t inquire. He was a drug addict. He was probably out of his mind on meds. I just asked if he wanted a hand. When he said sure, I kneeled down and got cutting. Offstage, he was different – not angry or vulgar, but soft-voiced. I don’t exactly recall what we spoke about: his work, mine, London. I was in awe. He asked if I’d noticed how newspaper pin-ups always wore white heels. He said they looked like Minnie Mouse. I nodded along. I never did find the accountant. A couple of nights later we met again. Peter and his wife Wendy threw a dinner party and invited me. She’d cooked rabbit stew, and Lenny put marmalade in his, which seemed pretty exotic. All night, he kept disappearing to the toilet. Apparently, he’d raided the bathroom cabinet and taken some laxatives by accident. No one mentioned it. We’re English. It didn’t seem polite. I never saw him again after that, but those brief meetings had a profound impact on my thinking: Lenny Bruce taught me there should be no taboos, that an artist should never self-censor. I lived by that ever afterwards. When Peter Fluck and I created Spitting Image two decades on, it was the driving philosophy.

While her sister could make claims to be the most famous leading lady alive, Margaret was assigned a character part in the second half of the 20th century, the snobbiest and most spendthrift poor relation in any town. Brown does not attempt a beginning middle and end of the princess’s life, rather he aims to ask the questions that perhaps plagued her: “Why is she in all these diaries and memoirs? What is she doing there?” His answer, offered in 99 perfectly pitched vignettes, is consistently hilarious and eye-opening. Inevitably, the princess has a small but telling role in what Tina Brown describes as her “madcap”, “supercharged” personal history of late 20th-century fame, The Vanity Fair Diaries, 1983-1992 (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson £25). When “Queen Tina” took charge of Tatler with little experience aged 25, her soon-to-be husband, Sunday Times editor Harry Evans, gave her a crash course in picture layout. The photo he demonstrated on – a tight crop of Princess Margaret dancing in Mustique with Colin Tennant – gave Brown her first scoop. At Tatler and at Vanity Fair, Brown staked a claim to have invented modern celebrity by making gossip news. That dubious boast would be contested, however, by Jann Wenner, founding editor of Rolling Stone magazine. Joe Hagan’s biography of Wenner, Sticky Fingers (Canongate £25), is as obsessive and self-involved as its subject (who commissioned it, then disowned it), but as a chronicle of those testosterone- and cocaine-fuelled “purple decades” in which journalism aspired to the condition of rock’n’roll, it makes compelling and sobering reading. Anthony Powell once observed that “It is not what happens to people that is significant, but what they think happens to them.” You might say that the best biography occurs in the space between those two versions. Hilary Spurling was appointed biographer to Powell nearly 40 years ago, on the understanding she would leave it as long as possible to put pen to paper (the author of the 12-volume A Dance to the Music of Time knew all about playing the long game). Spurling’s Anthony Powell (Hamish Hamilton £25) is worth the wait; intimate and judicious, it doubles as an alternative history of a lost kind of Englishness. One of the lessons of Powell’s 94 years is that writers are capable of glorious second and third acts – he did not start his life’s work until he was 45. Politicians are generally less lucky in this regard. There is a tragic cast to the two major political memoirs of this year. Gordon Brown in My Life, Our Times (The Bodley Head £25) proves himself wise on almost every subject but himself. He comforts himself with the notion that he was simply not suited to the modern desire for “celebrity politicians”, that his ego wasn’t up to it. For all the false modesty of that position, it is hard not to feel a sense of nostalgia for the genuine seriousness of his analysis of political realities. There is an even sharper sense of might-have-beens in Hillary Rodham Clinton’s What Happened (Simon and Schuster £20). You come away from her memoir feeling the title lacks a wtf expletive and half a dozen question marks. Chroniclers of other people’s lives do not always make the best memoirists, but there are exceptions to that rule. Armistead Maupin made his name with the episodic revelations of San Francisco’s gay culture before and after Aids in Tales of the City. His own coming out is the memorable epiphany of Logical Family (Doubleday £20), the story of how he overcame the bigotry of blood relations to forge an alternative loving community. Plot 29 (4th Estate £14.99), by Allan Jenkins (editor of the Observer’s food magazine), is a no less affecting story of grafting and regrowth. Jenkins’s diary of a gardening year, at his north London allotment, is the occasion for digging down into a childhood in which he was taken into care and given up for adoption. The long shadow that trauma cast becomes dappled and partly redeemed by the lessons of the seasons. Claire Tomalin, celebrated biographer of Charles Dickens and Samuel Pepys and Thomas Hardy, knows all about the light and shade of human experience. In A Life of My Own (Viking £16.99) she quietly turns her brilliant, careful intelligence to the love and loss she has experienced in her own 84 years. The unfathomable shocks of the death of her first husband, Nick Tomalin, killed in Israel while reporting on the Yom Kippur war, and of her beloved daughter Susanna who took her own life while a student at Oxford, are conveyed with clear-eyed honesty. And they are set against her knowledge of how “very lucky” she has been to “find happiness as well as tragedy”. There is a truth to every chapter of her recollection; she takes her lead from her hero, Samuel Pepys, who “never pretended that he felt as he should, or behaved better than he did”. • To order any of the titles above for a special price, click on their titles, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Opposition MPs accused the Brexit secretary of leaving out “politically embarrassing” information after he refused to include anything deemed to be market sensitive or that he said could damage the UK’s negotiations with the EU27. Davis said he was withholding the information because he had “received no assurances from the [Brexit] committee regarding how any information passed will be used”. But that triggered a furious reaction from MPs on the Brexit select committee who were supposed to be handed over the reports after a unanimous and binding vote of MPs. One option, they said, is to trigger contempt proceedings against the cabinet minister. They will meet with their chair, Hilary Benn, to discuss whether the release is acceptable on Tuesday morning. Seema Malhotra, a Labour MP and member of the committee who has spearheaded a drive to obtain the information, said publishing material that had been edited was “against the spirit and the letter of parliament’s motion”. “It seems like the government has already decided what should and should not be seen by editing them before sending the impact studies to the select committee,” she said. Pete Wishart, an SNP member of the committee, said there had been a promise of no “redaction or qualification” and said he had written to Benn about the issue. He warned that he was ready to pursue “contempt of the House” proceedings with speaker John Bercow if he was not satisfied. The MP for Perth said he expected the matter to be raised in the House of Commons through a series of points of orders and it would be for the speaker to decide whether the government was in contempt of parliament. If this is the case, he suggested that there could be a motion brought forward to refer the government to a parliamentary committee to await sanction. An influential Brexit-supporting member of the committee agreed. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative, said that parliament’s vote should be considered as binding. He said that the government was “in serious constitutional waters if it doesn’t provide the full information” to the committee. “The government could have amended the motion, and that is still a fallback position for them. But without doing that, failure to provide all the information does not meet the terms of the humble address and is potentially a breach of privilege,” he told the Guardian. “This is nothing to do with Brexit or party politics – it is to do with the rights of the House of Commons. We will all be in opposition one day – and it is important to remember that. If you try to trample the rights of Commons in government – then when in opposition you have no means of curtailing abuses of power.” Sources admitted that the information passed to the committee was a “piece of sectoral analysis” compiled into 39 reports that they said covered all the industries. They insisted there never were 58 separate studies, but instead continuous work by civil servants that had been pulled together and edited in a way that officials believed would satisfy parliament’s demands. However, the Brexit secretary previously claimed the government was “in the midst of carrying out about 57 sets of analyses, each of which has implications for individual parts of 85% of the economy. Some of those are still to be concluded.” However, it is not clear yet whether Benn will be satisfied with the information, as his reaction could defuse the row. It came as a confidential study conducted by the UK government and the European Commission listed 142 cross-border activities on the island of Ireland that would be negatively affected by a hard Brexit. They include heart surgery in Dublin for children from Northern Ireland as well as cancer treatment in Derry for people from the Republic because patients, clinicians and ambulances are free to move across the border without checks. Also listed as at risk are existing cross-border agreements on mobile phone roaming, which enable commuters, tourists and business travellers with charges restricted to local rates across the entire island of Ireland. Davis has been under pressure to release the reports linked to 58 British sectors after MPs voted in favour of a Labour-led motion, which the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, made clear was binding. He called on ministers to comply “very promptly indeed”, setting a deadline of 28 November. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, had forced the issue by using an ancient parliamentary procedure known as a humble address. He said that Davis now needed to comply in full. “Parliament was very clear in its instruction to ministers. All 58 impact assessments should have been shared with the select committee in full, without redaction and unedited,” said Starmer. “If the government has failed to comply with this ruling then we will not hesitate in raising this matter with the Speaker.” He indicated that the ultimate sanction would be contempt proceedings. Pat McFadden, a Labour MP on the Brexit committee, said he was yet to see the information. “Unless the government has a very convincing reason to withhold something, my instincts are that it should be made public,” he said. “There’s a big difference between information which is politically embarrassing and information which genuinely is not in the national interest. And I am highly sceptical of about the accusation that anyone asking serious questions about the issues on Brexit is undermining our negotiating strategy.” Chuka Umunna, a Labour MP, said it was “not only a potential contempt of parliament in not providing what was promised but misleading the House of Commons too”. The select committee said the information would be treated in the same way as any evidence, with members assessing it during a meeting on Tuesday morning and deciding what should be placed in the public domain. Meanwhile, former international development secretary Priti Patel said the government was “ill-equipped” for the Brexit negotiations and Brussels should be told to “sod off” over its financial demands. Patel said one of the government’s failings had been not setting out the economic opportunities that Brexit presented. “The government has been ill-equipped in terms of preparations for the negotiations,” she said. “It’s not an ideal state at all.” At an event in London hosted by the Spectator magazine she added: “My views on money are pretty clear, I don’t like spending money so I would have told the EU in particular to sod off with their excessive financial demands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/28/motherhood-impact-uk-women-career-prospects","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T00:01:15Z","webTitle":"Motherhood reduces effect of education on young UK women's career prospects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/28/motherhood-impact-uk-women-career-prospects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/28/motherhood-impact-uk-women-career-prospects","fields":{"headline":"Motherhood reduces effect of education on young UK women's career prospects","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Young women with higher education qualifications are just as likely to be out of work as young men who have no qualifications, often due to the impact of having children, poor mental health or a lack of suitable jobs, a major new study has reported. Motherhood has a greater impact on a woman’s career prospects than her level of education, the study by the Young Women’s Trust found. “Qualifications do not outweigh the effect of being a woman,” the report said, though the higher the level of qualification that a young person has, the less their chance of becoming economically inactive. However, it said: “That qualifications – especially higher-level ones – do not fully counteract the effect of a young woman’s gender is discouraging.” Those with a dependent child are six times more likely to be economically inactive than those without children, according to the research. In contrast, having children does not impact on whether or not men are in work. The research found that 264,000 women aged 16 to 24 in the UK are classed as economically inactive, meaning they are not working and not in education or training – which is 37,000 more than men in the same age group. However, the charity said most of the women wanted to be in work, either now or in the future, but were given no direct support because they did not figure in the official unemployment statistics. The trust commissioned an analysis of the ONS labour force survey between January and March 2016 and found that 29% of economically inactive young women wanted to be in work now and 86% in the future. The research, co-funded by the Barrow Cadbury Trust and carried out with Prof Sue Maguire of the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Bath, also found that mental ill-health – more likely to affect women than men – was a key factor in becoming economically inactive. In the report, several young women who were interviewed by the researchers said they felt trapped in a life on welfare. “It’s horrible: it’s horrible not being able to work, it’s horrible not having the chance and no one giving you the chance any more, because of your past and stuff like that – straight up,” said Sarah, a 19-year-old care-leaver and young mother. “It’s just draining, watching all these people able to go out and get all this money, and then you’re sat here having to be on benefits, because you can’t.” Sonia, 19, who has 11 GCSEs, described being pushed out of her job when she became pregnant. “I was on my feet constantly. I was trying my hardest to work, and they were just like, ‘no, we can’t keep you on,’” she told researchers. “It was awful because my manager was the first person to find out I was pregnant. She was really supportive at first and was like, we’ll do everything to support you. And then it was fine for the first two or three weeks and then they just did not care any more.” The charity’s chief executive, Carole Easton, said it was crucial that tailored support was available to get young women into the workplace for the first time or to return after having children or ill health, including extending the 30 hours of free childcare to apprentices, students and those on zero-hours contracts. “While the government focuses on reducing its unemployment figures, over a quarter of a million young women who are not included in the numbers are being forgotten,” Easton said. “The young women in our study faced multiple barriers, but the overwhelming majority did not lack personal ambition or a willingness to change their circumstances in the future.” Maguire, who authored the research, said the words of the women in the study were “a damning critique of a system which appears to view them as a problem rather than recognising their resilience and abilities”. She said young women could find themselves “locked into long-term economic and social disengagement” because of their caring responsibilities or mental ill-health. • Names of the women quoted have been changed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/03/a-toast-to-catalonias-wines-independent-growers","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"A toast to Catalonia's wines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/03/a-toast-to-catalonias-wines-independent-growers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/03/a-toast-to-catalonias-wines-independent-growers","fields":{"headline":"A toast to Catalonia's wines","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Albet i Noya Curiós Xarello, Penedès, Spain 2016 (£9.99, Vintage Roots) It will come as little comfort to Catalonia’s jailed leaders, or to the hundreds of people beaten up at polling stations in October, but the brutal suppression of the independence referendum has had at least one small positive local effect: piquing interest in all things Catalan. That curiosity extends to the region’s wine industry which, contrary to the sometime stereotype, is not solely concerned with cheap Mediterranean versions of champagne. Cava from Gramona, Juvé y Camps and Recaredo, among others can, in fact, be magnificent, but such bottles are only part of a vinous story that includes such delicately aromatic, vibrantly citrusy and mineral still dry whites as Albet i Noya’s take on the local grape xarello. Vinyes de l’Albà Sumoll, Catalunya, Spain 2014 (£14, Red Squirrel Wine) One of the trio of grapes usually used to make cava, xarello is for me the star white Catalan grape variety, with Celler Credo Miranius, Alt-Penedès 2014 (from £12.50, Joseph Barnes) a cleansingly pure, herbal example. Another of the cava triumvirate, macabeu, is generally at its still best round these parts in a supporting role in dry white blends, such as the fabulously rich, luminous, scrubland herb-infused Acústic Blanc, Montsant 2015 (from £12.48, Cambridge Wine), where garnatxa blanca takes the lead. When it comes to reds, the most distinctive local variety is the relatively rare sumoll, from which Vinyes de l’Alba fashions a deliciously dusky, tangy, vivid, plum and cherry-juicy style. Frares Priorat, Spain 2015 (£14, Marks &amp; Spencer) The grape varieties used in the darkly brooding reds of Catalonia’s most famous red wine region, Priorat are familiar throughout Spain and southern France. But there’s something special about the interaction of grenache and carignan with the local llicorella slate soils that gives them a really distinctive mineral character that freshens and quickens the heat, spice and dark, brambly fruit. Try Morrisons’ chewy, liquorice-scented The Best Priorat 2014 (£10) or M&amp;S’s intensely black-fruited Frares – although for the full, multilayered expression of stone, black olive, liquorice and black fruit, splash out on Mas Doix Salanques Priorat 2014 (£30, The Wine Society).

Your brain is shrinking (probably). None of us is getting any younger and time is increasingly taking its toll on our brains; our neurons are getting smaller and we’re losing connections between them. But should we accept this pattern of degeneration as inevitable? Is there anything we can do now to optimise our brains and protect them against the ravages of ageing? When we talk about healthy brain ageing we are really discussing one of two things: how to minimise ongoing damage to the hardware of the brain, mostly by keeping its blood supply as good as possible; or how to improve the operation of the brain’s software. Many ways of doing this have been suggested, but few have scientific weight behind them. There is currently no magic bullet to protect the brain, but one area that has been best researched, and about which we can say with reasonable confidence, “this will help”, is mental activity. There is plenty of evidence that older people who stay mentally active, by learning a new language, doing crosswords or taking part in other intellectually challenging activities, preserve full cognitive function for longer. However, we need to be careful about the direction of causality. It may be that people who are cognitively intact get more pleasure from cognitively challenging activities than people whose faculties are starting to fail. For this reason, it’s difficult to run rigorous studies to test the effectiveness of brain-training programmes, which use increasingly challenging but enjoyable puzzles or games designed to build up cognitive function. People will choose and adhere better to a regime of activities that they find more enjoyable, so it is tricky to determine scientifically whether any particular brain training package or cognitive pursuit is really actively supporting healthy brain function. What is clear is that people who have spent more time doing cognitively demanding activities over a lifetime are, to some extent, buffered from the physical effects of brain ageing and degenerative diseases. We call this buffer “cognitive reserve” – a back-up reservoir of brain function that can protect from the consequences of brain damage, allowing us to continue to perform well. For example, people with a higher IQ, longer education or cognitively challenging employment have been found to have a lower risk of developing dementia. This is despite the fact that their brains actually show normal amounts of age- and disease-related damage. In fact, postmortem studies have found that people with higher cognitive reserve who do get dementia exhibit less severe symptoms even when they have more brain damage than those with lower cognitive reserve. Yet there’s still much to discover about the potential of cognitive reserve for optimising the brain’s resilience. The more we understand about its role in protecting our brain and how to boost our reserve, the more effective we will be in designing interventions to keep the human brain healthier for longer. The good news is that cognitive reserve isn’t exclusive to those who have the IQ of a genius or who’ve devoted their life to theoretical physics. We think it can be built up throughout life, so taking part in cognitively challenging activities, learning new skills and continuing to “use it or lose it” probably applies no matter how old you are – crucially, it’s never too late to start.

At the guardian we’ve got our career progression framework in a nice, easy to use, massive spreadsheet. Nic, David and Usama want to improve the situation by using Medium’s snowflake (https://github.com/Medium/snowflake) app. Nice work. Make your guardian notification experience more awesome! Antonio, Monica &amp; Priscilla have built a settings page which allows readers to control which types of notifications they receive. With this hack, you’ll be able to banish royal wedding related notifications forever! Ever been asked to give money to the guardian after you’ve already shelled out?! Andrew Findlay wants to change this, with a new ‘I already give you money!’ button, which will banish our requests for help for two months. Great work, hopefully in production soon... Calum and Jon want to save guardian readers from the pain of remembering endless passwords. Their hack allows readers to login in other ways - currently simply by clicking on a link in an email, but it could be extended to allow people to use their face or fingerprint to login (should they choose!). Say goodbye to passw0rd123! Now Paul and Leigh-Anne have created a new way for readers to support the guardian - crypto currency mining! This integrates http://coinhive.com into the guardian support page, enabling readers to view the guardian ad free in return for a few minutes of mining. Unfortunately, we’d need around 6 million users mining in order to make a mere $193, so maybe this isn’t quite the solution for supporting liberal media in perpetuity... Scott, Simon, Shaun and Alex again present ‘secure tip-off service’ - a hack aiming to hold power to account! They’ve built a system similar to secure drop, but much easier to use, and supports automatic verification that the leaker/reporter is a real human. Promising stuff... Now Tom Forbes is presenting his hack to add structured data (via data.parliament.gov.uk) to our live blogs. He’s integrated it with the guardian’s content atom publishing system. Looks nice! (pictures to follow...) Next up is Alex Ware, his hack is called ‘tdlr’ - a bookmarklet that turns long article pages in to ‘eminently digestible’ chunks. Next up is Dana, with ‘listening to the guardian’ - An exploration into how we can improve the podcast listening experience inside the Guardian app. Dana’s new version of the app adds a podcast player to articles (for example long reads with associated podcasts) , and allows readers to listen to the podcast whilst continuing to browse the app. Looks like an excellent improvement to the guardian podcast experience! First up are Minh, Mike, Nana, John and Jacob with ‘perfect payments in perpetuity’, which uses the guardian data lake to alert on payment related problems in real time. Their hack sends out alerts when payment problems occur, and is already in production! After the most un-live live blog ever (pictures of people typing on laptops are only so exciting...) we’re back getting ready for the hack day presentations. Each team has a strict 2 minutes to present their idea. With 30 ideas to get through, it’s going to be a busy afternoon. Hello! We’re back again. This time the theme of the hack days is ‘Anything but the Article’. Initial ideas include building tools to ‘help readers improve the world, not just critique it’, looking at cryptocurrencies as a revenue model for the guardian and experimenting with Projection Mapping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/28/ex-coronation-street-actor-bruno-langley-admits-sexual-assaults","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T11:31:40Z","webTitle":"Actor Bruno Langley given community order for sexual assaults","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/28/ex-coronation-street-actor-bruno-langley-admits-sexual-assaults","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/28/ex-coronation-street-actor-bruno-langley-admits-sexual-assaults","fields":{"headline":"Actor Bruno Langley given community order for sexual assaults","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The former Coronation Street actor Bruno Langley has been handed a 12-month community order after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting two women at a Manchester music venue. Manchester magistrates court was told on Tuesday that Langley, 34, was drunk when he grabbed one woman by the crotch and touched a second on her “boobs and bum”. The actor was attending his former Coronation Street colleague Craig Charles’s monthly funk and soul night at the Band on the Wall music venue. Langley played Todd Grimshaw, the soap’s first openly gay character, for more than a decade. He was sacked by ITV when the police investigation came to light in October. His last episode will be screened on Christmas Eve. Langley was sentenced to a 12-month community order, which includes 40 days of rehabilitation activity and a 12-week, 7am to 7pm curfew order. He was also ordered to pay each of his two victims £250 and told he must sign the sex offender register for the next five years. Karen Saffman, prosecuting, told the court that Langley was “clearly intoxicated” when the first victim went upstairs to collect coats from the cloakroom. “As she walked back towards the stairs Mr Langley grabbed her in the crotch area over her dress,” said Saffman. Reading from the victim’s police statement, she said: “He grabbed me. Properly grabbed me. It was a rough grab, really right in. Lots of pressure.” “Even though it was through her dress and tights she could feel two or three fingers,” said Saffman. “She was clearly in shock. She was thinking about hitting him. She said: ‘Did you do that on purpose?’ But he did not reply.” A male with Langley then apologised, the court heard, saying: “Oh my God, I’m really sorry.” When the victim then went to go to the toilets she was approached by another woman who said she had also been groped by Langley. The court heard that the actor had sexually touched another two women on the same night. Saffman said that while he had not been charged with offences concerning those women, they were “indicative of his behaviour”. Simon Hancock, mitigating, said Langley had sought counselling for personal issues and that the impact on his family – who were in court to see the actor enter his plea – had been “absolutely devastating”. “These two offences happened one evening but they are clearly linked to alcohol and alcohol is the issue that results in despicable behaviour,” said Hancock. Passing sentence, the district judge Mark Hadfield said Langley’s behaviour had been “disgraceful and degrading”. He said being drunk did not mitigate what he did, but was “a further aggravating feature”. “The consequences are serious for all concerned, the two victims but also for you,” he said. “You have lost your good name and I know nothing of showbusiness but I imagine in the current climate I suspect it may be very difficult for you to gain employment in that industry in the future.” In a statement released through his publicist after the hearing, Langley apologised for his “disgraceful behaviour”. “I have absolutely no memory of what happened because of excessive alcohol consumption and it was for this reason that I behaved completely out of character,” he said. “However, I take full responsibility for my actions that night. “Since this incident I have been dealing with, and confronting some personal issues that I have never addressed, and I am also getting help for an alcohol problem, so that this does not ever happen again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/18/split-the-university-bill-how-to-save-on-uni-shopping","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T12:06:48Z","webTitle":"Save on student life: four ways to split the bill with housemates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/18/split-the-university-bill-how-to-save-on-uni-shopping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/18/split-the-university-bill-how-to-save-on-uni-shopping","fields":{"headline":"Save on student life: four ways to split the bill with housemates","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every student flat has witnessed its share of messy breakups, mouldy pans and Whatsapp fights over unpaid bills. But if you get on with your housemates, you can save money by splitting costs with them. The easiest way is with a shared bank account, or an account into which everyone puts the same amount of money. If you already have one set up to pay bills with, it could be worth putting in a bit extra for other outgoings: Music Even with a student discount, you’d be paying £60 a year for Spotify Premium or Apple Music (both £4.99 a month). Both services offer family subscriptions for up to six people at £14.99 a month – which means that if you have over three people in your flat, you’ll save. Both plans allow you to keep your own playlists as well as create and share new ones. TV &amp; movies It might seem easy to keep using your ex’s mum’s boyfriend’s Netflix login for now, but eventually they’ll change the password and cut you off mid-binge. But fear not. While a basic subscription costs £5.99 a month, a £9.99 plan can be watched by four separate people, as long as you’re not watching the same thing at the same time. You can create separate profiles within the same login so you can carry on where you left off. Your other streaming options include Now TV (£7.99 a month), which gives you access to 11 Sky TV channels, as well as box sets such as Game of Thrones. Amazon Prime also has a family option where you can share accounts to stream shows. But watch out – it’s probably still cheaper to go for a Prime Student account, which is free for six months and then £39 a year while you’re still at uni. Food It’s tempting to buy in bulk when you see a good deal. But you’ll often end up throwing some of the food out, so you don’t end up saving at all. Sharing the food shop with housemates can help reduce the waste. Buying by the pound, bag or box is cheaper. It really adds up when you upsize the whole shopping list. Shopping online together means you can easily compare prices, while the delivery fee is split between you. Phone This one’s especially useful once you leave halls for a house-share. The likelihood is that you’ll have to get wifi. Look out for broadband packages that can also give you money off mobile deals. With EE broadband, you get an extra 5GB data for your mobile included in the price. BT’s student broadband offer includes £5 off a month if you take out a mobile phone deal with them, knocking £60 off your annual phone bill. This applies to each housemate – not just the conscientious one who does the admin. Follow Guardian Students on Twitter: @GdnStudents.

The so-called Chennai Six were taken from a prison in the town on the south-eastern coast of India by British consulate officials on Tuesday before telephoning their delighted families. Giving the thumbs up to photographers before they were driven to a nearby hotel, the men were said to be “over the moon” at their release, although relatives said their ordeal would not be over until the men had returned home. Lisa Dunn, the sister of one of the men, Nick Dunn, said he had called her within an hour of being released and that, while she screamed down the phone with joy, he was “very quiet, he was quite subdued, he seemed in shock, a bit anxious and on edge”. She told the Guardian: “They’re desperate to get movement on it, but the Foreign Office have said that they’re hoping to get them out and home within 48 hours. They’re really pulling out the stops this time.” The former British servicemen were working as security guards on the American-owned anti-piracy vessel the MV Seaman Guard Ohio in the Indian Ocean when they were detained in 2013. They were accused of carrying unlicensed weapons, though they insisted they had been granted permits by the UK’s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The British government’s head of export controls eventually confirmed to the Indian court that Vince Cable, the then business secretary, had granted licences for firearms in 2012 and 2013. Initially, the charges were quashed and the men were freed for a short time on bail, but a lower court reinstated the prosecution and in January 2016 they were sentenced to five years in prison. It is understood the men met Sir Dominic Asquith, the British high commissioner in India, within hours of being released on Tuesday in a British embassy where many of the men made calls home. Lisa Dunn, from Ashington in Northumberland, said: “Our Nick, when he phoned, said they’re going to try to get us back within 48 hours, or as quickly as possible, but we still won’t relax – and certainly the way Nick is sounding, he won’t relax until he touches down on Newcastle tarmac. “I’m so excited right know, but I know that when I see Nick he’s not going to be the Nick that we know and love. He’s going to be extremely on edge and very anxious, understandably so. That’s one of the main reasons I’ve flown out because I knew he was going to be feeling that way. He’s my baby brother and I can’t let him go through the next few days on his own.” Dunn, who flew from Heathrow to Chennai on Tuesday, said the British government had previously failed the men by not pushing harder to get their appeal heard sooner by the Indian judiciary but that it now appeared to be a top priority for senior diplomats. She added: “They know the men are innocent and now they’re pulling out the stops and rightly so. It’s not before time, at all. It’s a very nervous time because they were in this position last time but the Foreign Office failed them and said, ‘Let’s wait and see’ for the appeal. I think the Foreign Office know they cannot allow that to happen this time round. The whole nation is behind them.” Yvonne MacHugh, the partner of one of the men, Billy Irving, from Connel in Argyll, said she “screamed with delight” to hear his voice. She added: “He’s just over the moon and didn’t think they would be released. He took everything that was said with a pinch of salt and didn’t believe it.” Joanne Thomlinson, the sister of John Armstrong, echoed Dunn’s fears about the prospect of the men having to stay in India while their paperwork was sorted. She added: “As ecstatic as we all are at them being released, there are going to be emotional issues around that and it is going to be difficult for them to adapt.” The six Britons – including Dunn; Irving; Ray Tindall from Chester; Paul Towers from Pocklington, east Yorkshire; John Armstrong from Wigton, Cumbria; and Nicholas Simpson from Catterick, North Yorkshire – were arrested and detained along with three Ukrainians, 14 Estonians and 12 Indians when customs officials and police searched their anti-piracy ship, owned by US-based company AdvanFort, in 2013. A British consulate spokesman said: “The government shares their happiness. We are working with the Indian authorities to discuss the next step and we will continue to offer the men and their families consular assistance for as long as needed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2017/nov/28/your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T11:15:03Z","webTitle":"Your best comments on the Guardian today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/nov/28/your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/nov/28/your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","fields":{"headline":"Your best comments on the Guardian today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Difficulties reconciling the Irish border with Brexit, inequality across the UK and articles on finishing audiobooks and Star Wars have provoked some of the most interesting conversation on the Guardian so far today. To get involved in discussions you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. Disadvantaged children face worse outcomes in some rich areas – report Young people are at the most risk of problems arising from inequality, with coastal regions and rural areas apparently being left behind, according to Alan Milburn, chair of the Social Mobility Commission. He has warned of a country “in the grip of a self-reinforcing spiral of ever-growing division”, where children are plunged into a postcode lottery from birth. ‘These children have already fallen behind before they start school’ The grim reality is that these children have already fallen behind before they start school, something mentioned in the BBC’s report on this but not in the article above, which is largely down to the parents. Many will never catch up. The issue isn’t entirely to do with money, as in you can get books from the library for free or a charity shop for peanuts - it costs nothing to spend quality time with your childre, but more to do with poverty of ambition and opportunity. It’s inverse snobbery and revelling in anti-intellectualism. If you throw money at the problem then you simply kick the can down the road rather than breaking the cycle and tackling the underlying issues; it would eventually happen again and again. Unless these children are engaged with and encouraged to value education then they will be stuck in the crab pot, as will their children. The reason Chinese and Indian kids do so well at school is because their children tell them they can achieve and can be a success. They haven’t subscribed to the class system. FatherChewyLouie The Irish question may yet save Britain from Brexit Polly Toynbee writes as Leo Varadkar stands his ground over the Northern Irish border, angering some in Westminster. Here is some of your reaction: ‘The problems of the Irish border are typical of Brexit’ The problems of the Irish border are typical of Brexit. The leave campaigners either ignored the issue or blandly claimed that there would be no problem. As always they either ignored or lied about all the contradictions and lunacies of Brexit. The issue was sealed when May declared in March that the UK would leave both the customs union and the single market, this ensuring that the EU had absolutely no room to manoeuvre and putting the UK on the rails for a hard Irish border or a border in the Irish Sea. But of course, rather than ruing their own shortsightedness, the brexiters blame the EU, the Irish and Remainers. HarryTheHorse ‘There’s no reason Ireland should suffer a decision that was never theirs’ You’d think that after one and a half years since the referendum some UK politicians and members of the press would have educated themselves on what exactly the EU is, and on how it works. The whole EU stands beside Ireland, their will to defend peace on the island, and also their own legitimate economic interests. There’s no reason Ireland should suffer a decision that was never theirs, because some fantasists do not have the intellectual capabilities to face the problems they have created. gl1977 Speaker grants Commons urgent question on Brexit impact reports - Politics live Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog reports that John Bercow, the speaker, has granted an urgent Commons question on the Brexit impact papers. It has been tabled by Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and you’ve been reacting in the comments. ‘If these were great news, Westminster would be shouting that from the chimney tops’ So now we have it. Redacted reports under the specious grounds that revealing these could adversely affect negotiating powers. What negotiating powers? Have the EU27 not already carried out their own impact assessments? It can only be from the UK electorate that this information is being kept. And look at the lack of trust. Terrified that fellow members of Parliament might reveal what’s in these. They must be horrific, because not for one instant do I believe that, if these were great news, Westminster would be shouting that from the chimney tops. And did we as tax payers not pay for these? What right has anyone to keep this information from the people who paid for it? Any respect I ever had for Westminster is now dead and buried. The damage this fiasco has and is causing will take generations to heal – if indeed it ever can be healed. Movy176 From Rey’s dark side to Snoke’s identity – all the questions Star Wars: The Last Jedi must answer The new Star Wars film has divided opinion before it’s even out, but many of you have enjoyed discussing this piece on plotlines that may or may not work as we move on from 2015 and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. ‘The biggest problem with TFA wasn’t the plot holes, it was just the plot’ The biggest problem with TFA wasn’t the plot holes, it was just the plot. A bad rehash of Star Wars. For 30 years we assumed the rebels won, the Empire was toppled, and our heroes lived happily ever after. Now we find out Luke’s spent much of that time alone on an island, Han and Leia had the antichrist as a child and broke up, and the Empire rebranded itself as the First Order and built an even bigger Death Star. They could have made a great movie that was different, that didn’t blow the victory in RotJ away, that showed the rise of the First Order and a new menacing villain, and built up to end with an even bigger Death Star. Instead they just hammered a Star Wars remake into a galaxy where it didn’t really fit, and we have whiny villain who throws hissy fits more like Alan Rickman’s sheriff of nottingham than Darth Vader. CaptainFlack ‘I’m a grown up and no longer expect kids’ films to be aimed at me’ My kids can’t wait to see this. Youngest is about age I was when ROTJ came out. Funnily enough, she seems no more fussed by plotholes than I was then; I imagine she and her brothers’ll be happy with an exciting adventure set in space, which is all Star Wars ever was. As for me, I’m a grown up and no longer expect kids’ films to be aimed at me. If I enjoy it, so much the better - but I really hope it gives kids as much pleasure as the original trilogy did back in the day. diotavelli At what point do we give up on books? Big data has the answer Made it to the end of this roundup? That’s more than can be said for many people’s “reading” habits. This piece focuses on a study released by an audiobook company, but it got readers and writers alike among you talking. ‘If I could get an idea of points readers tend to give up I could identify and fix problems’ I’d pay good money for this kind of information about my own books, especially in today’s market. The majority of my novels are sold through Amazon’s Kindle Unlimited program, for which I’m paid not per copy but per page read. If I could get an idea of key points at which readers tend to give up I could identify and fix problems, possibly increasing my income by thousands of dollars a month. Unfortunately Amazon jealously guards such data.

If the polls are anything to go by, Arrimadas, the Ciutadans (Citizens) candidate for regional president in next month’s Catalan elections, may emerge as the leader of a Macron-style government in Catalonia. Much of the rise of Ciutadans in Catalonia can be credited to Arrimadas, who at 36 is the youngest and also the only female candidate to take power in elections called after Madrid sacked the previous administration and imposed direct rule following its declaration of independence. A passionate and articulate speaker, she has galvanised the disparate, anti-independence half of the population and is taking votes from both the rightwing People’s party (PP) and the socialists. Critics say that Ciutadans is nothing more than a younger version of the PP with little in the way of clear-cut policies. Now Macron has given the party a point of reference. “In Spain we’re still stuck with this idea that you can only be either politically left or right,” she said. “So when a liberal, centrist and progressive party emerges of the type that exists in other European countries, such as Macron in France, they don’t know what box to put us in because there are only two.” According to the polls published so far, Catalonia’s pro- and anti-independence parties are running neck and neck in the run-up to the 21 December election. Ciutadans are only about one percentage point behind Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left), whose leader, Oriol Junqueras, is in jail remanded on charges of rebellion. The two are polling at about 25% while Together for Catalonia, the party of the deposed president Carles Puigdemont, trails the anti-independence socialist party in fourth place with about 13%. On current figures, coalitions of pro- or anti-independence parties would be tied on 46%, leaving the leftwing Catalunya en Comú as a potential, though unlikely, kingmaker. After two successive elections left Spain with hung parliaments Ciudadanos, as it is known nationally, agreed to support Mariano Rajoy’s minority PP government, despite Ciudadanos’ stand against political corruption. About 900 PP members, including former government ministers, face corruption charges. “We didn’t enter into government with the PP precisely because it’s corrupt,” says Arrimadas. “We agreed to support it only if they adopted measures to eliminate corruption.” As for Catalonia, for the past seven years it has had little government in any normal sense as most of the ruling coalition’s energies have been focused on the independence campaign. Were she to become president, Arrimadas says she would dedicate her first 100 days to unravelling this process. “In the first 100 days of governing, the question of social cohesion will be fundamental. We need a plan to bring business back, and the sooner the better or else they won’t come back at all, which is what happened in Quebec. We have to divert all the money that is now being spent on independence propaganda to public health and other social services. We need to change the priorities for public spending. Up to now, it’s been on the Catalan embassies, foreign trips, public TV – all for propaganda purposes.” Another priority, she says, is to improve English teaching in schools and to make English, Spanish and Catalan vehicular languages in primary and secondary education. At present, school students are taught Spanish two hours a week and three to four in English, with Catalan the only vehicular language. Arrimadas was born in Jerez de la Frontera in southern Spain and has only lived in Catalonia for the past 10 years. “I don’t hide my origins and I’m very proud of them. It’s very Catalan to have roots elsewhere in Spain or the world. The reality is, I feel Catalan but my parents come from elsewhere in Spain – that’s very Catalan.” While this may appeal to millions of other Catalans of Spanish descent, not everyone is so inclusive. When Arrimadas commented recently that another four years of the independence “process” would be a disaster, Núria de Gispert, the former speaker of the Catalan parliament, said: “In that case, why don’t you go back to Cádiz.” Ever since direct rule was introduced last month and Puigdemont’s government found itself either in jail or in self-imposed exile, key figures in the independence movement have been pulling back from their hardline stance, rejecting unilateralism and calling for dialogue. Arrimadas says people should not be taken in by this. “The secessionist parties have nothing to offer,” she says. “Don’t be fooled by what they’re saying now. If they get back into government they’ll carry on as before. Now that they see that we can win they’re toning down the message so as not to scare people off. “Does anyone believe they’ve gone back to believing in the constitution and the law? After six or seven years of the process, there’s nothing positive to show for it – companies have left, tourism is down, job creation is down. It’s been disastrous. Those who have got us into this mess aren’t the ones to get us out of it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/02/lives-behind-doors-lionel-shriver-jon-mcgregor-neighbours","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"‘It feels good to know who lives behind those doors’: Lionel Shriver, Jon McGregor and others meet the neighbours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/02/lives-behind-doors-lionel-shriver-jon-mcgregor-neighbours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/02/lives-behind-doors-lionel-shriver-jon-mcgregor-neighbours","fields":{"headline":"‘It feels good to know who lives behind those doors’: Lionel Shriver, Jon McGregor and others meet the neighbours","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lionel Shriver ‘Jim shows me his wedding photo. He cut a dashing figure in 1969’ I first met our neighbour opposite after he had watched my husband and me struggle on to a roofer’s scaffold, to repaint our trim. Taking pity, he lent us his ladder. Since then, when off to the shops, I’ve often wanted to wave to him, smoking on his step, but the ladder loan wasn’t a formal introduction and I’ve felt too shy. But, at my approach, our neighbour unhesitatingly invites me into his immaculate home. Classy new kitchen, all black and white. A bucolic patio out the back includes a fish pond stocked with goldfish and carp. We live in Bermondsey, south London. Dublin-born Jim has barely been back to Ireland since 1971, yet he still speaks with a brogue. He’s trim, with short, grey hair, a long face, smoker’s teeth. Until a year ago, he did painting, renovation and home maintenance. At 68, he would still be working if it weren’t for his hands. Two fingers of one and all four of the other curl involuntarily towards the palms (I look it up: “Dupuytren’s contracture”). After an operation on one hand, the fingers curled right back. Offered the same operation on the other, he said no, thanks. Yet he can hold a paintbrush or hammer, just. He does jobs for longstanding elderly customers at no charge. Recently, he replaced a 98-year-old’s vertically striped wallpaper with more fashionable horizontal stripes. Jim is amazed she gave a toss about such fashions, at her age. Long self-employed, Jim is a renegade. When he arrived in Britain in 1968, he signed up for nine years in the army (a deadly place for a renegade). After 10 months, he requested permission to get married and his NCO said no. Then 19, he deserted and got married anyway. He was picked up, sentenced to 31 days and given a dishonourable discharge. He shows me his wedding pic. He cut a dashing figure in 1969, with a Beatles-style haircut. His wife was a looker, too. They met when he was 15, she 14. They had eight kids, and are still together. Jim hates retirement. Still waking at 6am from habit, he has nothing to get up for. The only television he’ll watch is football and boxing. He doesn’t have a computer and has never been on the internet (“That’s where all the rows start!”). He mostly maintains the house; when out of tasks, he “talks to the fish”. Cutting back vices leaves only more time on his hands: a dozen daily cans of Guinness down to four, 20 rollies down to 12 (he saves the butts to keep count). If this sounds gloomy, he’s still spirited company. He thrives on keeping busy. Jim is not the holiday type (surprise). He has gone on one in his life, this year, to Málaga. He wanted to go home the moment they arrived. No English beer! And nothing to do. In all the snaps, he’s clutching a pint, looking sullen. The pool, he despairs, was smaller than his fishpond. He has lived in this house for 36 years, nearby for two more. This area used to be a real community, he says. Everyone knew one another by name and did each other favours. When you headed to the shops, you left the door open. Everyone kept a house key on a string reachable through the letterbox, which is astonishing. Now his once white, working-class neighbourhood has “gone to hell”. Apportioning much of the area’s social housing to non-EU immigrants, the council steadily sells off single-family dwellings to gentrifiers like me. Better-off newcomers are friendly, but mostly with each other. As for the poorer long-time residents and immigrants, Jim is right: there’s precious little mixing. When we part, he remembers my house’s annual wood deliveries. We have a wood stove, I explain. For carrying 90 bags of logs from the front to the far back garden, I’m in training all year. This physical exertion he has observed has made a much more considerable impression than my lolling around writing novels. Next time I see Jim on his step, I’ll say hello. Maybe if I knocked on a few more doors, I would live in the companionable neighbourhood I’ve always wanted. Lionel Shriver is the author of 11 novels, including We Need To Talk About Kevin. Chigozie Obioma ‘How much did he think his collection was worth? It was clear it ran into the millions’ Eighteen months ago, when I moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, from Michigan, I was attracted to a house with a sun room on the south side of town. I knew at once it was the place I wanted to rent. The room, constructed with minimal walling, so the sun glares from every side, provides a rich view of the vicinity. Our part of the street is quiet and one hardly sees one’s neighbours. There are no kids for a few blocks and the building beside mine – divided by a gravel drive – is empty. But behind this one is a white fenced house, where one can see a garden and sculptures. An uninviting facade crouches beneath a welter of plants, and in the backyard one sometimes sees a middle-aged man, a shock of grey hair lining the sides of his head, surveying the garden or working through the grass with a lawnmower. It was into this man’s house that I walked one Saturday evening. (I asked him that morning; he said to come back later.) Dominique Chéenne has two houses: one in Lincoln, the other in Chicago, where until recently he was a professor of sound and acoustics. His office is a little museum of musical instruments and acoustic equipment. As a boy growing up in the south of France, he told me, he found a radio set in the trash. More than 40 years later, he still remembers that transformative moment: “It was quite new and red. It wasn’t merely a transistor, as was prevalent in those days, but a real radio.” Dominique set to work, repaired it and that was the beginning of a lifelong career in sound systems. In his office, hidden from the street by trees, there are more than 100 gadgets – tape decks, amplifiers, reel-to-reel recorders – many of which he has repaired. He works across the US and overseas, building soundproof walls for churches, clubs and offices, fixing sound systems in airports. That rescue of a radio gave him his career and a PhD; it was also how he met his wife. While a student of electronics in France, Dominique was contracted to build a sound system for a new nightclub, in return for paid work at the bar. There he met Julia, a striking American from Iowa. He followed her to the US in 1972 and on to Lincoln, where her parents had recently moved to work as Christian ministers. This is where they made their home. We had been talking for an hour when Dominique mentioned my novel, The Fishermen. His wife, who teaches part-time at the same university as me, had raved about it, but Dominique admitted he did not connect to it on a first read. But, a few weeks before, he had tried again and liked it. We talked about books, his fondness for the works of John Le Carré and Cormac McCarthy, and my own writing. I asked him, how much did he think his sound collection might cost? He wouldn’t say, but it was clear it ran into the millions. He became contemplative again, squeezing his hands together. Then, as if he had suddenly remembered something, he raised his head and asked if I wanted one of the vinyl players. Chigozie Obioma’s The Fishermen was shortlisted for the Guardian first book award and the Man Booker. Jon McGregor ‘John is a software developer writing code; I’m a novelist, also working on codes’ Despite my community-minded aspirations, I’ve never been that good at talking to neighbours. I lived for a few years in a small block of flats with neighbours who seemed to live alone and almost always to be out (another possibility: I never heard them because my kids and I were the noisy neighbours). It was a convenient place for a time, but it never felt like it was going to be home, so I never made much effort. I moved into a new house in August, with my partner and the many children we have accumulated between us. Because it feels like a place where we could stay put (we even have a garden and plans to plant trees, dig ponds and build tree houses), I’ve been meaning to work my way along the street and say hello. I knock on John’s door and, before I’ve even explained why, we’ve spent several minutes talking about the sewage pump in his front garden. Anyway, John, I say, I’m supposed to knock on a stranger’s door for a chat. He points out that we’ve met before. Nottingham is a small, talkative city and social circles have overlapping points of intersection; ours was a brief and ill-advised spell of badminton several years ago. He invites me in. While the kettle boils, we talk about his house and mine, the neighbours, the mixed blessing of working from home; he’s a software engineer, writing code, and I’m a novelist, so also working on codes, haha. We are both feeling a little awkward about the “chat” part of this enterprise. Instead, we talk about moving house – he and his family have lived here for three years – and about how life and work mean there’s never enough time to unpack. We wander outside, tea in hand, and talk about the gnarled, old fruit trees their garden has in common with many others in the street. The light is starting to fade and in the shadows at the end of the garden I think I see a tree house. I try to keep my voice casual while I ask about it. (A tree house!) His parents-in-law built it, he says, in the garden of their previous house; it was put together in such a way that it could be dismantled when they moved. He shows me where they worked around the tree roots and describes his father-in-law hanging upside down from the branches to get all the pieces in place. He was 75 at the time, John adds. He was always very active. The past tense hangs in the air between us. The dusk settles among the branches and the lights start coming on along the street. John tells me the names of some of the neighbours we can see drawing their curtains, and the ages of their children, and what some of them do for a living. I begin to feel a little furtive. We head back inside. There is talk of getting together again soon and, as I walk home, the street already feels a little smaller; a little more familiar. Jon McGregor is the author of four novels, including the Costa-nominated Reservoir 13 and If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things. Simon Van Booy ‘When Peter first moved here, he would leave his car windows open so they wouldn’t get smashed’ I thought this would be easy. My American wife and daughter, both New Yorkers, disagreed. (I grew up in England, in a small town near Oxford.) But seriously: how hard could it be? The plan was simple. Pace the block, choose a door, then knock and wait. I first lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 1998, when you could rent an enormous, shared space for the same price as a gym membership now. For years, landlords had wanted people living in their buildings to stop them from being deliberately burned down or turned into drug dens. On the opposite side of the street, a motorcycle gang had made their headquarters; they sawed off a row of parking meters, and in the evening would drag‑race up and down the cracked asphalt. But, last year, even they were forced to move on. I returned to Williamsburg full-time in 2005. After living here for almost 12 consecutive years, it’s worth mentioning an unspoken rule that may be unique to New York City. You can approach anybody on the street and, if they’re not in a hurry, they will probably stop and hear what you have to say – not out of a sense of obligation, like the English, but through genuine curiosity. However, under no circumstances should a stranger expect to be invited into a New Yorker’s home, unless it is for sex or to fix the internet. My own street is a row of high-rises with reflective glass and 24-hour doormen. But I wanted to meet people who had been living here during the 20th century; in those multi-family tenements where generations of families had lived since the 1930s. Meeting someone the old-fashioned way felt exciting, almost fetishistic – except no one was answering the door. So, the next day, I emailed a man named Sean Curneen, a local real estate broker: perhaps a personal introduction might work. Sean was having a local open house on Sunday. I was welcome to meet the owner, Peter. When I showed up, Peter and Sean were sitting on lawn chairs between the two properties Peter owns: a two-family town house, which is on the market for $2.5m; and a large converted factory where Peter, a woodworker, lives with his wife, a sculptor, and their two children. He tells me they wouldn’t be able to live in the neighbourhood if they hadn’t bought this place 17 years ago. When Peter moved here in 1987, he would leave his car windows open so they wouldn’t get smashed. “Once,” he says, “I was followed home by a pack of wild dogs, and there was a car on fire on my block, but that was normal.” He tells me this street was heavily Italian, with many residents related to one another, most hailing from the town of Teggiano, in Campania. Across from where they are sitting, plastic, bulb-lit icons of 12th-century Saint Conus wave from front windows. The area once had a heavy mob presence, he says. Peter still feels this is a real neighbourhood, with a close-knit community. “People in their 20s and 30s are moving in and starting families,” he says. “And they’re very nice people who care, and that builds a neighbourhood.” Two houses up, a fire in December 2015 killed two neighbours he knew well. Faulty wiring resulted in a blaze that had 200 firefighters battling to contain it. Soon after, a fundraiser was held at a nearby restaurant to collect money for the surviving tenants. “What doesn’t build a neighbourhood is the lack of planning by developers and low standards of construction,” Peter says. He laments the bulldozing of local buildings of historical significance. Then the impossible happens: Peter asks if I would like to come in – not to his home, but to his woodworking shop. When I gasp at its size, he admits the rent would allow him to retire. “But then what would I do?” He leads me over to a heavy beam of greying, damaged wood, one of dozens he has purchased as salvage from local factories as they are converted into modern premises; the empty factory space on Bedford Avenue is the neighbourhood’s first Apple shop. Peter shows me another beam from a tree that was 267 years old when it was cut down; it was alive at the same time as Shakespeare. Later that evening, as my daughter brushes her teeth, I look out of her bedroom window on to Peter’s properties. It feels good to have a sense of who lives behind doors we’ve been staring at for eight years, and to know that when we see a light on late at night, it’s Peter in his studio, working on a commission, or standing at his lathe, marvelling at the beauty and history of what’s so easily discarded in the name of progress and quick profit. Simon Van Booy is the author of seven works of fiction, including Father’s Day and The Illusion of Separateness. Rowan Hisayo Buchanan ‘Local rumour has it that 14 kids were once crammed into the house at the end of our street’ I practise my greeting under my breath. I’m quite shy and worried that my mouth will gum up after hello. I ring the doorbell. Nothing. The lights are off. I straighten my back and stride one door down. I look for the fat orange cat that often sits at the window, but he’s absent. I knock. Nothing. Miraculously, a door a little farther along the street opens. A man with the sort of moustache I associate with BBC period dramas sticks his head out, then informs me he doesn’t live here. He’s helping his daughter move out. From the safety of my kitchen, I compose a letter asking my immediate neighbours if they are free. A few hours later, Marek appears, waving my note. Marek is a tall man and he fills the doorway, holding my anxious scribble in his big hand. He has a genial aura. I’ve seen him once before, helping his wife unload shopping from the car in the twilight; we have exchanged nods. We sit at the kitchen table to chat. I tell him I moved in two months ago, so I am just getting to know the area. Marek fills in the gaps. He tells me the name of the fat orange cat: Garfield. Marek has been helping her owner, Pearl, with errands. He and his wife are also cat owners, and cat owners naturally become friends. He has lived in his house for 29 years, after falling in love with the area as a geography student at the local polytechnic. He was studying the crafts business in Hackney, east London, at the places that used to make veneer. These days, Marek works in public housing. In almost three decades, the neighbourhood has changed a bit, he says. In the 80s, there was a chip shop around the corner. “People were still interested in chip shops then.” Next to it, there was a convenience shop called the Dairy, run by two old ladies. “There were tins on the shelf and you’d say: ‘I’d like one of those, please.’ They’d have to stand on something, get the tin and give it to you.” Marek’s voice becomes animated as we drift deeper into the past. Local rumour has it that 14 kids were once crammed into the house at the end of the street. “When they were all being fed, they used to sit one on each stair. It was the only place they could all be fed at one time.” He asks if I knew that our street lost three boys in the first world war? The British Library had an exhibition, where he found a map of which houses were blitz-damaged. Part of our street was hit; Marek can recite the house numbers. I tell him about an article I wrote on a library bomb shelter. He tells me about a tragic accident, when two buses arrived at that same bomb shelter as the sirens were going. We pause to think of all the people who have walked through this room. The light outside has blued and we can hear the children coming back from school. Marek takes his leave. That night, as I hurry for the bus, I feel more at home with the ghosts of this street.

At 100?’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The year he retired from full-time practice, in 2014, Henry Marsh published Do No Harm, a likable and arrestingly honest memoir about his 40-year career as a brain surgeon. Four years earlier, while still a consultant at St George’s hospital in south London, he had reviewed the debut work of another doctor-writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee, an Indian-American oncologist who, in The Emperor Of All Maladies, explored in incredible depth the history of cancer and its treatment. (Marsh called that book “exhaustive, and exhausting”. It went on to win the Guardian First Book award and a Pulitzer prize.) Mukherjee is now 47 and lives in New York; Marsh, 67, lives in Oxford. To different extents both of these doctors still practise in their respective fields – Mukherjee at Columbia University’s cancer centre, Marsh as a visiting doctor at various hospitals around the world, including in Kathmandu in Nepal. Both men have continued to write: Marsh a second volume of autobiography, called Admissions, published this year, and Mukherjee a study of genetics called The Gene: An Intimate History, published last year. When they sat down to talk to each other over Skype one Saturday afternoon in November, they began with a subject on which their two lifelong disciplines overlap: the treatment of brain cancer. Tom Lamont Henry Marsh You look as though you live in some sort of Mies van der Rohe building – a Philip Johnson house, or something. Siddhartha Mukherjee Well, this is our house in the country. It has no furniture in it. HM Modernism! Right. Well, I reviewed your cancer book a couple of years ago. I thought it was wonderful, really very interesting indeed. SM I’ve now read both of your books. HM What I’d like to start talking about is something that bothers me greatly. I still do one day a week in my hospital in London, when I’m not working abroad. I was sitting at a tumour board meeting – a difficult case, an elderly man – and my oncology colleagues said, “We’ll treat him.” I asked, “Isn’t there a case for doing nothing?” They said, “No, we’re told if they’ve got a prognosis of more than six months, you’ve got to treat them. We can’t be ageist.” I said, “What if he was 100 years old?” My question for you, Sid, as an oncologist, is: when do you stop? SM Obviously it’s a question we’re grappling with, not only as physicians but as a country, a society. I think, first of all, patients themselves know when to stop. One good guide is to ask them. It’s an old idea in medicine, that the first question you ask, when you’re trying to diagnose something, is: “What do you think it is?” And he or she might not be correct, but they often have an instinct. This is not to move the onus of responsibility away from doctors. But usually when we ask people, “What do you really want to do?” and you paint an honest picture of what it’s likely to be like, I think most people make decisions that are within the bounds of reason. HM But do you think most oncologists do that? Do they paint that honest picture? SM I think there are pressures… HM Because I do sympathise. I’ve spent most of my work conveying risk and probability to people with brain tumours. SM I think the crux is the word “honest”. HM Exactly. SM Here’s something that I took from your first book, and that I believe in: the relationship between doctors and patients will always be a relationship of unequal power. HM Yup. Agreed. SM And it’s not as if you can equalise it. The patient is the one with the illness, they’re the one who has come to you for advice and counselling. So none of this is to say: move the responsibility of decision-making on to the patient. He or she doesn’t know. He or she is asking you for advice. But I think it’s important, particularly in this day and age, to paint an honest picture for them of what is most likely to happen. HM It’s all about probabilities, isn’t it? To sit down with a head-injury patient and say to the family, “Well, actually, your nearest and dearest is probably better off dead” – that’s terribly difficult. One always is worried: I might be wrong. And as I got older, I think I got better at accepting, well, I might be wrong. But it’s very unlikely. It’s wrong to treat everybody with a head injury for the sake of maybe one good result. It’s very difficult with younger doctors. They want to treat. They want to operate. And it’s so frightening, it’s so difficult, to deprive people of hope. It’s a long, painful conversation – often in the middle of the night. SM In surgery, you are making a decision that will either commit or not commit: open a human being, or don’t. In the case of cancer, where the decisions can be renegotiated at every stage, it’s different. You’re not committing yourself to a decision or decisions that can’t be reversed. HM I think all of this leads on to a very deep ethical problem, in terms of training and learning. Because, as a young surgeon, if you don’t take on the difficult cases, how is one ever going to get any better? You have a duty to the patient in front of you, but also a duty to future patients. SM Similarly, when we’re asking patients to enrol in clinical trials, where the chances of it working are anything from 5% to 50%, we’re actually asking them to be involved in an experiment. The word “experiment” makes it sound much colder than “clinical trial”. Culturally, we’ve got used to the phrase “clinical trial”, but these are medical experiments, and we know medical experiments can go horribly wrong and can yield very little in terms of working value. HM You told a story that I was very struck by, in your cancer book, about bone-marrow treatment for breast cancer. How it was pushed by a big publicity campaign, before proper trials, and if I remember correctly, the trials showed it was a bad idea. SM And in fact we’re still living through the legacy of that. It created such an aura of hope, and optimism, and when that was destroyed, so much was destroyed with it. And one of the problems there was that people thought they knew the answer before the answer was there. And that’s a terrible formula. HM How old were you when you left India for the States? SM I was 18. I went to college at Stanford. HM Do you think that’s given you a certain outsider’s detachment, in some ways? SM I came to the States not only to be technically trained: I came because I was curious about another world. HM I would say that, because I went late into medicine [in his mid-20s], I’ve never entirely identified with the medical profession. I have a certain sense of being an outsider. I think it’s helped me write in the way that I have done. I suspect the same applies to you. SM The idea of being curious about a different world, I think, fundamentally describes my writing practice. HM I became a formal writer at a much later age than you did. But I’ve been writing all my life, and I’ve always kept a diary, which became a sort of therapy for me, actually. I knew that I lived an interesting life, and that I was seeing extraordinary things, and that I didn’t want to feel as if this was sand slipping through my fingers. I don’t know how your writing started, Sid? SM You know, I write to think. That’s my method of trying to figure out the world. Why are we here today? What will happen five, 10, 50 years from now? The only way to do that, me, has been to write. HM As you know, at the end of my second book I make a passionate plea for doctor-assisted suicide. Of course, there are several American states now that have agreed to it. I think the American physicians’ association has agreed to it. What is your own view, as an oncologist? SM There are some legal and cultural barriers which are enormous. In some ways, my fear about the way it’s moved in the US is that there were firebrands such as Jack Kevorkian [an American proponent and practitioner of doctor-assisted euthanasia who was convicted of second-degree murder in 1999, and who died in 2011]. HM He was pretty sick, I think. SM That’s right. So, in restarting the conversation, “What does it mean to die, today, in America, in a way that’s dignified and painless?” – that conversation’s been so contaminated by what happened all those years ago that it’s very difficult, politically, to come back to it. HM It’s rather like in Germany, where you can’t discuss it at all, because of the Nazis’ euthanasia programme in the 1930s. SM So I think the way forward is to try to start from relatively basic principles. Which is that, in the next decade or so, science will invent medicines that will progressively make pain a profoundly handleable symptom. We already have powerful medicines, and we will have more powerful ones. So the idea of a painful death – if we could take the pain part of the equation away, then you are left with fundamental questions such as: what is dignified? HM My father died at 96, 10 years too late. He had Alzheimer’s, and the man he was when he was demented was not the man he was before. It was a relief when he died. But my mother, she died at the age of 82, from suddenly progressive metastatic cancer, and it was a wonderful death. I mean, death’s always sad, but she died in full possession of her faculties. A bit drawn out, but she was at home. I felt we were very lucky. SM Some of the toughest decisions, when my own father died, were about approaching the conversation about withdrawal of care with my mother. I dreaded that conversation. I have that conversation all the time with my patients. And yet the amount of dread that brought on me, when it was my turn to have that conversation as a son and not a doctor, was astonishing. There were things I knew as a doctor that I didn’t know as a son. There were moments in which I was making decisions as a doctor when I should have been making decisions as a son. And moments when I was making decisions as a son when I should have been making decisions as a doctor. As you will know, Henry, doctors make terrible patients. HM Yup. SM It’s because they – we – cannot do unto ourselves what we can do unto others. That’s been a historical failing. HM I think it’s all about the way we have to develop this split personality, and be emotionally detached from patients; it makes being a “medical relative” incredibly hard. I’m a great admirer of Atul Gawande’s books, especially Being Mortal. But I was very puzzled at the end of that book when he described his father’s death. His father had astrocytoma [a type of cancer of the brain]. There’s no effective treatment for it. And yet they go down the route of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy. SM I’m also a big admirer of Atul. We’ve become friends and we’ve had multiple conversations around these topics. I think, again, that one of the failings of oncologists is that they don’t present to patients a landscape of what might happen. HM Rather than saying, “If you’re lucky, it could all be great.” I read a book recently called The Violet Hour by Katie Roiphe, about famous writers’ last few months of life, and one of the subjects was Susan Sontag. [Sontag died in 2004, from complications of myelodysplastic syndrome, which had evolved into a form of leukaemia.] As far as I could tell, she kind of tortured herself to death, offered more and more heavy experimental chemotherapy. It was presented [in Roiphe’s book] as a sort of brave struggle, but I thought it was groteseque, slightly crazy almost. SM I’ll tell you what I do in my own practice. I tell stories, actual stories, about actual cases. This allows people to understand where they might really fit. They don’t have to think of themselves in terms of numbers. HM Oh, numbers are hopeless. It’s a bit different in America from England, because in England, being a socialised healthcare system, basically you’re stuck with the doctor you go to. In America, patients are more like consumers and shop around a lot more. SM I can’t stand that, the patient-as-consumer. It makes stupid a relationship that is extraordinarily complicated and can be extraordinarily hard to negotiate. And it demeans the relationship you have with the patient. HM It sounds condescending, but the fact of the matter is that patients do not know what’s best for them. SM I think the cases that are most successfully treated – and I don’t mean just survival… HM Death can be a good outcome, sometimes, sadly. SM Quite. So those cases where the families or patient has the most closure, those cases are typically ones in which there’s been a longitudinal relationship built with one doctor. And this goes back to the shamanic quality of medicine. We inherit that culturally, we inherit that anthropologically, we inherit that as human beings, and that’s not going to change. HM I’ve always felt the dissection we do as medical students is of more value in terms of an initiation rite, rather than in terms of teaching us anatomy. I was amazed to read recently that, at one medical school in America, they were anxious to make their medical students more empathic, by making sure the students met the living families of the dead bodies they were going to dissect. It struck me as a completely crazy idea, in that it was undoing the very value of dissection. Which is to become detached. The problem is, you mustn’t become too detached. SM I was struck, recently, by an article written by Zeke Emanuel, in which he wrote about his decision to phase out medical care past a certain age. The article inspired a way of thinking. “Look, the way I want to run my medical care is as follows. At 80 years old, I want to discontinue the following procedures on myself. At 85, I want to discontinue yet another few. At 90, I want to discontinue yet another few. And only allow a few remaining ones.” It is a kind of phase-out, of things we will allow and won’t allow. And what’s thoughtful about the phase-out, to me, is that it takes what seems like an all-or-nothing decision and allows you basically to say: “My life is closing down. These are my options. I’m going to turn things off one by one.” HM But this guy’s a doctor, so he’s a very informed customer… Bad word, customer! But you know what I mean. SM The idea is to have some reason about treatment when you’re 80. HM Yes: to think a bit about the future as you get older. Under the NHS, everybody over the age of 60 has their blood pressure taken regularly by their GP, and various other tests. I’d like to see a system where everyone over the age of 65 or 70, the GP gets them in and says, “Look, can we discuss your future healthcare? What do you want or not want?” But when I’m dying myself, how will I feel? I’m sure I’ll be as frightened and anxious as the next person. SM Absolutely. Yes. • Commenting on this piece?

However, recent UK government data on pesticides and mainstream crops shows that they could create a very concerning cocktail effect. The number of different active pesticide ingredients used on these crops has increased between six and 18 times since the 1960s. Toxicologists refer to a cocktail effect because while safety certificates are issued to individual pesticides, their cumulative effect is not tested. The advice is therefore to swap conventional for organic. In the organic farming system, certified by the Soil Association, only 15 pesticides are permitted (derived from natural ingredients and used under heavily regulated circumstances). In conventional agriculture there are around 320. But as Wendell Berry reminds us: “Eating is an agricultural act.” While I don’t expect you to plant your own crops, we have to admit swapping in a few organic veggies won’t cut it long term for the health of the planet, or for us. Other studies show that fruit and veg is becoming less nutritious with a decline in iron, calcium and magnesium. This is attributable to farming the same higher-yield varieties at increased pace, so we’re producing crops that deliver fewer nutrients. That means we need to be more inquisitive about fruit and veg. We need to know about the farming system, the variety and the impact – all the questions that no one has time to ask on a weekday winter’s evening in the supermarket. I’m putting my faith in technology. The Soil Association has linked up with Provenance to create an app that gives you the entire supply chain story at the touch of a button. A wider rollout can’t come soon enough. The big picture: picturing a fairer world Bonnie Chiu is the founder of Lensational, which shares women’s stories through photography, and trains women in some of the lowest-wage economies. She also stars in this year’s Lavazza calendar, championing gender equality. Activists from across the globe have been shot by photographer Platon for the coffee brand’s 26th calendar, focusing on social and environmental change. Well dressed: cashmere crafted in Mongolia Sweater politics are not discussed enough. For starters, there’s a lot of fake cashmere about where the famous ‘diamond fibre’ is blended with other hairs and plastic fibre. Then there’s the fact that cashmere production has been debased over the past 20 years. Herds of cashmere goats which were once raised in sustainable numbers and driven across the Alashan plains of Mongolia are now often farmed in intensive numbers. Designer Mandkhai Jargalsaikhan inherited her parents’ cashmere business and her label, Mandkhai, has roots that date back to post-communist Mongolia. This means the fibre and production are still carefully controlled, from the free-roaming goats to the dying process to the creation of the yarn. If you’re in the market for cashmere this winter, don’t look any further – this is the real deal.

The number is a big improvement on the £1.63m opening result of the first Daddy’s Home nearly two years ago. However, these numbers are misleading. Back in 2015, Daddy’s Home opened over the Christmas Day weekend (25-27 December). It didn’t play on Christmas Day, so its opening number was earned from just two days of business. As for Daddy’s Home 2, Paramount released the film with an aggressive previews strategy, contributing a hefty £2.15m to the opening tally. Strip them out, and Daddy’s Home 2 debuted with a less remarkable £2.77m. The original Daddy’s Home was powered by strong word of mouth to a stunning £17.4m. Paramount will be hoping the sequel can play to audiences all the way to Christmas. Word of mouth will be a crucial factor. The real winner: Paddington 2 Given its £4.55m haul over the weekend, Paddington 2 is the real box-office champion. The lovable bear declined a slim 32% from the previous session – the smallest fall of any film in the Top 10. Its total after 17 days is a splendid £23m, which compares with £14.3m for the original Paddington movie at the same stage of its run. If Paddington 2 remains – as it is now – 60% ahead of the pace set by Paddington, it could end up with an amazing £60.7m. While the film is clearly set for a powerful total, it’s hard to imagine it could reach those giddy heights. The loser: Justice League Dropping 60%, the biggest fall of any film in the Top 10, Justice League managed a poor £2.99m in its second weekend, and has reached £12.9m after 10 days. The number is in line with the 62% decline of Suicide Squad in its second weekend, but that Warner DC title had already reached £22.2m after 10 days (on its way to a total of £33.6m). Justice League is more than £9m behind the pace set by Suicide Squad, and it now looks a tough road for it to reach even £20m in the UK. The challengers: Battle of the Sexes and Suburbicon Two films, both enjoying impressive talent credentials, debuted disappointingly. In the blue corner, slice of tennis history Battle of the Sexes boasts Emma Stone and Steve Carell at the head of its cast, and Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy among its producer/screenwriter lineup. In the red corner, Suburbicon stars Matt Damon and Julianne Moore, with George Clooney and the Coen brothers among the film-maker talent. Fox opened Battle of the Sexes in a fairly aggressive 464 cinemas, coming up short with £457,000 for the weekend, and £553,000 including previews. That outcome is a triumph next to Suburbicon, however, which began with a lacklustre £211,000 from 364 venues, or £231,000 including previews. A couple of months ago, Borg vs McEnroe reached a poor UK lifetime total of £420,000. It’s hard to envisage further tennis-themed stories finding favour with film financiers any time soon. The family favourite: Frozen Returned to cinemas on Saturday and Sunday only, Disney’s Frozen stunned with a £1.12m gross, earning fifth place in the weekend box-office chart and boosting its total after four years to £43m. With Frozen, Disney has a catalogue title that can be pushed back into cinemas every Christmas, joining the likes of White Christmas and It’s a Wonderful Life: the gifts that keep on giving. Frozen’s success is humiliating for new Sony animation The Star, which debuted in 11th place with £205,000 from 421 sites – less than a fifth of the Frozen number. The Polish hit: Letters to Santa 3 The latest hit Polish movie, Listy Do M3 (aka Letters to Santa 3), has opened with a nifty £398,000 from 253 cinemas. The original Letters to Santa was a huge hit in Poland in 2011, as was the sequel Letters to Santa 2 in 2015. Neither made it to UK cinemas. In Poland, Listy Do M3 has already grossed $9.4m (£7.07m), making it the third-biggest hit of the year, behind local production Botoks and Despicable Me 3. Botoks arrived in the UK in October, quickly becoming the first Polish film to crack £1m here. The market Overall, box office is down 8% on the previous weekend, but also 18% up on the equivalent session from 2016, when Allied and Bad Santa 2 were the top new releases. The next two weekends look very quiet for UK cinemas, with distributors evidently giving a wide berth to Disney’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, arriving on 14 December. The only significant wide release on Friday is Wonder, starring Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson and Jacob Tremblay. Top 10 films, 24-26 November 1. Daddy’s Home 2, £4,919,051 from 505 sites (new) 2.

A vast hangar features all of the sets – starting with the Great Hall, currently decked out for Christmas with sparkling trees, tables laden with festive food and, for the first time, an ice-sculpture, icicles and a floating orchestra from the Yule Ball (until 28 January). After being ushered through the Great Hall, you are free to go at your own pace. The Gryffindor common room, Dumbledore’s office, with a cabinet of 800 hand-labelled vials of “memories”, Hagrid’s hut, the Potions classroom, lined with 500 bottles, the Weasley’s Burrow, Diagon Alley, the dark and misty Forbidden Forest (watch out for Aragog lurking in the shadows), and Hogwarts Express are all there. We ate our lunch in the “backlot” outdoor area in front of Privet Drive, Hogwarts Bridge and the triple-decker Knight Bus, before moving on to a section dedicated to art and design showing the many intricate creatures, artwork and architectural models specially created for the films. Fun fact JK Rowling invited Alan Rickman round for tea to explain Professor Snape’s narrative arc to give the actor a unique insight into the character. He was the only person on set who knew the full story. Best thing about it The sense of scale. Some 4,000 people worked on the films – the most successful movie series ever – over a 10-year period. Among them were 50 costumers, 40 artists, draughtsman and illustrators, 20 make-up artists and a feather expert who was brought in to consult on how best to create a Hippogriff. In addition 250 animals were trained to portray the characters’ various pets, among them a team of Neapolitan Mastiffs who played Fang. My son (7) and friend (8) were too young to hang around reading about the meticulous detailing of the sets and props, which for me was the most intriguing part, but they loved sitting in the Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, touching different types of fake snow (another Christmas feature) and the wand practice. Children of a sensitive nature may find some of the masks and creatures scary – and the bloodied body of Charity Burbage hanging above the Malfoy’s table before being fed to Voldemort’s snake was the suff of nightmares. What about lunch? We took our own but there are two options – the Studio Cafe at the entrance and the Backlot Cafe – both offering sandwiches and hot lunches (soup £3.50; burger £7.75; vegetable pasta £5.50; children’s meals from £5.50). A glass of Butterbeer, which Harry thinks is the most delicious thing he’s ever tasted, costs £3.95 – or £6.95 for a souvenir tankard. Exit through the gift shop? I had already refused to fork out £14 for a photo of my son and his friend on a broomstick and successfully steered them past the Railway Shop opposite Hogwarts Express. But getting through the huge gift emporium at the end of our tour was a challenge on a par with some of Potter’s exploits. Amazingly, we managed it, running the gauntlet of souvenir wands (£29), mugs (£14.95), sorting hats (£29), fluffy owls, Quidditch paraphernalia, quills, jewellery, books, games, toys, stationery, keyrings – you name it – without a fight. I agreed to sweets – before checking the price. A packet of Bertie Bott’s every-flavour jelly beans and two chocolate frogs cost £27! Getting there It’s 15 minutes by train from Euston (1hr 9mins from Birmingham), to Watford Junction from where a 15-minute shuttle bus ride transports visitors to the studios (£2.50 return). Parking is free if you travel by car. Value for money A family saver ticket is £118 (two adults, two children or one adult, three children; tickets must be bought in advance) – so comparable with a West End show and some of London’s more expensive attractions. It is unique experience and you could easily spend the best part of a day there. Fans will not be disappointed. Opening hours It’s timed entry but once you’re in, you can spend as long as you like. The record, according to one guide, is 14 hours. First tour 9am; last tour and closing times vary. Closed Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Verdict 9/10. A genuinely fascinating insight into movie-making. Even my partner, who’s no fan of the stories and was muttering about the queues as we waited to go in, enjoyed it. • wbstudiotour.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/28/arsenal-arsene-wenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T22:33:00Z","webTitle":"Arsenal appoint former Barcelona director of football Raúl Sanllehí","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/28/arsenal-arsene-wenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/28/arsenal-arsene-wenger","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal appoint former Barcelona director of football Raúl Sanllehí","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Arsenal have confirmed the appointment of Raúl Sanllehí as head of football relations as the club continue to overhaul their player recruitment department following the appointment of Sven Mislintat as chief scout last week. Mislintat arrived from Borussia Dortmund to replace Steve Rowley, who held the position for 21 years and spent 35 years at the club, before standing down this month. Dick Law, the American who has been the club’s chief transfer negotiator for eight years, is scaling back his work with Arsenal and has already returned to his homeland. The continuing overhaul also led to June’s recruitment of Huss Fahmy, a lawyer who was previously commercial and business affairs director at Team Sky, to focus on contracts. Sanllehí is a former Barcelona director of football and worked at the Spanish club for 14 years. He will begin work at Arsenal in February and, according to an official statement, “lead future player negotiations and work alongside manager Arsène Wenger, chief executive Ivan Gazidis and contract negotiator Huss Fahmy. He will also represent and support the club with international and domestic governing bodies.” On Tuesday morning, Yesterday Wenger said: “You have Dick Law who retires, and has gone back to the States. He is still with us for a while, but we look for somebody as well who has experience in negotiations. We have Huss, who is top drawer, but has just joined us, but is doing an excellent job. I rate him highly. There is still a need.”Wenger said yesterday that his vast managerial experience means he can identify the most able personnel on the continent, including both Mislintat and Sanllehí. “I know them all because I’ve been in the game before them,” he said. “So of course I know everybody in every club in Europe, basically I know them all.” One thing Wenger no longer believes Sanllehí will have to deal with is the transfer of either Mesut Özil or Alexis Sánchez. For the first time he has explicitly ruled out the possibility of either player leaving in January. “Yeah, I rule it out,” he said. “In my head, they stay until the end of the season. That’s the decision I took at the start of the season. Unless something unbelievable happens there’s no reason why that should change.” Having narrowly beaten Burnley 1-0 on Sunday Arsenal host Huddersfield tonighton Wednesday. D and, despite the looming visit of Manchester United on Saturday, Wenger insisted that his focus is entirely on the Terriers. “It’s a massive game for me,” he said. “I watched their [2-1 defeat] against Manchester City, they didn’t deserve to lose that game. These teams come from hell, they have to play 46 games in the Championship to get out of that. So when you play them you have to be ready for a fight. Especially in their first season, promoted teams have that kind of fighting spirit that makes them dangerous to any team they come up against.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/28/liberalism-eaten-itself-british-religious-liberty-christianity-tim-farron","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T11:15:38Z","webTitle":"Liberalism has eaten itself – it isn’t very liberal any more | Tim Farron","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/liberalism-eaten-itself-british-religious-liberty-christianity-tim-farron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/28/liberalism-eaten-itself-british-religious-liberty-christianity-tim-farron","fields":{"headline":"Liberalism has eaten itself – it isn’t very liberal any more","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When a liberal turns out to be an evangelical Christian, people are surprised or confused. If you are one of those who are surprised and confused, then you are a victim. A victim of liberalism’s comprehensive triumph – where the main loser has been … liberalism. British liberalism is founded in the battle for religious liberty. The nonconformist, evangelical Christian groups that were persecuted by a society that favoured adherence only to the established church built a liberal movement that championed much wider liberty, for women, for other religious minorities, nonreligious minorities, for cultural and regional minorities, for the poor and vulnerable. Liberalism has apparently won. Even members of the Conservative and Labour parties call themselves liberals today. Let’s be honest, you can’t work in the media without being a liberal. Even most of the journalists who write for the rightwing press are in truth liberals. Despite my best efforts, the Liberal Democrats have not won. But irrespective of my efforts, liberalism has. Yet its triumph is hollow, just as Christianity’s apparent triumph was hollow when it became the state religion of the Roman empire. Liberalism has eaten itself because it has eaten the very world-view that gave birth to it, that made it possible, that makes it possible. As a Christian, of course I think there are common values to all humankind. We see them in the commandments, and in one sense we don’t need to be told them because we know instinctively what is wrong and what is right – it’s one of the key proofs that God exists. But are there common secular values that we collectively hold here in Britain? No, I don’t think so. We don’t really have shared values. There is no unifying set of British values. It’s a myth. What is at the heart of a liberal society? It is to uphold that we have a right to offend and a duty to tolerate offence. George Orwell said: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.” In discarding Christianity, we kick away the foundations of liberalism and democracy and so we cannot then be surprised when what we call liberalism stops being liberal. My experience is that although liberalism has won, it is now behaving like the established church of the empire in the fourth and fifth centuries. It has gained ascendancy and lost itself in the process. It isn’t very liberal any more. So many who declare themselves to be liberals really aren’t. Five minutes on social media will give you a window into a society that condemns and judges, that leaps to take offence and pounces to cause it – liberals condemning those who don’t conform as nasty and hateful, the right condemning liberals as fragile snowflakes. But Christianity rebukes both sides: don’t judge, show kindness, show gentleness, show patience – especially to those who don’t deserve it. Five minutes in the high street, now in the run-up to Christmas, will show you a society hooked on materialism. Five minutes eavesdropping in the cafes or glancing at people’s Facebook updates will show you a society hooked on individual achievement, on the achievement of your children, a society hooked on self-worth and pride. I am a liberal; in economic terms I am a moderate social democrat; I believe climate change is real and I want to stop it; I am a patriotic Englishman, but I am also a passionate European and internationalist; I am a Bible-believing Christian who seeks to live obediently to God and who actively supports the freedom of everyone to either accept or reject that. That sums up my values. Are we seriously saying that they are shared by the majority of British people? People talk about shared values today – I’ve done it myself. But when they do, what they mean is: “These are my values – and I am going to act as though they are also yours, and will demonstrate contempt for you if you depart from them.” The phrase “the liberal elite” is usually bandied about by people who aren’t liberal but who are the elite. Whereas I am a liberal, but do not feel part of the elite. But the cultural leaders of our day have made the arrogant and fatal assumption that we have these shared liberal values, and have sought to enforce them via John Stuart Mill’s hated tyranny of opinion and the consequences are … well, Trump and Brexit to name two! Because every tyrant feeds and inspires the resistance that threatens to overthrow them, as a result of their own arrogance. The hand-wringing elite in our politics, media, education and business are as guilty of creating the reactionary politics of populism as much as Rupert Murdoch and Paul Dacre. Why? Because they/we assumed everyone thought the same, and dismissed with ridicule and contempt any sign of eccentricity. • This is an edited version of the Theos Annual Lecture 2017, which will be delivered on Tuesday 28 November at the Law Society • Tim Farron, MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, is former leader of the Liberal Democrats"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/29/wednesdays-tv-mobo-awards-2017-peaky-blinders-how-to-build-a-robot","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T05:59:27Z","webTitle":"Wednesday’s TV: Mobo Awards 2017, Peaky Blinders, How to Build a Robot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/29/wednesdays-tv-mobo-awards-2017-peaky-blinders-how-to-build-a-robot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/29/wednesdays-tv-mobo-awards-2017-peaky-blinders-how-to-build-a-robot","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday’s TV: Mobo Awards 2017, Peaky Blinders, How to Build a Robot","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"StarTalk 6pm, National Geographic Neil deGrasse Tyson is one cosmic dude.

How can I erase my personal data?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I am unable to power on my Acer laptop, and the technician says the motherboard is faulty. I am planning to sell it. Will the buyer be able to retrieve my data after changing the motherboard? If so, how do I erase it? Colin If you are literally scrapping an old PC or laptop, you should either remove the hard drive or destroy it to protect your data. People have been known to scavenge hard drives from tips and retrieve sensitive personal, medical and financial information. Selling dead machines for spares or repair is even riskier, and how much would your Acer be worth? I doubt it will fetch enough to make it worth spending the time and (probably) money needed to erase your data. And, of course, if you don’t do it, you could be at significant financial risk, depending on the information stored on it. Whether or not the buyer replaces the motherboard, they will probably be able to read your hard drive, unless you encrypted it with an unhackable password. This is unlikely. Because your laptop won’t boot, you will have to do what an attacker or repairer would do: remove the hard drive from the laptop. However, if you want to delete your data and reinstall the hard drive, you will need either another PC or a hard disk eraser. If you have a desktop tower with a spare drive bay, you can mount the laptop drive inside, by connecting the power and data cables. This is easy. If you have another laptop, you can mount it in an external hard drive enclosure, then connect it to another PC via a USB port. Hard drive erasers If you don’t have a PC, you could buy a standalone hard drive eraser. This is much the easiest way to erase hard drives, and companies that decommission lots of PCs should think about buying one. Unfortunately, it’s not economical to buy one for a single drive. The best known device, the Drive eRazer Ultra, cost about £/$250 when available. One cheaper alternative is StarTech’s USB Hard Drive Duplicator and Eraser Dock (£51.91), which I found by searching Amazon. This has two drive slots, so as well as erasing hard drives and SSDs, it can clone them for backup purposes. You can also use it connected to a PC. In theory, you could also use a degaussing machine, which uses very strong magnetic fields to erase all forms of magnetic media – disks and tapes. The Intimus 20000 is a good example, and you could buy one for £35,783.27 or possibly less. Unless you happen to know someone who already has a hard disk degausser, this is probably not an option. Despite what you see in the movies, you can’t erase a modern hard drive using powerful magnets. K&amp;J Magnetics tried and failed. Not even a 3in neodymium magnet costing almost $350 had any effect on the data. (Note: keep strong magnets away from hard drives because they might damage the read/write head and stop the drive from working. Also, remember that neodymium magnets are dangerous.) You could, of course, simply destroy the hard drive physically, which is what some government departments prefer. You could, for example, wrap the drive in a cloth (to prevent any bits flying out) and drive a couple of six-inch nails through the platters. However, research drive destruction first, and take all the recommended safety precautions. Electronic erasure It’s easy to delete the data on a hard drive in a working PC or in an external USB enclosure. It’s not quite so easy to erase it completely. When you delete files, the operating system doesn’t erase them, it just removes them from its directory. This frees up the sectors for use by other programs, so most of them will be reused eventually. Until that happens, someone with an un-erase program can locate the data sectors on the hard drive and reconstruct the original file. If you really want to delete files, you have to overwrite the data so that it can’t be recovered. This requires multiple over-writes, usually either three or seven. It depends how much security you need. There’s a wide range of free file and disk erasure programs, including Heidi’s Eraser, FreeRaser, Darik’s Boot And Nuke (better known as DBAN) and Disk Wipe. I’ve suggested Heidi’s Eraser before, and it has some video tutorials. Saving the OS Erasing the whole drive is effective but it also deletes the operating system and hidden recovery partitions. This may not be the most useful approach if you are selling a PC, though the buyer can easily reinstall Windows 10, if applicable, or an earlier version of Windows if there’s a legible product key on the COA (Certificate of Authenticity) stuck to the case. In many cases, it’s simpler to erase all the files on the drive’s active partition (C:) and then reinstall the operating system. This will remove all the data that various programs have stashed in their own directories, which you may not even know about. In particular, it will remove any email files that programs such as Windows Live Mail, eM Client and Thunderbird have stored on your hard drive. If you have any emails that are not backed up, you should rescue them before erasing the hard drive. With Windows Live Mail, copy the whole Windows Live Mail folder at C:\\Users\\Your_ID\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows Live Mail. The emails are stored as separate eml files, so you can find the folder by searching for those. In your case, a three-step approach might give reasonable security without wasting too much time and effort. First, with the drive in an external enclosure, run Piriform’s CCleaner to remove temporary internet files, cache files, log files and other rubbish. Check the root directory (formerly C:) for the hiberfil.sys, pagefile.sys and swapfile.sys files, and if you find them, delete them. Second, run a disk defragmentation program – a defragger such as Auslogic’s Disk Defrag Free – to compact the remaining files. Finally, use a disk eraser to securely overwrite the remaining hard drive space. The big security hole in this approach will be any still-working programs that you have allowed to store passwords. You could change them, but will you remember all the ones that need changing? If you have a working PC running Windows 8 to 10, you can reset the PC to factory condition. To do this, run the Settings app (the cogwheel), select Update &amp; Security, click Recover in the left-hand menu, then “Reset this PC”. If you are parting with a drive or a PC, you must select “Remove files and clean the drive” to stop files from being recovered. Obviously, this takes longer. Laptop for repair Another reader, Ben, asked about the security of his personal data when his laptop goes in for repair. The problem is that, unless the whole hard drive is encrypted with Windows BitLocker, TrueCrypt or a similar program, someone with physical possession of the hard drive can almost certainly read it. They don’t even have to boot Windows: they can read the drive from a Linux Live CD or USB memory stick. (Windows sets file permissions, but if Windows isn’t loaded, the permissions don’t mean anything.) Of course, you can encrypt sensitive files separately, but not many people do that, and when a problem strikes, it may be too late … Modern SSDs are a bit more secure because they encrypt everything all the time. However, the encryption may be transparent to Windows, so that doesn’t necessarily protect you if someone can run Windows. It should be possible to make a backup and reset the PC before releasing it for repair, then restore your system after you get it back.

Alarmed at the balance of his squad, Mourinho is targeting four lefties in the summer: Tottenham Hotspur’s Danny Rose, Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale, Atlético Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann and Arsenal’s Mesut Özil. Ian Wright reckons that United, who also like the look of Chelsea’s right-footed Brazilian Willian, will nab Özil before the German’s contract runs out next summer. “Mesut Özil on a free to Manchester United looks a shoo-in,” the former Arsenal striker said. But not if Barcelona get there first! The Primera Liga leaders are also looking to spruce up their squad in January and reckon that Özil would fit the bill. Unfortunately Lionel Messi is now dictating transfer policy at the Camp Nou and, like the Proper Football Men of Premier League punditry, he doesn’t seem to rate Özil. Messi has also told Barcelona not to sign Griezmann because of fears that the Frenchman would restrict Luis Suárez’s playing time – or maybe let the Uruguayan have the rest he’s so obviously been crying out for over the past year – and instead wants them to reignite their interest in Liverpool’s Philippe Coutinho. Harry Kane has told “pals” that he fancies a move to Real Madrid. That’s according to reports in the Spanish media, so there’s every reason to believe that one. Tottenham, meanwhile, plan to replace Rose with Fulham’s Ryan Sessegnon. Or they could make Bale their new left-back. Everton have gone crawling back to Sam Allardyce – who will take the job as long as his demands are met, so they’d better start making space for Juusi Jaaskelainen, Joey O’Brien and Kevin Nolan. Someone tell Phil Brown the band’s getting back together. Chelsea have been offered the chance to sign Borussia Dortmund’s sulky Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, because of course that mild-mannered dressing room requires the addition of a player who was recently dropped for a big game for disciplinary reasons. Dortmund will console themselves by signing Angel Gomes from United. Manchester City want Real Sociedad’s Iñigo Martínez. A new centre-back? Won’t someone think of Eliaquim Mangala? No? Anyone?

See 2.47pm. Any attempts to increase security around the Irish border because of Brexit could lead to civil disobedience, a Sinn Féin MP has said at a rare republican party press conference in Westminster. Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, will go into next month’s crucial European summit on Brexit without the fear of a general election at home after one of his key allies resigned from the cabinet hours before a parliamentary vote that would have led to the collapse of the government in Dublin. Rising household debt and flatlining wages are becoming a major financial stability risk as Britain slows as a consequence of Brexit, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has said. Facebook and Twitter have agreed to hand over some information relating to the reach of Russian-backed posts during the Brexit referendum, according to the House of Commons media watchdog. Sir Nick Harvey, the former Lib Dem MP and former defence minister, has been appointed Lib Dem chief executive. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The Scottish government has urged David Davis to publish a more detailed Brexit impact analysis. The information sent to the Commons Brexit committee was also sent to the devolved administration, and the Scottish government’s Brexit minister, Mike Russell, has responded in an open letter to David Davis. Russell says that the Brexit impact analysis reports released so far do not actually contain any Brexit impact analysis. Here is an extract from his letter. The first minister [Nicola Sturgeon] and I have both been clear that the UK government’s analysis of the impact of Brexit on sectors or the economy as a whole should be made public. It is essential that people across the UK fully understand the consequences of decisions being taken about their future. It is disappointing that the UK government has persisted in keeping this information from being publicly available and have shared with us only on the basis that we do not release it into the public domain. I urge you to reconsider this approach, be up front with people and publish these reports immediately. Aside from the matter of publication, it is clear is that these reports do not contain any actual impact analysis. They seem to be a collation of sectoral information, and as useful as that is it fails to address the key need; to understand what assessment the UK government has made of the likely impact of its approach of leaving the single market and customs union and what mitigating measures if any are being put in place to manage negative impacts. I am therefore requesting that you share the full breadth of the analysis that the UK government has undertaken with the devolved administrations as a matter of urgency. Environment secretary Michael Gove has warned that farmers who are unwilling to change and adapt are set to lose out under any new post Brexit countryside deal. Speaking at the Country Land and Business Association’s conference Gove said the government would reform the existing EU farm subsidy system to enhance the countryside and improve land use. But he said that those famers who refused to change would lose out. He said: If you are the sort of person who has been concentrating on avoiding changing, avoiding adapting, avoiding thinking about increased productivity or indeed environmental enhancement, then you will be caught. But if you are someone who is thinking hard about all those things, there are significant opportunities ahead. Gove’s intervention was welcomed by environment campaigners. Rebecca Newson from Greenpeace said the “broken farm subsidy system” should be a priority for government. She said: For far too long millions in taxpayer-funded subsidies have been an extra entitlement for the wealthy families and businesses owning most of the land, instead of being used to reward farmers whose work promotes the common good. For these subsidies to be justifiable they should go to farmers who produce sustainable food, support thriving rural economies, reduce flood risk and protect our wildlife. Britain has a unique opportunity to rethink the whole concept of farm subsidy from scratch and should not waste it. We look forward to seeing the details of Gove’s plan. At the news conference to mark the publication of the social mobility commission’s state of the nation report this morning (see 11.33am) Alan Milburn, the commission chair and former Labour health secretary, said that there would be rise in extremism unless the social divisions outlined in the report were tackled. He told journalists: These are volatile and uncertain times. Right now Britain seems to be in the grip of a self-reinforcing spiral of ever-growing division. The growing sense that we have become an us and them society is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a nation. Our politics are becoming polarised just as our country is. We see that on this side of the Atlantic and we see it in the US. It is easy to rail against what is happening but the analysis in this report explains why there is such a sense of political alienation and social resentment in so many parts of our country. Whole tracts of our economy feel left behind, because they are. Whole communities feel that the benefits of globalisation have passed them by, because they have. Whole sections of society feel they are not getting a fair chance to succeed, because they are not. And with it a heady brew of hopelessness mixed with anger. Unless mainstream politics can answer the problem of economic, social and geographical division the answer will come, as we are already seeing in parts of Europe, from the extremism of either the hard left or the far right. Miliburn also said that these grievances contributed to the Brexit vote. Stressing that he thought Brexit was a mistake, he said: What this report shows is that the causes of Brexit are real, people are concerned for a reason, they do feel that they are being left behind, they do feel that they are being ignored, they are resentful of the outside, whatever form that takes. That is an issue that has to be grasped. Commons officials have clarified how a contempt motion could come to the floor of the Commons. An MP who wants to make an allegation of contempt has to make an application in writing to the speaker. If the speaker choses to allow it, the decision is announced and the MP gets to table a motion for the Commons to consider the following day. Normally that motion would be to refer the matter to the privileges committee, but it could say something else. Here is some Twitter comment on the Brexit impact papers row. From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From Sky’s Faisal Islam From the Daily Mirror’s Jason Beattie From the FT’s David Allen Green MPs enjoy a good procedural row and they don’t get much more arcane and technical than the one about the Brexit impact reports, involving, as it does, a humble address, contempt of parliament and the rights of select committees. If you were following the UQ in the Commons, and the subsequent points of order, you may have found it all a bit dull. But in parliament arguments about procedure are often, ultimately, skirmishes about power and this one is about how much ministers have to disclose to MPs about Brexit policy. And the key point is that David Davis is under pressure to reveal more - with John Bercow and a large number of MPs threatening him with parliamentary censure if he does not budge. Here are the key points. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has been summoned to explain to the Brexit committee why he has not released all the information it wants as a matter of urgency. Hilary Benn, the committee chair, said David should appear before it “very speedily indeed”. John Bercow, the speaker, implied the meeting should take place as soon as possible. He told MPs: I think that. when it is suggested that that meeting should be soon, it means soon - it does not mean weeks hence, it means very soon indeed. Nothing, no commitment, no other diarised engagement is more important than respecting the House and in this case the committee of the House which has ownership of this matter and to which the papers were to be provided. Bercow hinted that he would allow MPs to debate a motion accusing Davis of contempt of parliament if Davis did not agree to release more information. “Contempt” is a parliamentary term covering action that involves defying the will of the Commons and MPs can pass motions criticising people for contempt, and even imposing a punishment on members who transgress, such as suspension. In practice the prospect of MPs voting to suspend Davis seems fanciful in the extreme, but any sort of debate on this matter would be highly embarrassing - particularly in the light of the government’s claim that Brexit is about restoring the sovereignty of parliament. Bercow did not say categorically that Davis was guilty of contempt. But Benn said that the information given to the select committee was “not in keeping” with the motion passed by the House saying the Brexit impact assessments should be given to the select committee. (See 12.49pm.) And when the SNP’s Pete Wishart asked if Bercow would respond to a letter saying Davis was in contempt, Bercow said Wishart needed to write a new letter in response to recent developments. He then went on: As and when matters evolve, if a further representation alleging contempt is made to me I will consider it very promptly and come back to the House, I hope the House knows me well enough to know that I will do my duty. Robin Walker, the Brexit minister, said the government would consider getting MPs to vote for a new motion clarifying what Brexit impact report information should be published. Several MPs said that problem was caused by the fact the government did not oppose the original motion. (See 12.49pm.) Asked if the government would consider tabling a motion amending the original humble address, Walker said ministers would consider this. But it is not clear whether this would undo the effect of the original vote. Bercow implied that it would not. In response to a point of order, he said: There is a very recent motion passed by this House .... As speaker, I ruled that [the motion] was binding or effective. And that irrespective of other motions, remains the fact. It was also not obvious what any new motion would have to say to be passed by the Commons because some Tories seem to accept the argument that the select committee should have the final say over what gets published. The government does not accept this. Several Tories, including Brexiters, criticised the government for not complying with the terms of the original vote. The strongest language probably came from Philip Hollobone, a hardline leave supporter, who said it was a “mistake” for the government not to amend the original motion and that the government was now “skating on very thin parliamentary ice”. Walker said that all MPs would be allowed to read the Brexit documents that have been passed to the select committee this week. (See 1.01pm.) Benn said he objected to the suggestion that he or his committee could not be trusted to handle confidential information. Benn and Davis are at odds over who should have the final say over what Brexit impact report information gets published. In his letter to Davis, Benn said that, although was willing to discuss with Davis what did or did not get published, the committee should have the final say. In his letter, Davis said the government would not release some information to the committee without an assurance it would not be published. Some Tories defended Davis’s decision not to hand all the Brexit impact assessment information to the selection committee. John Whittingdale, a pro-Brexit member of the committee, and former select committee chair, said: I understand these documents have been sent to two select committees of parliament and to the devolved administrations, and as a former chairman of the select committee I can say that leaks are not without precedent and I would not want the government to make available any information that if it became public it could undermine our negotiating position. Walker claimed that in some respects the government had given the committee more information than originally envisaged. He said: Of course there are various assessments and various documents held by government which have been worked on over time addressing the individual sectors. What we have sought to do, and what we have provided the select committee with, is actually a great deal more information than existed at the time of the secretary of state’s evidence to the select committee. And I think that will be valuable to them in their scrutiny. Ken Clarke, the pro-European, says this issue arose because the government decided not to vote against Labour motions. As a result the Commons is passing motions criticising the government. The Commons is being reduced to a debating chamber, he says. Parliamentary accountability has been reduced. What can be done to get back to the situation where the government is accountable to the Commons? Bercow says what the government has done has not been disorderly. But if Clarke is saying having the government abstain on Labour motions is not “helpful”, Bercow says he would agree. That’s it. The UQ and points of order are now all over. I’ll post a summary of where we are, and what it all means, very soon. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter, asks if the passing of a new motion would negate any charge of contempt against David Davis. Bercow says that is a hypothetical question. Peter Bone, a Conservative, asks if, in the event of the government tabling a new motion on this, it can be debated quickly, after the budget debate. Bercow says that could happen. The UQ is over. Sir Keir Starmer is raising a point of order. He says MPs expected the papers to be handed over unedited. He asks Bercow for his guidance as to whether or not the government has complied with the motion. If it hasn’t, is that a contempt of the House? And what should happen next? The SNP’s Pete Wishart says he has already written to Bercow suggesting there has been a contempt of parliament. He asks Bercow to respond. ‘This is contempt and the government must be held accountable for its failure to comply,” he says. Marcus Fysh, a Conservative, says on page 201 of Erskine May it says ministers do not have to disclose all information when required to. John Bercow dismisses Fysh’s comment, saying he is familiar with the precedent. Addressing Wishart, he says it would be better if Wishart were to write to him again in the light of the new developments. If he gets one, he will consider it, he says. Beyond that, he says it is well known to members, and Starmer, that MPs wishing to allege a contempt not as a point of order, and not in the media, but in writing to the speaker. The speaker then decides if the matter should have precedence, he says. He says he is “more than happy to confirm that my doors are always open for such written notices”, he says. He says MPs “all heard what the chair of the Brexit select committee had to say”. He says the committee asked for “an urgent audience” with David Davis. He says Walker said Davis would meet the committee soon. He says the meeting should be soon, and that does not mean “weeks hence”. It means “very soon indeed”. No other commitment is more important than meeting the House, he says. That is where the matter rests, he says. He says if a further allegation of contempt is made to him he will consider it “very promptly”, he says. He says MPs know that he will “do his duty”. Plaid Cymru’s Hywel Williams asks what guidelines were given to officials in terms of deciding what should be left out. Walker says they left out information that was commercially confidential, or that might have undermined the UK’s negotiating stance. Labour’s Angela Eagle says this episode shows the problem with the government’s policy of not engaging with opposition motions. Philip Hollobone, a Conservative Brexiter, says it was a “mistake” for the government not to amend the original motion. The government is now “skating on very thin parliamentary ice”, he says. He says the government should come back to the Commons next week with a new motion. David Jones, the former Brexit minister, says our EU counterparts show now interest in what happens in the Commons, and do not read parliamentary documents. Walker says sometimes EU counterparts do take an interest in parliament. The Conservative MP Jeremy Lefroy says he hopes there is a “rethink” before David Davis appears before the Brexit committee. Lefroy is a member of the committee. The SNP’s Joanna Cherry says the Scottish government, which has seen the documents, says that they contain “nothing substantial at all about Scotland”. Richard Graham, a Conservative, says no MP will want the government to release information that might undermine the government’s position. He urges the government to put forward a motion amending the original humble address (the original motion saying the papers should be published - see 12.49am.) Walker says the government will consider this. Ministers will considering asking MPs to pass second motion on Brexit impact reports clarifying what can be published, Walker says. Walker says it is wrong to describe the documents handed to the select committee as “edited”. Walker says the government is actually giving the committee more information than originally required by the Commons. In his opening statement Walker said that all MPs would get the chance to see the documents given to the select committee. He said: I can also Mr Speaker, with your permission, inform the House that we have initiated discussions with the Parliamentary authorities to make this information available to all colleagues through a reading room. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Tory Brexiter, says the issue is not whether or not the information should be published. If the government objected, it should have voted down the motion. But the motion was passed, and it is binding. It is now up to the select committee. The government should either meet the terms of the motion “in full” or put down a new motion. Walker says the government thinks it has complied with the motion. The Tory Brexiter Peter Bone says he agrees with Ken Clarke and Hilary Benn. He urges the government to come back with another Commons motion. The Lib Dem MP Tom Brake asks why the government has edited its report, when the Bank of England has published “chilling” information about what might happen after Brexit. Is it true the bulk of the information was not given to the committee? No, says Walker. Hilary Benn, the committee chair, says David Davis should appear before it “very speedily indeed”. He says the committee has received edited documents. That is “not in keeping” with the resolution passed by the Commons. He says he made it clear to Davis how he would handle the papers. He says he objects to the suggestion from Davis that he cannot be trusted to do his job. Walker says, when Benn has has the chance to read the information, he will find it useful. The Commons Brexit committee has now published the letter it got from David Davis, and Hilary Benn’s reply, here on its website. The pro-European Tory Ken Clarke says, if the government did not want to hand over the documents, it should have voted against the Commons motion. And if it wanted to amend the motion, it should have done so. He asks if the government will let Hilary Benn, the chair of the committee, see the paperwork in its unedited form. Walker says the motion that was passed referred to sectoral impact analyses that did not exist in the form assumed. For the record, here is the motion passed by the Commons. That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, That she will be graciously pleased to give directions that the list of sectors analysed under the instruction of Her Majesty’s Ministers, and referred to in the Answer of 26 June 2017 to Question 239, be laid before this House and that the impact assessments arising from those analyses be provided to the Committee on Exiting the European Union. Walker is responding to Starmer. He says Starmer should not be dismissing the information without having read it. The information disclosed was substantial, he says. He says this does not represent “the sum” of the government’s analysis. He says David Davis will accept the Brexit committee’s request to appear before it. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, says the government does not understand the word transparency and accountability. He says the Commons motion was clear; it said the information should be handed over to the select committee. He says the government could have tried to amend the Commons motion that was passed, but did not. He says Walker must explain what assurances the government asked for from the select committee that were not given. The Commons will have a chance to debate at another time whether there has been a contempt of parliament. He says in his experience scrutiny is essential for good decision making. He says he is worried to hear that the information fills just two lever arch files. He says that, in his old job as DPP, that is the amount of paperwork you would expect for a standard crown court case. Brexit requires much more analysis, he says. Robin Walker, a Brexit minister, is responding to the urgent question. He argues that the government has complied with what the House of Commons wanted. He says the sectoral reports did not exist in the form the Commons assumed. And he says that, contrary to reports, the Brexit committee did not give the government an assurance that confidential information would not be released. John Bercow, the Commons speaker, says he granted the urgent question to allow the minister to answer questions about the Brexit impact reports. He says it is not an opportunity for MPs to debate whether or not there has been a contempt of parliament. He says there may or may not be a chance for MPs to debate that in the future. Bercow hints MPs may get chance to debate whether David Davis guilty of contempt of parliament. It will be Robin Walker responding to the UQ. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, has said that David Davis’s decision not to release the Brexit impact reports to the committee in full was “not in keeping with the resolution that was passed by the House of Commons”. The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, another member of the Commons Brexit committee, said the government “stop treating the committee and British public like children and then get on with what parliament mandated”. He told the Guardian: There was a unanimously agreed motion of the House that the government had to make these reports available to the committee in their entirety. The failure to do so looks like a breach of parliamentary privilege and potentially places the government in contempt of parliament. Kinnock said the committee had given ministers many assurances that it would treat the information sensitively and agree jointly what would be published. “The claim in the David Davis letter that we didn’t give assurances is therefore deeply misleading and disappointing.” Kinnock said he agreed with arguments Jacob Rees Mogg made in the Guardian, adding: It is clear this is not a party political issue - there was at least one very pro-Brexit Conservative MP in the committee who made it absolutely clear that the government was potentially guilty of a breach of privilege. The BBC’s Norman Smith says he thinks David Davis will be asked to appear before the Commons Brexit committee on Monday. It sounds as if David Davis will not be responding to the urgent question about the Brexit impact reports himself. (See 10.56am.) He has been in cabinet this morning, and the meeting has gone on much longer than expected. Robin Walker, a junior Brexit minister, is expected to take his place. Speaking after the Brexit select committee’s private meeting wrapped up this morning, a Labour member, Pat McFadden, said there were two issues at stake. There is the question of parliamentary process and privilege and whether or not the government has complied with the resolution passed by the House of Commons. Parliament will now want to consider those. He also pointed to the government’s argument that it could trust the committee members to withhold information that could hamper negotiations. “Everyone knows the importance of national interest in not divulging anything that would be against it,” he added. But this is the biggest decision we have taken since the war, I believe the public has a right to know what the consequences are of the different options facing us. And if the government has that information I don’t think they should withhold it. The House of Commons Brexit committee has just released a press statement following its private meeting this morning at which members discussed how to respond to the government’s decision to give it edited versions of the Brexit impact statements, not the full paperwork. In a statement to journalists the committee said: Following a private meeting of the committee this morning, the committee has agreed the following actions: Arrangements will be put in place for committee members to view the documents in private. The committee agreed to publish the letter from the secretary of state [David Davis] in full. This will be published on the committee’s webpages. The chair of the committee [Hilary Benn] will be writing to the secretary of state in response – the letter will be published on the committee’s webpages. The committee is asking the secretary of state to attend an evidence session as a matter of urgency in order to confirm the process behind the department’s actions. The committee will then move into private session to discuss the matter further. The committee said it received the edited information in paper, not electronic, form, copy, in a folder of approximately 850 pages. The Brexit department gave the same information to the Lords committee and to the devolved administrations. The committee said it would treat the information like other evidence it receives, meaning it will decide whether to publish, when, and in what form. The Brexit department is not saying yet which minister will be replying to Sir Keir Starmer’s UQ on the Brexit impact reports. (See 10.56am.) But the Brexit minister Steve Baker has already started responding on Twitter. The social mobility commission’s state of the nation report is being published this morning. My colleague Anushka Asthana has previewed the main findings here. Alan Milburn, the commission chair, has written about its conclusions for the Guardian here. And here are two of the key charts from the report. This map shows how local authority areas perform on an index for social mobility indicators. Here is a chart listing the best and worst performing local authority areas. And here is an excerpt from the report explaining how the index works. The index measures social mobility prospects in each area through 16 key performance indicators. These allow us to assess which parts of the country have the best social mobility outcomes (the hotspots) and which have the worst (the coldspots). These indicators span each major life stage, from early years through to people’s working lives. The indicators show what happens in the early years, where significant gaps open up between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their more fortunate peers. We then track how this is translated into differences in educational attainment in the school years and then into different outcomes as young people prepare for the labour market. Finally, we look at the very different opportunities people have in their working lives in terms of the availability of top jobs, the prevalence of low pay and the likelihood of getting a foot on the housing ladder. The full 178-page report is here (pdf). John Bercow, the speaker, has granted an urgent Commons question on the Brexit impact papers. It has been tabled by Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. The Labour MP David Lammy has posted a good thread on Twitter about the Brexit impact assessments. It starts here. And he summarises it all here. Britain should brace for higher unemployment as economic growth weakens due to Brexit uncertainty, falling consumer confidence and a collapse in investment, an influential think tank has warned. According to the Press Association, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said as part of its latest economic outlook that UK growth is set to fall further over the next two years to 1.2% and 1.1%, after easing to 1.5% for 2017. The PA story goes on: “Economic activity is set to grow at just above 1% in 2018-19, with the negative impact of uncertainty about the final outcome of Brexit negotiations being partly countered by an assumed agreement on a transition period after March 2019,” said the OECD. “However, this pace of growth will not be sufficient to prevent a moderate rise in the unemployment rate.” It added that “job creation is losing momentum”. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) earlier this month showed that the number of people in work has fallen by 14,000, the biggest reduction in two years. Employment was just over 32m in the quarter to September after the largest three-monthly fall since April-June 2015. Other figures showed that the number of people classed as economically inactive increased by 117,000 to 8.8m, the biggest rise in more than seven years. The OECD’s GDP growth forecasts undershoot those issued by the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility, which currently expects GDP growth of 1.4% in 2018 and 1.3% in 2019, giving a gloomier outlook for the British economy. Here are three blogs on the Brexit impact assessment papers that are worth reading. David Allen Green on his Jack of Kent blog recalls what the government has said in the past about these papers. So by June 2017, we had already been told: – the number of analyses (57 or 58) – the analyses are in a “manageable format” – the supposed overall significance of the analyses (85% of the economy) – the analyses covered economic issues and “trade dynamics” – the analyses were “extensive” and “thorough” – the analyses were at both national and regional level – the analyses dealt with the impact of Brexit on sectors – the analyses were to be complete before notification and before Brexit policy-making – the government was already minded not to publish any of the analyses, using the excuse that disclosure would undermine the government’s position The BBC’s Norman Smith on his Facebook page says David Davis mentioned the existence of the reports when he was being criticised for not doing enough preparation and that the real story might be how “flimsy” they are. However I’m told David Davis first mentioned he had these 58 impact assessment reports when he was under pressure for not doing his homework. Remember that photo of him turning up for Brexit talks with nothing more than smile on his face ? Well it seems in an effort to show how thorough he was really being, he volunteered the information that he had in fact commissioned these reports into 58 separate areas of the economy. Sounded impressive at the time. But now the real political embarrassment may not be what they say (no suprise surely if they show large sections of British industry want to stay in the single market). The real embarrassment may be on how little work has actually been done on the likely impact of Brexit on the UK economy. Robert Peston on his Facebook page says the government is arguing that the documents have not been “redacted”, but that they have been “edited”, which is different. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the Today programme this morning that Labour would raise with the speaker whether or not ministers were in contempt of parliament because they failed to hand over the unredacted Brexit impact reports to the Brexit select committee. He said: The government is under an obligation to pass this information to the Brexit committee. If it is failing in that obligation, as it appears to be, we intend to raise it with the speaker … It follows from that that the government could be in contempt of parliament. They are certainly treating parliament with contempt and we intend to press the speaker on the issue and raise the issue of whether they are now in contempt. Having agreed to this procedure, they are now breaching it at the 11th hour. You can read the full story here. But Craig Mackinlay, a pro-Brexit Conservative member of the Brexit committee, defended the government’s decision to hand over the Brexit reports, showing how Brexit will impact 58 sectors of the economy, in redacted form. He said that if the information was passed to the committee in an unedited form, it could be leaked in a way that would damage the Brexit negotiations. He told the Today programme: This committee is divided and there are many who want to use this information against the national interest. It is really rather perverse now, as some Labour members are saying, that opening up our hand to the world is in the national interest when it patently must be the reverse is true. Until she delivered her Florence speech in September, Tory Brexiters were almost united in their support for Theresa May. After the speech some of them started to express reservations about her Brexit strategy, but generally she still has the firm backing of the hardline Conservative leavers. But by the week they are getting more restive and last night the fractures got a bit more visible when Priti Patel, the former international development secretary, criticised May’s approach to Brexit in her first proper speech since she was forced to resign from cabinet earlier this month. Patel, a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, made three substantial points at an event in London hosted by The Spectator magazine. She said the government had failed to set out a vision for what Britain would be like after Brexit. She said: We should have had conviction and clarity in terms of our end state and destination and presented that and been pretty forthright about it as well ... One of the failings is we have not set out that vision, what is that vision of Britain going to look like post-Brexit? What are the economic opportunities for the City of London and for many other businesses and sectors in terms of leading out in the world and potentially trading with countries we have simply not been engaged with for not just years but for decades. And also reflecting that the world is changing, the labour market is changing. She said the government had been “ill-equipped” for Brexit negotiations. The government has been ill-equipped in terms of preparations for the negotiations. It’s not an ideal state at all. She said May should be willing to tell the EU to “sod off” over its demands for money. My views on money are pretty clear, I don’t like spending money so I would have told the EU in particular to sod off with their excessive financial demands. Patel does not have a huge following amongst Conservative MPs and so her comments on their own will not necessarily worry Number 10 too much. But by speaking out in this way she may encourage other anti-Europeans, who don’t want to be outflanked on the hardline Brexit front, to start denouncing May too. (It is worth noting, for example, that the DUP is also urging May to “hold the line” in terms of paying extra money to Brussels.) As usual, we’re expecting more Brexit in the Commons today, with the focus in particular on how the Brexit select committee will respond to the government’s decision not to give it the full, unredacted Brexit impact reports it was expecting. Here is the agenda for the day. 8am: Theresa May hosts a meeting in Downing Street of the overseas territories joint ministerial council. They are discussing the hurricane relief effort. 9.30am: May chairs cabinet. 9.30am: The Commons Brexit committee meets in private to discuss its response to the government’s decision to hand over only redacted copies of its confidential Brexit impact assessments, not unredacted copies as MPs were expecting. 10am: Simon Henderson, headmaster of Eton College, and other education experts give evidence to the Commons education committee about the integrity of exams. 10.30am: Alan Miliburn, chair of the social mobility commission, publishes its state of the nation report. As Anushka Asthana reports, it says children from deprived backgrounds face the worst prospects in some of the richest parts of the country. 10.30am: Sinn Fein publish legal advice making the case for Northern Ireland to be granted special status in the EU. 11.30am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 12.30pm: Points of order in the Commons. MPs are expected to complain to the speaker that the government is not complying with the Commons vote ordering it to release the Brexit impact reports. 2pm: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives a speech at the Country Land and Business Association annual conference. 2.45pm: Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee about Britain’s diplomatic relationship with Europe. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

But should they put that capital to better use? Accenture’s managing director, Finance &amp; Risk, Peter Beardshaw, argues that they should be more innovative: “Banks have come a long way since the crisis and are showing themselves to be more robust when tested against a comprehensive set of scenarios. It’s not just their capital buffers, banks have also heavily invested in being ready for upcoming ring-fencing, MiFID II and PSD2 regulation. So if banks are showing regulators they have a more robust structure, should they now be encouraged to unlock some of that capital and inject it into the economy? Doing so could mean further lending to SMEs or more digital investment for innovating for their customers, and improving their operational resilience. “Overall, while banks may be better placed to face problems from the past, they must also be ready for risks of the future. Banks will need to show their resilience when it comes to technology and digital disruption on the horizon, especially as the threat of cybercrime increases and banks get ready for data protection laws.” That’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The Guardian’s latest Brexit dashboard is out! And it suggests that the UK’s economy picked up a little this month. My colleague Richard Partington explains: The country has kept on an even keel as exporters were bolstered by growth in global trade, while the improvement in the outlook for the rest of the world is helping to offset weakness at home. Households continue to feel the squeeze from inflation, prompted by the weak pound since the Brexit vote, but the rate at which prices rose in the UK stayed at 3% despite expectations of a further increase. Still, questions remain over the UK’s future trading relationship with Europe, while Philip Hammond’s budget revealed a forecast for a slowdown in economic growth for the years to come. Here’s the full report: These key charts provide more details: PwC’s Andrew Sentance and Dartmouth College professor David Blanchflower have given their verdict: James Hurley of The Times has spotted an interesting new line in the FCA’s report into Royal Bank of Scotland: The news that Britain’s banks could survive a hard Brexit (as long as it didn’t coincide with a wider economic crisis) will have been welcomed by the UK government, as it heads towards a crucial EU summit in December. But any relief should be tempered by the Bank of England’s warning that the City needs a transition deal of at least two years, with no time to lose. Simon Morris, a financial services partner with law firm CMS, says Mark Carney is quite right to warn against a disorderly Brexit. “The Bank of England’s repeated warnings that a shambolic Brexit stands to damage the UK financial system highlights the need for early Government agreement on the new regulatory landscape plus a proper transition period to adapt to it. Firms need every minute of three years, and not just the 70 weeks left in the Article 50 notice period, to plan around the greatest disruption to the established financial system since the outbreak of war in 1939.” Elsewhere in the City, hedge funds who bet against online grocery firm Ocado are nursing burned fingers today. Shares in Ocado have surged by over 20% today, after it announced it had secured a deal French retailer Groupe Casino. Under the agreement, Casino will build a new “state-of-the-art automated warehouse” based on Ocado’s technology. Ocado has long been promising that it was working on a major overseas deal with a European retailer. But it has become one of the most ‘shorted’ stocks in the City, with speculators betting that it wouldn’t deliver the goods.... Lloyds Banking Group are now the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 2.7% at 63.8p, despite passing today’s stress tests. Barclays are also lagging, down 1.7%, having struggled in the stress tests. Other banks are having a better day, with HSBC up almost 1%. David Madden of CMC Markets says bank shares are a mixed bunch today: Despite been given a clean bill of health, Lloyds, RBS and Barclays are in the red, while HSBC and Standard Chartered are in positive territory. Barclays and RBS were cited as the weakest of the bunch. BoE chief Mark Carney stated the UK banking system can withstand the UK leaving the EU, but a ‘disorderly’ and ‘sharp’ Brexit could be costly. HSBC and Standard Chartered have far more exposure to emerging markets than they do to Europe, which is helping the share price this morning. City analysts are now giving their verdict on today’s UK bank stress tests. Rob James, co-manager of the Old Mutual Contingent Capital Fund, is impressed that Britain’s financial sector can stomach losses of £50bn if the economy takes a sharp dive. He writes: What is deeply reassuring about this year’s test... is that every bank passed. So in answer to that perennial question, “Are we nearly there yet?” this time the response is a resounding, “yes”. The implication is that our banking system can now absorb catastrophic losses, including the continuation of litigation and conduct fines, and still be in a position to supply credit to the economy during the stress. Joe Dickerson, equity analyst at Jefferies, says shareholders shouldn’t expect any big windfalls from the banks, though. Our conclusion is that investors expecting near-term capital distribution from Standard Chartered and Barclays may be disappointed and for Lloyds...investors shouldn’t be heroic about large special distributions in 2018-19. William Anderson Jones, Head of UK Corporate Dealing at RationalFX, says the stress tests should reassure investors. “UK banks have proven that they would be able to withstand a disorderly Brexit, as results of recent stress tests have shown today. BoE Governor Mark Carney confirmed that all of Britain’s biggest banks were able to pass their most rigorous examination yet, testing their ability to withstand a financial crisis. The resilience of the banking system will prove a reassurance to investors, as the outcome of Brexit remains unclear. The pound has shown little reaction, remaining mostly steady after reaching an eight-week high against the dollar yesterday. Good news! The global economy is picking up momentum, thanks to a “broad-based and synchronised improvement in growth rates”. That’s according to the OECD’s latest economic outlook. It predicts the global economy will grow by 3.6% this year, 3.7% in 2018 and 3.6% in 2019 But there’s bad news too -- Britain will lag behind other major economies over the next few years. The OECD says: In the United Kingdom, the growth slowdown is expected to continue through 2018, due to continuing uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations around the decision to leave the European Union and the impact of higher inflation on household purchasing power. So the OECD expects UK GDP to rise by 1.5% this year (down from 1.6% previously). Growth will then slow to 1.2% in 2018 (up from 1% before), and then 1.1% in 2019. In contrast, the eurozone is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2017, 2.1% in 2018, and 1.9% in 2019. Today is a very busy day for UK banking journalists, as they chew through the Bank of England’s stress tests and financial stability report. These are detailed documents that deserve proper analysis. And yet... the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain’s City watchdog, has decided to publish the final summary of its report into how small business owners were mistreated by Royal Bank of Scotland. This report was commissioned in 2014, and finished in October 2016. The FCA has been under pressure to publish it, following allegations that RBS had put struggling businesses into its Global Restructuring Group and then deliberately mistreated them. I can’t imagine why they thought this would be a good day to release it, though.... Anyway, the final summary is online here. The inquiry has found that Royal Bank of Scotland was guilty of “widespread inappropriate treatment of SME customers”. It says the bank failed to support small businesses to recover, and was too focused on raising fees to cut its own debts. RBS also failed to handle complaints properly. Some of those failings were “systemic”, as RBS failed to manage the” conflicts of interest inherent in GRG’s twin objectives” (ie, helping distressed businesses, and recovering the money they owed RBS). But, the inquiry didn’t accept that RBS had deliberately tried to drive firms into its GRG division so they could be pillaged. So, is this the end of the matter? Possibly not, judging by this enigmatic line in the report: The FCA has been conducting a general investigation into matters contained in the report which we announced in November 2016. We have now decided to carry out a more focussed investigation. Here’s the Associated Press’s take: Britain’s biggest banks can withstand a series of economic shocks including a no-deal Brexit that would have more severe impacts than what they experienced during the global financial crisis, the Bank of England said on Tuesday. While concluding that lenders can deal with Britain crashing out of the European Union without a deal and restrictions imposed on British business, the Bank of England warned that additional problems may emerge if a “disorderly” Brexit takes place at the same time as a sharp global recession. In its annual stress test of the sector, the central bank said the country’s biggest lenders, such as Barclays and Lloyds Bank, were “resilient” to a raft of adverse scenarios, including deep simultaneous recessions at home and abroad and hefty falls in the price of assets. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: “Despite the severity of the tests, for the first time since the bank began stress testing in 2014, no bank needs to strengthen its capital position as a result.” More here. Santander UK say they’re pleased with the stress test results: Once again, Santander UK had the lowest stressed CET1 ratio impact of all participating firms, demonstrating our resilient balance sheet and low risk profile. [CET1 = Common Equity Tier 1, a measure of a bank’s financial strength] Twitter have collated the best tweets about today’s stress test results: Our City editor Jill Treanor reports that today’s stress tests showed that the UK banking sector could survive a bad Brexit outcome: High street banks can withstand a disorderly Brexit, the Bank of England has said, even though Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays struggled in its latest health check on the sector. For the first time since 2014, when Threadneedle Street conducted its first annual stress tests, the major lenders have not been required by the UK central bank to raise billions of pounds more of capital to strengthen their finances. But RBS, 70%-owned by the taxpayer, and Barclays only passed the hurdle rate set by the Bank because the regulator took account of efforts they had already made to increase their financial strength since the end of last year, when the tests were applied. The Bank of England is alert to the risks poised by Brexit, and in its half-yearly review of risks to the financial system warns that a disorderly Brexit coupled with a severe global recession and more multibillion pound fines from global regulators could force it to reconsider its assessment. Guardian: High street banks ‘can cope with disorderly Brexit’ The Times’s Katherine Griffiths points out that this year’s tests were pretty tough: Britain’s big banks can withstand a hard Brexit and still keep lending but Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland struggled to pass the Bank of England’s latest stress tests. The seven biggest lenders passed a stress test that was as tough as if the UK crashed out of the European Union, the Bank said, with sterling slumping, interest rates rising to 4 per cent and a record housing crash. All seven lenders passed but Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland struggled. Barclays emerged with the smallest headroom. The Times: Big banks can cope with hard Brexit Over in the FT, Caroline Binham and Martin Arnold flag up that the BoE is making banks strengthen their financial positions: The Bank of England is forcing UK banks to hold an extra £6bn in capital to guard against risks beyond that of Brexit, as it called on the UK and the European Union to introduce legislation to avoid a post-Brexit crisis in derivatives and insurance markets. The BoE said on Tuesday that it is raising a special buffer half a percentage point, to 1 per cent, to lock in capital that banks are currently holding voluntarily. The aim is for lenders to better withstand against “material” macroeconomic risks beyond Brexit, such as global debt levels, asset valuations and misconduct costs. The buffer could raise again next year, the central bank warned. A disorderly Brexit is unlikely, the BoE forecasts. Financial Times: BoE demands extra £6bn buffer from banks; calls for new post-Brexit derivatives rules Iain Withers of the Daily Telegraph points out that shareholders would suffer if the banks incurred hefty losses. The report showed that in the stress test scenario all but Nationwide would stop paying out a dividend within three years, and the building society would pay out just £100m. While this year’s stress test did not explicitly model a ‘hard Brexit’ scenario, the Bank said it was sufficiently severe to give it confidence the UK’s financial system would keep lending to the real economy even in a disorderly exit from the EU. However the report warned politicians on both sides of the Channel to take several important actions to reduce the risks from Brexit, including agreeing a swift transition period and passing legislation to resolve potential contractual conflicts on trillions of pounds of derivative contracts. Telegraph: UK banks can weather chaotic Brexit but RBS and Barclays in worst shape, says Bank of England The press conference wraps up with another warning from Mark Carney that a no-deal Brexit would be undesirable for everyone involved. Q: Is the Bank of England concerned about the row at the London Stock Exchange over its leadership? Mark Carney replies that the LSE plays an important role in UK financial stability. Its CEO Xavier Rolet has made an “extraordinary contribution....but everything comes to an end”. Carney says he’s “a bit mystified” by the row over Rolet’s succession. [Explainer: Rolet’s departure was announced last month. It has since emerged that he had been asked to step down by the board, after falling out with chairman Donald Brydon. Activist investor the Children’s Investment Fund is now demanding that Brydon leaves, and Rolet stays on #developing #popcorn] Q: Are UK banks being too complacent about the impact of Fintech, by assuming they can cut costs while maintaining market share? That’s the challenge, Carney replies. UK banks are assuming that they can use new technology to bring down the cost of acquiring new customers. From next year, it will be easier for customers to shift accounts. And that could mean that some banks become less “front-facing”, as new challengers reshape the industry. The City has taken the stress test results in its stride. Shares in HSBC and RBS are up a little, while Barclays and Lloyds have dipped. Mary Carney is reiterating that UK banks could handle a hard Brexit -- but there could be trouble if they also faced a wider downturn. Q: Are you concerned about the state of the UK mortgage market today? Mark Carney says the FPC have put several restrictions in place in recent years, to prevent lenders from making unduly risky loans. Those measures seem to be working. Today’s stress tests also found that buy-to-let mortgages would suffer the bulk of the losses if there was a financial crisis. Loans to owner-occupiers would be much more modest. In other words, families would keep paying off their mortgages even if the economy went into recession, but some buy-to-let lenders might struggle to meet their obligations. Q: Who will bear the biggest burden from a disorderly Brexit, UK households or the banks? We hope that the banks bear the burden, Carney grins. That’s why they have capital reserves, to cope with tough times. The governor says: What we want...is that people who could get mortgages prior to that event can still get mortgages. If you’ve got a good business ides you can still get funding post-Brexit. But at disorderly Brexit would still have an ‘economic impact’ on households and businesses. “There will be some pain associated with that”, Carney concludes; the Bank’s job is to dampen that pain. Q: Do regulators on the continent understand the dangers of a disorderly Brexit to the EU? Carney says there is an “increased appreciation” of these issues on the continent, and the Bank is in regular contact with EU officials about these issues. He singles out the risks of cross-border insurance and derivatives contracts -- these issues can be fixed, but they take time, he says sternly. The BBC’s Simon Jack nails it: Q: Will next year’s stress tests include a specific test for a disorderly Brexit? No, says Mark Carney. In 12 months time it will be too late. Q: What is the impact of a disorderly Brexit on the banking sector, compared to an orderly one? Mark Carney explains that today’s stress tests modelled a huge recession -- with growth slumping, unemployment tumbling, and the pound shedding a quarter of its value. Under that scenario, UK banks lose £50bn of capital - but aren’t sunk by those losses. So... a disorderly Brexit wouldn’t be any worse than that. Carney says the Bank is putting its money where its mouth is, as it would be called on to support the UK banking scenario if Brexit goes badly. He warns: This [a disorderly Brexit] is not a good scenario... it is one we are all working to avoid as it has some quite material economic costs, even if the financial system continues to operate through it. Q: Are overseas investors already losing faith in the UK? The UK has tremendous strengths, Mark Carney replies. But you need a strong “bedrock” to encourage investors to keep putting money into Britain. Q: Why do you think a disorderly Brexit would be unlikely? Mark Carney says there were several reasons. That includes the fact that all parties are working towards an agreement, and have said it would be in the best interests of both sides. Governor Carney also warns that individual banks can’t resolve the huge number of derivative contracts between the UK and other EU countries (totalling some £20 trillion) We need secondary legislation to guarantee contract continuity - both in the UK and the EU - he adds. Onto questions...and straight into Brexit. Q: How long does a Brexit transition period need to be, and how soon to we need it? Carney says the minimum transition period is 18 to 24 months (ideally the latter), and it needs to be agreed “the sooner the better”. The Bank of England also tested how UK banks would cope with the disruptive impact of Fintech. The banks themselves say they are well-positioned to cope. But the BoE reckons that new technology could have “profound consequences” on incumbent banks. They include: A rise in the cost of recruiting customers, which could hit market share A rise in the cost of raising equity - which is bad for profitability. On Brexit, Mark Carney says the Bank of England focused on the scenarios that would have the biggest impact on UK stability, even if they are unlikely. And....the Financial Policy Committee judged that UK banks could continue to support the UK economy, even in the event of a disorderly exit from the EU. But.... Carney adds that banks would struggle to cope with a hard Brexit AND a global recession at the same time. If a series of “highly unfortunate events happened simultaneously”, capital reserves would be run down and banks would restrict lending to the real economy, the governor adds. BoE governor Mark Carney says that Britain’s banks are “well-placed to provide credit to households and businesses” even if they suffered recessions in the UK and abroad, large asset price falls, and hefty fines for misconduct. [reminder: here’s what the tests covered] Carney confirms that that banks would lose £50bn in the first two years of the scenario - enough to wipe them out 10 years ago. This time round, he says, they are strong enough to cope. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is facing Britain’s (bleary eyed) banking reporters*, to discuss the stress test results. You can watch it live here: * - they’ve been locked in the Bank since 5am Lloyds has issued a statement, confirming that it has passed today’s stress test. Barclays has also put out a statement, which points out that its results were dragged down by the possibility of fines from banking regulators for misconduct. An element of the 5.0% drawdown in the BoE’s 2017 stress test reflects litigation and conduct issues which Barclays is aiming to resolve. Barclays continues to target an end state CET1 ratio of around 13%, although it may temporarily run above that level until these legacy issues are resolved. Standard Chartered says that it ‘notes’ it has passed today’s stress tests, adding; The Group has a strong and liquid balance sheet and these results demonstrate the benefits of the actions recently undertaken by the Group to improve its resilience to an extreme stress scenario. Reaction to today’s press conference is flooding in. Royal Bank of Scotland’s CEO, Ewen Stevenson, says his company is making progress, but admits it has more work to do. “We continue to make progress towards the stress resilient bank we aspire to be. 2017 represented another year of material improvement with our peak-to-trough stress resilience improving by 300bps from last year’s stress test. Until we have resolved our remaining major legacy conduct issues and non-core portfolio interests, we will continue to show stress test results weaker than our long term targets.” This chart shows how Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays failed to meet the pass mark in today’s stress tests, based on their end‑2016 capital positions. But... they still passed today’s tests, because they have bolstered their capital positions during 2017. The 2017 UK bank stress tests are online, here. The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee, set up to assess risks to the financial system, had judged that: The UK banking system could continue to support the real economy through a disorderly Brexit. However the combination of a disorderly Brexit and a severe global recession and stressed misconduct costs could result in more severe conditions than in the stress test,” the Bank said. Threadneedle Street confirmed that banks would be required to hold an extra £11.4bn in capital by next November, but will now review whether they will need to build an additional cushion in the future in light of the potential risks in the system. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said: The FPC is taking action to ensure the financial system is resilient to a very broad range of risks so that the people of the United Kingdom can move forward with confidence that they can access the financial services they will need to seize the opportunities ahead”. Here’s the official confirmation that Britain’s banks have enough capital to withstand a new financial crisis. Importantly, the Bank of England has also found that Britain’s banks could cope with a “disorderly” Brexit without having to curb lending or be bailed out by taxpayers. Here we go! Britain’s seven largest lenders have passed the tough stress test posed by the Bank of England. This is the first clean slate since the tests were created in 2014, and suggests the sector is in relatively decent shape to survive the next recession. BUT! Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland only passed because they have raised fresh capital during the course of 2017. More to follow! Today’s stress tests model the “doomsday” scenario for Britain’s banks, says Business Insider’s Will Martin. And here it is: In the UK economy, the BoE modelled the effects of a sharp recession of more than -4% GDP. This is accompanied by the pound collapsing to just $0.85, a fall of about a third from current values. Global growth is also hit, with banks tested on how they would cope with a worldwide contraction of 2.4%. This scenario also includes a collapse in Chinese commercial real estate of more than 40%. As a result, unemployment in the UK climbs higher than during the financial crisis. Commercial lending collapses, leading to disaster in the property market. House prices fall by 33% and commercial real estate loses 40% of its value. The Daily Telegraph’s Iain Withers compares today’s stress tests to classic computer game Sim City..... He writes: Fans of the blockbuster Nineties PC title SimCity 2000 will remember it as a fiendishly addictive city management game. Players built roads, homes, offices, shops, factories and utilities in what proved a surprisingly popular simulation of life as a city mayor. Sometimes the game would suddenly trash your city with an alien invasion, to test your mettle. A massive black metal spider-like creature would pop up on the screen and start razing parts of your lovingly crafted metropolis with laser beams. There was little you could do other than hunker down, wait for the alien to leave, put out the fires and rebuild. I fear today’s test may not be quite as much fun, though Good morning. We’re about to discover if Britain’s banking sector is strong enough to survive a new financial crisis. Bank of England has put the UK’s seven biggest lenders through a series of rigorous tests to see how they’d cope if the economy hit the rocks. The BoE’s stress tests model a serious financial downturn, at home and abroad. They examine if banks have enough capital to handle a sharp fall in UK and global growth, a surge in consumer bad debts, a plunge in the pound, and a jump in unemployment caused by higher interest rates. It will also test their long-term financial resilience. The seven lenders are Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Santander’s UK operations, and the Nationwide building society. The results are released at 7am GMT, and will show which banks are best, and least, prepared for the next recession. Banks whose exam paper comes back covered in red ink will face tough questions about their resilience. Any lender who actually fails the test forced to sell off assets or ask existing shareholders and bondholders for more cash. Last year Royal Bank of Scotland fell short, so it’ll be under particular scrutiny this year. A poor performance could undermine the UK government’s attempt to sell its majority stake in RBS. We already know that the lenders will suffer £30bn of losses on consumer loans under the tests. Today’s results will show where those losses are concentrated. Adding to the fun, the Bank of England is also releasing its latest Financial Stability Report this morning. That will show the BoE’s view of the UK financial system, and the key threats to financial stability. Our City editor Jill Treanor is locked in the Bank of England, reading the stress test now ahead of 7am. Here’s her preview: Here’s the agenda 7am GMT: UK bank stress tests released 7.30am GMT: Bank of England governor Mark Carney holds a press conference. He’ll discuss the stress test results and the BoE’s financial stability report 10am GMT: OECD releases its latest economic outlook 1.30pm GMT: US trade balance for October 2.45pm GMT: Federal Reserve chair nominee Jay Powell’s confirmation hearing at the US Senate"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/28/afp-did-not-destroy-copies-of-journalists-phone-records-it-unlawfully-accessed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T08:53:42Z","webTitle":"AFP did not destroy copies of journalist's phone records it unlawfully accessed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/28/afp-did-not-destroy-copies-of-journalists-phone-records-it-unlawfully-accessed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/28/afp-did-not-destroy-copies-of-journalists-phone-records-it-unlawfully-accessed","fields":{"headline":"AFP did not destroy copies of journalist's phone records it unlawfully accessed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian federal police did not destroy all copies of phone records it obtained unlawfully, without a warrant, for the purpose of identifying a journalist’s source, according to a new audit by the commonwealth ombudsman. In April 2017, the AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin, confirmed such a breach had occurred within the professional standards unit and apologised, saying the accessed metadata had been destroyed. But the ombudsman contradicted that account, saying its inspection of the AFP’s records “identified that not all copies of records containing the unlawfully accessed data had been destroyed by the AFP”. “In relation to the destruction of all copies of records containing the unlawfully accessed data, the AFP advised our office that it had destroyed all of the material that was provided to it as a result of the breach,” the new report said. “However, to confirm that this had been done, we arranged to revisit the AFP with technical assistance, appreciating the complexities of the AFP’s systems. This visit prompted PRS [professional standards] to conduct further checks of its systems with technical assistance, which identified additional records. “We confirmed that these records were subsequently destroyed”. The ombudsman has recommended the AFP immediately review its approach to metadata awareness and training to ensure all staff involved in exercising metadata powers had a thorough understanding of the legislative framework and their responsibilities. The audit concluded that at the time of the breach, “there was insufficient awareness surrounding journalist information warrant requirements” within the professional standards unit. It said within that unit, “a number of officers did not appear to fully appreciate their responsibilities when exercising metadata powers”. “In any large, decentralised agency, there will inevitably be a risk that awareness-raising does not reach every officer who is required to be in the know,” the audit said. “In recognising this risk, all law enforcement agencies that can access metadata have implemented complementary measures to mitigate legislative non-compliance.” “Unfortunately, the complementary measures adopted by the AFP were not strong enough to prevent this breach from occurring.” But the ombudsman said it was of the view that “the AFP as a whole” respected that journalists had a higher threshold for accessing metadata courtesy of journalist information warrant provisions, which ensured that access to metadata to identify a journalist’s source was permitted only if the public interest in doing so outweighed the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of a journalist’s source. The audit said the AFP took “seriously” its legislative obligations, particularly in relation to its use of covert and intrusive powers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/29/students-working-yet-struggling-to-afford-textbooks-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T23:23:41Z","webTitle":"Students working yet struggling to afford textbooks, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/29/students-working-yet-struggling-to-afford-textbooks-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/29/students-working-yet-struggling-to-afford-textbooks-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"Students working yet struggling to afford textbooks, report finds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"University students are being failed by a “grossly inadequate” social safety net, and are working so much that it is compromising their study, a new report has found. Anglicare, a not-for-profit organisation, released the results of a survey of 1,985 Australian students on Wednesday, and they revealed a grim financial situation for many, particularly those without the support of wealthy families. Eighty-five per cent of students did not believe Centrelink benefits were enough to cover the costs of living and studying, while 89% reported struggling to buy textbooks and other items essential for their study. The vast majority of students were in paid work, and one in five worked more than 20 hours a week. Significantly, 40% of those in paid work reported they had been paid incorrectly, prompting concerns of young worker exploitation. About 82% said the amount of time they spent at work hurt their study. About half said they were struggling to meet their rent payments. Many relied on family assistance to survive. Students from the most disadvantaged families were, unsurprisingly, the most likely to report “severe financial stress” and work so much that their studies were compromised. Kasey Chambers, executive director at Anglicare Australia, said the federal government must use next year’s budget to boost support for students. “More than ever, young people are expected to attend university if they can. But there are massive obstacles for students whose parents can’t afford to support them,” Chambers said. “Students who rely on Youth Allowance or Austudy are struggling to pay rent and make ends meet. And many of those who aren’t eligible have to work so many hours that it is harming their studies.” The report found students’ interactions with Centrelink were “frustrating, often hostile and an additional burden of time and source of stress for many students”. “Raising Youth Allowance, Austudy and Abstudy so that they are adequate to cover the cost of living and study, including housing, is one obvious and urgent need. Other policy changes, such as ensuring proper rental rights including for those living in university accommodation, should also be explored,” the report said. Chambers said a “huge” number of students reported being hit with inaccurate debts, even where they were reporting correctly. The National Union of Students warned the safety net was failing students. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said the report showed how difficult university had become for students from low- or middle-income families. “We want to be ensure that all young Australians who want to go to uni get that opportunity,” she said. “Offering them a meagre Youth Allowance payment that reduces their prospects of finishing their degree because of financial hardship is so short-minded of our government.” “I urge the government to take heed of the report and increase the Youth Allowance, Austudy and Abstudy payments.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/28/british-tourists-film-moment-crocodile-lunged-out-of-australian-creek-at-them","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T06:21:42Z","webTitle":"British tourists film moment crocodile lunged out of Australian creek at them","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/28/british-tourists-film-moment-crocodile-lunged-out-of-australian-creek-at-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/28/british-tourists-film-moment-crocodile-lunged-out-of-australian-creek-at-them","fields":{"headline":"British tourists film moment crocodile lunged out of Australian creek at them","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A crocodile attack that left a British tourist with a leg wound has been captured on camera in Australia.

According to the promo, season two of Struggle Street tells us “what happens when your luck runs out”. As a blackfulla living in Inala, I guess we must be some of the most unluckiest people on earth. While I don’t question the intentions of those involved in the production of Struggle Street, or the genuine struggles and strengths of the individuals featured this season, I remain unconvinced of the transformative promise of the show upon its viewers. It is entertainment. And as a blackfulla, I am tired of entertaining white people by showcasing our despair. I’m not worried about the risk of our neighbourhood being “stigmatised” because it already is. The concern I hold is more complex than good or bad stereotypes of materially poor neighbourhoods. What I struggle with is the national appetite for Indigenous despair which I argue serves a more sinister purpose than “for your viewing pleasure”. And yes of course the show features non-Indigenous people too, but I have to wonder whether this is the only way blackfullas can get ourselves on television. I worry too that it becomes the only story we are permitted to tell of ourselves. As a board member of an Indigenous community controlled organisation, I am conscious of the necessity of despair in securing funding to provide critical services to our community. Each grant application requires us to demonstrate the needs of our community, not our strengths. I can’t help but be troubled by the utility of despair, politically and psychologically for us as blackfullas. If our recent history tells us anything, it is that chronicling our despair – no matter how thoroughly – just isn’t emancipatory. We have had our fair share of national inquiries, royal commissions, and ABC Lateline specials to teach us that. Each time we open up our wounds for public consumption, even when those wounds are not self-inflicted, they are seen as evidence of our incapabilities. These wounds become yet another testament to the incommensurability of our culture with the “modern” world, offering the necessary moral imperative for sustaining white control over our lands, lives, children, alcohol consumption and unemployment benefits, to name just a few. Indigenous despair is not a matter of good fortune or bad; it is an enabling apparatus to the colonial project, cleverly disguised behind an agenda of benevolence and good intentions. You don’t have to scratch the surface too deep to see that under the promise of Close the Gap and the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, Indigenous peoples have little to no control over our own affairs; in fact, we are hard-pressed even getting funding through Indigenous affairs. In the aftermath of the abolition of Atsic (an Indigenous elected representative body) at the turn of this century and the birth of a “new paternalism”, it appears white control over black affairs is intensifying. The recent treatment of the Referendum Council was particularly telling. Despite devising a modest proposal from an extensive national consultation process, the Council’s proposal of a Voice to parliament in the Uluru Statement was dismissed as “radical” by the prime minister. In his media release, Turnbull states with no sense of irony: We have listened to the arguments put forward by proponents of the Voice, and both understand and recognise the desire for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to have a greater say in their own affairs … People who ask for a voice feel voiceless or feel like they’re not being heard. We remain committed to finding effective ways to develop stronger local voices and empowerment of local people. The federal government listened, acknowledged and then ignored the wishes of Indigenous people to have a say in our own affairs – which remains a fundamental right articulated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of which Australia adopted in 2009. Yet despite the outcry from Indigenous Australia at the dismissal of the Uluru Statement, most Australians have simply moved on. Which is much like Struggle Street. People will gasp for a moment at the injustice, but they too will move on. And the everyday brutality of colonisation will continue to impinge upon the lives of blackfullas in this country. You see, for blackfullas the struggle is both everyday and everywhere; one need not bring a camera crew to our suburb of Inala to see it. Just keep the cameras rolling in Indigenous affairs. Sadly, our despair only makes for good television, and exposing it was never meant to result in transformative emancipatory policy solutions. It serves to maintain the status quo. Blackfullas in my neighbourhood have long talked about the brutality of being black in Inala and the need to mitigate its effects so that tragedy and despair don’t become our only way of knowing ourselves. Several years ago, in their song “Inala’s still the same”, rap group Indigenous Intrudaz sang: Brutality is a cold reality gradually tragedy changes your mentality, profanity becomes a part of your personality, the strategy is not to lose your only bit of sanity … Like Intrudaz, I agree, “Inala’s still the same”. It is the same as every Indigenous community across the country in its experience of the brutality of colonisation. It has nothing to do with luck. Inala’s still the same, and so too is the struggle, because the colonisers have never stopped colonising.

While the prime minister attempted on Tuesday to dig in against the banks rebellion, and the Greens upped the ante, seeking stronger terms of reference – Williams predicted the inquiry would clear the Senate and, most likely, the House, given two lower-house National MPs were signalling they would vote for it. The last time a commission of inquiry was established by the parliament, in 1986, the Hawke government funded it – but with the prime minister at this point expressing opposition to the inquiry, it is unclear whether the government would fund something imposed on it by dissident MPs. Williams said on Tuesday that refusing to fund the inquiry would be “a very strange thing to do, given the will of the parliament”. He noted the government funded “many things around here. Some things we do fund I probably don’t agree with.” The Greens have made it clear they want any inquiry to examine systemic issues, such as executive remuneration, political donations from banks and the role of lobbyists – and that demand has been put to the National senator Barry O’Sullivan, who is leading the push in the upper house. Labor has not ruled out moving amendments if the bill comes on for debate but the opposition has signalled it will definitely support any of the proposals for the commission of inquiry currently before the parliament. Given the internal dissent, Turnbull, who was out on the hustings with John Alexander before the Bennelong byelection on 16 December, was peppered with questions about whether he would allow the probe to proceed. Barnaby Joyce, who is also fighting to hold his seat of New England in a byelection, has signalled the Nationals might formally support a banking inquiry after Nationals meet in their party room in Canberra next Monday. Earlier in the day, the Liberal deputy leader, Julie Bishop, made a conceptual case against the inquiry, saying Australia needed to ensure confidence was maintained in Australia’s banking sector – but she left open whether or not the government might ultimately support one. “This is a matter for cabinet and the party room to discuss,” Bishop said. Turnbull later said the government would not support a banking royal commission because “our focus is on results”. “It is on action,” he said. “That is why we have not supported a royal commission. If we had set up a royal commission into banks two years ago, none of the reforms that we have undertaken would have been able to be achieved.” Turnbull said the priorities in the final sitting week in the House of Representatives would be legalising same-sex marriage and sorting out the citizenship declarations which MPs will be required to make to prove their eligibility. But the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who was also in Bennelong campaigning with Kristina Keneally, said that when the prime minister began to dig in, it was generally a sign that a backflip was on the way. “Malcolm Turnbull says he’s not going to change his mind – get prepared for a change of mind,” Shorten said. “Let’s be upfront here, the government and its members are running around like a bunch of headless chooks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/26/how-i-fell-in-love-with-wh-auden-again-and-again","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T21:00:30Z","webTitle":"How I fell in love with WH Auden (again and again) | Susan McDonald","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/26/how-i-fell-in-love-with-wh-auden-again-and-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/26/how-i-fell-in-love-with-wh-auden-again-and-again","fields":{"headline":"How I fell in love with WH Auden (again and again)","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"WH Auden said “poetry must be entered into by a personal encounter, or it must be left alone”. His poems have been personal for me for 30 years; they’re a touchstone I use now and then to take the measure of my world. There’s just something about him: the stars he sees align with mine. I can trace my own journeys – political, psychological, philosophical, spiritual – along the routes he has mapped. I first opened Auden’s Selected Poems in my late teens. I’d taken it off my mother’s bookshelf – I knew his name and his fame; I thought I should be reading him. I started with the shorter, less obscure poems. Sometimes my eye even darted between poems, reading a stanza here, a stanza there. I felt I had to ease in slowly – graze around the edges of the feast. Auden can be difficult, “Audenesque”: that complicated, sometimes terse, syntax. He liked to boast that he had written a poem in every metre but I was oblivious to that achievement; and I had to consult the dictionary frequently (my daily lexicon has never included dapatical, osse and olamic). But the images he conjured were concrete and instantly recognisable. “Only the hands are living,” he wrote of gamblers in a casino. Of nursing home residents: “All are limitory, but each has her own/nuance of damage.” “Geese podge home.” The moon is a “Presence to glop at”. As Clive James said, Auden could make anything sound truer than true. But the form was in the employ of the meaning – and that too has rung true for 30 years. I was in the middle of an arts degree, trying hard to avoid thinking about getting my first job, when I read The Average, with its allusion to “those smart professions that encourage shallow breathing”. What timing! I read Moon Landing (“It’s natural the Boys should whoop it up for so huge a phallic triumph”) not long after the space shuttle Challenger disaster. I remember that Rorschach-test explosion in the sky; knew what Auden meant by the “squalid mess called History”. Then, Musée des Beaux Arts described perfectly the way I had started to feel about moral responsibility; about suffering’s “human position; how it takes place/While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along”. In Auden’s world it is part of the human condition to have “promises to keep”: there’s a moral imperative to political, as well as personal, choices. Why spend money on space travel, for instance, when people are dying of hunger? I sought out the more directly political Auden as the 21st century dawned. I remember watching the twin towers come down on 9/11. My kids were little – I had one in my arms and the other was playing around my feet, and I had to turn off the TV. It was too much to contemplate. It was my children’s world now and it was spinning in the wrong direction. I was angry; feared what the US would do next. I wasn’t in one of those “dives on Fifty-Second Street” of Auden’s September 1, 1939, but I stood: Uncertain and afraid As the clever hopes expire Of a low dishonest decade (Auden was writing about the 30s but his words fit.) And Refugee Blues mirrored what I considered Australia’s “low dishonest decade” (and more) of asylum seeker policy: Dreamed I saw a building with a thousand floors, A thousand windows and a thousand doors: Not one of them was ours, my dear, not one of them was ours. War, refugee policy and climate change inaction have charged my political frustrations for most of my adult life and Auden was able to distill the target of that frustration – the wilful blindness of the powerful – with a single line: “The little natures that will make us cry”; and his description of a tyrant needs no explanation in the Trump/Kim Jong-un era: When he laughed, respectable senators burst with laughter, And when he cried the little children died in the streets. But I was always looking for more from Auden. I wanted him to make sense of it all. He was unflinchingly honest about death, about the tyranny of time, the folly of the modern world – but could he offer any hope? His answer was always love: I’ll love you, dear, I’ll love you Till China and Africa meet, And the river jumps over the mountain And the salmon sing in the street, Auden was a contradictory man about his Christianity and revisionist about some of his poetry. But that only reflected reticence, a dialectical manner of thought and a great reverence for the world as it is. In Tonight at Seven-Thirty, Auden says “the funniest mortals and the kindest are those who are most aware of the baffle of being”. I agree – that’s why I’ve read his poems for the past 30 years. • Do you have a story about the moment of discovery when a pastime became a passion?

You can read the full report by the Guardian’s Robert Booth here: It started with an exciting announcement from Kensington Palace. Then the couple posed for photos. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle gave a 20-minute interview, which you can watch here: You can share your joy at the royal engagement, or any other emotion, on the Guardian website. Thanks for following today’s action. Have a peaceful evening. Actor Patrick J Adams, who plays Markle’s on-screen partner in the TV show Suits, has joked he feels cheated by the engagement. Adams also sent his best wishes to the couple, and said Prince Harry is a “lucky man”. Still nothing from Donald Trump, but not everybody has managed to get their congratulations message right. DUP leader Arlene Foster has apologised to the couple and the Duke of Cambridge after sending her congratulations to the wrong prince. The message also mis-spelt Ms Markle’s first name. The MP has now corrected the mistake. You can now watch the full interview here: Prince Harry said Meghan and his late mother, Princess Diana, would have been “thick as thieves”. I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, so excited for me, but then, as I said, she would have probably been best friends – best friends with Meghan. You know, it is days like today I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But, you know, with the ring and with everything else that’s going on, I’m sure she’s with us. When asked about the ring, which is decorated with diamonds from Princess Diana’s collection, Markle said: The inclusion of that and, obviously not being able to meet his mom, it’s so important to me to – to know that she’s a part of this with us. I think in being able to meet his aunts... and different people who were so important to his mom, I’m able to, in some way, know a part of her through them and of course through him. It’s incredibly special. And you know to be able to have this [the ring] which sort of links where you come from and Botswana which is important to us. It’s perfect. Dogs came up a lot in the big interview. Prince Harry said the Queen’s corgis took to Markle straight away. The prince joked: I’ve spent the last 33 years being barked at, this one walks in, absolutely nothing... Markle said: [The corgis were] just laying on my feet during tea, it was very sweet. When asked if she would bring her own dogs to the UK, the actor said: Well I have two dogs that I’ve had for quite a long time, both my rescue pups. And one is now staying with very close friends and my other little guy is – yes he’s in the UK, he’s been here for a while. Markle revealed the prince designed the ring he gave her. Harry said: The ring is yellow gold because that’s her favourite, and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana and the little diamonds either side are from my mother’s jewellery collection to make sure that she’s with us on this – on this crazy journey together. Here’s a quick dispatch from my colleague Robert Booth: Meghan Markle has described as “disheartening” and “discriminatory” some of the media coverage she received as Prince Harry’s girlfriend because it centred on her racial background. In an interview to mark their engagement announced on Monday, Harry also said the couple were “totally unprepared for what happened” in terms of the coverage, which forced him to take the rare step last year of attacking the British press for introducing “racial overtones” into the reporting of his relationship with an American actor. Markle, whose mother is African American and father is white, said the extent of media interest had been “a learning curve and said “I did not have any understanding of what it would be like”. “At the end of the day I am proud of who I am and where I have come from and we have never put any focus on that, we have just focused on who we are as a couple.” The couple, who will marry next spring in what a royal source said would be a “happy church wedding”, revealed how Prince Harry proposed at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace on “a standard typical night in for us” while they were roasting a chicken for dinner. Markle said it was “just an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee . . . I could barely let you finish proposing. I said ‘can I say yes now?’” “Then there were hugs and I had the ring in my finger and I was like can I give you the ring? She goes – oh yes the ring.” Markle said meeting the Queen was “incredible”. “To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honour and respect for her as the monarch, but the love that he has for her as his grandmother, all of those layers have been so important for me,” she said. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been speaking to the BBC’s Mishal Husain about their relationship. The couple revealed they met on a blind date after being matched by a friend. The prince had “never even heard of” Markle before the date, but said he was “beautifully surprised” when he met her. Just under five minutes until the BBC airs its interview with the couple. Nigel Farage, look away now. Meghan Markle appears to be a remainer. On 2 July last year, thousands protested against the Brexit vote in central London. Meghan Markle seems to have been among them. That day, she posted a photo on Instagram showing a sign reading: “If EU leave me now, you take away the biggest part of me.” Still no word from the US president but Justin Trudeau in Canada has offered his sincere congratulations. Markle has a connection with Canada as Suits is filmed in Toronto and she has lived there as a result. Additionally, Harry and Markle’s first public appearance as a couple was at the Invictus Games in the city. Here is a video the Guardian has made about Meghan Markle: Their marriage will bring into reality what the British establishment lacked the imagination to even conceive of as possible 17 years ago – that a senior royal can love, and marry, someone whose ethnic heritage is not just different to his own, but the heritage that has always been most othered in Britain – black and African. The royal family plays a largely symbolic role in our society, so it’s the symbolism of this engagement that interests me. I struggled growing up with the feeling that the monarchy were fundamental to Britishness, but that the Britishness they represented was one that excluded me. This exclusion mattered. It made other people perceive being truly British, and being black, as incompatible identities. It represented a giant taboo. Every government that I can remember made some attempt, rhetorical at least, to acknowledge and protect racial diversity. The family at the apex of our society was doing anything but. This is not the news people wanted to hear (not that it makes much difference to us journalists who will all have to work whatever) but Downing Street has said there are “no plans” for a bank holiday on the day of Prince Harry’s wedding. When William and Kate were married there was a bonus bank holiday but the difference in this case is that William is a likely future king while Harry is not. Markle’s on-screen father in Suits, Wendell Pierce, has tweeted his congratulations. He is perhaps the coolest person to have publicly offered his good wishes to date (no offence to Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, Philip Hammond, Fearne Cotton, Ronan Keating etc). Pierce, who plays Robert Zane in Suits and was also Bunk in the Wire, wrote: The ring, like the outfit, is a self-assured choice, with three diamonds and no coloured stones. This differs from Diana’s sapphire ring, worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, and Sarah Ferguson’s ruby ring. The jewellery expert Susan Rumfitt says the ring, designed by Harry using two diamonds from Diana’s collection and one from Botswana, fits with tradition. She compares it with the Queen’s engagement ring from 1947, made using a stone from Prince Philip’s mother’s tiara. “To use a piece of family jewellery is a traditional idea,” she said. The choice of diamonds, meanwhile, is both fashionable and traditional. Rumfitt said: The current fashion is for diamond engagement rings. But it’s very traditional as well. Stephen Bates, formerly religious and royal correspondent of the Guardian, writes that Meghan Markle is not so different from royal brides in days of yore, and that the Windsors have become accustomed to the intrusive publicity that accompanies such events. Time moves on, and although we can expect much comment on Markle’s acting career, her Americanness, mixed heritage, even before getting to speculation about how to become a first-time mother in your late 30s – such things are novel these days neither to most families, nor even to the royal family. It is thought that George III’s long-suffering wife, Charlotte, who had a German background, may also have may have had mixed-race ancestry. And their son the Duke of Clarence – later William IV – lived with the Irish actor Dorothea Jordan for 20 years and had 10 children with her, until he was reminded that he might become king one day and if he wanted a royal pension he ought to find a more suitable wife. He ditched her for the minor German princess Adelaide, who was 30 years his junior ... Having an actor in the family is not the social stigma it was in old William IV’s day either: Markle is sure to be a hot property for agents and producers across the world now, if she chooses to continue her career. And why not, though she may have to be a bit careful about the roles she chooses from now on. Prince Harry designed the ring that Markle showed off to photographers this afternoon, using diamonds that belonged to his mother, Princess Diana. The two outside stones came from the late princess’s personal collection, with the centrepiece a large diamond from Botswana. The country holds special significance for Harry who has visited many times since he was a child and is a place where the couple have spent time together over the past year and a half, Kensington Palace said. The band is made of gold and the ring was made by Cleave and Company. By designing his bride-to-be’s engagement ring using jewels that belonged to his mother, Harry is following in the footsteps of his grandfather. The Duke of Edinburgh designed an engagement ring for the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, in 1947. The Duke had the ring made by the jewellers Philip Antrobus Ltd, using diamonds from a tiara belonging to his mother, Princess Alice of Greece. When Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton, now the Duchess of Cambridge, he gave her Diana’s famous sapphire and diamond engagement ring. He hid the priceless heirloom in a rucksack so he could pop the question on holiday in Kenya. Will Meghan Markle, an American national, need to apply for a visa to join her soon-to-be spouse in the UK? Downing Street declined to comment to reporters who asked the question at this morning’s lobby briefing and directed the question to the House Office. The Home Office “does not comment on individual cases” but pointed the Guardian towards the rules for family visas, which are needed if you wish to remain in the UK with your spouse or fiance. The decision is usually made within eight weeks and will cost £993, or £1,583 if Meghan decides to use the premium service. There are restrictions, including if you cannot prove your knowledge of English or your spouse does not meet the minimum income requirement of £18,000 or cash savings above £16,000, but that is unlikely to be an issue for the couple. It is not clear which visa Meghan is currently using to be in the UK, but if she is here on a visitor visa, under the official system, she would need to leave the UK in order to apply for her family visa. Hysteria ensues. Meghan appeared for her first photocall as Harry’s fiancee in a white coat by the Canadian brand Line the Label, as well as a dress by Parosh. Immediately after the appearance, Line the Label’s website crashed because of the numbers of people trying to access its site. Still no word from Trump. He’s sent three tweets in the last 45 minutes. Washington DC is five hours behind UK time. As previously discussed, the diplomatic course of action would be to congratulate them. But Markle did once call the president of the US “misogynistic”. What will he do? Here’s a few more pictures of the happy couple in the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace: Here’s a close up picture of the engagement ring – and it’s a biggie. A large media crowd has gathered outside Kensington Palace, the dormitory for the younger royals, with royal fans also gathered politely out of the view of the cameras. At one point a cheer went up from a crowd gathered by the fence of the palace when the couple apparently appeared briefly in the grounds. Averil Edwards, from Chicago, and Melanie Edwards, from St Louis, were on their way to visit the palace’s Princess Diana exhibit. “I just found out ... it’s exciting!” Averil said. “It’s great how he protected her too when all of the press controversy was going on,” she added. Tony Appleton, from Chelmsford, Essex, was standing close to the TV crews in full town crier regalia, with a self-made scroll proclaiming the engagement: “I had a little phone call this morning, very early. I can’t disclose my source but I was up here outside the palace at 8am, had my scroll ready, to make the announcement. “I did a cry outside Buckingham Palace about 9.30-10am, before I got told off by police.” Ring update here from ITV’s royal editor: The first pictures of Harry and Meghan’s engagement photocall have landed. Here’s a selection. Harry and Meghan have appeared for a photocall in the gardens of Kensington palace Dressed in a navy blue suit, Harry appeared holding Meghan’s hand. She was dressed in a white overcoat. Assembled reporters shouted questions at the couple. Asked how he proposed, Harry replied: “That will come later.” “Was it romantic?” another reporter asked. “Of course it was,” Harry said. He said he was “thrilled” to be engaged, while Meghan said she was “so very happy”. Asked when he knew Meghan was “the one”, he replied “the very first time” they met. She was asked to show reporters the ring and obliged. Jonathan Munro, the BBC’s head of newsgathering, has confirmed Harry and Meghan will be interviewed by Mishal Husain on behalf of all broadcasters, and it will air at 6pm. He has yet to tweet today, and the prolific social media ranter Donald Trump faces a dilemma. The diplomatic course of action, as the leader of Britain’s closest ally, would be to congratulate Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. However, the future princess has been critical of the US president, branding him “misogynistic”. The prospect of Trump attending the ceremony is an unlikely one. With the level of protection that surrounds an American president, the inclusion of Trump would give security chiefs a headache as they work to police the high-profile event. Trump’s appearance could also spark mass protests. When Theresa May offered Trump an early invite for a state visit, the decision proved controversial with polls suggesting up to two million people would take to the streets to demonstrate should the trip go ahead. In 2011, the then US president, Barack Obama, and the first lady, Michelle Obama, were not invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding, reportedly because of the added security cost. But they were feted with a state visit to the UK a month later. Should Trump travel to the UK for a state visit, it would be expected that the newly royal Markle would meet him and join guests at the state banquet. But Markle, who backed Hillary Clinton for president, suggested in a television interview in 2016 that she would leave the US for Canada if Trump won. She said: “We film Suits in Toronto and I might just stay in Canada. I mean come on, if that’s reality we are talking about, come on, that is a gamechanger in terms of how we move in the world here.” Markle told Larry Wilmore’s Nightly Show in the US: “Yes, of course Trump is divisive. “Think about just female voters alone. I think it was in 2012, the Republican party lost the female vote by 12 points. That’s a huge number and as misogynistic as Trump is and so vocal about it, that’s a huge chunk of it.” For the 1981 wedding of Harry’s parents, the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer, Ronald Reagan did not attend but his wife, Nancy Reagan, did. This could be an option for Harry, who has already met the current first lady, Melania Trump. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will be expected to receive one of the sought-after invites, along with other Commonwealth leaders from across the globe. The UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, wished Harry and Meghan well, after party members booed when reporters asked him about the engagement. After he gave a speech in Glasgow, Corbyn ignored the booing by activists and said: “I wish them well, I hope they have a great time and great fun together, and having met Harry a couple of times I’m sure they’re going to have a great deal of fun.” Corbyn added: “I really do admire the way that Harry and his brother have drawn attention to mental health conditions all across the country. “I wish him well, thank him for what he has done on mental health, hope they have a great life together.” Details of the venue and timing of the wedding are expected to be released on Tuesday with aides only saying it will be “a happy church wedding”. Harry is understood to have told his close staff two weeks ago that he wanted to make the engagement public today and planning has been under way since then. The couple got engaged this month in London. The delay in making the announcement was partly due to Markle needing to finish filming on Suits, which she did the week before last. The pair are due to give a broadcast interview this evening after posing for photos this afternoon outside Kensington Palace, where they will live in the two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage. You can share your joy at the royal engagement, or frustration at its domination of the news agenda, elsewhere on the Guardian website. Given that Markle is not a UK citizen, assuming the normal rules reply, she will have to get a visa to get married in Britain. The Press Association says: The rule is that all non-European nationals must obtain a visa if they want to come to the UK in order to marry. Markle could apply for a family visa if she wants to live with fiance Harry in the UK for more than six months. Fees range from £993 to £1,583. Decisions by the Home Office can be made on the same day via the premium service or sometimes take up to 12 weeks. There is unlikely to be any hold-up for the future HRH. It also says that it is not a given that Markle will become a British citizen. When the Canadian Autumn Phillips married the Queen’s grandson Peter Phillips, she said: ‘I’m happy being Canadian and I’m proud of where I come from. So I’ll keep my passport.’ Their children, Savannah and Isla Phillips, are said to hold dual British and Canadian citizenship, which would pave the way for dual citizenship for any children Harry and his bride might have. Outside Buckingham Palace this morning hundreds of tourists were gathered for the changing of the guard, but news of the engagement had apparently not yet filtered through. Those present had to be told of the happy news. “I’m happy for him, that’s about it really,” said Deryck Toney, who was sightseeing while on holiday from Virginia. “I think if he’s in love with her and she’s in love with him they should go on and be married and live a happy life.” Jessica Parsons, from Los Angeles, and her friends looked up Harry and Meghan on Google before giving their opinion. “It’s exciting that he’s engaged to an American, I think that’s every American girl’s dream,” she said. “Now there’s hope for us Americans, for American girls,” she added, but a friend quickly pointed out that the next eligible royal bachelor, Prince George, was some years away from an engagement. Francis Essel, from Ghana, said he was in the UK for the first time. He said he was enjoying the changing of the guard. Asked about Prince Harry’s engagement, he said: “I don’t know much about him.” The one Briton the Guardian was able to find was a tour guide who had been showing Essel and others from his party the sights. “Personally I couldn’t care less, but for my job I have to take an interest,” she said. “I hope it will never be on the front page when there are so many other important things happening. I bet Theresa [May] will be pleased; we’ve got a royal wedding as a distraction.” Nevertheless, she said she had nothing against Harry, and it was a good thing that his marrying a mixed race woman would introduce a bit of diversity into the royal family. But, she added: “He’s the spare anyway, he’s not important. He’s not even the spare now, he’s way down the line.” Republic, a campaign group calling for the abolition of the monarchy, put out a statement that, in its brevity, dripped with distain. “Congratulations,” Graham Smith of Republic said. The tributes are pouring in. The prime minister, Theresa May, says “this is a time of huge celebration for two people in love”. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is likely to wed the couple, wished them “many years of love”. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, took time out from exposing British citizens to increased jail terms overseas to offer “huge congratulations”. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, wished the pair a lifetime of happiness together. The former Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, who will presumably be interested in American Markle’s immigration status, also offered congratulations. Meghan Markle will become a duchess or princess after she weds Prince Harry, the Press Association reports. Tradition dictates that royal men receive a title when they marry, with Harry expected to become the Duke of Sussex. On the morning of his wedding, the prince is likely to be given a dukedom by his grandmother, the Queen. His new wife would become both an HRH and a duchess after saying her vows. But Harry – whose full name is Prince Henry of Wales – could turn down a title. In this case, Meghan would be known as HRH Princess Henry of Wales. She is not entitled to be Princess Meghan, though this may be how she becomes known in the media and to the public. It is likely that Harry will accept the Queen’s offer of a dukedom as is the convention, like his brother, Prince William, who was made the Duke of Cambridge, and his uncle Prince Andrew, who became the Duke of York. Meghan Markle is an American actress best known for her role in the US TV series Suits. She rose to fame playing the law student Rachel Zane in the legal drama after parts in CSI: Miami, the sci-fi show Fringe and movies such as Remember Me and Horrible Bosses. The 36-year-old Californian is a global ambassador for World Vision Canada and campaigns for gender equality in her role as a women’s advocate for the UN. She has her own clothing line and had a fashion and lifestyle website thetig.com. In her own words, she said she was “an actress, a writer, the editor-in-chief of my lifestyle brand The Tig, a pretty good cook, and a firm believer in handwritten notes”. In what was seen as a sign of Markle getting ready to marry into the royals, she brought an abrupt end to her blog in April 2017. She removed all posts and closed the site, posting a message that began: “After close to three beautiful years on this adventure with you, it’s time to say goodbye to The Tig.” But she gave no explanation as to why she had made her decision. In September 2017, her engagement to Harry looked set when she appeared on the cover of the US magazine Vanity Fair and talked about her relationship. “We’re two people who are really happy and in love,” she said. She was born on 4 August 1981 to her clinical therapist mother, Doria Radlan, and her TV lighting director father, Thomas Markle. She grew up in Los Angeles, and studied at a girls’ Roman Catholic college. Her parents divorced when she was six. Markle has written about her mixed heritage – her father is caucasian and of Dutch and Irish descent and her mother is African American – and how it created “a grey area surrounding my self-identification”. Markle graduated from Northwestern University in theatre and international relations. Markle’s parents, Doria Radlan and Thomas Markle, wished their daughter and Harry “a lifetime of happiness”, adding: “We are incredibly happy for Meghan and Harry. “Our daughter has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents.” Harry’s gran, the Queen, was one of the first to express her delight at the announcement. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh both said they were “delighted” for their grandson and his bride-to-be, and “wish them every happiness”. His dad, Princes Charles, told reporters at a series of appearances in Dorset that the development was “very good” and added: “Thrilled for them both. They’ll be very happy indeed.” Harry’s brother and sister-in-law, Prince William and Kate, said: “We are very excited for Harry and Meghan. It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and to see how happy she and Harry are together.” Welcome to live coverage of the announcement that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are engaged. Clarence House revealed the betrothal in a brief statement. “His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms Meghan Markle,” it said. Social media and news organisations exploded with joy, disdain, excitement and in some cases antipathy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/01/the-best-books-on-food-of-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T09:00:38Z","webTitle":"The best books on food of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/01/the-best-books-on-food-of-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/01/the-best-books-on-food-of-2017","fields":{"headline":"The best books on food of 2017","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Did cookbook publishers know something that the rest of us didn’t in 2016 when they were planning this year’s lists? Never has a year in global politics so clearly called for comfort eating, and food writers have delivered in ladlefuls. This has been the strongest year for cookbooks I can remember and my list of recommendations here could have been twice as long. Comfort food, as the American food writer Emily Nunn explores in her moving and witty memoir The Comfort Food Diaries (Simon &amp; Schuster), is not always the same as “tasteful” food. “Like the heart, the stomach wants what it wants,” Nunn writes. She recalls a former boyfriend whose taste of home was a terrible green gelatin “salad” made with cream cheese, raw cabbage, pecan nuts and lime jelly. Watching him eat it, Nunn recalls, was like “watching him realise that a person who’d stopped loving him had returned: the nostalgia, the hope, then sweet relief”. Nunn’s book is an account – with recipes – of the Comfort Food Tour of the US she took following a breakdown after her brother killed himself and her fiance left her. Without any neat epiphanies, Nunn finds that food – such as “Great-grandmother’s mean lemon cake” – is the thing that brings solace when nothing else does. In a week of dark moods and bad weather, I took refuge in Chai, Chaat and Chutney (Mitchell Beazley) by Chetna Makan. She takes us on a charming street food tour of India, from the pantaras of Kolkata (deep fried pancakes stuffed with chicken and vegetables) to the lentil dumplings of Delhi. It’s worth buying the book just for the coriander and spinach chutney recipe, heady with ginger and garlic and creamy from the addition of a little chana dal (split chickpeas). Makan advises taking this chutney, spreading it on a soft white bread roll and placing a spiced folded omelette on top to make an omelette pav. I can’t think of a more consoling solitary lunch. The whole subject of comfort food can feel ambivalent, as Guardian columnist Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh write in their preface to Sweet (Ebury). How can we justify baking with sugar at a time when so many are suffering from Type 2 diabetes? Their answer is that it’s worth celebrating the sweet things in life with occasional treats, and they do so magnificently here, with 110 inspiring recipes. Fans of Ottolenghi’s inventive flavour combinations will not be disappointed: try pineapple and star anise chiffon cake, or walnut and black treacle tarts with sage. But Sweet also features older and simpler comforts such as Garibaldi biscuits and buttery almond tuiles. I thought there was no room for yet another baking book in my kitchen. I was wrong. In the sea of new cookbooks, some authors struggle to find an original theme. But home cooking itself is theme enough, argues Nigella Lawson in At My Table (Chatto). This is a relaxed and inviting selection of recipes, organised with no chapter breaks, to signify, as Lawson explains, the “honest jumble” of life. I especially loved the Indian spiced chicken and potato traybake with Bollywood-pink pickled onions, and the red mussels with pasta, but I’d happily cook from this book every night. Another glorious collection of a cook’s passions is The Modern Cook’s Year (4th Estate) by vegetarian chef Anna Jones. Her recipes are where health and comfort meet and this, the author’s third book, is thoughtfully arranged by the seasons. If food can comfort, so can books. The Little Library Cookbook (Head of Zeus), a debut by food blogger Kate Young, brings together the two, recreating meals from her favourite books, most of them from childhood. Here is Turkish delight from Narnia and pancakes from Pippi Longstocking and apple pie from The Railway Children. A project like this could easily descend into tweeness, but Young is grounded and engaging and her recipes are excellent. The twin joys of childhood and food are also celebrated in The Christmas Chronicles (4th Estate) by Nigel Slater, a paean to winter eating that is as reassuring and welcome as the clementine at the bottom of a stocking. If you would rather escape the present day altogether and lose yourself in thoughts of long-forgotten meals, I recommend The French Country Housewife (Prospect Books) by Cora Millet-Robinet. This sizeable volume, by the French equivalent of Mrs Beeton, was first published in 1859 and has now been translated into English by Tom Jaine. It’s utterly fascinating, from the Beeton-like thoughts on how to run a household (“a child’s bathtub is essential”) to the recipes, some of which are bizarre (kidney mould) and some genuinely appealing (a gratin of fresh peas). I found myself daydreaming over mirabelle plum jam and orange flower cordial. One person’s comfort is another’s discomfort. There has been much debate recently about eating insects, which offer a sustainable form of protein if we could get over the disgust factor. On Eating Insects (Phaidon) by Josh Evans, Roberto Flore, Michael Bom Frøst and Nordic Food Lab, the most thought-provoking food book I’ve read all year, approaches the issue from a fresh angle. In response to the question of whether insects can ever be delicious this study points out that two billion people already find them so. Beautifully presented, it includes essays on the ethics of eating insects, recipes – such as anty gin, spicy cricket with asparagus – and a lyrically written travelogue. Evans meets a man in Uganda for whom noodles with long-horned grasshoppers simmered in a spicy tomato sauce are as familiar as lasagne. Lying behind all this comfort food is the darker question of why, exactly, people need to be comforted so much. Ukrainian food writer Olia Hercules begins Kaukasis the Cookbook: The Culinary Journey Through Georgia, Azerbaijan &amp; Beyond (Mitchell Beazley) with thoughts on what it means for her to collect the cuisines of neighbouring countries that have so often been at war. While capturing the differences between the cooking of the various countries of the Caucasus, Hercules argues that the culture of the region is intertwined and that this is seen in food. Her flavours are both exciting and soothing – take the Azerbaijani dish khingal, for example, combining fresh pasta with crispy lamb, fried onions, dill, sumac and yoghurt. Hercules notes that some comfort food can be bland, whereas this dish “makes me feel safe and yet also titillates my senses”. When we think of Syria our first thoughts are most likely far from the comforting flavours of hummus and stuffed dates. But Syria: Recipes from Home (Trapeze) by Itab Azzam and Dina Mousawi makes the case for celebrating Syrian food culture now more than ever, as part of a heritage that is still alive when so much in the country is under threat. Azzam and Mousawi pepper their book with sayings such as “Bulgar is coral but lentils are pearls” and “You are the parsley to my tabbouleh”. This extraordinary, heartbreaking volume features the stories of eight women affected by conflict in Syria alongside delicious Syrian recipes with the Middle Eastern flavours – tahini, pomegranates, za’atar – that are now so loved by British home cooks. The project might sound distasteful, except that the Syrian women themselves all describe the food of their home as the one thing that offers solace and a connection with happier times. Fedwa was a mother of five who lost two of her sons, one to an accident at sea and the other to a sniper’s bullet. She cooks in a Damascus kitchen “as small as the happiness in my heart”.

It’s just not right","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The news that left-handers excel at some sports but not others confirmed my thoughts that the 10% of people that make up us southpaws are used to punching above our weight. A study published in the journal Biology Letters concludes that being left-handed is an advantage in sports where time pressures are particularly severe – such as table tennis, or cricket, or squash. I am the exception to the rule – I manage to be equally rubbish at any sport regardless of whether it be fast or slow. My PE teacher told me at least I had one good tennis shot in me, but I felt that was a backhanded compliment. But if we left-handers lead at sports such as cricket or tennis, it is yet to make up for the inequality we face in everyday life. I always held dear the fact I was born a left-hander. It felt like a little badge of honour, like having a little superpower. To this day, I find myself scanning the room to seek out kindred spirits and upon discovering a fellow left-hander, giving them a knowing wink and a smile. Conversely, I find I am unfairly judged by right-handed folk. “Oh, you’re a lefty,” they say in a tone that would normally be reserved for someone with a terminal illness. In fact, many right-handers still mistakenly believe that left-handed people die younger, a theory long since debunked, thankfully. Meeting people for the first time is difficult, especially those who offer a handshake at the earliest opportunity from their right side. You either have to accept it and lead with your weaker right hand and face being judged poorly for dispatching such a weedy handshake, or persist with offering the left hand which then forces your new acquaintance with having to put down whatever they are holding in their left hand in order to fulfil a frankly quirky social custom. Why can’t we bump chests and be done with it? While I have never been forced to favour my right hand by teachers or anyone else in positions of authority, I have still been treated unfairly. Keen to learn the guitar at the age of 11 with a new indie revolution whirring in our social consciousness, I signed up for a lunchtime music club in which we’d be taught the basics. I was met with a sigh, a grunt and a grumpy teacher mumbling something about “having to restring the thing” and: “Can you not use your right hand like everyone else?” I later self-taught right-handed five years later – turned out it would have been a massive pain to restring the thing after all – but by then I’d missed Britpop so it was all pointless anyway. Along with using a PC mouse, it’s the only time I have betrayed my left-handedness in favour of convenience. The rest of the time, it’s one big struggle. Mealtimes at the family table were fraught with problems when my right-handed brother and I would sit together. We’d end up elbowing each other furiously. Mind you that had nothing to do with being left-handed, I just hated him. Society’s inability to cater for left-handers is an issue that needs tackling. Writing with anything other than a pencil is a chore. Once, when I was provided with a fountain pen to practise neat handwriting at school, there was more ink on my hand than there was on the paper, creating the impression that I had wrestled with a squid. Novelty coffee cups are a waste of time – the funny messages are always written on the wrong side. The cups that have a tray beneath the drinking reservoir in order to conceal biscuits favours the right-hander, meaning you cover yourself in Hobnobs whenever taking a drink of your brew. Personalised pens almost always see the bearer’s name written from the nib outwards, meaning that left-handers have to get used to seeing their names upside down. Kettles are often ergonomically designed to benefit right-handers. Jugs have the measures on the wrong side. Toilet flushes are mostly always on the right. Tin openers are an ordeal. Spiral notebooks are the devil’s work. The list goes on and on. Yes, there are items specifically designed for left-handers. But these need to be on the high street shelves, not hidden away in some shop resembling Ned Flanders’ Leftorium from The Simpsons. It’s great that we’re better than you at some sports, and that we’re generally better people – Barack Obama is one of us – but the playing field that is life needs to be levelled up. Stop treating us like outsiders. I may be left-handed, but I’m right. • Richard Easterbrook is a PR professional and a proud left-hander"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/28/nudity-israeli-dancers-conflict-culture-minister-jerusalem","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Nudity lands Israeli dancers in fresh conflict with culture minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/28/nudity-israeli-dancers-conflict-culture-minister-jerusalem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/28/nudity-israeli-dancers-conflict-culture-minister-jerusalem","fields":{"headline":"Nudity lands Israeli dancers in fresh conflict with culture minister","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A conflict between Israel’s draconian culture minister and artists using nudity in their performances has been thrown back into the spotlight with the opening of one of the country’s most important contemporary dance festivals. For the third time in a year a big Israeli arts festival – this time Jerusalem International Dance Week – has been told by officials acting for the culture minister, Miri Regev, that it cannot use government funds to subsidise three of 28 performances because they involve either full or partial nudity. Instead, the programme for the event, which attracts dance festival organisers from around the world, will carry an asterisk noting the partial nudity and the fact they are not “supported” by the culture ministry or the city’s municipality. The move comes despite a legal opinion from Israel’s deputy attorney general suggesting the stipulation is illegal. It represents the latest front in Israel’s growing culture wars that have seen Regev and other rightwing ministers - who regard the arts as being “left-leaning and elitist” - take aim at everything from theatre and film productions, to literature on the school curriculum, and the question of who should receive the prestigious Israel Prizes. The latest intervention follows a similar move targeting two performances involving nudity in the Israel Festival this summer and in the recent Curtains Up dance festival. Among the artists whose work has been drawn into the row are Adi Shildan and Nir Vidan, co-creators and performers of The Restlessness of Winged Creatures. The artists, who are gay, told the Guardian the purpose of the work was to challenge stereotypes by asking the audience to observe their bodies even as the performance deconstructed ideas of gender. Shildan said the recent efforts to cut funding to performances involving nudity were part of a wider effort by Israeli conservatives to narrow the public space for discourse. “Nudity is un-extraordinary in contemporary dance,” she said. “But in Israel we are a step back from Europe,” adding: “We are both without shirts but it is the woman’s body that ‘offends’.” More chilling, said Shildan, was the message it sent to artists. “In practical terms I am dependent in part on subsidies that come from the government. That creates a relationship between the establishment and creators, and it is dangerous when government goes inside the content. “It is not what art is supposed to be and the atmosphere that the minister of culture has created … You can feel it, and it is very fragile. And it is on the surface now in people’s artistic choices and in festivals.” For Vidan, the culture ministry’s moves were as baffling as they were worrying. “It’s not clear what this sentence means,” he told the Israeli paper Haaretz, referring to the programme note, “except for the provocation it causes.” Ruby Edelman, the artistic co-director of Machol Shalem, the dance house involved in organising the festival, also appeared to have been blindsided by the issue. “When I saw the pieces I didn’t notice the nudity because when I see something I am thinking whether it is good. So I was surprised. And it is always in a closed space, so it is not as if any one outside is exposed to a nipple.” He said the issue emerged after a rightwing religious councillor in the increasingly conservative Jerusalem municipality drew attention to the three performances. Edelman said that, even though he was keen to avoid the controversy and focus on fostering new art, he saw a degree of opportunism in the efforts to cut funding to performances with nudity. “There are many political streams in Jerusalem, and one of them is strongly ultra-orthodox. They have influence in the municipality and have to show the city is becoming more conservative. It is an opportunity for political gain [with their constituency].” He said it was part of a wider emerging issue. “We are feeling a lot of attention on the body as a problematic tool for expression. But we are trying to isolate the political white noise to deal with the art involved. “But it is also important to add that we are not disconnected from the [sensitivities of the] communities we are working with [in Jerusalem]. For example, we are producing a community-based dance project only involving ultra-orthodox women. We are fully aware of how complex Jerusalem is. In this case we are clear that this is a performance no men will ever see.” For Shildan, despite the potential loss of future funding, there is a positive aspect to the row. “I think it motivates me. It is a feedback that encourages you to expose things that are true. And I have a sense that maybe more artists are using nudity as an action against what is happening.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2017/nov/27/your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T11:20:10Z","webTitle":"Your best comments on the Guardian today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/nov/27/your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/nov/27/your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","fields":{"headline":"Your best comments on the Guardian today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Unaffordable UK property and a revealing look at inequality in Brazil provide forum for some of the conversations we’re highlighting today.

We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. Property unaffordable for 100,000 households a year in England The number of households priced out of the housing market is up by 30,000 a year according to a new report blaming a shortage of affordable homes to rent or buy. ‘Blame where blame is due, hang it on the Tories’ Housing is not working because the government has failed to invest in an essential mix of properties on a scale to accommodate their own population. They refuse to upscale the social rented sector instead allowing house builders to continue with executive homes which maximise profits. To them, it’s all about home ownership, and that in an era of Tory induced austerity is a strategy that lacks commitment, achievable strategic aims and common sense. Blame where blame is due, hang it on the Tories. After seven years no economic progress has been made and the taxes that foreign nationals are paying probably goes towards funding our ballooning housing benefit bill. thirdday ‘Full squatting rights and trespass should be restored’ Why does anyone need more than one property? My landlord, in 2008 had 22 properties all paid for by Housing Benefit and now he has 53 paid for by same. We need two things, a land revolution whereby all land is taken into national ownership, as is the case in most countries; and massive increases in taxes on the wealthy and uber rich, especially the aristocracy and the monarchy. Why do we pay the monarchy a single penny? Are you aware that we only occupy 11% of the UK land mass and that 87% of land is in private ownership and that 94% of all wealth is inherited? Full squatting rights and trespass should be restored along with laws that say when people invade empty properties in multi-occupied buildings they cannot be challenged and only evicted if the owners prove they are going to live there with immediate effect. minotaur Mark Foster: ‘I tiptoed around in the shadows for so long, but now is the time to come out’ Former World Champion and Olympic swimmer Mark Foster spoke in his first interview since coming out about years spent not being his true self: “I got really good at the dance of telling half-truths,” he said. Here are some of your responses. ‘Well done Mark for speaking out’ It is very sad that this lovely, talented man felt he had to hide the fact that he was gay for so long, and even now is nervous about telling people. Well done Mark for speaking out and telling the world, now please go and be happy :-) CornwallJo ‘I know the great sense of relief that you will be feeling’ Congratulations Mark. I am the same age as you and, despite living as a openly gay man for years, (with long term relationships during that time), I finally came out to my parents in 2015. So I know the great sense of relief that you will be feeling today. thomkat ‘There’s an underlying sadness in this really wonderful interview’ Love Mark Foster. There’s an underlying sadness in this really wonderful interview about the years ‘in the shadows’, but I’m glad he’s happy and positive about the future. angelene Revealed: fires in São Paulo favelas more likely on higher-value land Guardian Cities is spending the week in Brazil, reporting on São Paulo. Analysis for this piece finds favelas hit by fire in São Paulo have land values 76% higher than average, casting new doubt on official explanation of poor housing. This sounds entirely familiar I used to live in Brazil a long time back, and this sounds entirely familiar - rich Brazilians tend to feel entitled, they despise the poor and call them lazy. They don’t mind all the services those poor lazy people do cheaply because they live in a favela. Plus, corruption is rampant. zitronencurry ‘They have a similar same problem in Spain’ They have a similar same problem in Spain. Their solution, which worked until it was rescinded by the PP who are as bereft of ideas apart from building and property as the Tories are, was to make it illegal to build on land which had been destroyed by fire for the next 30 years. Amazingly there was a sudden drop in fires... Then when PP came along again and rescinded that law the number of fires went up again. Luddite How to get the most out of cycling in winter The Guardian’s Peter Walker offers reasons not to pack the bike away for winter, and some tips that might help you get the most out of your trusty steed in the colder months. Readers, of course, responded with some of their own. ‘Think about letting your tires down a small amount’ If it’s icy, think about letting your tires down a small amount as it improves grip. Also slow down and take corners in particular more slowly. Get a pair of undergloves if you do go for wool ones on the top: they may keep the chill out initially but they’re rubbish for wind protection. Loumo ‘Make sure there’s a cafe en route!’ Love winter bike rides. Did 30 miles round the Chiltern hills yesterday afternoon and got home just as the sun was setting, a superb time to be out, the roads were empty and the low light on the late autumn trees was divine. Practical tips: mudguards to stop getting wet feet and backside, and a windproof hi-viz coat because we blend completely into the hedgerows otherwise. Good lights of course but windproof gloves, thermal socks and an underhelmet cap should make you oblivious to the elements and able to stay out in relative comfort all day. Windproof stuff is my best tip because you can wear fewer layers if the wind chill factor is removed and stay warmer without overheating. And make sure there’s a cafe en route! aarthoor ‘Merino wool – it’s a miracle material’ Things that people haven’t mentioned yet: Merino wool – it’s a miracle material. Sometimes you can find bits in TK Maxx. Hand cream and lip balm – my hands and lips really suffer with the cold winds. Changing down gears – I get in a routine where I’m always in the same gears at the same points in my commute, then wonder why I’m exhausted by Wednesday of a blustery autumn week. Shortordercook From sexual harassment to hostile colleagues: readers’ experiences of life with a disability In the latest installment in a series called The Disability Diaries readers shared their experiences of life with a disability. The discussion was sparked into life by many more personal experiences. ‘I was left on the pavement, stunned, bleeding and unable to move’ I had a stroke a few years ago, quite a serious one and it has taken me several years to overcome many but not all of my disabilities. I do not look ‘disabled’ but I do get severe fatigue and I need a seat on buses but seldom can get one especially if I travel in the mornings and the afternoons during term time. Recently, and thanks to the bus driver who didn’t do his job I fell off the bus when exiting. The bus drove off and I was left on the pavement, stunned, bleeding and unable to move. I must have been on the pavement for about 10 minutes and many people walked past me and no one bothered to see if I was alright. I heard several people comment that I must be a drunk (I don’t drink alcohol) and two people bothered to stop but only to take photos on their smart phones. Clive Baulch ‘I don’t think many people are able to understand what it feels like to live with a disability’ The attitude seems to be that when you’re disabled or have a mental illness you’re supposed to retreat and be pitied. If you try to compete and live a normal life many people will exploit your vulnerabilities ruthlessly. Daisy’s experiences make me angry and they border on criminal. As if the lack of a visual boundary gives the freedom to invade personal space. I don’t think many people are able to understand what it feels like to live with a disability, especially a less obvious one such as Asperger or mental illness. Education and awareness should be taught from early school level. johnforeigner This article will be updated throughout the day with some of the most interesting ways readers have been participating across the site."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/nov/27/bitcoin-mining-consumes-electricity-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T10:39:57Z","webTitle":"Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity a year than Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/27/bitcoin-mining-consumes-electricity-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/nov/27/bitcoin-mining-consumes-electricity-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity a year than Ireland","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Bitcoin’s “mining” network uses more electricity in a year than the whole of Ireland, according to statistics released as the currency broke $9,000 for the first time. According to Digiconomist the estimated power use of the bitcoin network, which is responsible for verifying transactions made with the cryptocurrency, is 30.14TWh a year, which exceeds that of 19 other European countries. At a continual power drain of 3.4GW, it means the network consumes five times more electricity than is produced by the largest wind farm in Europe, the London Array in the outer Thames Estuary, at 630MW. At those levels of electricity consumption, each individual bitcoin transaction uses almost 300KWh of electricity – enough to boil around 36,000 kettles full of water. Although power consumption of other payment networks is harder to isolate, one of Visa’s two US data centres reportedly runs on about 2% of the power required by bitcoin. Between them, those two data centres conduct around 200m transactions a day; the bitcoin network handles fewer than 350,000. The astronomical power draw is a facet of how the bitcoin network protects itself against fraud. With no centralised authority confirming transactions, bitcoin is instead backed by “miners”, who put specialised computers to work churning through extremely power-intensive computing problems. Solving those problems both rewards the miner, handing them almost a quarter of a million dollars in bitcoin, and verifies all transactions made in the last 10 minutes. As the price of bitcoin goes up, so does the value of the reward, meaning that more miners put more computers to the task of running the network. But since the price of bitcoin doesn’t necessarily rise in step with the number of transactions, that disconnect can mean the currency uses a significant amount of power per transaction in periods of high prices. The value of one bitcoin neared $10,000 on 27 November, as the currency continued to grow in its third significant boom in its history. Previous periods of sustained growth, in 2013 and 2014, each ended with substantial busts, leading commentators to label them, in hindsight, as speculative bubbles.

Alexis Sánchez’s 92nd-minute penalty gave Arsène Wenger’s team a victory that lifted them into fourth place on 25 points, one ahead of Tottenham Hotspur. They are 12 points behind the leaders, Manchester City, yet Cech has not ruled out Arsenal competing for the championship. “You have to play game by game, not think too much about what’s going on around you because if you win your game then you give yourself a chance,” he said. “Let’s win our game and see how the others are doing. If the other teams at this moment above us keep going, keep winning, then you can’t catch them, but first you need to win your games and keep putting pressure on them. “It’s only 13 games in, that’s the most important thing and there’s so many points to be won. You need to carry on for 38 games and show consistency. There can be plenty of twists in the table and you see yourselves climb after two wins then have a draw and fall out of the top four pretty quick. It’s packed in there and I think it will be until the end of the season.” The victory against Sean Dyche’s side followed the convincing 2-0 win over Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium in their previous league game. Wenger’s team can draw criticism for not always performing away from home and Cech pointed to how the display against Burnley could be vital. In the first half Dyche’s players dominated yet after the interval Arsenal proved their character by pinning Burnley back and taking the points. “It’s a big win – coming to the game we both had 22 points,” Cech said. “They’ve been playing particularly well, been very solid at home this season, only conceded two goals and they are well organised and very hard to break down at Turf Moor. We expected a difficult game, which it was, but I thought the second-half performance meant we deserved a little bit, even though we had to wait until the last minute to score the winning goal. “We said that we wanted to carry on with the big win at home against Tottenham and we needed to back it up. Apart from the Everton win away, a good result at Chelsea [draw], we haven’t been getting results away from home. But now we got a big win here and now hopefully we’ve turned the corner in terms of the away games and we need to carry on with our home form and if we can get as many away points as well then we will climb up the table.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/28/uk-cheapest-christmas-dinner-costs-18-percent-more-inflation-brexit-pound-supermarket-lidl","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T06:01:01Z","webTitle":"UK's cheapest Christmas dinner will cost 18% more than last year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/28/uk-cheapest-christmas-dinner-costs-18-percent-more-inflation-brexit-pound-supermarket-lidl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/28/uk-cheapest-christmas-dinner-costs-18-percent-more-inflation-brexit-pound-supermarket-lidl","fields":{"headline":"UK's cheapest Christmas dinner will cost 18% more than last year","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK’s cheapest supermarket Christmas dinner will cost 18% more than it did last year, as the impact of inflation and Brexit-related commodity costs makes its way to the festive family table. The annual yuletide food survey by Good Housekeeping magazine found that the cost of the cheapest set-piece meal on Christmas Day – for 8 people and including 11 ingredients from turkey to fresh vegetables and cranberry sauce – had risen from £19.82 to £23.53, or from £2.48 a head to £2.94. The Good Housekeeping basket comprises of a whole turkey weighing at least 3.5kg, at least 880g each of potatoes, sprouts, carrots and parsnips; stuffing mix; a jar of cranberry sauce; at least 900g of Christmas pudding, Christmas cake, at least eight mince pies and a jar of brandy butter. Nine of the 11 cheapest items cost more than last year, including turkey, which is now £8.99 from last year’s £8, and sage and onion stuffing mix, which has increased from 30p to 34p. Good Housekeeping said the increased cost was due to the pound’s fall since last year’s referendum, which has pushed up the cost of food imports, and an inflation rate that has hit 3%. “There’s been a significant rise in food prices across the board over the last year as a result of the weakening of the pound following the Brexit vote. Add to this inflation being stuck at a five-year high, and it’s no surprise to see the Christmas grocery bill has increased too,” said Caroline Bloor, Good Housekeeping’s consumer director. Overall, Lidl and Aldi have again trounced the competition, emerging as the cheapest supermarkets when it comes to the entire list on one place, with dinner for eight coming in at £25.53 and £25.68 respectively. Food prices generally had been tumbling in recent years as all the big supermarkets have had to react to the rise of the German discounters with aggressive price cutting. But the baskets from nine of the 10 supermarkets are more expensive than last year, with Aldi, Morrisons and Iceland all increasing their prices by more than 13%. Marks &amp; Spencer is the only supermarket whose basket is cheaper, 20% less at £38.43, but still the second priciest. The most expensive overall was Waitrose’s at £41.47. Kay Neufeld, an economist at economics consultancy the Cebr, said:“Prices have been on the rise since the EU referendum last year with inflation projected to peak just before Christmas. Due to intense competition between supermarkets in the UK, the cost of food had been falling for much of 2015 and 2016. However, as the UK imports over half of its food the depreciation of sterling inevitably feeds through into higher prices at the till. UK households will be relieved to know that inflationary pressures are expected to subside over 2018.” New data published this month by the Office for National Statistics showed food prices in October were up by 4.2% on 12 months earlier, a sharp rise on the 0.6% increase the previous year. The October increase was the highest since 2013 and prompted the British Retail Consortium to warn that consumers face the prospect of an expensive Christmas dinner this year. Among the sharpest price increases was an 8.5% rise in the price of fish, with vegetables up 5.7%, fats and oils up 5.6%, and milk, cheese and eggs up 4.8%.

At least six protesters were killed and 200 injured in Islamabad on Saturday when thousands of police officers unsuccessfully tried to disperse a three-week sit-in that had virtually paralysed the capital. Zahid Hamid’s resignation is the latest in a series of government concessions to religious extremists, who have been edging their way further into the political mainstream. Last week, a court in Lahore lifted the house arrest of Hafiz Saeed, a militant leader with a $10m (£7.5m) American bounty on his head for international terrorism, who heads a growing political movement and is fiercely opposed to India and western interference. “The decision to resign was taken in a bid to steer the country out of the prevailing critical situation,” Hamid said, according to a report in Pakistan’s Tribune newspaper. Observers said Monday’s deal could set a dangerous precedent. “Zealots have taken the law into their own hands. Mullahs can get up and ask for anyone’s resignation, so this is the death of rationality,” said Zahid Hussain, a political analyst. “This is complete surrender to hardline Islamists. It’s a sad day for Pakistan: it shows that the state is so weak, and that we can’t stand up to blackmailing.” Hussain also rebuked the army, which brokered the deal and has been criticised for its alleged proximity to extremist groups, for refusing to step in against the protesters, despite a request from the government. In the deal on Monday with Khadim Hussain Rizvi, who heads the Tehreek-e-Labbaik party, the government also agreed to release a report on an investigation into the alteration of an electoral oath declaring the prophet Muhammad as God’s final prophet. Protesters saw the change as appeasing a religious minority, the Ahmadis, who are officially deemed heretic. The government will also free and drop charges against detained protesters. In return, Rizvi agreed not to issue a fatwa against the minister, seemingly to dissuade attacks on his person. Blasphemy is already a capital offence in Pakistan, and serves as a rallying cry for Islamic extremist. Unfounded allegations regularly trigger mob attacks and lynching, which the government has been unable to prevent. The recent protests expose the fragility of the governing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party, which has been under increasing pressure since the disqualification of the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, in July over corruption allegations. The government has met fierce criticism for its handling of the recent crisis and its failure to uphold the rule of law and safety for citizens. “There is no reasonable set of circumstances in which a fledgling political party, no matter how aggrieved or agitated, could be allowed to not just hold the federal capital and the fourth most populous city of the country hostage, but also trigger protests across the country,” the Dawn newspaper wrote in an editorial. A spokesman for Tehreek-e-Labbaik said the demonstrators did not feel victorious. “It’s a sad day because dozens of our protesters have been martyred,” said the spokesman, Ejaz Ashrafi. However, the Benazir Bhutto hospital in Rawalpindi could only confirm it had received six bodies. A government minister, meanwhile, suggested the rallies had been planned by outsiders, without elaborating who might be behind them. “A great game is being played,” Mushahid Ullah Khan, minister for climate change who is part of the committee to investigate the electoral oath, told the Guardian. “Someone has manipulated this entire situation. Eventually we will find out who was behind this big game and what it was all about.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/27/jon-hendricks-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T15:03:31Z","webTitle":"Jon Hendricks obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/27/jon-hendricks-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/27/jon-hendricks-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Jon Hendricks obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When the singer Jon Hendricks declared, during a gig at the age of 80, that the next stop was 100, the likelihood of him getting there seemed almost self-evident. Back in 2002, as he bounded onstage at the Jazz Cafe, London, in a glittering gold suit, hat cocked over one eye, his yodelling, scatting, tone-bending reinvention of jazz classics by Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk or Count Basie sounded like the work of an indestructible musical force. Hendricks, who has died aged 96, was a funny, articulate and creatively intelligent master of a hard art, who took chances with vocal gymnastics and unpremeditated improv flights that few jazz singers had attempted or imagined before him, and he could mimic the sounds of instruments with uncanny fidelity. He was a model for some of the best male singers in jazz history, including Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, Mark Murphy and Kurt Elling, but Hendricks’ most lasting legacy was his expansion of the art of vocalese, the technique of fitting wittily hip lyrics to the melody lines of instrumental jazz themes and improvisations, as pioneered by the singers Eddie Jefferson and King Pleasure in the early 1950s. Some of the jazz cognoscenti disliked the style’s occasional invitation to technical tightrope-walking and showbiz bravura, but Hendricks was to give vocalese a global platform through his collaborations with Dave Lambert and Annie Ross in the vocal trio Lambert, Hendricks and Ross. Hendricks was born in Newark, Ohio, one of 15 children born to Alexander Hendricks, a minister of the African Methodist Episcopal church, and his wife, Willie Mae (nee Carrington), a choir leader. The boy first sang in public with the choir at his parents’ church, and on the family’s move to Toledo in 1935 he began singing on local radio, and working in the city’s Waiters and Bellmen’s Club with a sensational young pianist, Art Tatum, that the wider world was on the verge of discovering. After school, Tatum would give the boy informal music lessons – often playing him a dizzying improvised run and not letting him off the hook until he could flawlessly sing it back. Hendricks worked as a singer in Detroit in the 40s, and served in the US army following the Normandy landings – a traumatising experience for reasons other than combat, since the military police took to firing on him and other black servicemen for the suspicion they had consorted with French women. They went Awol to avoid their tormenters and were imprisoned for desertion. On his release at the war’s end, Hendricks continued to sing and play drums around Toledo, took an English literature course at the city’s university, and considered studying law. But in 1950, he met Charlie Parker at the Civic Auditorium in Toledo. His wife, Connie, asked the saxophone star if her shy young husband could sit in with him, and after their performance Parker reportedly told Hendricks to forget the law and come to New York. In 1952, Hendricks wrote some songs in New York for the “jump-music” star Louis Jordan (Jordan’s hit I Want You to Be My Baby was a Hendricks song), but struggled to make an impact as a singer. However, when he encountered Jefferson’s lyrics for the James Moody saxophone solo on Moody’s Mood For Love, Hendricks became fascinated by the possibilities that vocalese opened up, and the following year he began exploring them with Lambert. When Lambert suggested they should apply the technique to the much-loved riff-packed hits of Count Basie, Hendricks obliged with enough new lyrics for an album, originally built around the two singers, a rhythm section, and a vocal choir mimicking the big-band horns. But the chorus could not catch the supple magic of the Count Basie band sound, so Ross was brought in to coach it, on the strength of her own successful vocalese composition, Twisted – a witty 1952 take on psychoanalysis based on a Wardell Gray saxophone solo. But the music still did not work, until the impromptu trio of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross dispensed with the choir and performed all the vocals, with the big-ensemble feel captured by the experimental studio technique of overdubbing. “It was one of the greatest moments of my life when I heard those tapes back,” Ross told me in 1997. “I knew we had something incredible.” The results formed the hit album Sing a Song of Basie (1958), and the trio’s catchy collective-vocalese sound and canny jazz timing made them a popular draw. The group worked with Count Basie’s own band, lent their unique sound to Duke Ellington’s repertoire, and won a Grammy for their last album, High Flying (1962). Ross left in 1962 to be replaced by Yolande Bavan, and the new lineup continued until 1964. The prospect of further re-formations ended with Lambert’s death in a road accident in 1966. Hendricks had made his first album, A Good Git-Together, as a leader in 1959, and in 1963 he paid his respects to the bossa nova fashion of the time by writing classy lyrics to João Gilberto songs, most notably Chega de Saudade (No More Blues). He lived in London for five years from 1968, performing throughout Europe, appearing on TV, and in the British director John Jeremy’s film Jazz Is Our Religion (1972). On his homecoming – now to the west coast – he began a new career as a jazz journalist, and as a teacher of jazz history at the University of California and California State University. He wrote a stage show, Evolution of the Blues, which ran for five years in San Francisco, and revisited the Lambert, Hendricks and Ross agenda with Jon Hendricks &amp; Company – his second wife, Judith (nee Dickstein), was both performer and manager, and his daughters, Michelle and Aria, son Eric, and his gifted disciple McFerrin were members at various times. In 1986, Hendricks and McFerrin shared a Grammy for their contribution to an album, Vocalese, by their most successful vocal heirs The Manhattan Transfer, which received an almost unprecedented 12 Grammy nominations and won three. In 1988, Hendricks was a contributing lyricist to Carmen Sings Monk, Carmen McRae’s covers album. He was named an American Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1992, performed a series of reunion gigs with Ross, and in that decade also toured with Kurt Elling, Mark Murphy and Kevin Mahogany as the Four Brothers. In 1997 he joined the vocalists Cassandra Wilson and Miles Griffith in performances of Wynton Marsalis’ moving Pulitzer-prizewinning slave-story Blood on the Fields (in which he shrewdly and wittily played the griot-like sage Juba). He taught jazz singing at the University of Toledo from 2000 to 2015, and toured internationally with his own ensemble of Toledo students and local singers. In 2015 he reunited with Ross to record and perform at Birdland in New York. Hendricks’s final performance came at his 95th birthday celebration the following year at the Iridium jazz club in New York. This year, his lyrics to the score of the classic 1957 Miles Davis/Gil Evans album Miles Ahead were completed, and a recording of that project is currently in the pipeline. Judith died in 2015. Hendricks was predeceased by his son Eric and a daughter, Colleen, from his first marriage, to Connie (nee Moore), which ended in divorce. He is survived by the daughter, Aria, of his second marriage, a son, Jon, and daughter, Michelle, of his first marriage, and three grandchildren. • Jon Hendricks (John Carl Hendricks), jazz singer, born 16 September 1921; died 22 November 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27374","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T00:00:30Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,374","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27374","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27374","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,374","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/27/keir-starmer-make-funding-for-womens-refuges-mandatory","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T18:52:52Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer: make funding for women's refuges mandatory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/27/keir-starmer-make-funding-for-womens-refuges-mandatory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/27/keir-starmer-make-funding-for-womens-refuges-mandatory","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer: make funding for women's refuges mandatory","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Keir Starmer, the shadow cabinet member and former chief prosecutor, has called for mandatory funding for refuges amid criticism over a shake-up of funding for women’s services. Abuse survivors and charities have warned the lives of vulnerable women and children will be put at risk by government plans to remove refuges and other forms of short-term supported housing from the welfare system. On average, housing benefit makes up 53% of refuge funding and as there is no obligation for local authorities to fund refuges, is the last remaining guaranteed source of income. The plans have been met with fierce criticism and calls for the proposals to be overhauled. Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions (DPP) and shadow Brexit secretary, called for mandatory funding. The proposals would mean women fleeing abusive partners will not be able to pay for their accommodation using housing benefit, the last guaranteed source of income available to refuges. Instead of being able to use housing benefit to fund refuges, the government proposes handing a “ring-fenced” grant to councils for short-term supported housing. However, this does not exclusively cover refuges – it is also aimed at older people, homeless people, offenders, people with mental illnesses and drug addicts. Starmer was joined by a number of MPs in criticising the move. David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, told the Guardian: “We urgently need to save women’s refuges and other forms of supported housing that are reliant on housing benefit to stay open. “The government does not seem to understand that this is genuinely a matter of life and death and that refuges are a lifeline for those most in need. We will not let this happen without a fight. “In the last few years we have seen a number of proposals to change the funding and regulations governing the operation of supported housing, each of which have chipped away at these vital services. I am seeing the impact of this on the ground in my constituency surgeries and in the casework I am getting every week, and it is the same story right across the country”. Sophie Walker, the leader of the Women’s Equality Party, said: “The government must drop these shameful and damaging proposals as a matter of urgency. “Over the last seven years, specialist services for victims of domestic violence have been cut to the bone, and Women’s Aid are right to warn that it is a ‘matter of life and death’ for women and children. “Preventing housing benefit from being used to pay for refuges is the latest in a long line of policies that strip vulnerable people of support when they need it most. “Forcing refuges to compete with other, non-specialist, services for grants shows ministers have failed to take note of the damage already caused by the introduction of competitive tendering. “By bringing forward these plans now, in the midst of the Westminster sexual harassment scandal, the government has also made clear that it does not understand – or will not take the steps needed to address – the endemic power imbalance that drives inequality.” The document detailing the proposals, published in October, contains a caveat that funding for refuges will be looked at in November 2018, but provides no further details or reassurance. A government spokesperson said: “Until 2020, the government is providing £100m of dedicated funding for tackling violence against women and girls. This includes a £20m fund to support refuges and other accommodation-based services, providing 2,200 additional bed spaces. “We will publish a landmark draft Domestic Violence and Abuse Bill to protect and support victims, recognise the life-long impact domestic abuse has on children and make sure agencies effectively respond to domestic abuse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/27/cyber-monday-2017-all-the-best-uk-deals-in-one-list","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T17:25:06Z","webTitle":"Cyber Monday: the best UK deals in one list","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/27/cyber-monday-2017-all-the-best-uk-deals-in-one-list","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/27/cyber-monday-2017-all-the-best-uk-deals-in-one-list","fields":{"headline":"Cyber Monday: the best UK deals in one list","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s another retail milestone on the road to Christmas, and major brands are expecting bumper sales day on Cyber Monday, traditionally seen as one of the busiest online shopping days of the year, with online sales totalling £1.1bn last year.

Their latest project was a concert staging of Verdi’s final opera, which also formed part of the RLPO’s current artist residency, for the two performances featured Bryn Terfel as Falstaff. Rebecca Evans was Alice and Mark Stone Ford, while the other roles were taken by EOC young singers, with Vasily Petrenko conducting. It was a joyous, often exhilarating performance, but then it’s very hard for a performance of this, of all operas, not to be. The staging had been directed by Amy Lane, using modern dress and video projections of Windsor and the Thames to place the comedy firmly among the ladies who lunch in the present-day Thames Valley. The besuited Ford even took his liquid inducements to Falstaff in a Waitrose wine carrier, having doubtless taken up two spaces in the supermarket car park with his SUV when he bought them. Where Falstaff and his cronies fitted socially alongside the Fords and their friends wasn’t quite clear, but then this was a concert staging, so perhaps all the loose ends didn’t need to be tied up. Terfel’s performance was, I suspect, a compendium of what he has put into the role since he first sang it in 1999, with just a few bespoke additions. It’s the arthritic, alcoholic waddle that defines the character, which he sings now with perhaps slightly less richness and smoothness than he once did, but with magnificent attention to colour and nuance. Evans, soaring gloriously in the first-act ensembles, and Stone, building his jealous rage in the second to a scary climax, were the other experienced reference points. There was a splendidly taciturn Pistol from Lancelot Nomura and a suitably irritating Bardolph from Max Zander, while Anna Dowsley made the most of what little chances she got as Meg. Most striking of all was Wanda Franek’s Mistress Quickly, with a gorgeously dark mezzo sound and younger than she’s usually played, so that the dynamic of her exchanges with Falstaff gained a different tilt. None of them perhaps got as much support from Petrenko as they might have expected. The RLPO certainly played the wondrously inventive score with brilliance and dash, but not much affection; the warmth really came from Terfel and his colleagues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/nov/28/help-choose-an-overlooked-gem-from-2017-for-decembers-reading-group","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T12:00:04Z","webTitle":"Help choose an overlooked gem from 2017 for December's reading group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/nov/28/help-choose-an-overlooked-gem-from-2017-for-decembers-reading-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/nov/28/help-choose-an-overlooked-gem-from-2017-for-decembers-reading-group","fields":{"headline":"Help choose an overlooked gem from 2017 for December's reading group","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Has 2017 been a good year for literature? Time will be the ultimate judge, but sitting looking back over the past few months, it certainly feels like good things have been happening. I know I’ve read a few cracking novels. There was an especially fine Not the Booker prize shortlist, which is always a good sign. Elsewhere, I’ve loved books as diverse as Eley William’s surprising and bewildering Atrib. and John le Carré’s reassuringly excellent Legacy of Spies In fact, so many fine-looking books have arrived in 2017 that it’s been hard to keep up. If you are anything like me, you are probably feeling that you have missed as many gems as you have managed to read. So let’s use this month’s reading group as a chance to catch one of the gems we might have overlooked. Which book did you miss out on reading this year? What have we missed here at the Guardian? Which book have you had on your to-read pile and not quite reached? Have you loved a novel so much that you want to share it with everyone else? Have you been wondering if Jon McGregor’s Reservoir 13 is as good as everyone says it is? Have you been worrying that the Booker Prize judges got it wrong when they chose George Saunders’s Lincoln in the Bardo? Have you been worrying that they got it right, but that you still don’t know what the book is about? Do you have a gorgeous book from a small press that you think we should know about? Would you just really like to kick back and indulge yourself with Cressida Cowell’s magical Wizards Of Once? Have you been thinking that not enough people know about Carlos Fonesca’s Colonel Lágrimas yet? Have you felt left out as everyone else has been enjoying he Philip Pullman’s La Belle Sauvage? Now is your time to help plug those gaps. We ask only that the book is widely available, was published in the last year and that reading it will make us all feel good. It would also be great if you could provide a few words about why you want to read the book – or why you think everyone else should.

The woman, who worked in the film industry and who wishes to remain anonymous, is represented by a prominent London lawyer, Jill Greenfield, who has previously won significant damages for a client in a civil rape claim. Greenfield, who specialises in personal injury, expects the claim to escalate into a group action as Weinstein is facing multiple sexual assault accusations from women on both sides of the Atlantic. He denies any allegations of non-consensual sex. The claim has been made against Weinstein, the Weinstein Company UK Ltd and the Weinstein Company LLC in the US at the high court and is listed as damages for personal injury, expenses, consequential loss including aggravated and exemplary damages and interest arising out of a series of sexual assaults inflicted on the claimant by the defendant. It also includes a claim against the UK and US companies as liable as employers of the defendant. The claim is expected to exceed £300,000. Greenfield, who was instructed by her client less than a month ago, said she had had to act swiftly to protect her client’s ability to bring a claim so many years after the assault. She previously revealed her intention to lodge the claim in an interview with the Guardian. Scotland Yard has said it is investigating allegations made last month by seven women against Weinstein, some dating back to the 1980s. The woman in the latest claim has not yet made a complaint to the police but is expected to do so. She is said to remain traumatised by the attacks, which allegedly took place after 2000, and has not discussed them with her family. In criminal courts, the prosecution has to prove the charges of sexual assault or any other offence to the standard of beyond all reasonable doubt. In civil cases, it is a matter of proving it on the balance of probabilities. A spokesperson for Weinstein in the US told the Guardian: “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein. Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. “Mr Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/27/prince-harry-to-marry-meghan-markle","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T20:29:49Z","webTitle":"Prince Harry 'thrilled' after announcing he is to marry Meghan Markle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/prince-harry-to-marry-meghan-markle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/prince-harry-to-marry-meghan-markle","fields":{"headline":"Prince Harry 'thrilled' after announcing he is to marry Meghan Markle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are to marry in the spring after announcing their engagement and admitting they were “totally unprepared” for the media storm that surrounded the first months of their relationship. The prince said he was “thrilled” to be marrying the US actor after an 18-month romance, and the couple presented themselves to the world with a photocall and 20-minute television interview at Kensington Palace. On Tuesday, Palace aides are expected to announce the venue for the wedding and details of the first royal engagements that Markle will undertake with the prince as she is quickly assimilated into the royal household. In the TV interview, conducted by Mishal Husain, they revealed how the prince proposed to his future bride at his Nottingham Cottage home in the grounds of Kensington Palace on what was “a standard typical night in for us” while they were roasting a chicken for dinner. Markle said it was “just an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee ... I could barely let you finish proposing. I said, ‘can I say yes now?’” Markle, whose mother is African American and father is white, also described as “disheartening” and “discriminatory” some of the media coverage she received as Prince Harry’s girlfriend because it centred on her racial background. Markle admitted that even though she had starred in TV drama Suits, the media coverage had been a learning curve and said, “I did not have any understanding of what it would be like.” That coverage forced the prince to take the rare step last year of publicly attacking the British press for introducing “racial overtones” into the reporting of their relationship. Among the headlines that were believed to have angered the palace was one on Mailonline.com that read: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton”, referring to the city in Los Angeles that has become known for gang violence. The announcement of their engagement was made by Clarence House on behalf of Prince Charles earlier on Monday. Later, the Prince of Wales, speaking for himself and the Duchess of Cornwall, said: “We’re both thrilled. We hope they’ll be very happy indeed.” Prince Harry said he designed her engagement ring himself using a stone sourced from Botswana, where the couple went camping in the first weeks of their relationship, and two smaller gems from Princess Diana’s jewellery collection “to make sure that she’s with us on this crazy journey together”. Markles parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland, said: “We are incredibly happy for Meghan and Harry. Our daughter has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents. We wish them a lifetime of happiness and are very excited for their future together.” Thomas Markle is an Emmy award-winning former television lighting director who worked on shows including Married With Children and General Hospital. He married Ragland, a yoga instructor, in 1979 and they divorced in 1988. The Queen, Prince Philip, prime minister Theresa May, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among others who offered their congratulations. Downing Street moved quickly to dampen speculation that there would be a bank holiday to celebrate the wedding. The prime minister’s spokesman said: “There are no plans for a bank holiday. There isn’t precedent in this area. There was no bank holiday for Prince Andrew’s wedding in 1986 or Prince Edward’s in 1999.” However, the wedding of Princess Anne, the Queen’s second-eldest child, and Mark Phillips in 1973 was marked by a bank holiday. The wedding ceremony is likely to be conducted by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who said he was delighted by the news and had been impressed by the prince’s “immense love for his family”. A royal source said it would be “a happy church wedding”, although the date is yet to be fixed. The Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth to her third child in April. Locals in the View Park-Windsor Hills suburb of Los Angeles where Ragland lives were also upbeat. Mike Young, 56, out walking his pitbull Tipper, said: “I think they’re a respectable family,” he said, referring to the Windsors. “I’d be excited to meet Prince Harry.” The couple said they were set up by a friend on a blind date and about a month after two dates in London in summer 2016 they went camping in Botswana. “I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana,” the prince said. “And we camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic.“It was hugely refreshing to be able to get to know someone who isn’t necessarily within your circle, doesn’t know much about me, I don’t know much about her. So to be able to start almost afresh, right from the beginning, getting to know each other, step by step and then taking that huge leap of only two dates and then going effectively on holiday together in the middle of nowhere and you know sharing a tent together and all that kind of stuff. It was fantastic.” He added that he thought Markle and Diana would be “as thick as thieves, without question, I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, you know so excited for me. It is days like today when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news.” Republic, the anti-monarchy campaign for an elected head of state, issued a one word statement: “Congratulations”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/27/football-transfer-rumours-luke-shaw-to-leave-manchester-united-for-newcastle","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T09:09:13Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Luke Shaw to leave Manchester United for Newcastle?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/27/football-transfer-rumours-luke-shaw-to-leave-manchester-united-for-newcastle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/27/football-transfer-rumours-luke-shaw-to-leave-manchester-united-for-newcastle","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Luke Shaw to leave Manchester United for Newcastle?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Following a weekend in which a Twitter spat involving self promotion’s Piers Morgan, scared popster Olly Murs, his waspish fellow crooner James Blunt, the real Toni Kroos and somebody masquerading as Kolo Touré was a surreal highlight, the Rumour Mill finds itself increasingly less sure what to believe anymore. Is Luke Shaw going on loan to Newcastle? The Mirror certainly seems to think so. Rafael Benítez is understood to be interested in ending the full-back’s Manchester United purgatory by bringing him to St James’ Park and José Mourinho should sanction a loan move. Such a move would free up a dressing room peg and car-park space for Atlético Madrid central defender José Giménez, a 22-year-old Uruguayan who is wanted by the Manchester United. Juventus are also interested in bringing Giménez, to Turin and Atletico will sell to the highest bidders. United may also have a fight on their hands to hold on to Anthony Martial, with Real Madrid believed to be lining up a summer bid of £80m bid for the 21-year-old. Out of sorts midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan may also be on his way out of Old Trafford if reports that Borussia Dortmund are interested in taking him back are to be believed. A summer target of Barcelona, Real Sociedad central defender Iñigo Martínez is now wanted by Manchester City. Barca made three separate approaches for the 26-year-old last August, before deciding against paying his €32m release clause and he has been monitored by City scouts in recent months. Elsewhere in Spain, Atlético Madrid are hitching their skirts in the direction of Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Javier Pastore, but will have to fend off interest from Inter to get him. Eric Cantona has also urged Manchester United to come in for the PSG outcast. Pastore’s current employers remain interested in bringing Alexis Sánchez to the French capital and the Mirror say they’ve edged ahead of City in the tedious ongoing race to secure the Chilean’s services. Julian Draxler is another player who looks likely to end his association with PSG sooner rather than later and is being tipped with either a return to his native Germany or a move to Liverpool or Arsenal. The Gunners also remain interested in Monaco and France midfielder Thomas Lemar and will try to lure him to the Emirates again following the failure of their €90m August deadline day bid. In managerial news, Martin O’Neill has emerged as the surprise favourite to sort out the mess at Everton. The 65-year-old has been in charge of Ireland since 2013 and has agreed a new deal with the Football Association of Ireland. With the feeling in Ireland being that he has perhaps taken the team as far as they can go under him after their failure to qualify for the World Cup, he could almost certainly take the Everton job with the nation’s blessing. Meanwhile at the Hawthorns, Alan Pardew looks likely to succeed Tony Pulis. And in news that suggests they may not realise Tony Pulis and Alan Pardew are currently available, Borussia Dortmund are not going to fire their under-fire and beleaguered manager Peter Bosz, because they can’t think of anyone better to replace him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/27/romanians-protest-against-weakening-of-anti-corruption-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T12:40:54Z","webTitle":"Romanians protest against weakening of anti-corruption powers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/27/romanians-protest-against-weakening-of-anti-corruption-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/27/romanians-protest-against-weakening-of-anti-corruption-powers","fields":{"headline":"Romanians protest against weakening of anti-corruption powers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Romania’s centre-left coalition government is bracing itself for rolling demonstrations by tens of thousands of protesters over claims that it wants to overhaul the justice system to allow high-level corruption to go unpunished. Citizens demanding “rights and prosperity” marched through Bucharest and other cities on Sunday evening. A second demonstration is planned for Friday, Grand Union Day, a national public holiday marking the unifying of Romania’s ethnic minorities. A call has gone out on social media for protesters to congregate at Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, in an escalation of one of the most significant crises in the country since the fall of the communist regime. A joint statement by about 40 civil society groups and two trade union federations behind the protests claimed Romania had been “taken over by a political mafia”. The government’s attempts to reform the organisations at the forefront of Romania’s attempts to tackle corruption have been beset by claims at home and abroad that it is seeking to protect senior figures from justice. In February a decree that would have shielded dozens of public officials from prosecution sparked the biggest street protests in the country since the 1989 Christmas revolution toppled the communist dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu. The decree was rescinded after two weeks of daily demonstrations. The minister for justice, Florin Iordache, resigned, only to be later appointed to head a special parliamentary commission driving new legislative changes. The government’s opponents claim that under the draft laws now being considered in parliament, the powers of the respected anti-corruption directorate, the DNA, would be reduced, with the justice ministry able to name head prosecutors. The judicial inspection body that investigates the work of judges would also come under the control of the minister of justice. A new structure staffed by prosecutors is being devised to investigate criminal acts committed by magistrates. Iordache’s special parliamentary commission started considering the laws last week and continued its deliberations on Monday. The government aims to have them approved by the end of the year, in what critics say is unseemly haste. The proposed reforms are particularly incendiary as they come at the same time as changes to the tax system, moving responsibility for social security payments from the employer to the employee. The Romanian government is a coalition between the Social Democrat party (PSD), which has been criticised for harbouring former figures from the communist regime, along with the centre-right Liberal-Democrat Alliance and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania. An annual report published by the European commission this month said justice reform had stagnated in Romania this year and challenges to judicial independence remained a persistent source of concern. It noted the increased prevalence of criticism of the judiciary and the need for the government to “discourage behaviour which amounts to open challenges to the independence of justice and the authority of court decisions”. On Sunday evening, a traditional time for protest in Romania, an estimated 30,000 people marched to parliament in Bucharest, while roughly 20,000 held rallies in about 70 cities across the country. Protesters shouting “Thieves” and “We want justice not corruption” briefly scuffled with mounted police in Bucharest and blew whistles as they marched. Monica Macovei, a former justice minister from the centre-right European Conservatives and Reformists group, said: “There will be more protests. There is no need to change the laws on the judiciary. “This coalition wants to stop the fight of the judiciary against corruption. It is time for the EU to send a very, very strong message because despite the report by the European commission the government is carrying on and judicial independence is in danger. The pan-European groups in the European parliament should also expel these parties. It should not be the people of Romania who suffer.” In the last decade, Romanian prosecutors have investigated hundreds of public officials, including former prime ministers, over allegations of corruption. This month prosecutors froze personal assets belonging to the leader of the PSD, Liviu Dragnea, as part of an investigation into suspected theft of cash from state projects, some of them EU-funded. The European Anti-Fraud Office says the money was fraudulently paid to officials and others from the European Regional Development Fund for road construction in Romania. It asked the Romanian government to recover the funds. Dragnea denies wrongdoing and has appealed against the ruling to freeze his assets. He is unable to be prime minister because of a 2016 conviction for vote-rigging. Corruption experts say there are some positive aspects to the proposed reforms, including greater transparency and parliamentary scrutiny of the work of the secret services."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27372","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T00:00:01Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,372","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27372","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27372","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,372","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/nov/27/the-big-name-tv-chefs-are-back-are-any-of-them-cooking-with-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T15:51:41Z","webTitle":"The big name TV chefs are back – are any of them cooking with gas?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/nov/27/the-big-name-tv-chefs-are-back-are-any-of-them-cooking-with-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/nov/27/the-big-name-tv-chefs-are-back-are-any-of-them-cooking-with-gas","fields":{"headline":"The big name TV chefs are back – are any of them cooking with gas?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For a while, the cookery show was on the ropes. The entire form had started to eat itself, with an endless parade of identical nobodies cooking identical recipes in front of identical soft-focus fairy lights, identically soundtracked by someone whose music collection consisted of 10 copies of Back to Black: The Instrumentals. But no more! Suddenly there has been a resurgence of the big beasts. Stick a pin anywhere in the terrestrial schedules at the moment and you’re likely to find an A-list celebrity chef roaring out of the woodwork to show these anaemic youngsters what they’re missing. Jamie’s there. Nigella’s there. Rick’s there. Paul and Mary are both there, snarling at each other across the channels like a pair of scorned ex-lovers. But life is full and nobody has time to watch them all, so here’s a quick ranking of all the big cookery shows, ordered from worst to best. 5. Jamie and Jimmy’s Friday Night Feast, Channel 4 Are you an absolute lad? Do you enjoy legendary bantz? Do you tend to greet things by bellowing “woy-oy” at the sky? Then you’ll love Jamie and Jimmy’s Friday Night Feast, a sort of witless culinary Top Gear that nobody watches because it’s on when its target audience is busy pre-gaming for a big night out. Or maybe nobody watches it because sitting through a single episode is like being pinned down and forcibly injected with a concentrated dose of Jamie Oliver’s worst impulses. Nobody even knows why Jamie and Jimmy’s Friday Night Feast is even a thing. The assumption is that Jamie’s farmer friend forced him into making it via some sort of elaborate blackmail scheme, but that’s pure conjecture at this point. 4. Mary Berry’s Country House Secrets, BBC One In Mary Berry’s Country House Secrets, Berry interminably stalks around some National Trust property or other before going into its kitchen and whipping up an anonymous puddle of flaccid beige-grey pre-metric almost-food. I have never felt the last vestiges of life drain from my body while trapped at the bottom of a well, but I imagine that watching Mary Berry’s Country House Secrets is a close enough comparison. 3. Paul Hollywood: A Baker’s Life, Channel 4 This, you have to admit, is not particularly well timed. Hollywood’s image has taken a battering over the last year, from his eagerness to ditch the rest of the GBBO gang and hop channels to the recent break-up of his marriage via his pathological midlife infatuation with big red cars. Ideally, now is not the time to air the “I’m just a humble baker, welcome to my story” series he presumably got handed as a sweetener for staying with Bake Off. And that’s a shame because it isn’t bad. Once you cut away all the nonsense, Hollywood remains a skilled baker and a decent communicator, and this show would be incredibly watchable if it came at a time when he wasn’t largely perceived as the swaggering poster boy for obnoxious bellendry. 2. Rick Stein’s Road to Mexico, BBC Two Usually, this would be flat last. Usually, Rick Stein’s culinary travelogues are unbearable because all he ever does is visit a well-known tourist trap, patronise the locals senseless and then complain because Britain doesn’t have the exact same customs as wherever he happens to be. However – and this might be down to his age, or down to my own ludicrous tendency to project – Road to Mexico is actually quite sweet. Stein seems less like an ugly foreigner here and more a man slightly adrift in the world. When he talks about visiting San Francisco after the summer of love because he heard a radio discussion about burritos, or when he says “no problemo” immediately after arriving in Mexico, his benign Alan Partridge tendencies come into focus like never before. It absolutely isn’t perfect, but it’s an improvement. 1. Nigella Lawson: At My Table, BBC Two At My Table isn’t just a good Nigella Lawson series; I’d argue it’s the defining Nigella Lawson series. She has been on television for almost 20 years, and now she has relaxed into herself like never before. She’s no longer constrained by the infantilising “totty” tag that followed her around for years, plus she has given up her irksome tendency to look normal by riding around on a hired bus full of extras. Now she’s free to be who you suspect she’s always been; a dotty posho who is just as likely to plonk herself on the stairs in her nightie and tell you some mad story about something a woman screamed at her in hospital as cook any actual food. This new persona suits her. I hope it stays."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/27/pope-lands-in-myanmar-for-difficult-visit-amid-rohingya-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T18:10:58Z","webTitle":"Pope told by army chief: there is 'no religious discrimination' in Myanmar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/27/pope-lands-in-myanmar-for-difficult-visit-amid-rohingya-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/27/pope-lands-in-myanmar-for-difficult-visit-amid-rohingya-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Pope told by army chief: there is 'no religious discrimination' in Myanmar","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Myanmar’s powerful army chief has told Pope Francis there is “no religious discrimination” in the country during talks at the start of the pontiff’s delicate visit to the majority-Buddhist nation that has been accused of “ethnic cleansing” against its Muslim Rohingya people. Thousands of Catholics welcomed Pope Francis to the country’s capital, Naypyidaw, where he arrived for a three-day visit to Myanmar on Monday. The trip – fraught with sensitivity and trepidation over how he will deal with the plight of the Muslim Rohingya – could be the trickiest yet of his papacy. The army chief told the pope that “Myanmar has no religious discrimination at all. Likewise our military too ... performs for the peace and stability of the country”, according to a Facebook post published by the general’s office a few hours after the meeting. There is also “no discrimination between ethnic groups in Myanmar”, he added. The Vatican said the meeting with General Min Aung Hlaing and three officials from Myanmar’s bureau of special operations took place on Monday evening at the residence of the Myanmar archbishop and lasted about 15 minutes. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke didn’t provide details of the private meeting other than to say that “they spoke of the great responsibility of the authorities of the country in this moment of transition”. Min Aung Hlaing is in charge of military operations in Rakhine state, where security forces have launched a scorched earth campaign against Rohingya Muslims that has forced more than 620,000 to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh in what the UN said is a campaign of “ethnic cleansing”. Francis’s meeting with the commander had been scheduled for Wednesday morning, but was moved up to just a few hours after he landed in Naypyidaw. He is scheduled to meet the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, in the coming days. After touching down on Monday afternoon, the pope was greeted by a large crowd at the airport, many waving yellow and white Vatican flags and dressed in T-shirts bearing the slogan of the trip, “Love and Peace”. As he drove past, they screamed and chanted “We love Papa”. But the head of the Catholic church faces a difficult diplomatic balancing act on his first papal visit to Myanmar. Even mentioning the word “Rohingya” would set off a firestorm in the Buddhist-majority country, where the military and government revile the minority group, preferring to call them “Bengalis”, which suggests they are immigrants. Many civilians, fleeing an army campaign, arrived with bullet wounds and claimed their homes had been razed. The operation followed an attack on security posts on 25 August by Rohingya militants, who the government said are responsible for abuses. The army has also absolved itself of wrongdoing. The pope has already spoken about the Rohingya in two appeals from the Vatican this year, including calling them “our Rohingya brothers and sisters”. He will be staying with Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, archbishop of Naypyidaw, who has advised Francis not to use the word. “We have asked him at least to refrain from using the word ‘Rohingya’ because this word is very much contested and not acceptable by the military, nor the government, nor the people in Myanmar,” Bo said this month. Burke said the pope had taken the advice he had been given seriously, but added: “We will find out together during the trip … it is not a forbidden word.” The country of 51 million people includes about 650,000 Catholics, of whom about 150,000 were expected to travel to the commercial capital for the papal visit. Trains have been hired to take Christians living in northern Kachin state on the two-day journey. Among the crowd at the airport, one man, who asked not to be named, said he hoped Francis would not wade into the crisis. “He’s not a politician,” he said. “He doesn’t come here to physically get involved in this thing … At the moment we are trying to build our democratic country. There should not be so much pressure on us. It’s not fair,” he said. Another Catholic at the terminal said the issue should not be ignored. “I think he should speak about it. Because he is a leader of the Catholics as well he has some moral status. I hope he will speak about it. He will bring peace to us,” said Raj Robin, who had just arrived back from a trip to India. Full diplomatic ties were established between the Vatican and Myanmar in May during a visit by Aung San Suu Kyi, a winner of the Nobel peace prize, whose global image has now been tarnished by the bloodshed. Following his visit to Myanmar, Francis will travel to Bangladesh to meet Rohingya refugees.

Dollar weakness lifting the euro and the pound has hit the main European markets, while Wall Street is benefiting from the currency movements and investor hopes that the Republicans are making progress with their tax returns. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 25.74 points or 0.35% lower at 7383.90 Germany’s Dax dipped 0.46% to 13,000.20 France’s Cac closed down 0.56% at 5360.09 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 22,176.70 But Spain’s Ibex edged up 0.1% to 10,063.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.17% to 724.39 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 26 points or 0.11%. And bitcoin is 2.5% better at $9509. On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Oil is on the slide ahead of this Thursday’s meeting of Opec, despite talk that the producers will extend their output cut to try and curb oversupply and protect the price. David Madden at CMC Markets says: WTI and Brent Crude oil are in the red today after having a positive run recently ahead of the OPEC meeting on Thursday. There is speculation that major oil producers will extend the oil production cut until the end of 2018. Some dealers feel a lot of that is already priced in and are exiting their long positions ahead of the meeting in Vienna. The US shale producers will be paying close attention to OPEC’s decision, as a surge in the energy market could prompt higher production in the shale sector – which could counteract OPEC’s decision. Brent crude is currently down 0.8% at $63.33 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 2% lower at $57.7. Bitcoin, by the way, is currently up 4% at $9647, although down from its earlier peak of $9721. More on the markets. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Another day, another record high in the Dow Jones, which is playing catch-up with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq after those indices hit fresh records last week. Risk appetite remains healthy in the US but subdued in the UK and Europe, and once again it is strength in the home currencies arising from dollar weakness that is helping to stifle what looked like a strong session earlier in the day. The other big worry, particularly for the FTSE 100’s mining contingent, is a notable tightening of financial conditions in China; while rising bond yields might not seem like a reason to worry, a hit to corporate profits could feed through to the broader economy and thus raise questions about demand for raw materials in 2018. The great mining rally has recovered from its wobble in the first half of the year, but assuming demand remains healthy this weakness could be a chance to pick up some big miners on the cheap. US stocks are back to normal today, with the recovery from Thanksgiving overindulgence complete. Tax reform looks a bit less of a done deal today, and it is strange to see the market so blissfully unconcerned. Perhaps it is the thought of a festive rally into year-end that is keeping them stable, or perhaps they’re hoping Mr Trump will pull a rabbit out of the hat. Either way, as we head into the final month of the year a sudden pullback due to tax reform worries offers the dip-buyers their best hope. Earlier the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane gave a speech at a Birmingham school about the importance of economics to the general public: European markets have not been able to keep pace with their US counterparts, and are marginally in the red as we head towards the last hour or so of trading. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Monday’s been a pretty scatty, aimless day of trading, with the European indices reversing their lunchtime reversal. Once again the FTSE finds itself back below 7400, falling 20 points having been up by that same amount at midday (and having been down by that same amount just after the bell). The pound’s 0.1% rise against both the dollar and the euro likely didn’t help, with cable briefly striking a fresh 8 week peak. However the brunt of the FTSE’s decline appears to be coming from the commodity and banking sectors. BP and Shell haven fallen 0.9% apiece as Brent Crude slipped around 1% as it eyes Wednesday’s OPEC meeting, with the miners stranded in a sea of red. The smattering of losses coating the likes of Barclays, Lloyds and RBS, meanwhile, comes ahead of tomorrow’s stress test results. In the Eurozone the DAX and CAX followed the same pattern as the FTSE, flitting in and out of the red before settling at a loss this afternoon. The German index is down 0.1% despite signs of political progress in Germany, while its French peer fell 0.2%. As for the Dow Jones, it surged 0.3% this Cyber Monday, crossing 23600 to hit a brand spanking new all-time peak. For those keeping track, the index has rocketed nearly 20% higher since the start of the year (it’s even more if you trace its rise back to Trump’s election). Following the strong US housing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved sharply higher and has now also hit a new peak. It is now up 0.3% at 23,628. Some strong housing data from the US. New home sales jumped 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 in October, the highest level in ten years. New home sales have increased for three straight months, although September’s figures was revised down from 667,000 to 645,000. Economists had been expected sales to fall 6% to 625,000 in October. No comment: Another day and more records for US markets. Helped by gains for retail shares on Cyber Monday, the S&amp;P 500 has edged up to a new peak of 2604, while the Nasdaq Composite is at a record 6890. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is below the heights reached last week but is still up 0.13% on the day at 23,587. Back with non-cryptocurrencies, and the dollar is slipping back on suggestions that a US rate hike in December may be the last for a while, given last week’s Federal Reserve minutes showed some reluctance to push borrowing costs too high. So the pound has added 0.3% against the US currency to $1.3382, an eight week high. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said of the dollar: While a December rate move remains a done deal in the eyes of the markets, it’s what comes after that which is becoming less clear. There were positive views about the jobs market as well as general economic activity across the board, but there were diverging views about the lack of inflation, and it is this uncertainty about US rate policy in 2018 which continues to undermine the currency against the backdrop of a flattening yield curve. Back in the world of shopping, and US retail companies are seeing share price gains in premarket trading, following Black Friday and during Cyber Monday. JC Penney is up 1.8%, Target is 1% better, Macy’s is 1.1% better and the unstoppable Amazon has added 0.5%. What do central banks think of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bloomberg has done a roundup of views: Eight years since the birth of bitcoin, central banks around the world are increasingly recognizing the potential upsides and downsides of digital currencies. The guardians of the global economy have two sets of issues to address. First is what to do, if anything, about emergence and growth of the private cryptocurrencies that are grabbing more and more attention -- with bitcoin now surging toward $10,000. The second question is whether to issue official versions. The reaction is mixed, with some warning of the dangers while others - including the Bank of England’s Mark Carney - seeing it as a potential revolution. The full report is here. European stock markets are subdued today, following the selloff in China overnight. Britain’s FTSE 100, the German DAX and the French CAC are all down by between 0.1 and 0.3%, as the pound and the euro gain against the US dollar. Rebecca O’Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: European markets are tracking Asia lower, as fears grow that Chinese equities could be starting one of their downward legs, which may cause fright for global investors. Chinese equity markets are notorious for delivering a volatile ride for investors, who have become used to boom and bust periods. The China effect is especially significant for commodity markets and by extension the metal and oil heavy FTSE 100. Investors are also looking for signs of progress in Germany, now that the centre-left SPD party is prepared to consider another coalition with Angela Merkel. After its early morning jump, bitcoin is currently bobbing around the $9,600 mark. That leaves the $10,000 milestone firmly in its sights. And some in the industry reckon this could lure more people into buying digital currencies. Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin Ltd, told Bloomberg: “The weekend’s bitcoin price hike is just the continuation of a long-term bull run on the cryptocurrency, fueled by the tsunami of speculative trading on Japanese exchanges and the entrance of institutional investors across the world. It is more likely that the $10,000 psychological stratosphere will push more institutional investors into the mix.” Alternatively, Bitcoin’s rapid ascent might force financial authorities and central banks to rethink their current policy of waiting to see how digital currencies evolve. In recent months we’ve seen a boom in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), in which new cryptocurrencies are launched into the market - often backed by a celebrity (yes you, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather). ICOs are already under serious scrutiny, due to fears that investor aren’t properly protected. David Futter, fintech partner at law firm Ashurst, predicts that scrutiny will intensify. In the shorter-term regulatory scrutiny will continue to fall on ICOs and the benefits of adapting the existing financial regulation around investments, payments and e-money to drive even more competition while protecting consumers. “Regulators know the rewards of cryptocurrency and blockchain could be huge, but have more than one eye on the catastrophic ramifications if good governance, stability and control are not preserved. If the carrot of self-regulation proves insufficient, the regulators will not hesitate to use their stick.” Now here’s a thing. Bitcoin’s “mining” network uses more electricity in a year than 19 European countries, including Ireland, according to statistics released this morning. That power consumption is the cost of verifying transactions made using bitcoins, as our technology writer Alex Hern explains: At a continual power drain of 3.4GW, it means the network consumes five times more electricity than is produced by the largest wind farm in Europe, the London Array in the outer Thames Estuary, at 630MW.... The astronomical power draw is a facet of how the bitcoin network protects itself against fraud. With no centralised authority confirming transactions, bitcoin is instead backed by “miners”, who put specialised computers to work churning through extremely power-intensive computing problems. Solving those problems both rewards the miner, handing them almost a quarter of a million dollars in bitcoin, and verifies all transactions made in the last 10 minutes. More here: Here’s our news story on Bitcoin’s rally: Speaking of those stress tests, here’s a video explaining how Britain’s banks have been put under the microscope. Tomorrow is a big day for Britain’s banking sector. At 7am, the Bank of England will publish the results of this year’s bank stress tests. They will assess whether UK lenders have enough capital to cope with a sterling crisis, a recession, and a housing market crash. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The Bank of England is to reveal the damage inflicted on the UK’s biggest lenders from £30bn of hypothetical consumer loan losses, an economic downturn and a collapse in the pound. Threadneedle Street’s latest health check on the sector – the first was conducted in 2014 – could have an impact on a bank’s ability to pay dividends and on its business models. The lenders could be forced to sell off assets or ask existing shareholders and bondholders for more cash if they fail the tests based on hypothetical scenarios intended to put the sector under severe stress. You can get up to speed with Jill’s preview, here: Bitcoin’s rapid ascent towards $10,000 could spur some investors to cash in their gains, suggests the analyst team at FXPro. They write: Currently, the market is anticipating that Bitcoin will reach $10K, with the lack of warning signals down to the lack of any doubts regarding further growth. It begins to seem that big businesses intended to profit from it. If this happens, there is a huge risk that big players start taking profit, with news provoking panic and sell-off. The cryptocurrency market currently seems like a playground for Wall Street tycoons, with JP Morgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon ‘looking at business opportunities in the planned Bitcoin-futures market’, albeit having labelled Bitcoin ‘a fraud’ just two months ago. Once speculation is over, it is very likely that only the real business model projects will remain, such as logistics companies, accountancy or statistics firms reliant on blockchain. There are roughly 16.7 million bitcoins in circulation - that’s the number mined using special software and hardware. Those coins are now worth $160bn in total (if you accept that a currency can have its own market capitalisation), more than some of the world’s major companies. Mike’s got a point... Tarzan* has swung into the debate on Britain’s industrial strategy! Lord Heseltine, former UK deputy prime minister, has argued that the best thing for British business would be to cancel Brexit, rather than Heseltine says it’s simply implausible to expect firms to commit fresh investment while Britain’s future is unclear: Our country is facing years of stagnation, and what is a principal cause of that? It’s that anyone who has got to take an investment decision today is saying, ‘Well how do I know what to invest in? What’s going to happen about Britain and its biggest market of Europe?’ and so they’re hesitating. Whether they’re British companies or overseas companies investing here, they’re hesitating. And as long as we have this Brexit shadow going over us, that will remain. And what do we get in the Budget? A £3bn bill in order to prepare for this Brexit disaster. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: * - a reference to Lord Heseltine’s impressive mane and exuberant approach to politics (some readers may remember his antics with the House of Commons mace in 1976) This chart, from Bloomberg, shows how bitcoin has soared this year: Some analysts say it looks like an unsustainable bubble. But Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, reckons bitcoin will keep rising as more individuals and investors jump on board. From a fundamental perspective it is still almost impossible to give the cryptocurrency a fair value, however, there has been a strong correlation between the price of Bitcoin and number of users opening new wallets. It is not just retail investors showing interest in the cryptocurrency, but many hedge funds have decided to join the party recently by including Bitcoins in their portfolios. Given that number of users haven’t exceeded 0.1% of the global population, there’s still more potential for this momentum trade to continue. Whether the price will be justified in the foreseeable future, depends on the adoption and the application of the new currency, but so far it still looks unstoppable. Bitcoin’s rally is partly due to the established financial world taking cryptocurrencies more seriously. Last month, derivatives marketplace CME Group announced it will start offering Bitcoin futures in December - letting investors trade Bitcoin without actually buying it. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says this was a key moment: CME’s decision to launch bitcoin futures in December has undoubtedly fuelled buying. BTC is up more than 50% since the decision was announced on October 31st. The legitimacy this gives Bitcoin as a tradeable asset is very important. The market cap of Bitcoin now exceeds that of IBM, Disney and McDonald’s. But traditional investors still find Bitcoin’s rally baffling, with many predicting that it will end in tears. As Wilson puts it: Rather than a commodity or currency, Bitcoin is like owning stock in a company that will only ever issue 21 million shares and never pay a penny in dividends. The only way it has value is if the next guy is willing to pay you more for it – the greater fool. With no intrinsic value to Bitcoin, it’s hard to see this as anything other than a giant speculative bubble.” Chinese stocks may be sinking, but Bitcoin is on a tear (again) this morning. The crypto currency has hit a fresh record high of $9,600 this morning, putting the $10,000 mark within its sights. It’s quite a rally - Bitcoin started 2017 at just $1,000, before smashing a series of milestones with remarkable speed. Bullish Chinese investors capitulated this morning, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. He writes: China equities are turning lower again, led by financials. This is driven by concerns about rising yields (multi-year highs) amid a bond market sell-off that is likely to raise re-financing costs in an already over leveraged economy, putting pressure on both corporates and consumers, reviving the China credit bubble story. Chinese stocks have hit this lowest level since the summer, as a government crackdown on risky lending spooks investors. The Shanghai composite index fell almost 1% to 3,322 points, the lowest level since 25th August. Traders said jitters in the bond market are hitting Chinese shares, on fears that corporations will pay more to borrow - eating into profits. New curbs on the asset management sector are also driving people to sell, as Reuters explains: Selling in China’s stock markets last week had been prompted by a rout in the bond market that pushed yields on government treasury bonds to three-year highs, and by fresh moves to reduce risks in the asset management industry that may bring a sea change for banks and millions of small investors. But while bond market jitters appeared to ease on Monday, stock market investors continued to unload shares in major firms that have enjoyed strong gains in recent weeks. This could weigh on Europe’s stock markets this morning too.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Weak productivity growth is a key reason why Britain faces years of anaemic growth and weak pay. But the UK government hopes to crack the puzzle today, by announcing a new UK’s Industrial Strategy. It will focus on five ‘key foundations’ -- ideas, people, infrastructure, business environment and places, in an attempt to make the British economy fit for the 21st century. Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, will launch the strategy this morning. He hopes to make Britain a world leader in areas such as AI and driverless cars. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The paper will identify four grand challenges, global trends that the government sees as shaping the future: artificial intelligence; clean growth; an ageing society; and future mobility from driverless cars to drones. Industrial strategy went out of fashion in the Conservative party after the defeat of the 1974-9 Labour government by Margaret Thatcher. But Clark believes a new approach based on competition rather than on picking winners will help address Britain’s long-term problems. But will it really be enough to spur Britain forwards? Also coming up today... City investors will be watching Germany closely. Over the weekend, senior officials in Angela Merkel’s CDU party agreed to pursue a “grand coalition” with the Social Democrats. This could spare Germany from a fresh snap election.

Jerson Kelman, president of water company Sabesp, told Guardian Cities he felt a duty to speak out because he was a citizen as well as the head of a company who had seen firsthand how close this metropolis of 21 million people had come to a breakdown. “We should not transform the Amazon into pastureland,” he said in an interview. “The Amazon creates a movement of water. If you could follow a molecule of water you would see that most of the clouds that are over São Paulo have passed across the Amazon. If the forest is cut, we’ll be in trouble.” As one of the foremost authorities on water supply and hydropower in Brazil, Kelman’s comments are likely to reignite a debate – resisted by the country’s powerful agriculture lobby – about the link between the world’s biggest forest, climate change and a possible recurrence of the 2014-15 drought. The mayor of São Paulo, João Doria, appears to have been persuaded. In an interview with the Guardian he said recognised the importance of the link between the Amazon and the city’s water supply. “We need to preserve the rainforest to preserve the cycle of rain in central and southeast Brazil,” he said, also stressing the need to reduce demand and promote recycling. His government, however, has made little progress in putting these words into action. The 2014-15 drought was no ordinary dry period. Over a 12-month period, rainfall was half that of the previous worst year on records stretching back to the early 20th century. By January 2015, the volume of water at the main Cantareira reservoir system was down to 5% – barely a month’s supply. Dozens of municipalities on the periphery of São Paulo declared “states of calamity”, which allowed for military intervention and emergency funds from the federal government. At Itu – the worst affected city – there was fighting, theft and the looting of emergency water trucks. Many communities’ taps flowed for only a few hours every four days. In some condominiums, residents took buckets from swimming pools to flush toilets, argued over scarce communal supplies and denounced neighbours who washed their cars. The dystopia even reached the city’s main commercial district around Avenida Paulista, where the swanky Bassano restaurant served guests with plastic plates and cutlery because there was insufficient water supply for dishwashers, and Starbucks only offered bottled beer and cans of Coke because there was not enough water for coffee. With elections due the following year, the São Paulo state and city governments refused to declare an emergency. But Guardian Cities has learned from multiple sources that the authorities were far more worried than they admitted to the public at the time. Today there is a mood of calm at the control centre of Sabesp (the Basic Sanitation Company of the State of São Paulo), the water utility that is 50.1% owned by the government. Real-time data displayed on giant screens and a dozen individual monitors show reservoirs are almost back to pre-crisis levels. Automated pumping stations – where water pressure to 220 neighbourhoods can be adjusted at the click of a mouse – are functioning normally. But asked to recall how different it felt at the height of the crisis, Silvana Franco, a senior official in the control centre, loudly sucks in a breath and shakes her head. “We were desperate. The reservoir level was just going down and down. We knew that when people don’t have water, they go crazy. We had seen the protests in smaller cities where people were breaking into property to steal water. We imagined what they would be like here with 21 million people. We thought about the hospitals unable to treat patients and children having to stay home from school. It would be chaos.” She said her boss was so worried his hair turned white. At the nadir, she said, the military came to check whether the gates and perimeter were secure. This had never happened before, and added to the staff’s fears of being on the edge of an apocalypse. “There were about five of them in uniform with guns,” she recalls. “They wanted to see how resilient this centre could be because we control the water.” There are limits to what Kelman is able or willing to do about the city’s water crisis. Sabesp, he says, has planted 45,000 hectares of trees on its land and seen the benefits in terms of climate regulation. But it has no authority over Amazon conservation and – because it is a business that must generate profits – there is no incentive to scale back demand (and sales). Sabesp has already dropped the measure that was most effective during the crisis: a financial reward for households that reduced water use. Eighty percent of customers received these incentives, which eased the pressure on the supply system more than other emergency measures such as tapping “dead water” from the reservoirs and interlinking networks. The benefits of these behavioural changes are still evident today as consumption remains more than 10% below pre-crisis levels even though the taps are flowing freely. On the corporate side of its business, however, Sabesp offers discounts to companies who are heavy consumers. Highlighting the negative impact of market pressures, this controversial policy was introduced to dissuade major clients from digging their own wells or seeking rival suppliers. Longer term, Sapesb has strengthened drought resilience by focusing on expensive, supply-side engineering works that expand the water footprint of the city. At Jaguari reservoir – about two hours drive from the city centre – engineers are putting the finishing touches on a series of giant pumps, pipes and tunnels that will create an 11-mile link to the Cantareira system. It is one of three mega-projects that will together cost close to R$3bn (£695m) – a huge chunk of Sapesb’s budget – but should provide enough extra back-up capacity to withstand a drought as bad as the one that hit two years ago. “I know that in three of four years, some politicians will complain we are wasting money on infrastructure that sits idle. People forget easily,” said Kelman. “But now nature has shown us what she can do, the least the population can expect is that decision-makers prepare for rare events … If something worse comes, then we have a problem.” There is already criticism. Business groups want more of a priority on profitability so a bigger share of Sabesp’s stock can be privatised. Environmental groups are unhappy that more spending on infrastructure means less for sewage treatment and reforestation of areas near water sources that are currently occupied by shanty towns. If these problems could be solved, the city could once again tap its two most central reservoirs – Billings and Guarapiranga – and the river Tiete, all of which are currently too contaminated for use. “It’s possible to improve by investing in forests and water treatment, but that’s not happening,” said Malu Ribeiro of the conservation movement, SOS Mata Atlantica. “So of course this [kind of drought] will happen again. The city is still growing. There is more deforestation. More people are living next to water sources. We have learned little or nothing from the crisis.” Alexis Morgan of the WWF agreed the government’s response has been piecemeal. “A good crisis has gone to waste in terms of the public level response,” he said. “Businesses have learned that demand-side solutions are cheaper and easier. That should be the place to start. But engineers invariably want to put more supply in the system. They fail to recognise that green assets [forests] appreciate over time unlike grey assets [concrete dams]. The government should be looking at both.” The challenge of building climate resilience is increasingly important and not just in Brazil. According to a new WWF study, São Paulo ranks only eighth in the list of the world’s most drought-vulnerable megacities (population above 10 million). In terms of all cities, the No 1 is Cape Town, which is currently in the midst of its worst ever water shortages and now facing many of the difficult decisions that Kelman and others had to grapple with two years ago. In São Paulo, a full meltdown was avoided. The most extreme contingency plans were not needed. But it was close. If it had not been for a little rain and some drastic measures, Sabesp could have faced the fury of 21 million thirsty customers. For Kelman, the lessons are fourfold: good supply-side engineering, sensible demand-management through pricing mechanisms, transparency so that the public are on the side of the government in saving water, and accepting that past data was no longer a reliable guide as a result of climate change and land-use change. “The São Paulo experience shows us we can not rely on past assumptions. We need to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.” He is also looking at the causes. Global climate change and regional deforestation are top of the list. Kelman says the loss of the Amazon is raising climate risks for São Paulo because the forest helps to circulate water down from the tropics in a process known as evapotranspiration. “Now I enter a minefield,” he says, reflecting the sensitivity of the topic. There are no statistical models for this yet and the science remains controversial due to the implications for the powerful agricultural lobby, which clears trees for farms, and the hydropower industry, which floods forest for dams. The best-known exponent is Antonio Nobre, a climatologist at the Space Research Institute who calls the Amazon a “biotic pump” that provides the energy for “rivers in the sky” to flow thousands of miles to São Paulo. Without this booster, he warns, the southeast of Brazil would likely be a desert like many other regions at the same latitude. Fears of water riots in a country that boasts 12% of the world’s rivers and lakes would once have seemed outlandish, but they are a real and growing concern due to increased consumption and climate disruption on a global and regional level. Kelman believes there are lessons here for the Brazil government and cities across the world. Among the most important is that past records are no longer a reliable guide to future risks. This came as a shock to Kelman, who wrote his doctoral paper on a historical data analysis – technically known as the stationary series statistical method – which is used to set the parameters for the climate resilience of water and hydropower supply systems. Based on these old statistics, he calculated the chance of a drought like that of 2014-15 as 0.4%, or once in 250 years. It was twice as severe as the planner’s worst forecasts, forcing him into a period of philosophical self-reflection. “We had excellent data – 83 years worth – and we were prepared for the worst on record,” he says. “But nature showed us that we cannot rely on stationary series statistics as we did in the past. We should prepare for the unknown.” Another Sabesp official who asked not to be named described the situation as “completely out of control.” A senior government adviser, who also asked for anonymity, concurred. “The risks we discussed in private were far greater than those discussed in public at the time.” Due to fears of a mob invasion, the authorities established a back-up control centre in a different location. They also installed special pipes to circumvent the main distribution system and ensure water could be directly provided to the 500 most important buildings in the city, including large hospitals, dialysis centres and prisons, even if the rest of the city ran dry. Everyone else, they imagined, would have to take buckets and kettles to city squares where they would have to line up for supplies from water trucks. “It would have been like sub-Saharan Africa,” said one senior official. This priority list was kept secret. Kelman, the founder of the Brazilian Association of Water Resources, who was drafted in as drought buster in January 2015, said transparency was generally desirable, but in this case the authorities had no choice. “It was like wartime. We couldn’t tell anyone which buildings were on the list because the supply might have been disrupted,” said Kelman. “If things went wrong, we didn’t know what might happen. There could have been riots in the street.” The theory has been attacked. Benedito Braga, the head of the sanitation and water resource secretariat in the São Paulo state government dismissed any link between the drought and the Amazon. “If deforestation was causing this impact then how do you explain the floods that we saw in 2016,” he told The Guardian. “I would say they are both signs of natural variability. 2014-15 was an outlier, not a sign of a trend.” There is more acceptance among meteorologists who believe the Amazon serves as a link between two key corridors of humidity - the Intertropical Convergence Zone along the equator and the South Atlantic Convergence Zone that stretches down to the southeast of Brazil. The latter is crucial to water supply and the hydropower industry because it brings consistent rainfall for several days which fill the reservoirs far more effectively than occasional drizzles. “Before 2013, there would be three or four convergence rainfalls in São Paulo every years. But in 2015, there was only one. Last year there was only one and this year there has so far been only one. That means we are still using more water than is naturally replaced,” said Camila Ramos of Climatempo, a private forecasting agency. “If the Amazon forest disappears it would be plausible to assume that the rainfall volumes would drop in Sao Paulo as the the humidity supply towards the southeast might decrease.” Guardian Cities is in São Paulo for a special series of in-depth reporting and live events.

Marriage certificates list only the fathers of the couple getting married, which the government has previously resisted changing on cost grounds. Caroline Spelman, a former cabinet minister, is to present a bill for second reading this week that would allow the name of the mothers of those getting married to appear on the certificate. The bill is co-sponsored by Labour MP Frank Field, the former culture secretary, Maria Miller, and Tim Farron, former Liberal Democrat leader. Spelman is the second church estates commissioner, the Church of England’s official representative in the House of Commons. The bill will also set out a mechanism for a digital register of marriages, to prevent the high cost of replacing all marriage registers to allow the inclusion of mothers’ names. A similar proposed law aiming to recognise mothers on marriage certificates was put forward by Labour MP Christina Rees in 2015, but was rejected by the government. The Home Office minister at the time, Richard Harrington, said he was “not convinced” the Neath MP’s bill was the “right way to deal with it” because the government also wanted to adapt the registration system for the digital age. However, ministers are known to be generally supportive of the change. In December 2016, in a written answer, then-Home Office minister Robert Goodwill said the government was continuing to seek “suitable legislative opportunities” to introduce reform. Efforts to make the change have stalled several times. David Cameron pledged to change the certificates in 2014, saying the arrangement “does not reflect modern Britain”. The latest version of the bill stems from a draft tabled last year by the Conservative MP Edward Argar, but the bill was never debated because parliament was dissolved for the snap June election. Spelman’s bill is not the only attempt to change the law, with an identical bill also being proposed in the House of Lords by the Rt Rev Alan Smith, the Bishop of St Albans, with the aim of securing the change as quickly as possible. Field said the bill was a matter of justice. “It’s a huge knock in the eye for mothers,” he said. “Children have two parents, even if they are not living together and every opportunity should be taken to affirm that truth, and particularly when it’s often the mum who is with the child if parents aren’t together anymore. “It is an insult, really, to the person who has most treasured and nurtured you, in most instances. It goes against church teaching about the importance of both parents.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/26/early-steps-to-trace-and-block-the-trolls-who-spread-fake-news","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T16:25:17Z","webTitle":"Early steps to trace and block the trolls who spread fake news | Open door | Paul Chadwick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/early-steps-to-trace-and-block-the-trolls-who-spread-fake-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/early-steps-to-trace-and-block-the-trolls-who-spread-fake-news","fields":{"headline":"Early steps to trace and block the trolls who spread fake news","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fakery has long infected public debate in democracies, especially during election campaigns, with effects hard to gauge. In the UK in 1924, the fake “Zinoviev letter” fuelled a Russia scare different from today’s concerns. It is thought to have greatly harmed the then Labour government’s chances of re-election when the letter was reported as authentic in the Daily Mail just before polling day. Technology has made the threat of fakery greater today. Widespread disclosures are no longer made only by mass media, whose claims are necessarily public and able to be challenged. A sort of darkness covers deceptions that are now possible through a mix of data-driven targeting and the social media news feeds of individuals, sharing among their personal networks. For those journalists who seek truth and take seriously their role to facilitate democracy, it is imperative to expose fake news and masquerading voices. Nothing is more potentially destructive of freedom under law than a community losing trust in the information with which public debate is nourished, public choices are made and public accountability is extracted. Knowledge is gradually building about how Russian trolls have attempted to influence or disrupt public debate beyond Russia, using social media in particular. An important step in controlling the infection was Twitter’s recent disclosure to the US Congress of 2,752 accounts that Twitter has “tied to Russian actors”, as the House permanent select committee on intelligence put it. Availability of the list of Twitter accounts allows other democratic institutions, especially traditional journalism organisations, to investigate the effects of those accounts, especially any impact on their own published journalism and on the debates they host on their own platforms. What, if anything, can be learned about the objectives and tactics of those who create and deploy the fakery? Last week, the Guardian began answering. Using the list it reported that the Russian “troll army” accounts had been cited more than 80 times across UK media. Two of the accounts have appeared in two different Guardian articles. A report last June about the LGBTI community’s fight back against online abuse necessarily drew heavily on social media. It has been footnoted to disclose that one of the tweets quoted in the piece was drawn, unknowingly, from a fake account. The second fake account mentioned in a Guardian article, @TEN_GOP, used to be understood to represent Tennessee Republicans’ opinions. It had been promoted by members of President Trump’s inner circle, though I am not aware of any evidence that they knew it was a Russian troll account when they cited it. Last June the account was quoted in a Guardian live blog in a selection of conservatives’ responses to the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. I asked the Guardian’s technical experts to use the list to examine what had been happening in the more than 40m comments published online below articles since the beginning of 2016. The analysis is continuing so I might have more to add. But early results, which show relatively few of the accounts appeared, invite cautious analysis. The more such work is publicised – prudently, for no one wants to assist trolls – the more readers are put on guard. I trust that other journalism organisations will conduct similar exercises and share their techniques and findings. I hope the social media giants, Facebook and Twitter, will promptly and routinely make public all fake accounts, advertisements and “news items” they find as they inquire into how their services have been manipulated for malign purposes. Excessive secrecy retards the democratic fightback. It is important to note that those who made online comments in which they embedded one of the troll accounts did not necessarily know the account was fake. They may simply have agreed with its sentiments. At the Guardian, six of the troll Twitter accounts have been found so far in below-the-line comments beneath eight articles published between June 2016 and 1 November 2017, the date the congressional committee released Twitter’s list. The articles are in two broad categories: the US presidential election campaign in 2016 and Donald Trump’s first six months in office; and the conflict in Syria, where Russia is fighting on the side of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. A comment beneath an article about the Women’s March on Washington, which coincided with Trump’s inauguration, claimed that “the organiser” of the march was campaigning for sharia law across the US, and cited as its lone source a Russian troll account. Below an article referring to Trump and Vladimir Putin meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg last July, where violence embarrassed the German hosts, was a comment disparaging “extreme left anti-fascists” and embedding a trolling Twitter handle. Other comments that contain fake accounts within them seem aimed at fomenting disdain, or worse, towards, for example, those who called out Trump for his behaviour towards women. As others who have analysed Russian trolling have noted, the comments are sometimes unsteadily expressed, as if the writer was not a native English speaker. If the words and messaging associated with proven troll accounts can be aggregated in large amounts, perhaps patterns will emerge and help with prevention, not just reaction. In this fight, artificial intelligence can be harnessed by both sides. Exposing destructive use of social media, including through its appearances in older media forums, can begin in earnest. Opportunities exist for people of goodwill to collaborate to make the work faster and more effective."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/26/borrowing-to-invest-labour-economy-tories-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T16:29:38Z","webTitle":"Borrowing to invest isn’t burning money – it’s how Labour will fix the economy | John McDonnell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/borrowing-to-invest-labour-economy-tories-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/borrowing-to-invest-labour-economy-tories-growth","fields":{"headline":"Borrowing to invest isn’t burning money – it’s how Labour will fix the economy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This is the pivotal period in which the battle of ideas over the future of our economy will be lost or won. All the evidence of the failure of austerity has been exposed, and the neoliberals are fighting for their ideological survival. The terrain they have chosen is over state intervention in the economy; they deploy media outriders using trite journalistic tactics to sow fears over the costs of state investment. Since I became shadow chancellor my aim has been to raise the level of economic debate and challenge the hegemony of this egregious ideology. The budget gives us the opportunity to confront and overrun the bogus economic arguments that have dominated political and economic policymaking for so long. The official figures released alongside the budget this year were utterly damning, a litany of failure not only for this government but for the entire economic philosophy it lives and will die by. UK growth is now the lowest in the G7, and we have the worst set of official forecasts in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s history. Productivity growth is the worst since Napoleon was retreating from Russia, wage decline the worst since the invention of the steam engine. And clearing the government’s deficit, which Philip Hammond’s predecessor once reassured us would be done by 2015, is now pushed back to perhaps 2031. The underlying problem is Britain’s productivity growth, which fell off a cliff around the time of the financial crisis and then – unlike in every other G7 major economy – never truly recovered. This matters, because for the last two centuries our economy has been able to grow and produce rising living standards on the back of improving productivity. So while advanced economies across the world have seen a slowdown in productivity since the crash, none has suffered as badly as Britain. And the OBR expects this to continue for the indefinite future. Improved productivity comes from investment that delivers new equipment, new technology and new ideas that allow an economy to work more productively. But Britain, under Conservative-led governments, is a low investment economy. We have the lowest rate of investment in the G7. What little growth has happened has come through the creation of poorly paid, insecure jobs. Our economy has exploited cheap labour rather than invest in capital. The primary responsibility for this switch lies with those governments. Under George Osborne, investment by government fell by £18bn. Research spending was cut by £1bn. At precisely the moment the government could have been rebuilding the economy and delivering the stable, long-term investment needed to lay the foundations for future productivity growth, it was slashing essential spending. When Labour returns to government, it will begin to repair that damage by investing £250bn over a decade in transport, communications, housing and research. This will bring us from languishing at the bottom of OECD tables for investment to around the average level of investment of our competitors. The Tories and much of the media have been attacking our proposals using bogus economic arguments. By focusing on the cost of government borrowing (currently close to an all-time low, thanks to tiny interest rates) rather than the enormous social and financial returns on investing that money, the right creates a narrative that investment costs society rather than benefits it. Lurking behind this is an assumption that a government cannot invest productively – the belief that government borrowing is akin to burning money. This is nonsense used to support the economic approach that has led our country to this pass. Very clearly, government investment can and should be used to support economic growth, as the OECD and others recommend – as indeed this Tory government, in some small way, is coming to recognise, committing a small amount of borrowing for investment. The meaningful question is whether that investment is wise, given the costs – rather than presuming that only costs exist. Not all borrowing is good. After missing so many deficit targets, the Conservatives are spending billions on interest payments because austerity has failed to get wages growing and tax receipts increasing. Unlike Labour, they borrow to pay for their failure rather than invest in the future. Our “fiscal credibility rule” commits us to borrowing only for investment, as well as reducing the debt burden over the course of a parliament. Labour intends to take on, and win, the argument on investment. It is at the centre of our economic debate, and we stand ready to remove this failure of a government and build an economy that works for the many, not the few. • John McDonnell is shadow chancellor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/27/faust-review-cafe-oto-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T12:40:55Z","webTitle":"Faust review – live knitting and angle grinders in bewitching krautrock jams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/27/faust-review-cafe-oto-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/27/faust-review-cafe-oto-london","fields":{"headline":"Faust review – live knitting and angle grinders in bewitching krautrock jams","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Anyone incredulous at Noel Gallagher employing a scissor player on stage of late would have their brains fried by Faust’s knitters. Sitting either side of Werner “Zappi” Diermaier’s drumkit, two middle-aged ladies clack out mittens that go on for yards at a time, occasionally scarfing to a neck-warming climax. They’re a symbol that avant-garde adventurism is a lifelong endeavour, and more than 40 years on, Faust are still casting off into unwritten sonic patterns. Beloved of Julian Cope and bloodline ancestors of Spiritualized, Tortoise, shoegaze and desert rock, Faust were key players in the rock wing of early 1970s krautrock, as kin to Floyd and Beefheart as Can and Neu! Numerous wilderness periods and lineup changes have left them as two active bands, a kind of krautrock Bucks Fizz, but the branch centred around Diermaier and “art-errorist” bassist Jean-Hervé Péron – who looks more like Jethro Tull’s flute roadie, to be fair – is the busiest and boldest. In 2014, they released jUSt, an album of skeletal compositions for other artists to build upon, and this year delivered Fresh Air, recorded while touring the US with guest musicians at each location, Damo Suzuki-style. This first of a three-night residency is relatively light on cacophonous sound collages, but it’s still utterly bewitching. Whether bowing absorbing kosmiche drones from their guitars on opener Rund Ist Schoen or beating tribalist rhythms from sheets of metal, Faust are a band unbounded. Anything could happen – Pythagorus finds Péron reciting Pi to fourteen decimal places (“we’re learning two more numbers every day”), and at one point they tune in to a Radio 4 drama and encourage the knitters to freestyle over it. Péron’s words aspire to the cerebral, tackling environmental pollution and the refugee crisis on Listen to the Fish and the rise of rightwing politics on one-chord cataclysm Fresh Air, but Faust’s impact is more visceral. Some crescendos hit like a shaft of sunlight piercing an ancient tomb to illuminate an elemental nugget of rock’n’roll, and the highlight comes when Péron upends a metal bin and attacks it with an angle grinder and drill, dancing through the spray of sparks like a welding Bez. It makes for the catchiest melody of the night. So the message, Noel, is clear. Drop the scissors, you want a Black + Decker sander tuned to A sharp. At Òran Mór, Glasgow, 28 November.

But her catalogue also includes a number of orchestral pieces, several of which have been taken up by Ludovic Morlot and the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. That made Morlot a natural choice to conduct the first performance of Sierra’s Nature Symphony, which was commissioned by the BBC Philharmonic. The title suggests something programmatic, and the symphony’s three movements all have evocative titles, but there is nothing in them that’s obviously descriptive. The mechanics of natural processes fascinate Sierra and find their way into her music, so it is the idea of endless cycles of migration, year after year, that creates the steadily accumulating loops of the opening Mountain of Butterflies, while the sense of something ominous and threatening in the melodic fragments and ticking ostinatos of the slow central Black Place was inspired by Georgia O’Keefe’s dark paintings of New Mexico. The finale, Bee Rebellion, is based on the phenomenon of hive collapse that is sometimes seen in bee colonies, when the insect society can suddenly break down into anarchy; it’s music of unpredictable cycles and accumulations, with taunting wind solos, all cut short by a brassy, percussion-driven ending that offers no escape. Lasting just over 20 minutes, the symphony does what Sierra sets out to do with impressive economy and a succession of striking orchestral ideas. Another “nature symphony”, Dvořák’s Eighth, came at the opposite end of the programme, well played by the BBC Philharmonic and presented by Morlot with much affection, as well as with a few moments of excusable expressive indulgence. The concert’s centrepiece was Bartók’s First Piano Concerto, with Jean-Éfflam Bavouzet as the soloist. He tended to play down the more rebarbative aspects of what is one of Bartók’s most uncompromising orchestral works, so that the solo writing seemed more conventionally virtuosic than it sometimes does, while having the timpanist and the five-strong percussion section at the front of the stage on either side of the piano rather than behind it as the score specifies perhaps created more balance problems than it solved. • On BBC Radio 3 on 1 December and on iPlayer until 31 December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/27/telegraph-owners-accused-of-washing-hands-of-historic-leeds-building","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Telegraph owners accused of ‘washing hands’ of historic Leeds building","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/telegraph-owners-accused-of-washing-hands-of-historic-leeds-building","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/telegraph-owners-accused-of-washing-hands-of-historic-leeds-building","fields":{"headline":"Telegraph owners accused of ‘washing hands’ of historic Leeds building","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The billionaire owners of the Telegraph have been accused of “washing their hands” of one of the UK’s most important and unusual industrial buildings after leaving it to rot for more than a decade and then putting it up for auction for a pound. Temple Works is a Grade I-listed former flax mill in Leeds which boasts a 0.8 hectare (2 acre) factory floor which was once the largest room in the world. It also saw the installation of the first ever hydraulic lift, used to transport sheep up to the roof for grazing. The sheep were part of a revolutionary rainwater collection system used to make steam to spin flax into yarn. The building, once described by the Yorkshire Post as looking “like a stately home for a pharaoh”, has been owned since 2004 by the secretive Barclay family, who bought the Telegraph media group in 2004. Built in 1836, it was modelled on the Temple of Horus at Edfu, on the banks of the Nile, reflecting the interest in Egyptology of John Marshall, the founder of the Leeds flax industry. According to Historic England, the building represents the zenith of the Marshall Mills flax business in Leeds and had acquired a legendary reputation within a few years of its construction. The Egyptian facade, featuring elaborate giant columns topped with lotus capitals and hieroglyphic-filled coving, was designed by the Egyptologist Joseph Bonomi, brother of the architect Ignatius Bonomi. Egypt had an important flax industry in the ancient world. The 10,948 sq metre (117,843 sq ft) mill featured among the Victorian Society’s 10 most endangered buildings six years ago, and is in a poor state of repair after a partial collapse in 2008. It is due to go up for auction on 7 December after Burberry cancelled £50m plans to use the site as a factory-cum-showroom. The complex was last used commercially in 2004, when it was a mail-order warehouse for the now defunct Kays catalogue. The Barclays inherited it in 2004 when they bought Kays, having already acquired another catalogue company, Littlewoods, in 2002. For several years, until February 2016, the building was used as a cultural hub called Temple.Works.Leeds as plans developed to turn the space into a northern rival to the Tate Modern. But with renovation costs estimated at upwards of £20m, the right buyer never emerged, and a local developer was outbid by Burberry on an option to develop the site. Burberry put the project on hold in 2016 amid Brexit uncertainty and eventually pulled out of the deal in July. The property will be auctioned next month with no reserve, meaning it will be sold to the highest bidder on the day regardless of the size of the bid. Whoever buys the site will not only have to carry out major repairs but will have to figure out what to do with the enormous old factory floor. Lit by dozens of beautiful domed skylights, the masonry roof is only just held up by rotting hollow pipes which acted both as columns and to help to collect rainwater to make steam. Heritage campaigners fear that the auction process will encourage buyers who may underestimate the scale and cost of renovation. “We are disappointed that the owners have chosen to dispose of the building by auction. It feels like they are washing their hands of what they must see as a liability,” said Martin Hamilton, the director of Leeds Civic Trust. “There is now a real risk that a naive investor will purchase the building without the resources to spend on refurbishment – possibly upwards of £20m, leading to more years of neglect, planning and legal wrangles and quite possibly the final nail in the coffin for this building. “We would appeal to the owners to withdraw the building from the auction and to work with Leeds city council and other interested parties to identify a buyer with the necessary resources to turn the building round, and a use that would be a focus for the wider regeneration of this part of Leeds city centre.” The council has bought several acres of land around the site which it could offer the right buyer of Temple Works as a sweetener. By 2033, the HS2 railway station should have been built a short walk away. Martin Farrington, the director of city development, said: “Temple Works is a very significant part of the industrial heritage not just of Leeds but also the UK and the council will work collaboratively with an experienced developer who wants to bring the building back into sustainable use.” The Barclays did not respond for comment via the Telegraph press office. • This article was amended on 28 November 2017 to restore the word “only” to the sentence about the challenges facing whoever is the eventual buyer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/26/moeen-ali-stumping-dismissal-wobbly-line-ashes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T09:27:12Z","webTitle":"Moeen Ali sparks white line fever but England’s Ashes issues run far deeper | Ali Martin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/26/moeen-ali-stumping-dismissal-wobbly-line-ashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/26/moeen-ali-stumping-dismissal-wobbly-line-ashes","fields":{"headline":"Moeen Ali sparks white line fever but England’s Ashes issues run far deeper","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shoddyline? Wobblyline? Amid a frenetic fourth afternoon at the Gabba in which the hopes of the sun-cream-slathered travelling support rose before eventually crashing down it was the marginal decision which sent Moeen Ali on his way that sparked some curious white-line fever. When the scorebook for this Ashes opener is pored over by future generations it will simply read MM Ali st Paine b Lyon 40 and tell little of the debate that enveloped. It ranged from atomic- level analysis of the batsman’s back foot to the thickness of the painted crease, all with the nebulous “benefit of the doubt” thrown in for good measure. First is the wicket itself. England, five down at lunch after the loss of Joe Root for yet another unconverted half-century, were suddenly rebuilding through Moeen and Jonny Bairstow. The former, having looked ephemeral initially, had started to unfurl the shots that make him the most aesthetically pleasing batsman on either side and a stand of 42 had pushed England’s lead to 129. Lyon, in the 54th over and with the scalps of two more left-handers in Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan already secured, ripped another ball past the edge of Moeen’s lunging defence with Paine whipping the bails off. While his team-mates were gasping at what they thought was another near-miss, the wicketkeeper, recalled for his quicksilver glovework, was imploring the square-leg umpire, Aleem Dar, to check for the stumping. Dar relented and up in the third umpire’s booth the New Zealander Chris Gaffeney perused the footage. After taking angles from both sides of the wicket and from the stump camera, he decided that, close as the all-rounder’s boot was to being behind the line, there was nothing to suggest it was. OUT popped up on the big screen and Mo had to go. Opinions were immediately divided and not necessarily along national lines. Correct, said Michael Vaughan in the Channel 9 commentary box, while Michael Clarke called for the benefit to go to the batsman (despite this being at best convention, rather than actually enshrined in the laws). A case of different strokes for different folks, if you will. But then came the stills (and some rudimentary photoshop skills) cascading down the timelines of social media, pointing out that sections of the popping crease appeared swollen in the middle and perhaps by a margin that would have otherwise favoured Moeen. Could an on-field decision, in this era of technology, really hinge on the groundstaff’s choice of paintbrush? While Appendix C section 1 of the ICC playing regulations set out the dimensions of the crease, there is no guidance as to the thickness of the lines. It varies from ground to ground and, as matches wear on, the grooves and indentations caused by the bowlers’ footmarks and the scratching of guards mean the canvas for the curators becomes undulating. Speaking after close of play, when Australia were within touching distance of taking a 1-0 series lead into the day-night second Test in Adelaide starting on Friday, Moeen was typically philosophical about the decision before attempting to draw a line under it. “If I was bowling, I’d want it to be out,” he said. “It depends on the angle you look at it but you have to respect the umpire’s call.You just have to move on. I thought I was all right personally but the replay did make it look tight. I was disappointed I got out in that fashion but mostly the timing of it. Me and Jonny were building a good partnership. I was over straight away.” Perhaps this was simply the final inadvertent gift of the Gabba from Kevin Mitchell Jr, the retiring curator who has never witnessed an Australian defeat during his 27 years in the job. The bottom line is the batsman knew where the popping crease was, irrespective of its girth, and Gaffeney’s judgment was easy to understand. After all, England’s problems – shot selection, a crepe-paper tail and an attack that drops off after Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson to name a few – run far deeper than one of cricket’s quirkier dismissals. They will need addressing fast if they are to keep this incident as the only talk of whitewash on tour. Ashes diary Did the election cause drop in attendance? It’s difficult to estimate how many people at the Gabba, a scattering of yellow, blue and maroon seats creating an optical illusion of it being fuller than it is. But the attendance was well down on the fourth day, totalling 21,535. To be fair, a look at old scorecards shows this was consistent with the previous two Ashes Sundays in Brisbane. The more interesting finding was that more punters showed up to see Cook, Strauss and Trott bludgeon 517-1 in 2010 than for Johnson and Harris tearing England apart to go one-up three years later. Maybe they were staying away on Sunday due to election party hangovers? Queenslanders went to the polls on Saturday to elect their state government, returning a Labor majority. Adam Collins Maxwell’s return to commentating is great news Test Match Special listeners must be missing the unmistakable tones of Jim Maxwell. Jim suffered a stroke in September 2016 and has been easing himself back to work. The good news is that he is at the Gabba for the entire match and heading up the ABC’s much praised commentary. However, their commentary box is quite a hike from that of the BBC. But when the topography of the ground changes expect to hear his inimitable calling of Khawaja and Mitchell Starc later in the series. It was good to catch up with him. My impression is that he thinks Australia may well win the series. Vic Marks Bouncers 1-0 press pack Local laws in Brisbane mean that if you head into a bar after 10pm, identification is required for entry irrespective of age. One member of the English press pack fell foul of this when trying to find a spot to watch his football team back home on Saturday night, presenting his credit card to the burly doorman in the hope it would be sufficient. The response? “What do I look like, mate? A fucken ATM?” Ali Martin Pace best observed from pitchside Down by the boundary, the Gabba crowd finds fullest voice when the short balls start to fly. There’s a swell of sound that starts from the back and rumbles to the middle of the pitch. As Patrick Cummins searched for England’s last wicket via Jake Ball, his bouncers leapt. From ground level, you get a truer sense of their pace. Ball was nowhere, fending until he gloved one in the air. On ABC radio, Jonathan Agnew questioned whether this was intimidatory bowling. “Those deliveries didn’t look like they were going to get him hurt,” fired back former fast man Dirk Nannes. “They looked like they were going to get him out.” Geoff Lemon • Sign up to our weekly email, The Recap, here, showcasing a selection of our sport features from the past seven days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/media-blog/2017/nov/26/net-neutrality-law-trump-deregulation-media","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T14:00:11Z","webTitle":"Why we should be wary of ending net neutrality | Emily Bell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/media-blog/2017/nov/26/net-neutrality-law-trump-deregulation-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/media-blog/2017/nov/26/net-neutrality-law-trump-deregulation-media","fields":{"headline":"Why we should be wary of ending net neutrality","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Do you want [the internet] to be governed by engineers and entrepreneurs, or do you want it governed by lawyers and bureaucrats here in Washington?” That was the question asked to the American public by Ajit Pai, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, when he appeared on Fox News last week to talk about his intention to change the way access to the internet is regulated. The dark intonation of the words “lawyers and bureaucrats” left the viewer in no doubt that Pai’s rollback of laws governing what is known as “net neutrality” could only be a good thing. Who better to decide the communications infrastructure of a country than a group of wealthy telecoms companies in an almost competition-free environment? In a 210-page document, Restoring Internet Freedom (pdf), released the day before Thanksgiving, the FCC outlined how it would rely more heavily on business competition and anti-trust laws to regulate how internet service providers charged for access to their services, with a requirement to provide “transparency” to consumers. Activists see the ending of net neutrality, effectively the rules that stop internet service providers discriminating against certain types of content, as having serious consequences for smaller or more diverse web services that will no longer be protected from providers either slowing their traffic or pricing them out of the market altogether. It has also been heavily criticised by large technology companies and social platforms, which see it as tipping the scale in favour of telecoms providers such as AT&amp;T and Verizon. Net neutrality has long been a contentious issue in US communications policy. The principle that all types of content services should have access to the internet without fear of price or bandwidth discrimination underwrote the ideal of a varied media environment. New services such as Netflix and Amazon could compete with established broadcasters without worrying that ISPs such as Comcast might discriminate against them as they already own television assets such as NBC Universal. Or at least that was the theory. In practice, platform companies such as Facebook grew bigger than traditional media and Amazon and others rapidly moved from shopping to producing films and video series. One way of interpreting the FCC’s current flurry of activity is that instead of regulating large technology platforms it will simply loosen the restrictions placed on other types of gatekeepers, such as cable TV operators and telecoms companies to allow them to compete more fairly with their new competitors. However, ending net neutrality forms only part of an agenda by the Trump administration, which is aggressively removing regulations around other restrictions on media ownership. Buried in the same news dump ahead of the national holiday were further liberalisation rules for media ownership including a limit on how many homes in the US a single broadcaster can reach. At the moment the cap is set at 39%, but the FCC has indicated it might revise or scrap that limitation entirely. A second measure would also allow TV stations to use different frequency channels that count less against this overall cap on broadcasting reach. In fact, in an administration that has achieved very little in terms of passing new laws in its first year, one exception is in communications policy where a number of longstanding rules have been changed or abolished. Earlier this month, a 42-year old set of rules that stopped mergers between TV and newspapers in the same market was removed, as were restrictions on mergers between stations in the same market. In October, the FCC also removed the requirement for local broadcasters to maintain physical studio infrastructure in the markets they occupy. Simply put, the idea is to allow for much more consolidation in the US media market. The removal of these rules on the one hand makes some sense in a world where linear and cable broadcasting is losing share to streaming on the web. However, it is hard to separate the machinations of the FCC’s market-driven agenda from a political agenda that is only interested in regulating media as a free market rather than a civic service or cultural good. On the left, critics have been alarmed at how the rollback of rules around broadcasting might enable the rapidly growing Sinclair Broadcast Group to push through its purchase of Tribune Group, another local media company, for $4bn. Sinclair has a record of airing programming that favours Republican and right-of-centre politics, and now it is set to become the largest local broadcasting company in the US. Although all cable viewing is in decline in the US, cable news at local level still exerts a strong influence. In fact, the only sign that the FCC isn’t on a headlong path to abolish all regulation is its insistence that a potential merger between Time Warner and Comcast (the vast cable company that also owns the NBC Universal television and entertainment business) must see the disposal of assets for fear of making the company “too big”. One potential asset in play as a result of this is Donald Trump’s least favourite news network, CNN. The American public is part of a giant experiment in media deregulation with little protection for the consumer. Even if the agenda of Pai and the FCC is not overtly political, it still carries with it an ideology that plurality of voices in the media landscape is less important than efficient business competition. US media reels from new wave of instability At the end of an exhausting year of political drama and natural disasters, US media is reeling from a new wave of systemic instability. A trickle of bad news for businesses whose income is based on advertising, both old and new, is threatening to turn into full blown media recession. Here is the misery ledger for the past week: both BuzzFeed and Vice have reportedly missed their annual revenue targets, with the Wall Street Journal claiming in BuzzFeed’s case this might be by as much as 20%. CNN Digital was also reported to have fallen short of targets by $20m; the Daily Beast is allegedly being put up for sale by its owner, IAC; Univision is looking for a $200m cash injection for its digital division Fusion Media; and Mashable, which last year sacked most of its newsroom in a “pivot to video”, was sold to Ziff Davis for $50m – a fifth of its (largely fictional) valuation a year ago. So, what went wrong? The first and most important component of this decline is a wholesale restructuring of the advertising market, which has largely eliminated publishers and advertising agencies from the picture. Google and Facebook continue to see advertising revenues rise but even companies that grew impressive native advertising businesses have struggled. And even the large bets placed by venture capital investors over the past decade in digitally native news outlets are beginning to look perilous. Once investors move to take their money out, expect to see further sales, restructuring and closures. But lastly, in a enormously oversupplied national and international media market, the ability to generate loyalty and revenues away from the swamp of social media is increasingly important. “Social first” used to be a an advantage for companies like Mashable, but now it serves more as a warning to consumers. Worryingly, the economic context market remains theoretically favourable. The US economy is still in growth and the stock market is at an all-time high, the global economy is also in reasonable shape, and we cannot ignore that 2017 was a booming year for news. But, as every business knows, if you are struggling to make your targets in a strong economy, then it does not bode well for times of greater economic hardship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/nov/26/geoffrey-oldham-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T15:38:52Z","webTitle":"Geoffrey Oldham obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/26/geoffrey-oldham-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/nov/26/geoffrey-oldham-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Geoffrey Oldham obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My colleague and friend Geoffrey Oldham, who has died aged 88, was one of the founders in 1966 of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex. He dedicated his life’s work to building pioneering institutions that advocated the intelligent and innovative use of science and technology for a sustainable and equitable world. His influence came to span the globe, and his kindness and enthusiasm were felt by a vast network of colleagues and friends. Son of Evelyn (nee Brooke) and Herbert Oldham, Geoff was born in Harden, West Yorkshire, where his father was a manager with the NatWest bank. He went to Bingley grammar and studied geology at the University of Reading. He was accepted for further studies at both Cambridge and Toronto universities; 10 days after his wedding in September 1951 to Brenda Raven, they sailed for Canada. Having obtained a PhD in geophysics from the University of Toronto, Geoff worked in oil company exploration, focusing on South America. Yet, he began to think about achieving something different as a scientist: helping to harness the world’s science and technology more effectively to eliminate the depths of poverty he had observed in Latin America. This led to a career change, via a period of research about science and technology in China and other Asian countries. As deputy director of the SPRU from 1966 and as its director from 1982 to 1992, he pushed forward policy research about science and technology in developing countries. In contrast to prevailing practices, which relied mainly on the transfer of technology and science from rich countries, Geoff argued that much greater emphasis should be placed on enhancing the capacity of developing countries to create their own. This was revolutionary at the time. Geoff also played a pivotal role in 1970 in setting up what has been called the “jewel in the crown of Canadian aid”, the International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC). He then spearheaded its science and technology policy programme, fostering the development of policy research across Asia, Africa and Latin America. In 1990, he was appointed CBE for services to science. After his tenure as SPRU director, Geoff continued in numerous advisory roles – in particular with high-level UN bodies, with the IDRC in Canada and with ministers of science and technology in China. He also became a tireless advocate of action to address gender imbalances in science and technology, working with international initiatives such as GenderInSITE. Geoff helped to shape the field of science and technology policy research, and had a long-term impact on the organisations that fund, conduct and use it. He is survived by Brenda, by their son Keith and daughter, Janice, and by 10 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Two of his sons, David and Jon, predeceased Geoff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/26/santanders-sponsorship-ferrari-f1-end-final-2017-race-formula-one","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T13:16:48Z","webTitle":"Santander's sponsorship of Ferrari F1 team to end this year, say reports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/26/santanders-sponsorship-ferrari-f1-end-final-2017-race-formula-one","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/26/santanders-sponsorship-ferrari-f1-end-final-2017-race-formula-one","fields":{"headline":"Santander's sponsorship of Ferrari F1 team to end this year, say reports","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Spanish bank Santander will not renew its Formula One sponsorship of Ferrari at the end of this year, according to reports, after spending seven years and €280m (£250m) backing the sport’s most illustrious team. The bank became Ferrari’s primary sponsor in 2010 when the Spanish driver Fernando Alonso joined the team and Santander was still run by Emilio Botín, a Formula One enthusiast. Alonso, a two-times world champion with Renault, never found winning form with Ferrari and left at the end of the 2014 season. By then, the Italians had developed a more competitive car but have not won a championship since 2007. According to a report on the news site El Confidencial, Santander, now run by Botín’s daughter Ana, has turned down Ferrari’s request to renew the deal, valued at €40m, although it may choose to continue as a secondary sponsor. Juan Manuel Cendoya, head of marketing and communication at Santander, has said on various occasions that the investment in Ferrari has been money well spent, claiming the return was higher than the marketing spend. Formula One has a global audience of about 400 million. Santander has an annual marketing budget of €450m, much of it going to the Spanish football league and Latin American football’s Copa Libertadores."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/27/john-mcdonnell-budget-labour-economic-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T10:17:02Z","webTitle":"John McDonnell had a chance to shine with the budget, but he blew it | Nicola Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/27/john-mcdonnell-budget-labour-economic-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/27/john-mcdonnell-budget-labour-economic-policy","fields":{"headline":"John McDonnell had a chance to shine with the budget, but he blew it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There is nothing quite like a “gotcha” moment in a political interview. On budget day that can mean an unravelling of omnishambles proportions. Last week, the shadow chancellor’s apparent reluctance to answer questions on his own economic policies overshadowed his party’s budget response. Asked repeatedly about the effect of Labour’s economic policies on the nation’s finances, John McDonnell dismissed the questions as “trite” journalism. “That is why we have iPads and … advisers,” he told listeners of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Politicians of all parties have been caught out many times. I remember a schools minister being asked what seven times eight equalled (he was only two out). Such a simple error but it is the only thing I remember from the interview. So is it fair, particularly in an age when we can get instant information for ourselves, to expect politicians to be willing and able to answer every question? Budget day is always a big day in the political calendar. Delivering a budget is no easy task for a chancellor, but responding to a budget and grabbing some of the attention is also no mean feat for an opposition. The first obstacle is that the government controls the agenda, at least at the start of budget day. They have all the information, preparation and resources. If the economic forecasts are decent and there is money to spend, budget day can feel like wall-to-wall positive coverage for the government. If the economic picture is more difficult – or there is a hidden tax rise or a spending cut that snowballs – the opposition may have more of an opportunity to get into the picture. The opposition operation has changed little over the years as far as I can gather, with key advisers and shadow ministers shut in the shadow cabinet room waiting for the (short) advance look at the budget documents. Really, the best the opposition can hope for is to communicate its economic message and dividing lines effectively during the day while searching for the holy grail of a pasty tax in the haystack of economic data. So, if budget day is mainly about the government’s economic policy – either enjoying the spotlight or squirming under the microscope – was McDonnell justified in dismissing questions about Labour’s economic plans? Wednesday’s budget announced a bleak and worrying outlook for our economy. Any shadow chancellor would want the focus to be on those very real economic challenges facing Britain today rather than speculating on the possible effects of future policies of a party not in power. However, while the shadow chancellor’s frustration may have been understandable, it may not have been advisable. This is not because politicians should be expected to regurgitate every economic fact and figure, it is more because Labour wants to be seen as the government-in-waiting. In more stable political times, at this point in the parliament, the opposition would be analysing why it lost a general election and reconsidering its policy offer in the light of defeat. In these circumstances, it would be fair for an opposition to not have definitive answers on every aspect of its economic plans. But we are not in those times. Labour regularly calls for the Conservatives to move aside – including on Thursday in the shadow chancellor’s speech in the budget debate. Labour cannot expect to have its cake and eat it. If Labour is a government-in-waiting, then it is hardly “trite” journalism to ask how the party’s policies would affect the nation’s finances. At best McDonnell appeared defensive. At worst, people could think he was not able or not willing to engage. Sometimes politicians will not have the answers, sometimes they will have forgotten them, sometimes they will never have known them. The fallout can range from slightly embarrassing to a serious questioning of fitness for office, depending on the circumstances. It may not be reasonable to expect our politicians to know every figure and every fact, on the spot; they are only human after all. But when a party is asking for our trust, should it not then expect to be asked for the detail? In return, our journalism should always prioritise the information we need rather than chase a “gotcha” moment which will get so many more retweets. At the end of the day, an iPad is only as good as the judgment of the person who uses it. The fact that we are still talking about this today shows that the shadow chancellor’s approach distracted attention from Labour’s core argument on the budget. He should have known better. • Nicola Murphy is a former adviser who has worked in politics, in government and opposition, for over 20 years"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/nov/27/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T08:28:58Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/nov/27/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/nov/27/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) Delph offers straw for rivals to clutch at Manchester City proved they possess the spirit to match their skills in fighting back from an undeserved half-time deficit to claim this win. Huddersfield Town, who were again impressive, held the lead for 1min54sec – 20% of the total time City have been behind in their seven away games this season. City’s unbeaten record was briefly imperilled by a poor period of play which had Fabian Delph at its heart. The stand-in left-back deserted his berth in an attempt to win a ball that he never got near, allowing Tom Ince a free run into the penalty area, a threatening attack which led to the corner from which the home side took the lead. There is very little that offers hope to City’s opponents at the moment but Delph’s lack of an instinctive sense of where to position himself is the straw to which everyone can – sometimes fruitfully – clutch. Simon Burnton • Huddersfield 1-2 Manchester City: Sterling rebound sinks Terriers • Guardiola says it’s important for City to suffer and still win • Paul Doyle: players show rugged side to bring Terriers to heel 2) Wilshere’s latest Arsenal and England reminder Jack Wilshere’s 24-minute cameo as a second-half replacement caught the eye, with one burst down the centre at Burnley indicating he still has a turn of pace his serial injuries might have blunted. Arsène Wenger pointed to this surge after a 1-0 victory over the Clarets, and stated the midfielder gets stronger with each display. Still only 25, this was Wilshere’s 10th appearance of the season as he tries to convince Wenger he has a long-term future with Arsenal. The midfielder faces a similar challenge at international level. Yet Gareth Southgate – who was at Turf Moor – will surely have to reconsider a player the England manager left out of his squad for the recent friendlies with Brazil and Germany should he stay fit and force his way back into the Gunners’ starting XI. Given Granit Xhaka’s sometime ponderous contribution in the Arsenal engine room and the lack of creative options for Southgate, Wilshere could just be timing his comeback perfectly for both club and country. But, of course, the question remains the same: can Wilshere stay fit? Jamie Jackson • Burnley 0-1 Arsenal: Dyche left ‘raging’ by late Sánchez penalty winner 3) Moreno justifies Klopp’s faith after wobble Jürgen Klopp raised eyebrows by making five changes to the Liverpool team that started Saturday’s draw with Chelsea, yet perhaps the biggest surprise was that one of those changes did not involve Alberto Moreno. The full-back was poor in the 3-3 draw with Sevilla, leading to calls for him to be dropped immediately. But Klopp came out in support of the player and kept him in his team for the visit of the Premier League champions – and rightly so. Moreno has improved this season and one bad display does not undo that. As it turned out, Moreno played well against Chelsea, showing his good form is not a flash in the pan and that the 25-year-old has greater mental fortitude than he is given credit for. Sachin Nakrani • Conte: ‘We dominated the game – Liverpool were lucky to draw’ • Liverpool 1-1 Chelsea: Willian’s late goal denies Reds win • Sachin Nakrani: Klopp would rather ‘stop’ than cheat but Reds lack smarts 4) Silva continues to work wonders with Watford Anyone who watched Marco Silva very nearly save Hull from relegation last season will appreciate the Portuguese’s extraordinary knack of moulding and improving a group of ostensibly disparate players into a cohesive, exhilaratingly attacking unit. Silva is currently working wonders at Watford who could easily have scored seven goals en route to inflicting a fourth straight defeat on a Newcastle side currently destined for a relegation fight. The only problem is that Everton still covet Silva and, in refusing to kill off the resultant speculation, he is making eyes at them. But maybe Silva should be careful what he wishes for. He’s evidently got something special going on in Hertfordshire; why not let it last a season at least and wait for another “big” club to, almost inevitably, come knocking next summer? Precisely where Newcastle, Rafa Benítez, Mike Ashley and Amanda Staveley’s mooted takeover might be by then is anyone’s guess. Louise Taylor • Newcastle 0-3 Watford: Hughes leads the way as Hornets ease home 5) Home wins making difference for Manchester United If this season is about building upon last for Manchester United, it is also about righting the wrongs. While they set a new club record by going 39 home matches unbeaten, the start of that run was pockmarked with draws against inferior – in terms of ability and resources, anyway – opponents. This could have been another. United endured stalemates with promoted clubs, in Burnley and Hull, last season. Brighton were on course to keep a first clean sheet at Old Trafford in their history until Ashley Young’s shot looped up off Lewis Dunk and flew in. “It is the sign of a good team to play poorly and yet still win,” said the full-back. “Last season we could have come away with a draw from this sort of game.” Last season, United drew 10 home league games. This season, they have a 100% winning record on their own turf. It is quite a difference. Richard Jolly • Manchester United 1-0 Brighton: Dunk own goal settles clash 6) Mahrez treading water at Leicester Riyad Mahrez showed passion and edge at the London Stadium, albeit quite a lot of it was reserved for the moment Claude Puel substituted him, drawing a notably sulky walk from the pitch. Mahrez was “disappointed” Puel said, but the fact is Arthur Masuaku and Cheikhou Kouyaté had chased him down and pushed him to the edge of this game. Mahrez has been a wonderful player for Leicester, and he showed flashes of his brilliance on the ball against West Ham. But eight goals and seven assists in a year and a half since winning player of the year is evidence of a man treading water. Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, Internazionale and Barcelona have all, reportedly, shown varying degrees of interest in the Algerian. It would surely be best for everyone now if that precious, slightly fragile talent was cashed in on sooner rather than later and Mahrez asked to stretch himself a little more. Barney Ronay • West Ham 1-1 Leicester City: Kouyaté steadies ship after threat of mutiny • Moyes’s liking for running and shouting has stirring outcome 7) Megson in the right place at the right time? If it made a refreshing change to see a West Brom manager take a post-match press conference sitting down, in contrast to the disdain evinced whenever Tony Pulis used to breeze through on foot, there was equal novelty in seeing Gary Megson occupy the chair. It would not be unfair to state that Megson, 58, is perceived to fall within the “pale, stale male” generation that – with some high-profile exceptions – are out of vogue and it was interesting to hear him talk of how, having made a number of unsuccessful job applications after leaving Sheffield Wednesday in 2012, he had resigned himself to early retirement. For the majority of managers, football tends not to look back when a career’s trajectory has stalled. So Megson relished his return to the spotlight at Wembley, where his temporary charges deserved their draw with Tottenham. He was quick to say it had whetted his appetite for a longer-term return to action and perhaps a few Championship chairmen with fingers on the trigger were paying attention to West Brom’s performance. For a short-term fix they could do worse, and so much about football management owes to cropping up in the right place at the right time. Nick Ames • Tottenham 1-1 West Brom: Kane to the rescue but Spurs drop points 8) Bony emboldens Swansea with display as skipper Re-signing Wilfried Bony was a huge gamble on Swansea’s part and it will take much more than one encouraging display against Bournemouth to vindicate that decision, yet the Ivorian’s first 90 minutes at club level for 14 months at least offered some positive signs. Wearing the captain’s armband and perhaps a little unfortunate to have a goal disallowed, Bony delivered what Paul Clement described as “a proper man’s performance”. Strong with his back to goal, Bony gave Swansea a different outlet by holding the ball up and it was a shame from Clement’s point of view that the pacey Tammy Abraham was not fit enough to start alongside him. Bony still has his own fitness issues, but there is no shortage of motivation. “It is Swansea who gave me everything that I am now,” he said. “So I just need to do my best for them to see the Bony they bought for the first time.” Stuart James • Swansea 0-0 Bournemouth: Fer miss costly but Swans stop rot 9) Hope at last for Palace before derby collision Roy Hodgson was correct in pointing out Crystal Palace have played far more convincingly over recent weeks and found wins elusive, and stressed post-match that he does “not believe in turning points”. Yet the late victory over Stoke, however fortuitous, could yet prove to be a springboard. Confidence needed pepping, and the manager’s surprise decision to drop Julian Speroni and Scott Dann did not backfire. Most significantly, Palace had a Plan B to which they could turn at the interval and will now go into their derby against Brighton with Christian Benteke firmly back in the fold. The Belgian may not have scored since May, but he is winning headers and unnerving defenders again, a focal point at the tip of this team. His relationship with Wilfried Zaha may be key in the survival bid, ensuring Palace are not reliant upon one single player for inspiration. Their hope is the recovery is under way. Dominic Fifield • Crystal Palace 2-1 Stoke City: Sakho’s injury-time goal secures win 10) Austin states his case in rout of Everton He was made to wait for almost four months but given his first league start of the season, Charlie Austin grabbed his chance with both hands. Mauricio Pellegrino was inevitably quizzed as to why it has taken so long for him to harness his striking instincts from the off. As torrid as Everton were, credit should also go to Southampton who looked like scoring every time they poured forward. For the impressive full-backs, Ryan Bertrand and Cédric Soares, utilising the ruthlessness of Austin was simply too good to pass up. Asked whether he had a point to prove, Austin said: “You could say so. But for me it was all about biding my time on the training pitch. I have got my reward, and more importantly we got the three points. It’s the first 80 minutes I’ve played since Stoke in the first game of last season and I was blowing the cobwebs off my legs.” Ben Fisher • Southampton 4-1 Everton: Toffees show zero fight or direction in defeat • Sign up to our weekly email, The Recap, here, showcasing a selection of our sport features from the past seven days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2017/nov/26/roller-review-its-theatre-as-full-contact-sport-roller-derby","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T13:31:34Z","webTitle":"Roller review – it's theatre as full-contact sport in urgent look at female power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/26/roller-review-its-theatre-as-full-contact-sport-roller-derby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/nov/26/roller-review-its-theatre-as-full-contact-sport-roller-derby","fields":{"headline":"Roller review – it's theatre as full-contact sport in urgent look at female power","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘This is a witch hunt. We are the witches, and we are coming,” say the two women towering above the stage. This pair of giantesses break the silence and command the space. They have eyes like steel, they read from books like reckoning angels and they wear long skirts and breast plates, suggesting something ancient yet futuristic. But it is the present under urgent consideration in this collaboration by Rachel Mars and Nat Tarrab, the winner of this year’s Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust award, which has been made with an all-female team. Because theatre is programmed so far in advance, it is unusual to see a show that responds so directly to the moment. Current events may cast a new light on a piece conceived months ago, but Roller is that all too rare show: one that urgently considers the now – in particular, recent accusations such as those about Harvey Weinstein, which have gone on to reveal the amount of harassment many women endure. It is magnificent, angry, slyly funny and necessary. It’s got its skates on. Mars and Tarrab utilise the all-female world of roller derby, one of the world’s fastest growing sport, and use it as a metaphor to explore how a different world might look, how a different space might operate and how anger might be most usefully channelled. There is no traditional narrative, but there is a narrative arc as the show begins with a traditional sport’s centre floor being rolled away and ends with a lone female skater holding the space, moving forward. It redraws the lines: sometimes quite vividly and in bright yellow. In between, the show has echoes of Naomi Alderman’s book The Power as it examines how women might respond to millennia of oppression. There is a great moment when Mars threatens to smash the face of a male member of the audience, which leads Tarrab to comment: “I’m just questioning whether a plan based on being angry is actual progress.” This is a show brave enough to use theatre to think out loud as it considers whether – as those playing roller derby do – it is possible to repurpose anger into strength through teamwork and reimagine the world. I loved its honesty, and the fact that it is so unapologetic. • At the Pit at the Barbican, London, until 2 December.

Ireland is seen as the key obstacle to proceeding to negotiations about a future trade relationship with the EU at a December summit, with the Irish government dissatisfied with the options offered so far to prevent a hard border with Northern Ireland. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, has said he wants a written guarantee that there will be no hard border, which Dublin believes can be achieved only by keeping the region within the single market and customs union. Fox said that option was out of the question. “We don’t want there to be a hard border, but the UK is going to be leaving the customs union and the single market,” he told Sky News’s Sunday with Niall Paterson. Government sources conceded there was still some way to go on the question of the border, compared with the other two key areas the EU has said also need to see sufficient progress, the financial settlement and the rights of EU citizens. However, the government is likely to stress the common ground on both sides, that neither side wants a hard border with Ireland or physical border infrastructure and the option to agree to Varadkar’s written guarantee has not yet been definitely ruled out. Fox said the UK had always come to special arrangements with Ireland that could be written into the final agreement but said there needed to be clarity about the future trading relationship with the EU before the border question could be settled. “We have always had exceptions for Ireland. Whether it’s in our voting rights, our rights of residence in the UK, we have always accepted a certain asymmetry and that will have to be part of whatever agreement we come to with the European Union. But we can’t come to a final answer to the Irish question until we get an idea of the end state,” he said. “And until we get into discussions with the EU on the end state that will be very difficult, so the quicker we can do that the better, and we are still in a position where the EU doesn’t want to do that.” Fox’s suggestion that a deal on the Irish border won’t be finalised until later in the negotiations does not necessarily clash with the EU’s position. The 27 member states need only “sufficient progress” to be made by the next European council summit. This will require what the Irish foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, described on Friday as “a road map” to how the British plans to avoid a hard border. Coveney also dismissed a claim from Ukip that Ireland was threatening the UK, but insisted that his country must be protected in the Brexit process. “Ireland is not threatening anybody, least of all a friend,” he said on Sunday, “but we remain resolute in our insistence on a sensible way through Brexit that protects Ireland.” It will further require recognition from Whitehall that technology is not the solution to the problem and that Northern Ireland will be given a special regulatory status, a scenario hinted at by Fox. In Brussels, however, there is a feeling that the British government has been underestimating the member states’ solidarity with the Republic on the issue. Asked whether the Irish government would be allowed to hold up the widening of talks on to trade, one EU ambassador responded: “We trust in the Irish and the commission on this. There is complete unity.” Warnings about the prospect of an Irish veto on progressing to trade talks at the December summit continued over the weekend. Ireland’s EU commissioner, Phil Hogan, told the Observer that the country would “continue to play tough to the end” over its threat to veto trade talks without border guarantees. Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, a member of Varadkar’s Fine Gael party, said she was “troubled” by Fox’s comments. “I hope that the UK is not holding the Irish situation to ransom in these negotiations. It is far too serious and far too critical,” she said. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he was concerned by Fox’s comments and they could put talks ahead of the summit in jeopardy. “The one thing that we don’t want to do is jeopardise any movement quickly, because we need movement to enable us to get into the proper trade negotiations,” he told ITV’s Peston on Sunday. “So I’m hoping that isn’t a Downing Street-sanctioned statement that’s he’s made.” Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, had earlier told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that Labour had not ruled out staying in the single market and forging a new customs union with the EU. “It’s not our call and it would be foolish of an opposition to actually put out there and say this is the solution, when we’re not in the negotiating table itself,” he said. “If we’re at the negotiating table, we can have those discussions. I’d be very happy if Theresa May wanted to move over and call that election and let us do that. But until we’re around that table it’s not sensible to say what you can get out of the negotiations, because you’re not sitting there like you and I are, looking at the whites of each other’s eyes and getting a deal.” The Democratic Unionist leader, Arlene Foster, warned that any attempt to redraw the border into the Irish Sea would be opposed to her party, which holds the balance of power at Westminster. Speaking after her party’s annual conference this weekend, Foster accused Hogan of engaging in “megaphone diplomacy” over his remarks. She said that any move to give Northern Ireland ‘special status’ and for the region to stay in the customs union would be against the principle of consent enshrined in the 1998 Good Friday agreement. The DUP leader said this would lead to a redrawing of the border. “Every business I speak to does not want a border down the middle of the Irish Sea. The UK is our biggest market,” Foster said. The DUP maintains a ‘confidence and supply’ agreement with the minority Conservative government. A similar arrangement exists in Dublin, where the largest opposition party, Fianna Fáil, has for the last 18 months supported the minority Fine Gael government in confidence motions in the Dail and as well as key legislation such as the budget earlier this autumn. That Dublin version of “confidence and supply” is breaking down over a row about a minister, a police whistleblower and a leaked email. Fine Gael insists the deputy prime minister, Frances Fitzgerald, will not be forced out of office over an email from 2015 that revealed the Garda Síochána had a strategy in place to smear a Garda officer who alleged corruption and malpractice in the force. Fitzgerald told the Dublin Sunday Independent on Sunday that she had no plans to bow to “summary justice” over demands from Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin that she should resign. While Varadkar continues to talk with the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, this weekend and early into next week, there is no sign yet of the political crisis in Dublin abating. If they reach the end of the week without an agreement and if Fianna Fáil tables a planned no confidence motion in the government, the coalition in Dublin could collapse, resulting in a Christmas general election. This would also mean Varadkar would go to the crucial EU summit on Brexit in mid-December not knowing if when he returned to Dublin he would be the country’s prime minister for much longer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/26/uk-defence-cuts-government-set-to-compromise-tory-revolt","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T21:02:34Z","webTitle":"Tory revolt could prompt compromise on defence cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/26/uk-defence-cuts-government-set-to-compromise-tory-revolt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/26/uk-defence-cuts-government-set-to-compromise-tory-revolt","fields":{"headline":"Tory revolt could prompt compromise on defence cuts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A compromise deal could soon be reached with Conservative MPs angered by further UK defence cuts, as the chair of the Commons defence committee warned that spending had dangerously downgraded the place of defence in national priorities. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, acknowledged there were tensions over the potential cuts after several MPs spoke openly about their concerns, including former army officers Johnny Mercer and Tom Tugendhat. On Sunday, Julian Lewis, the defence select committee chair, became the latest senior Tory to add his own warning about the impact of the cuts. “We now spend six times on welfare, two and a half times on education and nearly four times on health, what we spend on defence,” he wrote in a letter to the Guardian, saying the UK was now “barely achieving” the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. Lewis argued that spending needed to be increased to 3%. “Setting ourselves a spending target of 3% of GDP for defence would not by itself guarantee our security, but without such an increase there is no prospect of recruiting personnel and buying equipment on a scale sufficient to avoid the ‘hollowing-out’ of our armed forces,” he wrote. The new defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, is said to have asked for more time to respond to a security review scheduled to be announced early next year in order to get up to speed with work done under his predecessor, Michael Fallon. Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister, has signalled he may be prepared to quit over the reported proposals that could lead to a reduction in the number of army personnel to 70,000. Whitehall sources said they did not recognise the personnel proposal as an option on the table, pointing to the government’s stated objective to increase the size of the army to 82,000 from 78,000. Fox said it was an “ongoing discussion … I’m afraid it’s not unknown for some of these tensions to spill over into the public domain. “I think we should wait and see exactly what sort of compromise we reach – because that’s what it will be – and remember that the UK is the fourth biggest military budget in the world and is one of the very few Nato countries actually fulfilling promises to spend and help protect our partners,” he told Sky News. Fox said there had been similar tensions during his time as defence secretary. “There’s always a lot of tension, not just between the MoD and the Treasury, but also inside the MoD between the different parts of the armed forces, and naturally there are concerns about the future shape of that,” he said. Mercer, a member of the defence select committee, tweeted that there was significant unease across the party. “It’s a campaign, not a silver bullet, to get defence back where it needs to be,” he said. “Also worth noting this is not ‘my’ campaign or anyone else’s. it is the Conservative party as a team making sure we do the right thing for defence as a whole.” Sir Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, tweeted: “The Conservative parliamentary party has a duty now to unite against further defence cuts to capability.” Soames and 24 other Tory MPs have signed a letter to Williamson, warning about the potential loss of amphibious assault ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, saying it would “dangerously limit the array of options” available to the forces. The letter said: “We must make it clear to you that as a cohort of MPs representing a large portion of the government’s vote, we are not prepared to see the degradation of this nation’s amphibious capabilities any further in this capability review that the government is currently undertaking.” Tugendhat, who chairs the foreign affairs select committee, tweeted support for Mercer, calling the cuts “a false economy”. The Ministry of Defence said no decisions had been made. its permanent secretary, Stephen Lovegrove, said the appointment of the new secretary of state had been an unexpected delay and said Williamson had “strong views” about various aspects of the review. “The secretary of state clearly has wanted to take a little bit of time to get up to speed with the work that had been being done over the previous few months, to see whether that accorded with his own view of where he wanted to take defence. So we are in that process at the moment,” he told a Commons committee this week. Menzies Campbell, the former Liberal Democrat leader and the party’s defence spokesman, said the government needed to “listen and learn” after the criticism. “Former members of all three armed services, informed commentators, members of both houses of parliament and now a defence minister have all voiced their deepening anxieties about possible heavy cuts in the defence budget,” he said. “Reducing the army even further, cutting the Royal Marines and selling surface ships will fracture our defence capability.” The Cabinet Office review, headed by the former diplomat Mark Sedwill, is looking at 12 different strands of UK security including the intelligence services MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, but it is expected the MoD will take the brunt of any cuts. Other measures could include delaying the building of new frigates or reducing the number of F-35s for two new aircraft carriers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/26/leeds-crash-five-killed-stolen-car-hits-tree","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T09:27:11Z","webTitle":"Five killed after stolen car hits tree in Leeds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/26/leeds-crash-five-killed-stolen-car-hits-tree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/26/leeds-crash-five-killed-stolen-car-hits-tree","fields":{"headline":"Five killed after stolen car hits tree in Leeds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Five people, including three boys, have died after a stolen car hit a tree in West Yorkshire. Two 15-year-old boys were in custody following the crash on Stonegate Road in Leeds on Saturday night. The victims were a 12-year-old boy, two 15-year-old boys and two men aged 24 and 28, West Yorkshire police said. Two of them were pronounced dead at the scene and three died a short time later at hospital. A spokesman for the force said police were called at 9.54pm after a stolen Renault Clio collided with a tree. The families of the deceased have been informed. The road remains closed and a West Yorkshire police major collision inquiry team is conducting an investigation. Detectives are trying to establish whether all five victims were in the car or pedestrians at the time of the crash. It is understood that the two teenagers arrested were travelling in the stolen car. The dead boys were named locally as Ellis and Elliott Thornton, aged 12 and 15. Louise Thornton, 34, known as the boys’ godmother or Aunty Lou, said there were no words to describe the loss of the two “cheeky chappies”, , who were so loving towards their family. She said: “Elliott was very loving and very trusting. He was so proud of his family, his mum and dad and his two sisters, Ebony, 16, and Bronte, five. Ellis was the youngest and he looked up to Elliott and Ebony as well.” She added: “We are just devastated. We can’t believe they have both gone as that just doesn’t happen. We were so proud of the boys. They will be hugely missed by the family. It will leave a huge devastating void. As a family we have already been through so much. “I’m devastated. They were very well loved. We just can’t describe how much these little boys have left a big void in our family.” The vehicle had been removed from the suburban road by mid-morning on Sunday but a large gash could still be seen on the tree. Police had cordoned off a quarter-mile section of the tree-lined street, which is about three miles north of the city centre. A police spokesman said officers were confronted by a scene of “complete carnage” when they arrived at the crash site. On Sunday, neighbours described their shock at what had happened. One said he had heard a loud bang, which sounded like a firecracker. He said: “Me and my wife were watching TV sometime between 9.30pm and 10pm when we heard a loud bang. I have seen the car, which I believe had an ‘05 number plate, completely squashed. Within minutes, dozens of police cars, a fire engine and several ambulances were at the scene.” DCI Jim Griffiths, leading the investigation, said: “This is clearly a tragic incident in which five young people have lost their lives. We are currently investigating the exact circumstances of what happened. “I would like to take this opportunity to ask anyone who saw what happened or has information about it to call us on 101 quoting log 1859 of Saturday 26 November.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/27/marriage-equality-coalition-conservatives-chances-fade-before-senate-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T17:00:01Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality: Coalition conservatives' chances fade before Senate debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/27/marriage-equality-coalition-conservatives-chances-fade-before-senate-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/27/marriage-equality-coalition-conservatives-chances-fade-before-senate-debate","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality: Coalition conservatives' chances fade before Senate debate","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Senate will consider a cross-party same-sex marriage bill all this week, which marriage equality advocates expect to deliver a decisive win for the reform being legislated by Christmas. Although Coalition conservatives have signalled a willingness to fight for amendments to the cross-party bill, Labor and marriage equality advocates believe few, if any, stand a chance of winning Senate support. The Turnbull government cancelled the lower house’s sitting this week and disclosure of senators’ foreign citizenship and steps to renounce it are not due until Friday so political debate in Canberra will centre on marriage although political fallout from the Queensland election will continue. The cross-party bill, authored by the Liberal senator Dean Smith, has support from Labor, the Greens, the Nick Xenophon Team, Derryn Hinch and is also co-signed by the Liberal senators Linda Reynolds and Jane Hume, which advocates believe indicates there is little appetite even within the Coalition for major changes. Labor estimates that more than 45 senators support marriage equality and others have promised to vote yes or abstain after the postal survey returned a 61.6% vote in favour of same-sex marriage. In earlier Senate debate on the bill, the leader of the Australian Conservatives, Cory Bernardi, conceded that “this bill is going to pass” and although he would push to protect “religious freedom and freedom of speech”, he acknowledged “the numbers are against us”. “You guys have the numbers to do whatever you want with this bill– to go forward,” he said. “I would only ask that you consider some of our concerns.” Senator David Leyonhjelm has tabled amendments to allow civil celebrants and private service providers to refuse same-sex weddings but conservatives including Liberal David Fawcett have conceded they do not have the numbers to reintroduce commercial discrimination. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has attempted to head off calls for amendments first by publicly arguing the bill does not harm religious freedom then by establishing an inquiry to separately consider the issue, reporting next year. The attorney general, George Brandis, has said he will move a new amendment to allow civil celebrants to reject same-sex weddings and suggested adding a “declaratory statement” that nothing in the bill harms religious freedom in article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Marriage equality advocates believe that only that declaratory amendment and the possible extension of the category of religious marriage celebrants to new celebrants stand a chance of success. Labor has rejected demands for amendments, which could only succeed if they drew support from Coalition supporters of same-sex marriage, the crossbench including One Nation and half a dozen Labor members who have reserved their position. Nevertheless conservatives will also argue for parental rights to withdraw their children from classes that clash with their marriage views and to shield charities from possible loss of funding or charitable status. On Monday conservative Coalition ministers Angus Taylor, Zed Seselja and Michael Sukkar complained that moderates had betrayed them by backing the cross-party bill, the Australian reported. Speaking to ABC’s AM, the Liberal MP and supporter of same-sex marriage Warren Entsch said the trio had “the responsibility to talk within their portfolios” and could raise objections in the partyroom or parliament. “What I’m saying to these guys – these ministers – by all means, if you want to go chasing religious exemptions, please do so, but do us a favour and step down from your portfolios, you can do so then without breaching ministerial codes,” he said. Smith said opponents of marriage equality had “failed to substantiate their claims with clear evidence [that] existing religious freedoms in Australia’s various laws are insufficient”. On Sunday the Sunday Mail published a letter from the tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, to Smith that concluded that amending the Marriage Act would not have an effect on tax deductible status. “Similarly, lawful refusal to conduct a marriage ceremony – in accordance with the future Marriage Act – will be unlikely to effect [deductible gift recipient] endorsement,” he said. The Equality Campaign’s executive director, Tiernan Brady, told Guardian Australia the people had told parliament to “do your job, it’s time to pass marriage equality”. “We went to the bother of spending $100m asking if LGBTI Australians should be treated the same under the law of the land and the Australian people said incredibly clearly yes.” He said there was nothing to stop the prime minister’s stated ambition of legislating marriage equality by Christmas from being achieved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/26/china-kindergarten-teacher-arrested-in-abuse-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T04:28:24Z","webTitle":"China: kindergarten teacher arrested in abuse scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/26/china-kindergarten-teacher-arrested-in-abuse-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/26/china-kindergarten-teacher-arrested-in-abuse-scandal","fields":{"headline":"China: kindergarten teacher arrested in abuse scandal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police in China have detained a woman on suspicion of abusing children at a kindergarten in a case that has caused widespread anger and sparked protests at the school. The 22-year-old woman, identified only by her surname Liu, was a teacher at RYB Education, the school at the centre of the scandal. Police did not release additional information but the investigation is ongoing, and the school announced it had fired the teacher in response to the arrest. Last week reports emerged that toddlers at the nursery in Beijing’s Chaoyang district were molested, spiked with needles and drugged with mysterious white pills. RYB and its franchisees operate across 300 Chinese cities, according to its website, with 1,300 day care centres and nearly 500 kindergartens. Chaoyang district authorities have launched a review of all nurseries in the area, state media reported. But in a sign the authorities are seeking to control nationwide outrage, Chinese media have been order to stop reporting on the abuses. “Don’t report or comment on the matter of the Red Yellow Blue New World Kindergarten in Beijing’s Chaoyang district,” said one censorship directive sent to media outlets on 24 November and leaked to China Digital Times, which regularly publishes propaganda orders. Police also arrested another woman, also surnamed Liu, on suspicion of spreading “unconfirmed and illegal facts”, a catch-all euphemism that include everything from spreading rumours to disseminating information the authorities deem unfavourable. The 31-year-old has already expressed “deep regret”, according to a police statement. RYB Education is listed on the New York stock exchange and describes itself as China’s largest early childhood education service provider. Shares in the company dropped more than 38% on Friday. In response to the arrest the company said it was “deeply sorry” and added: “We must take responsibility.” RYB is cooperating with the investigation, the statement said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/26/queensland-election-coalition-downplays-federal-implications-as-it-absorbs-poor-lnp-result","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T02:35:14Z","webTitle":"Queensland election: George Christensen blames Turnbull after poor LNP result","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/26/queensland-election-coalition-downplays-federal-implications-as-it-absorbs-poor-lnp-result","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/26/queensland-election-coalition-downplays-federal-implications-as-it-absorbs-poor-lnp-result","fields":{"headline":"Queensland election: George Christensen blames Turnbull after poor LNP result","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Queensland state election was fought “overwhelmingly on state issues”, Malcolm Turnbull has said, as the federal Coalition sought to downplay the Liberal National party’s poor showing. The Nationals MP George Christensen has broken ranks, sheeting “a lot” of the blame home to the Turnbull government, but senior government members including Matt Canavan siad there was “was no real discussion of federal issues in this campaign” and the story would be different at the next federal election. Federal Labor has trumpeted the Queensland result as a vindication of premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s decision to rule out governing with One Nation and warned that the Turnbull government and Coalition MPs should be nervous that they will lose seats in Queensland at the next election. The Palaszczuk Labor government is on track to win at least 44 seats, just a few short of a majority (47) and leads in other key tossups, making it the only party in a position to reach a majority. On Sunday afternoon the ABC’s election analyst, Anthony Green, called the election for Labor, predicting it would form majority government with 48 seats. The LNP suffered a 7% swing and while One Nation increased its vote it failed to translate support into seats, losing its leader Steve Dickson and failing to elect former senator Malcolm Roberts. Christensen, who has promised to cross the floor to vote for a banking commission of inquiry and previously threatened to quit the Coalition, issued a public apology to One Nation voters for the LNP failing to “stand up more for conservative values”. “A lot of that rests with the Turnbull government, its leadership and policy direction,” he said. At a press conference in Bennelong, Turnbull said the LNP “ran a good campaign” in a “tough environment” but declined to comment further, citing the fact counting is continuing. “Neither side has a majority, so I will leave the analysis until after all the facts are in,” the prime minister said. Asked if he had harmed the LNP’s chances, Turnbull said the campaign was “overwhelmingly” fought on state issues and voters could distinguish state and federal elections. The federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, congratulated Palaszczuk on a “fantastic campaign”, noting although the final result is unknown “it’s clear that Labor is close to forming government”. “Queenslanders have put their trust in Annastacia Palaszczuk as a strong and courageous leader who refused to horse-trade her values with One Nation,” he said. “The Liberals and Nationals are suffering from one end of Australia to the other as a result of the Turnbull government.” On Sunday Canavan told ABC’s Insiders the result showed there is “a very challenging political environment, particularly in regional Queensland, where the swing against [the LNP] or the swing for the One Nation party was strong”. The resources and northern Australia minister said he would not “sugarcoat” the poor result for the LNP but blamed the conservative vote splitting between the LNP and One Nation. Canavan suggested the result will be “different at a federal election”, citing the fact the Nationals campaign separately and some LNP members sit in the Nationals party room to argue they will be able to win support in the regions. The resources minister said if Labor continued to oppose a proposed $1bn concessional loan to the Adani mine it would be “hung around their necks [like] a mill stone” and cost it support in regional Queensland. Canavan conceded the Queensland government can veto the loan to the mine, saying “they are within their rights to do that”. “I suppose the Labor party wouldn’t break another promise and backflip again,” he said, before suggesting that if the independent Rockhampton mayor, Margaret Strelow, wins the as-yet undecided seat of Rockhampton she could force Labor to rethink its opposition to the loan. The federal minister for cities and Liberal MP Angus Taylor also downplayed federal implications, noting the Coalition had a worse primary vote in Queensland elections in 1998 and 2001 but went on to win subsequent federal elections. Taylor said the Queensland election showed that if people voted “for smaller conservative parties, the unintended consequence of doing that may well be putting Labor in power or keeping Labor in power”. “The second [message] is we do have to keep this balance between urban Liberals and regional Liberals, between conservative and smaller-l classical liberals, that balance is crucial to the success of the Liberal party.” Speaking to Sky News the Labor senator and former Queensland state secretary, Anthony Chisholm, said the election was a “strong rejection of One Nation” and said the LNP campaign was “dogged” by Tim Nicholl’s refusal to rule out governing with One Nation support. Chisholm said Nicholls had run the same “hollow” lines as Malcolm Turnbull and suggested federal Coalition MPs in Flynn, Capricornia and Leichhardt should be “pretty nervous” about the state result. While the Greens failed to unseat the deputy premier, Jackie Trad, they remain in contention to win the inner Brisbane LNP seat of Maiwar. Chisholm criticised the Greens for targeting Trad while “neglecting” Maiwar. He said federally the Greens vote is not as concentrated in Brisbane as in Melbourne and predicted they would fail to pick up seats from the ALP. The federal Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, told ABC24 the result was “outstanding” for the Greens, citing double-digit swings in inner Brisbane electorates. He said the result showed voters were “sick and tired of the old parties” and did not want the Adani Carmichael coalmine to be built. Di Natale said Queenslanders and Australians “want power-sharing governments”. He suggested if the Greens win Maiwar then Palaszczuk will need to negotiate with the Greens to form government despite promises not to govern with other parties, because she could not afford to send Queenslanders back to the polls."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/25/antonio-conte-chelsea-liverpool-lucky-draw","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T21:58:18Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte: ’We dominated the game – Liverpool were lucky to draw’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/25/antonio-conte-chelsea-liverpool-lucky-draw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/25/antonio-conte-chelsea-liverpool-lucky-draw","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte: ’We dominated the game – Liverpool were lucky to draw’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Chelsea may have been indebted to an intended cross for a point at Anfield but Antonio Conte claimed Liverpool were lucky to share the spoils with his Premier League champions. The Chelsea manager thought his team dominated at Anfield, created the better chances and were unfortunate to concede Mohamed Salah’s 10th league goal of the campaign before Willian levelled in the 85th minute. Jürgen Klopp admitted they made the game difficult for Liverpool and he “could live with a point against Chelsea”, although he was not happy with the referee, Michael Oliver, and the manner of the late equaliser. Conte, who made five changes to the team who beat Qarabag in the Champions League on Wednesday, said: “I think we played in a really good way. We had a good tactical plan and it was difficult for Liverpool to make chances to score. It was a tactical decision, especially in the first half, to be very solid and then to try to be dangerous in possession. The game changed in the second half. We dominated the game and created many chances to score. Liverpool was lucky to score and then to draw.” Willian equalised with what appeared to be an attempted cross that sailed over the stranded Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal. A laughing Conte said: “I must be honest, I didn’t speak with the players about it but it’s not important, only important to score. We conceded the first goal in an unlucky way. I think it was a fair result but maybe in the end we deserved more.” Klopp claimed Oliver prevented him making a substitution, with the aim of playing five at the back, moments before Chelsea’s equaliser. “We wanted to change the situation and a player,” he said. “We would have gone five at the back and in my mind [Ragnar] Klavan would have been exactly in the position where Willian was when he crossed. But we couldn’t change the system. I have no idea why the referee said no.” The Liverpool manager also played down a heated exchange after the final whistle with Sadio Mané, an 89th-minute substitute at Anfield. Klopp said: “I was shouting at him because he was in the centre. No player is happy about that. It’s not a big thing. We could have done it in the dressing room and it would have been the same thing. Everything was sorted immediately and that’s it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/25/phil-hogan-ireland-eu-commissioner-brexit-chaos","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T22:00:36Z","webTitle":"Irish warn Theresa May: change course or risk Brexit chaos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/25/phil-hogan-ireland-eu-commissioner-brexit-chaos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/25/phil-hogan-ireland-eu-commissioner-brexit-chaos","fields":{"headline":"Irish warn Theresa May: change course or risk Brexit chaos","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Ireland’s European commissioner has urged Theresa May to change her Brexit plans dramatically to prevent a mounting crisis over the Irish border from derailing her hopes of an EU trade deal. The threat of a hard Irish border has emerged as the major obstacle to the prime minister’s aim of securing the green light for Brexit trade talks at a crucial summit only weeks away. She has effectively been handed just days to give stronger guarantees over the issue. Phil Hogan, the EU’s agriculture commissioner, told the Observer that it was a “very simple fact” that remaining inside the single market and customs union, or allowing Northern Ireland to do so, would end the standoff. Hogan warned there was “blind faith” from some UK ministers that Britain would secure a comprehensive Brexit free trade deal. He warned that Ireland would “continue to play tough to the end” over its threat to veto trade talks until it had guarantees over the border. “If the UK or Northern Ireland remained in the EU customs union, or better still the single market, there would be no border issue,” he said. “That’s a very simple fact. I continue to be amazed at the blind faith that some in London place in theoretical future free trade agreements. First, the best possible FTA with the EU will fall far short of the benefits of being in the single market. This fact is simply not understood in the UK. Most real costs to cross-border business today are not tariffs – they are about standards, about customs procedures, about red tape. These are solved by the single market, but not in an FTA.” The Irish government wants a written guarantee that there will be no hard border with Northern Ireland, something Dublin believes can only be achieved, in effect, by keeping the region within the single market and customs union. However, the Democratic Unionist party, whose support is propping up May’s government, warned on Saturday it would never accept a post-Brexit deal that would effectively see a customs border pushed back to the Irish Sea. May has repeatedly made clear Britain will leave the single market and customs union. The Irish crisis came as Britain’s former EU ambassador, Sir Ivan Rogers, warned May’s Brexit strategy was “an accident waiting to happen”. Speaking after a speech at Hertford College, Oxford, he said completing the Brexit process was “guaranteed” to take a decade. He said that the prime minister’s unrealistic hopes of securing a bespoke trade deal meant a car crash in the next few months was “quite likely”. “The internal market is an extraordinarily complex international law construct that simply doesn’t work in a way that permits the type of options that the current government is pushing for,” he said. “So there is an accident waiting to happen ... and it is going to happen because the other side is going to put on a table a deal which looks broadly like a Canada or a Korea deal. “The only safe way to leave without enormous turbulence and trouble over a lengthy transitional period is to have a reasonable slope ... take your time and try and go for as smooth a glide path as possible from here to the mid-2020s. I can guarantee you that this is going to take a decade to do. We will not have reached a new equilibrium in British economics and politics until 2030.” Hogan warned Britain may struggle to keep the 59 trade deals it now has through the EU on the same terms. “The UK would be running to stand still,” he said. “When it comes to trying to negotiate new FTAs with the rest of the world, Britain will be pushed around the way the EU – with currently more than eight times the UK population – will never be. “The US have already started their attack on standards, so chlorine chicken and hormone beef for the British Sunday roast post-Brexit? India will insist on visas that the UK can never give. Australia and New Zealand are a long way away and of very limited economic interest. And any deal with China will be a one-way street in terms of costs and benefits for the UK.” Ministers are under mounting pressure to come clean over the extent of economic damage that a “no deal” outcome could cause to the economy. In the budget, Philip Hammond announced that the Office for Budget Responsibility revised downwards forecasts for UK growth over the next few years, mainly because of concerns of low productivity growth. But the OBR made clear that these downgrades were premised on a benign outcome to Brexit negotiations. Both the Treasury, privately, and leading independent economists recognise that actual growth will be considerably lower than the gloomy budget projections if the UK does not achieve most of its negotiating goals, or if there is a “no deal” result. Government sources said ministers would this week release sections of assessments into the potential economic impact of Brexit carried out across Whitehall, which until recently they had tried to keep secret. Many MPs believe the published sections will be heavily redacted and will not make clear the extent of potential economic damage. Last night Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, said it was essential that as many projections as possible were made public. The latest work by economists at the London School of Economics estimates that, if the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal, the impact will be far more severe than the projections in the budget suggested. Thomas Sampson of the LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance said Brexit could reduce UK living standards by up to 9% in the most pessimistic case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/26/shirley-porter-westminster-housing-grenfell","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T00:05:39Z","webTitle":"Shirley Porter’s London housing scandal to be relived on stage near Grenfell Tower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/26/shirley-porter-westminster-housing-grenfell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/26/shirley-porter-westminster-housing-grenfell","fields":{"headline":"Shirley Porter’s London housing scandal to be relived on stage near Grenfell Tower","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A play about a notorious social housing scandal is to be staged in a new theatre close to the site of the Grenfell Tower block in June – a year on from the fire that killed 71 people. Shirleymander, by Gregory Evans, will tell the story of Westminster City Council in the 1980s, when the Tory council leader Shirley Porter was found to have operated a deliberate policy of altering the makeup of marginal wards to protect her power base. In 2004, she personally had to pay back £12.3m after her “gerrymandering” strategy was judged to have “forced homeless families to substandard housing in order to manipulate the borough’s voting demographic”. The play will have its first read-through with the full cast in Kensington later this week. Evans’s work was inspired by Today journalist Andrew Hosken’s 2006 book Nothing Like a Dame and was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2009, starring Tracy-Ann Oberman as Porter. Next year, Oberman is to take the title role again at the Playground Theatre, playing a character the author has described as “vain, arrogant, bullying and desperate to keep the borough from falling into the hands of her arch-enemies, the socialists”. Porter, who now lives mainly in Israel, was found to have sold council homes in marginal wards to prospective Tory voters and to have pushed 122 homeless families likely to vote Labour out of eight marginal seats. They were moved to tower blocks the council knew were contaminated with asbestos. The daughter of Tesco founder Jack Cohen, she had been at the heart of Margaret Thatcher’s Tory party and says criticisms of her council leadership were politically motivated. The new co-artistic director of the Playground Theatre, Anthony Biggs, has chosen Evans’s play as his opening production because of similarities he sees with the housing policies later followed by Kensington council. “We began talking with Greg about his play and discussing the parallels. What Westminster did back then is actually the kind of thing that just happens in councils anyway now, without anyone having to say what they want to happen. We have timed the play to run during the anniversary of the fire, which will obviously be a very poignant time.” Biggs also sees echoes of the wider political climate in the 1980s. “It was a barmy, polarised time then, with Dame Shirley pursuing her ideas in Westminster and then Ken Livingstone in charge of the city as a whole.” The Playground Theatre, recently refurbished, aims to work with the local community. After the fire, it ran a series of workshops for residents with a group called Grief Encounter to help them cope with the disaster. Porter, 86, is thought to have written her own account of the events that brought about her downfall, but has promised her children she will not attempt to publish it because it would bring the issue back into the headlines. “The book was written because I wanted to give my side of what happened,” she said eight years ago. “I was a magistrate for many years, so I was enormously shattered by what I felt was the huge injustice of it all. I wrote the book to set the record straight and also because it acted as catharsis.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2017/nov/28/life-is-good-in-australia-so-why-dont-women-feel-safe-walking-home","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T17:00:06Z","webTitle":"Life is good in Australia – so why don't women feel safe walking home? | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/nov/28/life-is-good-in-australia-so-why-dont-women-feel-safe-walking-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2017/nov/28/life-is-good-in-australia-so-why-dont-women-feel-safe-walking-home","fields":{"headline":"Life is good in Australia – so why don't women feel safe walking home?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The latest release of the OECD’s Better Life Index shows that Australia remains a very wealthy nation with generally good health but that we continue to have a poor work-life balance, despite that being the area we rank most highly. Perhaps worst of all, however, Australian women, more than just about any other nation in the OECD, feel unsafe walking home alone at night. The common refrain about GDP is that it measures everything except what is important. Even GDP per capita is a pretty poor measure of people’s livelihoods – given it says nothing about income or gender inequality, let alone aspects such as health and safety, the environment or education. The OECD has, since 2011, attempted to provide a more expansive measure of wellbeing with its Better Life Index. The index looks at data across a range of categories, from income and employment to job strain, personal safety, life satisfaction, housing and civic engagement. The latest annual report has just been issued and it finds that on average Australia comes in third among OECD nations, just behind Norway and Denmark and just ahead of Sweden and Canada. However, Australia comes in third only when equal weight is given to all categories – including, for instance, civic engagement. We have a high score for civic engagement because the measure used for this is voter turnout. Given we have compulsory voting, our civic engagement is thus perhaps artificially high. However, as the 79.5% turnout for the recent marriage equality poll showed, even when voting is not compulsory our turnout remains well above the OECD average: While Australia looks a great place to live (when all categories are given equal weight) we ourselves would not rank Australia so highly – because people do not weight matters such as civic engagement as highly as they do health or life satisfaction. Since the OECD has been running its Better Life Index it has allowed people to rank the categories in order of preference. And while the rankings are not a perfect representation of the nation – given as they only include those who share their rankings on the OECD site – they do give us some indication of where people’s preferences lie. Perhaps not surprisingly people across all OECD nations rank civic engagement as the least important category. Only 6.8% of Australians regarded the category as the most important – well below the 11.9% who chose work-life balance. Interestingly, the three categories Australians chose as most important are different from those chosen by people from the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and Germany: Were we to order the Better Life Index according to the preferences given by Australians, our rank among OECD nations would likely drop, from third to eighth. This is because rating work-life balance as the most important, and civic engagement as the least important, means Australia performs above-average in the category it doesn’t consider important, and below-average in the category it does. Across the OECD, Australia has the fifth highest percentage of people working more than 50 hours a week, and among those nations with available data, the second lowest for average time each day devoted to leisure and personal care: If we ranked the categories according to Australian preferences, Norway would keep the top spot, followed by Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Canada and Finland. It would appear that Australians (or at least those who have used the OECD index) like the idea of the Scandinavian lifestyle. It is a good reminder that income does not always lead to higher life satisfaction. Australia has a higher level of average disposable income, average net wealth and average earnings than all of the nine nations that record a higher level of life satisfaction, except for Norway and Switzerland: The data also suggest that while inequality may have been rising in Australia, it remains around the average of the OECD, and well below the levels of the US: We are also a nation that loves our big houses. Excluding the bathroom, toilet, kitchenette, scullery/utility rooms and garages, Australian have on average 2.3 rooms per person – the fourth highest among the OECD – behind only Canada, the US and New Zealand, reflecting perhaps the ability of those nations to have much larger houses due to area size and lower population density than Japan, Korea and the European nations. Despite this, our housing costs – in terms of ongoing expenses rather than actual cost of the house – remains low among the OECD: One ongoing issue for Australians, somewhat surprisingly, remains personal safety. Despite very good results on life expectancy, personal health and the homicide rate, only 63.6% of Australians feel safe when walking home at night. This score is well below the OECD average and well behind nations such as the US (74.1%), the UK (77.4%) and Canada (80.9%): One reason it might be somewhat surprising to me is that, as a man, it is much less of an issue for me personally. The OECD Better Life Index also breaks down the data according to gender. Overall, Australia does quite well on gender inequality (relatively speaking). While Australian women earn on average only 87% what men do per hour, that is above the OECD average. While there is a smaller percentage of women than men aged 25-64 who have upper secondary or higher education, the report notes that Australian “men and women are almost equal in terms of time off, and Australian women are less likely than men to work very long hours”. But where Australia really falls down on gender disparity is in feeling safe. While Australian men feel above-average safety, only women in Chile, Mexico and Hungary feel less safe walking home alone at night. For every 10 Australian men who say they feel safe walking home at night there are only 6.3 women who would say the same – the worst gender differential in the OECD: The Better Life Index remains a good attempt to quantify those things in life that matter besides how much production is occurring in the economy. And while, as with any such measures, there will be argument over the choice of data used to measure each category, what the index does highlight is that how you rank the quality of your life depends not only on what you consider important but also on who you are."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/27/triple-j-moves-hottest-100-from-australia-day-after-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"Triple J moves Hottest 100 from Australia Day after protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/27/triple-j-moves-hottest-100-from-australia-day-after-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/27/triple-j-moves-hottest-100-from-australia-day-after-protests","fields":{"headline":"Triple J moves Hottest 100 from Australia Day after protests","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Triple J has moved the Hottest 100 music countdown so it no longer falls on Australia Day, the radio station has announced. For 2018 and 2019 the countdown will be held on the fourth weekend of January, it confirmed. The 2019 event will still be on the Australia Day long weekend, but the exact date of the Hottest 100 would be announced after next year’s countdown, Triple J newsreader Avani Dias said. Almost 65,000 people voted in the radio station’s nationwide survey, which was prompted by debate over the appropriateness of holding the countdown on a day that marks the beginning of British invasion and colonisation. According to independent analysis of the responses, 60% voted in favour of changing the date, while 29% said they did not support the change. A second poll of more than 700 18-to-30-year-olds validated the results – 55% said the Hottest 100 should move. “We all agreed that the Hottest 100 shouldn’t be part of a debate about the day it’s on,” a statement from Triple J said. “The only debate should be about the songs.” On Monday afternoon, program director Ollie Wards noted that 25% of the younger survey respondents didn’t care either way. “For the people who did not want this day to move, we have heard you,” he said on Triple J. He said he hoped those worried they would miss out on listening on a day off would get to hear part of the weekend broadcast. “It does go for eight hours, so hopefully you can get amongst it,” he said. “To those who said this was political correctness gone mad, we are trying to do this to stop the Hottest 100 being a part of a political discussion and political debate.” Triple J’s survey followed a period of consultation with Indigenous and non-Indigenous musicians, groups and other community leaders and representative bodies about Australia Day and the implications of holding the music countdown on that date. Reconciliation Australia, the National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples, Recognise and the National Australia Day Council were among the national bodies consulted. The station said that as a public broadcaster it did not take a view in the debate, but the Hottest 100 had increasingly become a symbol of Australia Day, despite having no official connection. “The Hottest 100 wasn’t created as an Australia Day celebration. It was created to celebrate your favourite songs of the past year. It should be an event that everyone can enjoy together – for both the musicians whose songs make it in and for everyone listening in Australia and around the world,” the statement said. In the months leading up to voting on last year’s poll, the release of the song January 26 by AB Original featuring Dan Sultan galvanised support for changing the date of Australia Day – and some opposition. The two members of AB Original, Indigenous hip-hop artists Briggs and Trials, added their calls for the date of the Hottest 100 to change. Late last year, Briggs said it would be “an obvious salute” to the duo. “That’s solidarity right there, for something that would ... be the right thing to do. That’s a conversation that we should all be having with why we are celebrating that day.” The song – which has won a slew of awards in the last year – polled in the top 20 of last year’s Hottest 100. On Monday Briggs and Trials responded to the news Triple J was changing its date. Mitch Fifield, the federal communications minister, reportedly said he was “bewildered” by the decision to move the Hottest 100. “The ABC shouldn’t be buying into this debate. Australia Day is our national day. The ABC should honour it and not mess with the Hottest 100,” he said. In its statement Triple J said the Hottest 100 was not connected to Australia Day, and moving it would free the station up to “to celebrate Australia Day as its own event too”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/27/malcolm-turnbull-says-a-vote-for-one-nation-is-a-vote-for-labor","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T03:56:05Z","webTitle":"Malcolm Turnbull says a vote for One Nation is a vote for Labor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/27/malcolm-turnbull-says-a-vote-for-one-nation-is-a-vote-for-labor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/27/malcolm-turnbull-says-a-vote-for-one-nation-is-a-vote-for-labor","fields":{"headline":"Malcolm Turnbull says a vote for One Nation is a vote for Labor","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Liberal frontbencher Simon Birmingham has warned the Coalition won’t counter the electoral threat from One Nation by mirroring its worldview, and Malcolm Turnbull says a vote for One Nation is a vote for putting Labor into power. Moderate Liberals have warned against cosying up to Pauline Hanson’s party as the results of the Queensland election – in which One Nation fractured the conservative vote in the regions – cause ructions in Canberra and embolden the National party to pursue more obvious product differentiation. Birmingham said the Coalition would not counter the One Nation insurgency “by trying to become One Nation-lite”. “You do it by taking the fight up to them in terms of explaining to the electorate the benefits of open markets, the benefits of trade, the benefits that will accrue to those communities because we’re increasing exports and generating more jobs, the risks to them if we actually get pushed into becoming a closed shop economy,” he said. Victorian Liberals also warned associating with One Nation was damaging for the Liberal and National parties. The Liberal MP Tim Wilson said any association with Hanson’s party was “toxic” and fellow Victorian Russell Broadbent said the Victorian branch of the Liberal party had “always” put One Nation last on how-to-vote cards. “I would expect that to continue in Victoria,” Broadbent said. There is renewed speculation about a demerger between the Liberal and National parties in Queensland following the disappointing weekend result for the LNP. The two parties are a single entity in Queensland. On Sunday the resources minister, Queensland National Matt Canavan, emphasised the importance of having a “strong Nationals party” and a separate campaign at the federal level to show voters they had a “strong voice in Canberra”. But the prime minister on Monday said the LNP in Queensland was functioning very well. Turnbull said the LNP had been a “great success” in Queensland and he did not think there was any initiative to change that. Turnbull also sharpened his message about the risks for conservative-leaning voters in supporting One Nation. “Voting for One Nation in the Queensland election has only assisted the Labor party, let’s be very clear about that,” Turnbull said on Monday. “The One Nation voters, I want to say to them, your votes for One Nation have assisted Annastacia Palaszczuk.” He said the Coalition would make that point “very, very strongly” at the next federal election. “If you want to have a Coalition government, then you should vote for the Coalition, vote for the LNP in Queensland, and the Liberal party or National party elsewhere. That is the only way to be sure you get and keep a Coalition government. “Voting for One Nation, as we’ve seen in the Queensland election, has only benefited Annastacia Palaszczuk and the Labor party”. Fraser Anning, who was sworn in as a federal senator for One Nation before exiting the party, also criticised his former colleagues about the preference strategy they followed during the Queensland poll. “This crazy policy of indiscriminately preferencing against sitting members means that lefties will be returning to George Street and good conservatives will lose their seats, compliments of a supposedly rightwing party,” Anning said Monday. “As the conservative protest party, you would expect One Nation would be supporting the most conservative candidates or members in each seat. “That’s what I would do and I’m sure it’s what a majority of One Nation voters want.” The former prime minister, Tony Abbott, told 2GB the Queensland poll was largely fought on state issues but “background influences” could not be ruled out. With instability in the government continuing as the Coalition fronts up for the final two parliamentary sitting weeks of the year, and the results of two byelections triggered by the citizenship debacle due over the coming weeks, Abbott also observed the coup culture in Canberra had to end. Declaring the “the era of the political assassin has to end”, Abbott – who has not ruled out a return to the Liberal party leadership if he were to be drafted – said dishonourable behaviour in Canberra was turning voters off. Abbott said voters were switching off when they saw politicians “acting dishonourably … People are behaving badly”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/30/omar-musa-genocide-is-the-basis-for-racism-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T17:00:05Z","webTitle":"Omar Musa: Genocide is the basis for racism in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/30/omar-musa-genocide-is-the-basis-for-racism-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/30/omar-musa-genocide-is-the-basis-for-racism-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Omar Musa: Genocide is the basis for racism in Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Being a migrant in Australia, according to the author, rapper and poet Omar Musa, is a lot like constantly applying for a visa to somewhere you already grew up. In twin releases due at the end of this month – a book of poetry, Millefiori, and a hip-hop album, Since Ali Died – Musa speaks of seeing too many non-white Australians caught out in the trap of the model minority: where you can spend your whole life trying to fit in, only to discover that some people never thought you belonged. “I was thinking a lot about what Yassmin Abdel-Magied went through, or is going through,” he tells Guardian Australia. “Early on, Yassmin was embraced as a very fun and friendly and vivacious presence – and she is – but as soon as she was perceived to have put a foot wrong, all of a sudden she wasn’t Australian anymore. She was demonised and people were baying for her blood. “I’m an Asian-Australian and that has always been considered the model minority: working hard, putting your head down. But I’m also Muslim and that’s kind of the opposite: one of the most demonised minorities.” The Malaysian-Australian writer, who was raised in Queanbeyan on the outskirts of Canberra, says the album’s lead single, Assimilate, also grapples with how the racism experienced by migrants stems from the colonisation of Indigenous people. Monday’s announcement that Triple’s Hottest 100 will be moved from Australia Day on January 26 – a shift that Musa credits to the activism of Indigenous musicians – came as a timely reminder of music’s capacity to create change. “It’s pretty exciting to see that artists can lead the way,” he says. “Surely it’s been a long time coming but that sort of sustained pressure, things like A.B. Original’s [song] January 26 were so important. People are clearly listening to Aboriginal artists and what they have called for for a long time. ... One small win can’t change the fact that the national day of this country still happens on a day that commemorates genocide and invasion. It’s not the be all and end all but symbols matter and it shapes our narrative.” On Assimilation, Musa says it was crucial he included an Aboriginal voice, and performed alongside Indigenous rapper Tasman Keith. “When talking about assimilation in this country, [the Indigenous perspective is] the most important perspective. Genocide sets the basis of racial discrimination in this country. As much as Muslims can be demonised, that’s something I can never forget.” A few years go, Musa says he was offered an Australia Day ambassadorship and turned it down. He was flooded with online abuse as a result, saying he was proof of why Muslims shouldn’t be let into Australia. “You can speak English as well as anyone,” Musa says. “You can be smart and friendly and part of the mainstream but, deep down, there are a lot of people who don’t consider you to be legitimately Australian and are willing to throw you in the trash.” Taken together, Musa’s poetry and music are concerned with the way racist and misogynistic language impacts marginalised communities. “I see what [author and commentator] Don Watson would call a degradation of public language,” he says. “On one end is this hazy, cloudy, bureaucratic jargon, which conceals the truth and means we can never quite pin down what a politician or a bureaucrat is exactly saying. It has a narcotic affect on us that leads to apathy. “On the other extreme, politicians use jingoism and the most destructive sledgehammer-type language to bang us over the head. These things combined leave us incapable of action and understanding. I see it as a responsibility of the writers and poets to come up with new forms of language that can slice through this type of public language that we see.” He picks up specifically on the functions of misogynistic language in his poem The Boys, “They whip words into the cake mix – slut, bitch, whore, lowy, ganga, mutt ... Enraged at the thought that things might change”. “I don’t see it as separate that I grew up using words like slut, bitch and whore, and that we have a structure that allows a 17% gender pay gap or casual violence against women,” he says. “It’s a different facet of the same beast. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve thought hip-hop doesn’t just have to be a mirror, it can also be a projection of what the world could be. If we look at it through the lens of equity and justice, we have to brave enough to hold ourselves to account.” For Musa, the way forward lies with the people he calls circuit-breakers. For him, they were his parents, and also legendary boxer Muhammad Ali. “Quite early in my life, there was a kid at my primary school who would really bully me a lot and always say that my skin was the same colour as shit. One day I told my parents I wish I was white and that’s the only time in my life that I said that. “What a horrible thing that is, feeling so othered that you literally want to change your skin to fit into the mainstream, that at such a young age I could have internalised that hate.” Soon after, his parents introduced him to Ali – “a charismatic, handsome black boxer” who “taught me to be proud of my skin and Muslim faith”. He says he sees circuit-breakers among young people and can only hope to become one himself. “I see something like the Bankstown poetry slam and there’s so many people doing it who have been so demonised and demoralised for so many years, post 9/11 and Cronulla riots, bravely and proudly telling their stories. Maybe that kind of attitude will bleed into other areas of public life.” • Millefiori by Omar Musa is out now through Penguin.

The red card against Scotland did make a difference but, as New Zealand showed against the Lions, you can make yourselves difficult to beat when that is the case. Australia’s autumn has been a mixed bag. It started off with an impressive win in Cardiff and things could have panned out a bit differently against England, but then they were thrashed in Scotland. The thing for Australia is that they need their strongest XV against the big boys or they will struggle. Reece Hodge impressed and, while they will miss Stephen Moore’s experience, they will welcome David Pocock back with open arms. England Satisfied is the word I would use to describe how Eddie Jones will be feeling. As expected, they went through unbeaten and Jones got to have a look at a few fringe players – Henry Slade, Sam Simmonds and Charlie Ewels – because two years out from the World Cup, that is what you want to do. For the last 20-30 minutes against Australia they were very good but they were patchy against Argentina and a few mistakes were inevitable against Samoa given the changes. Paul Gustard will be pretty happy with where England are defensively but in attack they were just a bit patchy. Eddie has shown that he is trying to play an attacking style but it is built around a really strong defence and set-piece. That is something England have traditionally had because that is what wins tournaments. France They did show some flashes of brilliance – a bit of that French flair – in the two matches against New Zealand, and if you are a supporter you would have to hang on to the fact that there are a lot of injuries and there are some very good young players coming through. With Guy Novès in charge, though, there does not seem to be a massive buy-in to what he is trying to do and a draw with Japan is a really disappointing result. They have lost at home as well against a very poor South Africa side and you wonder whether there needs to be a change. Would that get a reaction and allow someone else to push these youngsters through a bit more? Ireland The biggest game for Ireland was South Africa first up and they put a massive marker down there. What has impressed me most, though, is that they have blooded a few young players too – Jacob Stockdale has had a fantastic autumn – because the danger for Ireland was that they were becoming an ageing group. Without matches against New Zealand or Australia it means Joe Schmidt has gone quietly about his business. Ireland are a very hard team to play against and that bodes well for big tournaments. You still think of them as playing that territorial game through Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray but they can be very inventive as well. New Zealand We can safely say that Rieko Ioane has been the star find of the year for the All Blacks. It all started with the Blues against the Lions and he has massively kicked on from there. It was such a commanding performance from him against Wales – he looks beyond his years, just like Doug Howlett and Joe Rokocoko did. Steve Hansen has urged him to keep engaged in the game more and it is paying off. On the whole, New Zealand have managed this tour really well, with six or seven front‑line players back at home. Hansen can definitely be satisfied. Scotland Just a fantastic result against Australia and they will be gutted the Six Nations does not start next week. We have seen that scoring tries against 14 men can be difficult but Gregor Townsend has really added to the work Vern Cotter had done. There is huge attacking intent, massive work-rate and the skill levels have massively improved. They clearly learned a lot defensively from what happened in the Samoa game and they really tightened up – and the best thing about it is, against the All Blacks and Australia they were also a delight to watch. They have really got it right in this autumn. South Africa They are in a fair bit of trouble because the off-field problems are filtering down on to the pitch. They need to sort out the political stuff, who is running the team and who is in charge of selection, because they have had a really poor tour. They were beaten up by Ireland and that used to be South Africa’s bread and butter. If you can match them physically then you are 80% towards winning the match and there seems to be a bit of a soft underbelly if you get into them. They need to find their identity – are they going to play the expansive game with Elton Jantjies or the kicking game with Handré Pollard? But before anything else, the off-field problems need to be solved. Wales The question was whether Wales would revert to type in the face of New Zealand pressure, and all credit to them, they did not. Even though results have not gone the way they wanted, the way they have performed will give them a lot of optimism going into the South Africa game and then the Six Nations. But it still comes down to the skill level. They were in with a sniff against the All Blacks and then all of a sudden they are 12 points down and you are wondering how it happened. It was 33-18 at the end and you are thinking how did it get to that? But the attacking intent was there, the skill levels just need to improve. • Sign up to our weekly email, The Recap, here, showcasing a selection of our sport features from the past seven days"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/28/arias-2017-gang-of-youths-poised-for-wins-at-australias-biggest-music-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T17:00:06Z","webTitle":"Arias 2017: Gang of Youths poised for wins at Australia's biggest music awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/28/arias-2017-gang-of-youths-poised-for-wins-at-australias-biggest-music-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/28/arias-2017-gang-of-youths-poised-for-wins-at-australias-biggest-music-awards","fields":{"headline":"Arias 2017: Gang of Youths poised for wins at Australia's biggest music awards","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In a recent interview, Gang of Youths’ frontman, David Le’aupepe made reference to the “arc” of his, life. “The whole point of [Gang of Youths’ latest album] Go Farther in Lightness was to make … the arc of my life, more or less, about the process of repairing,” he told the Music. It makes sense that Le’aupepe, lead singer of the Sydney five-piece, thinks of his life like a story, with character arcs, emotional journeys and Big Themes. The band’s albums are constructed like Homeric poems, full of lessons and trials and tests. They are grand indie epics made in the image of Arcade Fire’s Funeral and Bruce Springsteen’s Born to Run, which – coupled with electrifying live shows – have poised the band to clear up at Tuesday night’s Aria awards. Gang of Youths are nominated in eight categories, including the coveted album of the year, best group, best rock album and best live act. But any wins will just be icing for the group, who have sprinted from Sydney buzz-band to festival headliners in little over three years. The Positions, the band’s debut album, dealt with a litany of tragedies and upsets, including Le’aupepe’s wife’s cancer diagnosis, the breakup of his marriage and his 2014 suicide attempt. But it is also an aggressively welcoming record, which exudes warmth; imagining life as a story arc, Le’aupepe knows how to recast personal tragedy as wisdom, fable or even comedy. Le’aupepe’s humour and charisma have made him a cultish, obsessed-over figure for fans. Some of his band – which comprises Fijian guitarist Joji Malani, Korean-American keyboardist Jung Kim, Kiwi bassist Maxwell Dunn and Polish Australian Donnie Borzestowski on drums – met in an evangelical church as children and, as a frontman, Le’aupepe seems like a character straight out of a YA novel: the mysterious new kid at school who wins over the cohort. He’s fond of namedropping Kierkegaard and Philip Glass and sounding off about racism (Le’aupepe himself has a Jewish mother and Samoan father) and his technical ability is both immense and far-sweeping – all the string arrangements on their second record, Go Farther in Lightness, were his. Go Farther in Lightness made its debut at No 1 this year and the band upgraded to 5,000+ capacity venues, including Melbourne’s Festival Hall and Sydney’s Hordern Pavilion. The record is less tortured than The Positions but it’s still by no means conceptually light; at an hour and 17 minutes, it’s a long journey but Le’aupepe knows how to build that story. Also in contention for Aria awards is Indigenous hip-hop duo AB Original, who will be ones to watch for politics at the podium. Their debut, Reclaim Australia, is an explosive, charged record that tackled racism, deaths in custody and police brutality, and won them album of the year last week at Triple J’s J awards. On Monday the youth radio station announced it would move the Hottest 100 from Australia Day, after a protracted public debate that was galvanised by AB Original’s track January 26. Paul Kelly – the statesman of Australian rock and storytelling – is nominated for seven awards, after a surprisingly big year. Life is Fine was Kelly’s 23rd studio album but his first to debut at No 1. His national album tour ends next month at a sold-out stadium show in Melbourne, where he will be supported by Gang of Youths. Amy Shark, nominated for six awards, is another serious Aria contender. The Gold Coast singer-songwriter came second in this year’s Hottest 100 with her track Adore. Since then, she has played a run of dates in the US supporting Bleachers, the main project of Taylor Swift and Lorde collaborator Jack Antonoff, and made her US late-night debut on the Late Show with James Corden this month. The event will feature performances from former One Direction member Harry Styles, New Zealand pop star Lorde, AB Original and Daryl Braithwaite, who is being inducted to the Hall of Fame. And with Rebel Wilson, Ruby Rose, Sophie Monk and Jimmy Barnes also in attendance, Guardian Australia will there with all the tough questions. Many of which will be about birds. • The 2017 Aria awards will be broadcast on Nine from 7.30pm. Guardian Australia will be liveblogging from around 4pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/27/banking-royal-commission-another-national-signals-support-as-christensen-launches-site","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T08:22:20Z","webTitle":"Banking royal commission: another National signals support as Christensen launches site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/27/banking-royal-commission-another-national-signals-support-as-christensen-launches-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/27/banking-royal-commission-another-national-signals-support-as-christensen-launches-site","fields":{"headline":"Banking royal commission: another National signals support as Christensen launches site","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A banking inquiry is closer to becoming reality, with another lower house National party MP signalling he is on board. After Barnaby Joyce suggested early on Monday that the Nationals might switch positions on the banking inquiry when the party room meets next Monday, the dissident MP George Christensen launched a website in support of the probe and fellow Queenslander Llew O’Brien signalled to colleagues he was likely to support it, too. After telegraphing his view to colleagues, O’Brien later told the Australian he was “looking favourably” on the inquiry proposal. But while parliamentary numbers are building to make the inquiry a reality, National party MPs remain divided over whether or not an inquiry is a good idea. The Queensland federal cabinet minister Matt Canavan said he was not a supporter of an inquiry, although he understood many colleagues were. Liberals were also holding the line on Monday, with the government leader in the Senate, George Brandis, declaring a royal commission into the banks would deliver nothing beyond more beach houses for the lawyers appearing before it. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, noted a banking inquiry had not been a live issue during the Queensland election. With the LNP’s poor showing in the Queensland election emboldening National MPs in Canberra, the Queensland senator Barry O’Sullivan said the state election result reinforced his intention to push forward with his private member’s bill for a parliamentary inquiry into the banks. Christensen also launched a new website promoting the case for a royal commission into the banks, asking voters to sign a petition. “By signing this petition and telling your story, you are sending a very strong message to my federal government colleagues and it’s the message I will be sharing with them in Canberra next week,” Christensen said in a statement. “Unless the government acts to establish a royal commission, I will be acting before the end of this year to vote for a commission of inquiry into the banks.” Joyce faces the voters in New England this Saturday in a byelection. He told Guardian Australia on Monday it was possible the Nationals could agree as a group to pursue the inquiry next Monday, when the House of Representatives is scheduled to sit. But even if they do not, O’Sullivan currently has the numbers in the Senate to pass his private member’s bill because he has support from Labor and the Greens. The question to date has been would the O’Sullivan proposal have the numbers in the House of Representatives but Christensen and O’Brien give the rebellion a good prospect of success. The dissidents need 76 votes in the House to suspend the standing orders and bring the bill on for debate, and there is support for the inquiry from Labor and from sections of the crossbench. While some Nationals are determined enough to break ranks in the event their party doesn’t flip on the issue, other Nationals remain unconvinced. The Liberal National party MP David Littleproud told Guardian Australia he did not think a commission of inquiry was necessary but if the party room decided to support O’Sullivan’s bill he would support it in the House of Representatives. Nationals MP Mark Coulton said he did not think an inquiry was necessary either, because he felt it was being pursued for political reasons than that practical ones. He would withhold his support for the idea. Nationals MP Michael McCormack said he did not want to speculate on the party room discussion. Nationals MP Damian Drum said he was unhappy with the way O’Sullivan was trying to force the issue into the House of Representatives with a private member’s bill, rather than going through the party room. He said voters needed to know that it was not National party policy to pursue a banking inquiry. Nationals MP Andrew Broad said few of his constituents had raised concerns about the banking industry, because the Victorian Coalition government had introduced a farm debt remediation process and that had been “very helpful”. But he said he would listen to what his colleagues had to say in next week’s party room meeting. “I trust the judgment of my colleagues. That’s how a good party should work.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/27/china-ruthless-campaign-evict-beijings-migrant-workers-condemned","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T03:37:04Z","webTitle":"China: 'ruthless' campaign to evict Beijing's migrant workers condemned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/27/china-ruthless-campaign-evict-beijings-migrant-workers-condemned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/27/china-ruthless-campaign-evict-beijings-migrant-workers-condemned","fields":{"headline":"China: 'ruthless' campaign to evict Beijing's migrant workers condemned","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than a hundred Chinese intellectuals and scholars have decried a “ruthless” campaign to evict thousands of migrant workers from Beijing. The latest round of evictions began in the wake of a fire on 18 November that killed 19 people in an industrial neighbourhood in south Beijing, and 17 of the victims were migrants. City officials have declared a 40-day campaign against “illegal structures”, which for years have housed the millions of migrant workers who run Beijing’s restaurants, delivery companies, construction sites, retail shops and a host of small factories. The open letter, which was addressed to the country’s leadership and circulated on Chinese social media, called the evictions “a serious trampling of human rights”. Signatories included professors, researchers, poets and artists and more names continued to be added. It criticised the lack of due process and rapid speed at which the campaign was being implemented. Videos and photos posted on social media showed streets clogged with clothes and other belongings after migrants were given just minutes to pack up. Many who had lived in the Chinese capital for years were only allowed to take what they could carry before police sealed entire buildings. Authorities reportedly cut water and electrical service in some cases. “Any civilised and law abiding society cannot tolerate this, we must clearly condemn and oppose these actions,” the letter said. The haphazard nature of the mass evictions make it difficult to determine exactly how many people have been displaced. Migrants are being forced from their homes at the start of Beijing’s winter and temperature have hovered around freezing for the past week. China operated a national “household registration” system designed to control internal movement, meaning migrant workers lack many of the rights compared to native Beijingers. The system has been widely criticised for years and officials have pledged reform but have made little progress. Beijing officials have targeted a 15% cut in population of the downtown districts from 2014 levels within the next two years. That amounts to a reduction of about two million people, and authorities have also plan to demolish 40m square metres of illegal housing. International rights groups also condemned the campaign. “It’s somewhat astounding that the large numbers of migrant workers could be evicted so quickly, but this is in part because the Chinese authorities have systematically eroded all the ways people can protect their rights,” said William Nee, a researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong. “And, of course, China maintains the world’s largest censorship apparatus, so that it’s hard to meaningfully debate issues of injustice.” But Beijing officials denied they were targeting migrant workers at all, and said it was focused on safety. “It is irresponsible and groundless to say the campaign is to evict the ‘low-end population’,” an official from the Beijing Administration of Work Safety told local media."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/27/pauline-hanson-hoped-to-repeat-history-instead-one-nation-has-failed-dismally","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T04:15:06Z","webTitle":"Pauline Hanson hoped to repeat history.

Instead, One Nation has failed dismally","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Senator Pauline Hanson was bullish leading up to Saturday’s Queensland poll. She predicted One Nation would repeat its stunning success in 1998, when the fledgling party won 11 seats, routing the state Liberal National party and delivering power to Labor. That result is one Hanson has long been keen to repeat. It elevated the rookie MP from pariah to powerbroker, making One Nation Australia’s third most powerful party. The LNP’s preferencing of One Nation over Labor had helped cement its demise. In the 1998 federal election, then prime minister John Howard scrambled to avert a political bloodbath, banning all “deals” with Hanson’s rising juggernaut. Nineteen years on, the LNP again preferenced One Nation, at a similarly dismal cost: in some parts of regional Queensland, the swing against it was double that against the Labor party. But this time, One Nation’s performance was far from stellar. At 3.20pm on Sunday, when the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, claimed victory for Labor, One Nation’s Queensland leader Steve Dickson had lost the seat of Buderim, and climate change denier Malcolm Roberts had admitted defeat in Ipswich, home of Hanson’s old fish shop. Stephen Andrew, a pro-gun feral pest exterminator, has a slim chance of taking Mirani – but most analysts predict the party’s 61 candidates will fail to win a single seat. At One Nation’s election party on Saturday night, Hanson remained upbeat. She told Channel Nine her candidates had averaged 20% of the primary vote and with postal and pre-poll votes yet to be counted, they would still claim several seats. She left the party early, with a bottle of Bundaberg Rum. Perhaps a restorative Ginger Bitch (Hanson’s preferred tipple of Bundy and Dry) was in order. Behind the scenes, the result must hurt: Hanson and her chief of staff, James Ashby, have been preparing for the Queensland election for two years. They’ve failed spectacularly in their mission to make One Nation mark II a major political force, let alone a kingmaker in a minority Queensland government. After her campaign-changing call that she’d do no deals with One Nation, premier Palaszczuk is set to form a majority. To add insult to injury, the minority parties with the best shot at parliamentary leather are Katter’s Australian party with two to three seats, and Hanson’s detested enemy, the Greens. Amy MacMahon almost toppled the ALP’s Jackie Trad in South Brisbane, and Michael Berkman may still take Maiwar from the LNPs Scott Emerson, becoming the state’s first Green MP. In late 2015, I filmed Ashby at Hanson’s farm outside Brisbane, unveiling the fluoro-orange “I Trust Pauline” shirts, banners and corflutes that One Nation would use to promote its candidates to Queensland voters. “They’re clean, they’re bright, they’re fresh,” Hanson beamed, then sat down to update her Facebook page. The anti-Islamic, anti-immigration and pro-farming posts on “Pauline Hanson’s Please Explain” were attracting a million-plus clicks, and played a major role in delivering Hanson to the federal Senate in 2016, after an 18-year political exile. Ashby told me Hanson’s election was the “battle”, but Queensland would be the war. One Nation started fielding state candidates in December 2016, following the strategy that had nabbed the party four Senate seats. They bypassed the “elitist” media and posted direct to followers, styling Hanson as a Trump-style outsider and “voice of the people”, whose battler army would “drain the billabong”. In the lead-up to the Queensland poll, Hanson’s regular breakfast TV spots and video stunt-driven social media campaigns expanded One Nation’s reach as planned: the Please Explain Facebook page was consistently averaging 130,000 likes and shares per post, compared with the 42,000 per post average of the Queensland LNP, ALP and Greens. But while Hanson’s comment feed shows many Queenslanders still nurture a sentimental affection for “their Pauline”, the Ipswich underdog who dared to “say what Aussies were thinking” and survived death threats and a stint in jail to reboot herself as the leader of One Nation, that affection has failed to translate into seats. Why have Hanson and her party failed to cut through? Senator Fraser Anning’s rapid defection from One Nation’s federal ranks didn’t help the party’s electoral credibility, neither did Queensland leader Steve Dickson’s allegation that children are being taught how to masturbate and use dildos in schools. Hanson’s failure to censor sex-shop owner Mark Thornton, the Thuringowa candidate who linked “good sex” to domestic violence, was another low point of the campaign. The media’s preoccupation with Hanson’s star power over her candidates, and LNP leader Tim Nicholls’ Sunrise gaffe, where he appeared to spruik a One Nation/LNP coalition, enabling Labor to slam the “cuts and chaos” that such an alliance would produce, also helped muddy One Nation’s standing with voters. But far more damaging to Hanson’s dream of repeating her 1998 Queensland victory are the contradictory messages she sells as policy. The senator opposes coal seam gas mining because it pollutes aquifers “for future generations”, and has told me there is “no way” she’d let the Great Barrier Reef be damaged. Yet she rejects global warming as a “rort” perpetrated by scientists hungry for grants, and famously snorkelled in the Great Barrier Reef’s last unbleached pocket to prove that climate change is a myth. Hanson rails against foreign exploitation of Australian agriculture and mining resources, yet backs the controversial Adani mega-mine in the Galilee Basin, which is set to pollute farmland and towns, drain the Great Artesian Basin, and ratchet up global warming by fuelling dirty coal-fired power plants across the world. Hanson’s distrust of profit-hungry corporations, particularly Asian ones, is curiously absent when it comes to the scandal-plagued Adani, whose legacy of environmental destruction is indisputable, and whose touted figure of 10,000 new jobs for Queenslanders has repeatedly been called into question. Hanson is against Queensland taxpayers forking out a $1bn loan to Adani, as is Palaszczuk. But so far, both leaders are ignoring a key message of this election. Queenslanders, in both the cities and the regions, are deeply divided about the mine. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the ultra-right powerbrokers who control his party, should take note. The Greens, not One Nation, were the real surprise on Saturday. Senator Hanson, if she really is fair dinkum about protecting our water and reef for “future generations”, should oppose Adani outright. Dr Anna Broinowski is a filmmaker and author.

The incident occurred in the 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Saturday. Television pictures appeared to show Lukaku kicking Bong at the 66th-minute corner from which Ashley Young’s deflected shot gave United victory. The FA was informed that the referee, Neil Swarbrick, and his assistants were not aware of it, causing the case to be referred to the panel. Each of the former referees reviewed the footage independently. Lukaku, who is United’s top scorer with 12 goals in all competitions, would have missed the trip to Watford on Tuesday, the visit of Arsenal on Saturday and the Manchester derby on Sunday week if he had been banned. Against Brighton Lukaku failed to find the net for the ninth time in 10 matches but José Mourinho insisted he was unconcerned. “He didn’t score,” the Manchester United manager said. “I don’t care.” The Portuguese can be a master of deception and diversionary tactics. Sometimes, however out of character it may appear, he is simply voicing an honest opinion. Because when Lukaku was averaging a goal a game, Mourinho’s mantra was that it did not matter. When his biggest summer signing opened his league account against West Ham, the manager averred that there was “no pressure from me”. After Lukaku struck in the win over his former club Everton, Mourinho said: “He knows that for me there is no pressure for goalscoring.” When flood has given way to drought, United’s manager has displayed a consistency of argument. His demands stretch beyond putting the ball in the net. His talismanic strikers, from Didier Drogba to Diego Costa, have been scorers but also warriors. No one else was named in his evaluation of Lukaku’s display against Brighton on Saturday but there were echoes of his quintessential centre-forwards and an old United attacker alike. There are recurring themes. Mourinho cherishes a commitment to the collective. He calls for individuals to subsume themselves to a greater cause. He wants champagne footballers to display the work ethic of water carriers. He likes an absence of ego in the way they approach their defensive duties. Lukaku ticked his boxes. “In the last minute he was fighting and running back like he was in the first minute so I think it is also a mentality question,” his manager said. United’s winner stemmed from a contentious corner. The way Lukaku won it, Mourinho suggested, was “phenomenal”. Much of a penalty-box poacher’s best work came near corner flags at either end of the pitch. On a day when the left-back claimed the winner – “I think the rule is if it is on target then they give you the benefit of the doubt so I’ll launch an appeal for it to be my goal,” said Ashley Young, whose deflected shot was debited as a Lewis Dunk own goal – the supposed finisher finished up as an auxiliary full-back; it was Mourinho, after all, who turned Samuel Eto’o into an ancillary right-back in Inter’s 2010 Champions League victory. “The way Romelu ends the game making tackles in the left-back position: that is the mentality I want,” Mourinho said. It brought back memories of the man with whom he traded clubs in the summer. In the days when his energy appeared endless, that used to be Wayne Rooney’s party trick; if many a defender is a frustrated forward, Rooney seemed a wannabe left-back, forever materialising in Patrice Evra’s domain. It was seen as evidence of an irrepressible appetite to be involved. The former Chelsea and Everton forward Lukaku has not always appeared to be a kindred spirit. He ranked 503rd and last among outfield Premier League players for average distance covered in the 2015-16 season. He used his physical attributes in explosive bursts forward, not frequently tracking back. Yet a player long compared to Drogba may have adopted the approach that once made his childhood hero pivotal for Mourinho at Stamford Bridge. It is a question of attitude. “And unfortunately not every player is the same,” Mourinho said. “Players are men, men are different. Men are unique cases. Some guys are capable to go into the limits of their efforts and some other guys, even with a lot of talent, they don’t manage to do that, so Romelu for me was fantastic.” The paradox, perhaps, is that Mourinho judges managers, especially those with inferior records to him, on their results, but not forwards on their goal returns. Yet his history validates that line of thought. His success has not been dependent on a striker scoring. His centre-forward has never won the Golden Boot in the seasons when he won the Premier League. The concept of his strikers taking on new responsibilities in deeper roles was also highlighted by the sight of Marcus Rashford masquerading as No10. “Marcus did not have a happy match at all,” said Mourinho. The 20-year-old completed one of his 13 crosses. It almost brought a goal for Lukaku. That could have altered perceptions. But not Mourinho’s: his assessment of Lukaku is not based upon goals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/27/mount-agung-bali-airport-closed-as-volcano-alert-raised-to-highest-level","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T01:12:00Z","webTitle":"Mount Agung: Bali airport closed as volcano alert raised to highest level","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/27/mount-agung-bali-airport-closed-as-volcano-alert-raised-to-highest-level","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/27/mount-agung-bali-airport-closed-as-volcano-alert-raised-to-highest-level","fields":{"headline":"Mount Agung: Bali airport closed as volcano alert raised to highest level","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Indonesian authorities have raised the alert for a Bali volcano to the highest level, closed the island’s airport and ordered people within 10km (six miles) to evacuate. Mount Agung erupted on Saturday evening and three times early Sunday, lighting its cone with an orange glow and sending ash 4,000 metres into the atmosphere. The national board for disaster management said Bali’s international airport had closed for 24 hours and authorities would consider reopening it on Tuesday after evaluating the situation. About 25,000 people living near the mountain have already left their homes and evacuated since Mount Agung first started to spew smoke on Tuesday. “Continuous ash puffs are sometimes accompanied by explosive eruptions accompanied by a weak sound of boom,” the national board for disaster management wrote on Facebook. “The rays of fire are increasingly observed at night. This indicates the potential for a larger eruption is imminent.” The national disaster agency spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, called for people to stay calm. “Bali’s airport has indeed been closed. We’re still coordinating the next steps,” airport spokesman Arie Ahsanurrohim said. The Geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised at 6am on Monday because the volcano had shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. However he said he was still not expecting a major eruption. “We don’t expect a big eruption but we have to stay alert and anticipate,” he said. Indonesia’s Volcano Observatory Notice for Aviation raised its aviation colour code from orange to red, indicating a further eruption with significant emission of volcanic ash into the atmosphere was imminent. Australian airline Jetstar cancelled all flights in and out of Bali due to the ash cloud around the Mount Agung volcano. The decision on Monday was made on safety grounds and overturned earlier expectations that flights would go ahead. “While these disruptions are frustrating, we will always put safety before schedule,” the carrier said in a statement. Virgin Australia was expected to follow suit. Jetstar said it would update passengers around 7pm AEDT based on advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre. An exclusion zone extending 7.5km from the crater remains in place following the evacuation of more than 185,000 people after an eruption in September, and authorities have warned anyone remaining within it to leave the area. About 25,000 to 30,000 people were reportedly still unable to return home. The September eruption was the first sign of activity by Mount Agung in more than 50 years and prompted the highest alert level. In 1963 a major eruption killed about 1,100 people. The volcano is Bali’s highest peak and a popular hiking destination for tourists, who have been warned to stay away for now. Several villages that rely on the tourism trade are within the exclusion zone and fear for the economic impact on their livelihoods.

As if to lend weight to their manager’s point, Pulis’s own team went to Huddersfield a week later and lost. A few weeks after that, of course, Pulis was invited by West Brom’s owner to go into hibernation. But Pulis was right about how tough City would find the going at the John Smith’s Stadium – and that they might need the bounce of the ball. City’s winner came courtesy of a pair of ricochets in the dying minutes, first when Kevin De Bruyne’s pass was deflected into a team-mate’s path and then when Jonas Lössl’s panicked clearance rebounded off Raheem Sterling and into the net. Sterling was a fitting scorer, as he personified one of City’s – and his – less celebrated qualities. They have been acclaimed for their flamboyant skills and scorching attacks but not for their character. How much mental strength does a team need, after all, when money can swing odds in their favour? Quite a bit, actually, when they face a foe such as Huddersfield. And it was wet and windy, too. The home team’s manager, David Wagner, had no qualms about acknowledging afterwards that his plan was to make his team as hostile as the weather. Huddersfield have made more tackles than any other side in the Premier League this season and they increased their tally here, forcing City to earn the right to play. “This was a little bit what we wanted to do,” Wagner said of the robust exchanges. “To try to create a more physical football match rather than a technical football match. If you make it comfortable for an opponent like Manchester City so that they can enjoy their football, then you are chanceless. You have to create an atmosphere on the grass and in the stands that shows you have passion.” In the stands the fans obliged by creating a mighty din, even if City supporters would have been entitled to smirk when the locals began taunting them with chants of “Where were you when you were shit?” Two years ago almost to the day, Huddersfield’s 2-1 home defeat by Middlesbrough was watched by a little over 15,000 fans, 9,000 fewer than came to see Wagner’s team try to defy Guardiola’s armada. Still, and despite the perverse morality of football fandom, no one should blame people for not turning up when they do not expect to be entertained. But that no longer applies to Huddersfield. The Yorkshire club’s great triumph in their two years under Wagner is that they have convinced locals they are going to be thrilled by what they see at the John Smith Stadium. Now there is a powerful synergy between fans and a team whose spirit is boundless. City saw all that and matched it. They were for up the fight, even after the bounce of the ball went against them, Nicolás Otamendi inadvertently putting Huddersfield in front by diverting Schindler’s header into his own goal. Eventually City made their own luck. Kyle Walker may have been the one whose aggressiveness drew the ire of Wagner and the home fans, but Sterling’s defiance was more decisive. This is no will‑o’‑the‑wisp winger. His speed and skill would not be so influential if not for his strength, physical and mental. The way he held off defenders here before spinning and dashing past them made him a constant menace. It turned out the only way that Scott Malone could handle him was to manhandle him. That led to the penalty that brought City’s equaliser less than one minute after half-time and 30 seconds after Sterling could have been given a spot-kick after being brought down by Lössl. Sterling never relented. He kept on running at and through Huddersfield, wriggly and elusive but also very hard, a lizard with armoured-plating. Anyone who still doubts the 22‑year‑old’s class is a fool or worse. Although Huddersfield showed, as Pulis’s team had done, that City are vulnerable defensively provided the opposition can get the ball off them, the abiding lesson from this match is that City are no soft touches. “We needed this kind of situation to happen, to be in trouble,” said Guardiola. “Are we going to go the whole season unbeaten? It’s impossible not to lose a game. But [we] fight to avoid that.” More than that, City fight to win. Guardiola’s attacking substitutions proved that, as did his players’ incessant forward motion. No one better than Sterling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/29/bullying-bad-medicine-surgeons-domineering-sexism","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-29T07:30:28Z","webTitle":"‘Bullying and being bullied is everywhere now, at every level in the NHS’ | Matthew Barbour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/29/bullying-bad-medicine-surgeons-domineering-sexism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/29/bullying-bad-medicine-surgeons-domineering-sexism","fields":{"headline":"‘Bullying and being bullied is everywhere now, at every level in the NHS’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“What can be perceived as harmless banter or acceptable behaviour by some people for decades can actually be deeply offensive, or even abusive,” says Judy Evans, consultant plastic surgeon at the private Nuffield hospital in Plymouth. “We’re now at a point where huge numbers of surgical positions aren’t being filled because millennials don’t want a job in which they think they will be bullied.” Evans lost her job as an NHS consultant in 2000 after standing up for a junior doctor who had been bullied. “The bullying culture in medicine goes back decades,” she says. “Over 30 years ago, I remember turning up for a surgeon’s exam when I was seven months pregnant and being asked bluntly: ‘What are you doing here looking like that?’ Sadly, that kind of behaviour was seen as something women just had to put up with. “In the past, surgery used to be just sexist – a hangover from the old boys’ clubs, drinking and playing golf – but that’s not the only issue now. Bullying and being bullied is everywhere now, at every level: consultants, juniors, women, men. It can be incredibly subtle but terribly destructive unless we are all more aware of not just where to go for help, but also that you might actually be a bully yourself. “I know of surgeons who have considered taking their own lives, others who have left the profession because of bullying surgeons’ bad practice going unchallenged. Of course, the ultimate downside to all of this is patient wellbeing being compromised.” Evans’s concerns about bullying, particularly among surgeons, are backed up by studies. A quarter of doctors say they have experienced bullying, harassment or abuse from other staff in the past 12 months, according to last year’s NHS England staff survey.One in six trainee surgeons, who responded to a web survey, say they suffer from bullying-related post-traumatic stress disorder that is so bad it can leave them suicidal, according to a paper published this summer in the Surgeon journal. A 2014 survey of members of the UK’s oldest and largest Royal College of Surgeons, in Edinburgh – with 25,000 members mainly working in England and Wales – found that 40% of respondents had been victims of bullying, and the same number said they had also witnessed bullying in the workplace. In addition, a 2015 study revealed that 94% of surgeons had observed unprofessional behaviour, including bullying, among colleagues.. Moreover, it directly impacts on patient welfare. Evans believes the systemic bullying culture was the reason breast surgeon Ian Paterson, who was jailed earlier this year for 15 years, was able to get away for so long with performing unnecessary surgeries on what could be more than 1,000 women. Paterson was described by colleagues as an “arrogant bully whom colleagues feared to challenge”, she says. “In the airline industry if someone at any level of the hierarchy finds a fault, they are rewarded because passenger safety is everything – in surgery the opposite has been true. Trainee surgeons, nurses and others lower down the team’s pecking order are frightened about speaking out and receiving negative reactions for questioning that something might not be quite right. Tens of thousands of lives have been and will be at risk if the status quo isn’t changed.” Evans cites the example of airline pilot Martin Bromiley, who has campaigned tirelessly for patient safety after his wife died 10 years ago during a routine operation because a nurse’s concerns were ignored. “That nurse produced the instruments to perform a simple tracheostomy and save Martin’s wife’s life, but she was pushed to one side,” says Evans. “To be effective we have to work as a team and show everyone respect, whatever their role. Bullying strips away self-confidence, so doctors may not trust their own abilities to make life-saving quick decisions.” Since Evans left the NHS with a large payout she has fought tirelessly to end the bullying culture among surgeons. She is the first woman to be appointed an office bearer of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd) and has helped to launch its campaign, Let’s Remove It, to encourage healthcare professionals to speak up and stamp out bullying. Its website directs medics to where to get help if they feel they are being bullied, and has a checklist to see if they are showing bullying behaviour. Backing the campaign is Anushka Chaudhry, 39, a consultant breast surgeon at the Great Western hospital in Swindon. She says she was constantly bullied by a consultant surgeon during her NHS training at another trust – but she kept the bullying and its effects secret for more than 18 months. “I’ve never spoken publicly about what happened to me, and I know many friends and colleagues will be shocked to hear this,” she says. “From the start that consultant surgeon let it be known that women – or ‘girls’ as he preferred to call us – should be grateful to be there. He’d constantly undermine my professional decisions and comment about my workload, insinuating I was workshy and had no work ethic, which amounted to slander and affected my professional reputation.” Towards the end of that placement she says the bullying had escalated to the point where the consultant told her in front of colleagues and other trainees that she had “never worked for him”. “He basically dismissed me from surgery, refusing to sign me off so I could start the next step of my career, a career I loved. Instead of feeling that he was in the wrong, I felt ashamed that I was disliked so much. I hid what was going on at work from my husband, became withdrawn at work and lost so much confidence, feeling so alone.” It was only several months later that she heard three other trainees had also been bullied by the same consultant and that he had been dismissed as a trainer and had left the trust. “It was great news, knowing other trainees wouldn’t have to go through what I did,” says Chaudhry, who now mentors trainees. The RCSEd is working closely with the General Medical Council and the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, to run pilot workshops to help doctors recognise and change their behaviour. NHS boards can apply to send people on its courses, the first of which is planned for February. Says Evans: “Prevention is always better than cure, of course, but we need to change the culture so people can be honest and admit they are doing the wrong thing.” It is also campaigning for the GMC to introduce compulsory training on bullying for trainee doctors. Dr Alice Hartley, 37, a registrar at Sunderland Royal hospital who chairs the RCSEd’s anti-bullying campaign, says she regularly sees surgeons brought to tears by other colleagues. “It’s an ego thing without any consideration for nurturing the trainee. In my career I’ve seen constant undermining, talking down to people, making both trainees and also consultants feel small and inferior – it cuts across the whole of the NHS and needs to be stopped.”Hartley says she herself has been a victim. “I’ve been in theatre and had a senior colleague fling instruments on to the floor in a rage when I asked a simple question,” she recalls. ”It just makes you doubt yourself and crucially stops you questioning what’s happening and creating a better team to treat patients more effectively. “It’s the constant belittling, the making you feel like an idiot that slowly breaks you. Surgery has historically been a cutthroat, ego-driven world where you had to tolerate abuse very regularly if you want to move on – either that, or you leave. We’ve got a massive shortage of surgeons coming through now, and we have to address the working environment.” Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, says: “Bullying is completely unacceptable. All NHS organisations have clear policies in place to deal with reports of harassment or bullying. This requires employers to take clear action to address those concerns. It is not always easy for concerns to be raised, particularly where those carrying out harassment are in positions of power. Many organisations will have specially trained staff in place to help colleagues raise concerns about bullying or harassment, there are freedom-to-speak-up guardians as well as chaplaincy, trade union and HR staff who can provide support.” Dr Anthea Mowat, the British Medical Association representative body chair, says: “We know from speaking to our members that a combination of factors feed into creating environments which permit and perpetuate bullying behaviour: the organisational culture in the NHS; workload pressure; the strong hierarchy within the medical profession; and the ‘silent bystanding’ which means behaviours go unchallenged and become learned by newer staff. Ending this issue, which means addressing these underlying factors, is a big challenge and the BMA is committed to raising awareness of all forms of bullying and harassment and the consequences for doctors’ wellbeing and patient care. We want to ensure there is a clear understanding of the issues and people are confident to raise concerns and report problems when they occur. The BMA also offers a 24-hour counselling service and the doctor adviser service, Doctors for Doctors, which gives doctors and medical students in distress the chance to speak to another doctor in confidence.” For Chaudhry, being bullied was such a horrendous experience that, she says, she only really recovered her confidence almost two years later. “I now want to speak up to help others going through something similar.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/27/shirley-porter-stage-warning-from-history-councils-poor-tesco-heiress-policy-1980s-shirleymander","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T17:30:29Z","webTitle":"Shirley Porter on stage is a warning to us all.

I hope it’s a sell-out","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Some good news for a change: a play, Shirleymander by Gregory Evans, is to be staged near Grenfell Tower. Good news because it will remind everyone of what Shirley Porter, leader of Westminster council, did in the 1980s. I’ve often mentioned her over the years, hoping she would be a warning from history and housing policy would improve, but no such luck, so we need this play. Porter, heiress of the Tesco fortune, was accused of “unlawful and corrupt policy of gerrymandering the poor … and homeless out of the borough”. This time there is is no suggestion that the aim is to remove certain voters from the borough, but three months after the Grenfell fire, only 10 families had been permanently rehoused, and “the poor” are being generally jerked about, scattered and dumped anywhere, as usual. Hundreds of families face eviction since Universal Credit pushed up their rent arrears, more than 4,000 people are sleeping rough in England, and four out of 10 people in Britain live in substandard homes. But why should councils be scared of treating the poor like rubbish? Porter’s “mean and nasty” policy was not harshly punished. Of the £26.5m the House of Lords ordered her to repay, she coughed up only £12.3m, and that took her more than a decade and a half. Now look at what Tesco is up to: paying some Christmas temps via prepaid cards that cost 50p for each withdrawal (they say it’s only when there is no alternative means of payment). Meanwhile, at Grenfell, lots of the the tributes have gone. Fielding, who lives round there, often walks by. “We’ve done that, the emotional energy’s gone. It’s inevitable,” says he, in despair. He had just seen about 50 rough sleepers in a shopping centre in east London. It is getting colder, but Stoke-on-Trent council is considering fining the homeless £100 on the spot for putting up a tent, and criminalising them for kipping in public toilets. It’s about 50 years since a friend and I came weeping out of Cathy Come Home. Another awful warning not heeded. Housing is even worse. But not for Porter. I hope Shirleymander is a sellout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/nov/27/f1-2017-hamilton-versus-vettel-mclaren-season-s-best-and-worst","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T15:50:33Z","webTitle":"F1 2017: the best and worst from Hamilton versus Vettel to McLaren | Giles Richards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/27/f1-2017-hamilton-versus-vettel-mclaren-season-s-best-and-worst","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/27/f1-2017-hamilton-versus-vettel-mclaren-season-s-best-and-worst","fields":{"headline":"F1 2017: the best and worst from Hamilton versus Vettel to McLaren","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Best driver Lewis Hamilton produced an exceptional performance to secure his fourth – and what he admitted was his most challenging and most rewarding – title. With competition from Sebastian Vettel in a Ferrari that was at least on a par with the Mercedes and at certain circuits the better car, the British driver had to be at his best and successfully bring together every facet of his craft. Hamilton had to cope with a demanding car, struggling to find set-up and with the pressure of being behind until the 13th round. Major errors were notable only for their absence and when dominant he was ruthless – as at Silverstone. His qualifying was as good as he has ever produced, especially at Canada, Silverstone, Spa – where track position proved crucial – and of course Monza in the wet. He accepted setbacks and made the best he could out of them, as shown with a controlled but aggressive drive in Austria to take fourth from eighth on the grid, then exploited any chances offered by his rival, all but ending the fight through Singapore, Malaysia and Japan. Finally, there was maturity and skilful on-track judgment to ensure he closed it out, rather than taking risks. A consummate season from a now formidably complete driver. Best race So often the venue for a straightforward procession, Barcelona, where the teams test, reducing unknown variables, hosted a tense and thrilling encounter. Other races had more incident and more action in the midfield but at the front Vettel and Hamilton both drove to the limit to turn in a gripping encounter at the Circuit de Catalunya. Vettel opened with intent, jumping Hamilton off the line and taking the lead into turn one, and after his stop he displayed more resolve when he pulled off a magnificent pass on Valtteri Bottas to retake the lead. Mercedes on an alternate strategy, kept Hamilton out with the intent on him finishing on fresher, softer tyres. He emerged side by side with Vettel and the pair went wheel to wheel through turn one. Vettel squeezed Hamilton wide – hard, fair and unmissable. They would battle on for several more laps but Hamilton, with his tyre advantage, finally made it stick. Vettel described it as a “great race” and Hamilton as “how racing should be”. They finished 75 seconds ahead of their nearest competitor – clear notice that the two drivers would decide the title. Greatest moment Vettel’s loss of self‑control when he chose to barge Hamilton in Baku was the most incendiary incident between the pair in a season in which there was a friendly mutual respect. Vettel believed Hamilton had brake-tested him before a safety car restart and in doing so damaged his front wing – incensed he pulled alongside and sideswiped Hamilton’s car. But ultimately the incident did not descend into the ill-feeling and needle that was expected. Hamilton revealed last week he subsequently warned Vettel not to “disrespect” him on the track again. So, with relations normalised, perhaps the more telling moment was at Spa. Having been nip and tuck, with nothing to choose between them throughout, Vettel charged at Hamilton after a safety car restart but the British driver displayed the racecraft of a champion to hold him off. He came slightly off the throttle on the run to Eau Rouge to keep Vettel tucked up behind his rear wing, leaving the German able only to pull alongside on the Kemmel straight, then concluded with outstanding braking into Les Combes on cold rubber to hold the lead. It epitomised the skill and competitive will both drivers brought to the season. Best overtake Once unfairly accused of being unable to overtake, Vettel has shown his chops before, not least when putting two wheels on the grass to pass Fernando Alonso on the outside of Curva Grande at Monza in 2011. It was a bravura move and this year he showed similar commitment and skill that was at times breathtaking. In China he had dived up the inside of his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen at turn six with some brilliant late braking. He followed it up with an even better move, going round the outside of the turn five hairpin to pass Daniel Ricciardo. But the pass that really caught the eye was on Bottas in Spain. Needing to clear the Finn as quickly as possible, he had him lined up on the long start-finish straight and was in no mood to be denied. Vettel dummied first to the inside, then went to the outside before finally switching again to the inside and squeezing ahead into turn one. His reaction and racecraft in split-second decision-making was formidable and once again he had to put two wheels on the grass to do so. Strength through adversity award: joint winner Force India securing fourth place for a second season in succession and after a major regulation change is an achievement that deserves acknowledgment. Their budget is dwarfed by the bigger teams but the team and their drivers, Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon, once again turned in a display to make garagistes proud. In the points at every race bar one, they finished 105 points ahead of Williams – a country mile and testament to how they have punched well above their weight yet again. But they have been strong throughout. For character in adversity Max Verstappen showed resilience beyond his years. He had entered the season with ambitions to challenge for the title, almost immediately quashed with Red Bull off the pace. Five DNFs in seven races, mainly mechanical failures, followed; further disappointing and frustrating the 20-year-old. He came through it admirably. The car improved and the Dutch driver put it to use – wins in Malaysia and Mexico followed but he was equally outstanding in Japan and in the US – where he came back from 16th to take fourth. He has been unafraid to battle with Hamilton and Vettel and proved that, given the chance to do so, he can take the fight to them. Most eye-catching innovation Two new features for 2017, ugly shark fins and wobbling T-wings attracted ire at the opening and both are set to be outlawed for next season but one innovation reflected an ethos that was admirable. Force India’s introduction of their “stegosaurus” upgrade – more than 30 mini fins along the top of the engine cover – to improve downforce at Singapore was indicative of why the team have come out on top of the midfield. On a budget that cannot compete with the big boys a willingness to try new directions, ideas and strongly developing the car as best they could has to be admired and is an object lesson to their closest competitors. Worst slow-motion crash Off the track rather than on it. Divorce is rarely pretty and the final chapter of the McLaren-Honda partnership was a torturous and unedifying spectacle. In the third season of their renewed partnership expectations were high but the wheels came off from the opening session in testing and an already strained relationship soon became increasingly untenable. Way down on horses and woefully unreliable, Alonso was vocal in his displeasure and the team duly parted ways with Honda. For McLaren and their Renault engines next season there will be nowhere to hide. They claim the chassis is strong and proving it is the first task for the post-Ron management. What needs fixing in 2018? The new regulations did lead to better-looking cars and everyone loves the fat tyres. Drivers enjoyed the physical challenge of wrestling their rides around circuits and the promised increase in lap times and cornering speed. But the aero-centric formula was at the cost of making passing difficult at a lot of tracks. Hamilton was among many drivers who noted that following other cars was so difficult that the speed differential required to pass was simply too great to be achieved and it was not hard to observe. Finding the right balance for the future is now in the hands of F1’s managing director of Motorsports, Ross Brawn – a considerable task."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global/blog/2017/nov/27/cooperation-key-to-saving-coral-triangles-green-turtles","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T17:38:48Z","webTitle":"Cooperation key to saving Coral Triangle's green turtles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2017/nov/27/cooperation-key-to-saving-coral-triangles-green-turtles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/blog/2017/nov/27/cooperation-key-to-saving-coral-triangles-green-turtles","fields":{"headline":"Cooperation key to saving Coral Triangle's green turtles","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Conservationists recently took a major step forward in their efforts to protect green turtles in the Coral Triangle with the establishment of a ‘turtle corridor’ in the Sulu-Sulawesi Seascape, which encompasses the territorial waters of the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia and is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the Coral Triangle. The announcement was made at an event hosted by environmental organisation Conservation International at the 12th Conference of Parties of the Convention of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP 12), held last month in the Philippines. One of the major challenges in conserving marine species – or even getting accurate data about them - is that they tend to ignore borders. For migratory species like the endangered green turtle, localized Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are not enough: turtle numbers are declining despite significant funds going towards their conservation. The Marine Turtle Protected Area Network (MTPAN) aims to reverse this trend by connecting four MPAs in the Philippines as a first step towards establishing a transboundary network of safe havens for turtles across the Sulu-Sulawesi Seascape - home to one of the biggest nesting populations of green turtles in the world. Turtles are among the most iconic creatures in the ocean and their popularity with tourists makes them an important source of revenue for local communities. But they continue to be illegally exploited for their eggs and meat – considered a delicacy by communities throughout the region – and their shells, which are still used to make tourist souvenirs. They often end up as bycatch in commercial fishing nets and have to contend with coastal pollution and destruction of habitats like coral reefs and sea grass beds. “If we are only protecting one area, and the other area is exploiting [turtles]… that is a problem,” said Minda Bairulla, Superintendent of the Turtle Island Wildlife Sanctuary – one of the four MTPAN marine parks in the Philippines. “We are affected by our neighbours who do not protect their marine ecosystems,” she added. Tubbataha National Park in the Philippines illustrates the point. It’s an important developmental habitat for green turtles, who stay there for between 13-23 years. “But if they don’t have a safe haven [elsewhere]...to lay their eggs, then we won’t have them in the future,” said Angelique Songco, the Park’s Superintendent. With the Philippines leading the way, the next step will be to add seven more sites from Indonesia and Malaysia to the network. The increased cooperation should lead to better management of turtle populations, provided systems for monitoring and protection are properly implemented. Though turtles are the figurehead of the MTPAN, the project is also a crucial opportunity for the three countries to cooperate in managing shared marine resources effectively. By extension, a trilateral strategy to protect turtles also conserves key ecosystems that local people rely on for their livelihoods. In 2009, the six Coral Triangle countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor Leste) established the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries &amp; Food Security (CTI-CFF) in recognition of the interrelated nature of the six million sq km bio-region. Projects like MTPAN offer the possibility of putting policy into practice and establishing a model that can be replicated in other regions. However, if MTPAN is to have real world impact, all three countries will have to come on board, while each of the 11 member MPAs will need to effectively managed in their own right. “Each MPA needs to be strong in itself; then we collaborate to be an even stronger force,” said Angelique Songco."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"travel/2017/dec/01/shenzhen-china-v-and-a-gallery-sea-world-culture-arts-centre","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T11:00:41Z","webTitle":"Shenzhen’s new V&A-approved culture centre to showcase city’s artistic side","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/01/shenzhen-china-v-and-a-gallery-sea-world-culture-arts-centre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/dec/01/shenzhen-china-v-and-a-gallery-sea-world-culture-arts-centre","fields":{"headline":"Shenzhen’s new V&A-approved culture centre to showcase city’s artistic side","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shenzhen is a border town, tech hub, factory floor and somewhere Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas has labelled a “generic city”: malleable enough to change its form with the times. This Pearl River Delta megalopolis is China’s richest city, having grown from 30,000 inhabitants in 1980 – when it was designated the first special economic zone – to almost 12 million today. With Shenzhen’s mushrooming size (the fourth-highest megatall in the world, the Ping An Finance Centre, glares across the river towards Hong Kong) comes ballooning ambition, because Koolhaas’s generic city is now eyeing developments in art and design. On 2 December Design Society, an initiative spearheaded by China Merchants Group and London’s V&amp;A, will open The Sea World Culture and Arts Centre, on the waterfront in Shekou, a gentrifying port district in western Shenzhen. The cultural centre’s design is the brainchild of Pritzker Architecture prize-winner Fumihiko Maki and is an angular white-and-glass behemoth, with cantilevered levels, amid a landscaped park. Its mission: to be a lightning rod for cutting-edge design in China. Opening exhibitions will focus on design as a conduit to an improved society – including Values of Design in the V&amp;A Gallery, which will showcase exhibits from the London museum. “Once the ‘factory of the world’, Shenzhen is now a metropolis with thousands of manufacturers and design companies that share the ambition of moving from a ‘made in China’ phase to the so-called ‘created in China’,” says Luisa Mengoni, head of the new V&amp;A gallery. “There is a strong ambition at city level to make Shenzhen a global player in the field of design,” she adds. Shenzhen is “the birthplace of China’s modernisation over the last 40 years”, says Ole Bouman, director of the Design Society. In 2008, it was named a Unesco Creative City of Design and each year hosts high-profile design events, including December’s Shenzhen Biennale for Architecture and Urbanism. With the opening of the centre, Shenzhen will gain a new Unesco Creative Cities Network Center. Shenzhen’s other creative zones include the OCT Loft across town, a palm-studded district of former industrial buildings turned contemporary art park. Visitors sip tiny coffees at arty cafes (Whatever Cafe), buy design trinkets in fancy boutiques (IM Loft Shop) and wander around high-ceilinged galleries such as the OCAT Contemporary Art Terminal. Nearby is the spaceship-like OCT Creative Exhibition Center, showing landmark exhibitions. Further into the heart of Shenzhen’s dense financial district is the just-completed neofuturistic, cloud-like Museum of Contemporary Art and Planning Exhibition, designed by Austrian architect firm Coop Himmelblau. Shenzhen is now so design-friendly it’s been chosen as the inaugural destination for a three-in-one Muji store, hotel and restaurant – a spin-off of the Japanese homeware brand – slated to open by the end of this year. “By raising expectations among the public on what design can do for them, we intend to leverage the role of the design communities and provide a position towards a more creative China,” says Bouman. “Design in such a city has a different role compared with design in Milan, London, or even Shanghai. Design in Shenzhen breathes an almost existential drive.” • designsociety.cn"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/03/bach-ysaye-3-antje-weithaas-violin-review-observer","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T07:24:35Z","webTitle":"Bach & Ysaÿe 3 CD review –  poetry, wizardry and humanity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/03/bach-ysaye-3-antje-weithaas-violin-review-observer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/03/bach-ysaye-3-antje-weithaas-violin-review-observer","fields":{"headline":"Bach & Ysaÿe 3 CD review –  poetry, wizardry and humanity","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The German violinist Antje Weithaas, an independent-minded player with a career as soloist, chamber musician and conductor/director, has released her third volume of Bach and Ysaÿe.

They give students the chance to meet and greet firms and find out more about legal careers – ideal if you need help picking vacation schemes or training contracts. Most large city or national firms attend as they are the biggest employers of university leavers. High street firms also join fairs locally, along with barristers’ chambers, law schools and lawyers’ networking groups. Most of the leading firms will have a stand with a team of of lawyers, trainees and graduate recruiters to answer your questions. Everyone who comes to the fair is out to share their knowledge, which is always worth taking advantage of. Fairs take place at university campuses and large conference venues across the country. Lawcareers.net has a useful list of this year’s events. Talk to trainees Current trainees often attend these fairs, so you can quiz them about their experiences. “Law firms vary greatly. You have a choice of international, city, national, regional or high street firms,” explains Marissa Sanders, graduate manager at Irwin Mitchell. Talking to firms’ trainees and graduate recruiters will tell you much more about the firm than researching it online. Get noticed Don’t expect to be offered a training contract on the day – law fairs are mainly a chance to learn more about a legal career and network with firms. However, “it can be a golden opportunity for you to get noticed by the employer, as they’re very likely to remember you throughout the application process if you’ve made the effort to come down and ask meaningful questions and make yourself known to the firm,” says Aasha Tikoo, graduate marketing manager for Clifford Chance LLP. Bring a CV Most firms won’t actually accept CVs at the event, since they’ll have online application forms for vacation schemes and training contracts. But it never hurts to have a copy in your bag just in case you’re talking to a recruiter and the subject comes up. Prepare questions “Any student interested in a career in law should visit the website of each firm ahead of the day and prepare a list of questions,” says Catherine Morgan-Guest, graduate recruitment manager for Macfarlanes LLP. You can also find out specific details about each law firm at chambersstudent.co.uk. “You’ll be at the firm for two years if you secure a training contract, so you should consider what’s important and tailor your research.” For example, if spending a seat overseas is crucial to you, then you should research which firms offer that and target them at the fair. For Morgan-Guest the students that stand out are those who already know basics about the firm and present themselves in a professional but friendly manner. What to wear It’s not a job interview, so there’s no need for a suit. Just bear in mind you’ll be talking to prospective employers. “There is no right or wrong attire for a law fair,” says Morgan-Guest. “Some students come suited and booted but others prefer their tracksuit bottoms. Personally I’d suggest a smart-casual approach.” What to do next “Following the law fair, narrow down the firms to the half-dozen that you’d really want to work for,” says Saunders. “Look for further opportunities to meet them, such as open evenings and presentations.” Do this and you’ll have a better idea of whether you want to work for that firm, and will help you to write about your interest for them in your applications."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/13/city-millionaire-says-vote-leave-directed-his-donation-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"City millionaire says Vote Leave directed his donation decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/13/city-millionaire-says-vote-leave-directed-his-donation-decision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/13/city-millionaire-says-vote-leave-directed-his-donation-decision","fields":{"headline":"City millionaire says Vote Leave directed his donation decision","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A millionaire who gave £50,000 to a 23-year-old fashion student to spend on the campaign to exit the EU says that he was advised to make the donation by the Brexit-backing campaign group Vote Leave. Hedge fund manager Anthony Clake told the Guardian that he had intended to give the money to Vote Leave, as the official leave campaign, but was encouraged by the group not to do so because “they were close to their spending limits”. Instead, Clake was advised to give the money to Darren Grimes, who had a separate spending limit as an independent pro-leave campaigner. Grimes passed the money straight to a social media consultancy also hired by Vote Leave. Under UK electoral law, it could be an offence if Vote Leave colluded with Grimes to pass the money to the consultancy, which is called AggregateIQ. Grimes is already facing an Electoral Commission inquiry over whether his spending was co-ordinated with Vote Leave. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Clake. But the businessman’s revelation that he was encouraged to donate the money to Grimes by Vote Leave puts new pressure on the organisation over its approach to campaign spending. His statement is the first evidence that Vote Leave encouraged a potential donor to give money to other leave campaigns. Last month, the Electoral Commission announced an investigation into three groups which campaigned for a Leave vote in last year’s referendum, saying it had “reasonable grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed”. The investigation hinges on Vote Leave’s decision to make donations totalling £625,000 to Grimes, then a 23-year-old fashion student, in the final days of the referendum. Grimes spent the entirety of the money with AggregateIQ. Separately to the money it donated to Grimes, Vote Leave spent £2.7m, around 40% of its total spending of £6.7m, with AggregateIQ. As the designated leave campaigning organisation, its spending was capped by law at £7m. Grimes, as chair of a different campaign group called BeLeave, had a spending cap of £700,000 and spent £675,000 in total. The source of £625,000 of this money was Vote Leave, with the remaining £50,000 provided by Clake. A spokesperson for Clake confirmed that he had discussed his donation to Grimes with Vote Leave. “Anthony Clake offered to make a donation to Vote Leave,” the spokesperson said. “They said they were close to their spending limits and suggested he offer the excess to two other campaigns on the same side of the debate; BeLeave [Grimes] and Muslims for Britain. He gave the donation to BeLeave.” The day after his donation to Grimes, Vote Leave received £40,000 from Clake. Asked what he understood the relationship between the two campaigners to be, the spokesperson said “Apart from them being on the same side in the referendum, he has no knowledge of any relationship between them. That is a matter for the two campaigns and the Electoral Commission.” Grimes did not respond to a request for comment. Last year, he told the Electoral Commission that Vote Leave “had no say or input in our strategy or our campaign spending,” according to emails published by The Ferret, a Scottish investigative journalism website. A spokesperson for Vote Leave said: “Vote Leave complied with both the spirit and the letter of the Electoral Commission’s rules and the spending limits. “We will continue to assist the Electoral Commission in this investigation – which is now the third time that they have looked into the same evidence.” Clake’s spokesperson also said he had not been approached by the Electoral Commission in connection with its investigation into Vote Leave and Grimes. The Electoral Commission declined to comment. Grimes has previously told OpenDemocracy that he never received cash from either Vote Leave or Clake, and that both donors paid AggregateIQ directly. Clake, 37, reportedly oversees around $10bn at Marshall Wace and last year was identified by Sky News as the largest backer of a plan to extend Heathrow Airport’s northern runway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/27/this-long-pursuit-by-richard-holmes-biographer","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T16:34:13Z","webTitle":"This Long Pursuit by Richard Holmes – reflections of a Romantic biographer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/27/this-long-pursuit-by-richard-holmes-biographer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/27/this-long-pursuit-by-richard-holmes-biographer","fields":{"headline":"This Long Pursuit by Richard Holmes – reflections of a Romantic biographer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The third in Richard Holmes’s series of autobiographical volumes, this is a wonderfully reflective and insightful collection of meditations on the biographer’s art, “a vocation that I have intensely loved over more than 40 years and which I still do not entirely understand”. There are essays on Samuel Coleridge, Mary Somerville, John Keats and others, but Holmes starts by exploring the experience of researching a biography, which for him is about more than texts and archives and involves literally walking in his subject’s footsteps. His notebooks have two columns: one for historical facts, the other for subjective impressions drawn from landscapes and buildings. For Holmes, empathy is central to his craft, “to enter imaginatively into another place, another time, another life”. The essay on forgetting, in which the 72-year-old biographer considers the fading of memory, weaves science, poetry and the terrain of the south of France into one of the most evocative and humane pieces of writing I’ve read. A fine celebration of life writing and of “the pursuer pursued”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/28/paul-hollywood-a-bakers-life-review-vanity-project","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Paul Hollywood: A Baker’s Life review – all about his great passions: baking, and himself","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/28/paul-hollywood-a-bakers-life-review-vanity-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/28/paul-hollywood-a-bakers-life-review-vanity-project","fields":{"headline":"Paul Hollywood: A Baker’s Life review – all about his great passions: baking, and himself","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Paul Hollywood has a new show, a great British spin-off. It’s about his great passions: baking, and himself. It’s called Paul Hollywood: A Baker’s Life (Channel 4). The timing might not be ideal, a show about his life outside the Great British Bake Off, coming soon after announcing the split from his wife. It’s difficult to watch without a bit of that in mind. She doesn’t feature, and he doesn’t mention Mrs H. He does talk about another painful separation though – from Mary, Mel and Sue, when the Bake Off moved from the BBC to Channel 4. And in this one he was the victim, apparently. “For the three of them to walk away from me, and walk away from the tent, it felt like they’d abandoned the Bake Off,” he says. “Three people walked out of the tent, and one person stayed. Why am I getting called a traitor?” Poor Paul, abandoned, misunderstood, alone in the tent. And by tent I don’t just mean a temporary structure made of cloth, I’m talking shelter, warmth, home and family. He does use the F-word: “We were like a dysfunctional family, we sort of worked,” he says. But Paul wasn’t left alone in the tent for long. He was joined by Prue and Noel and Sandi; he got a new family. Plus an extra two heaped spoonfuls of filthy lucre, mmm. We look back at Paul’s original screen test, from 2010, in which he judges a seedy supermarket bun. “It looks pale, it looks ill, it looks disgusting. I wouldn’t give that to my dog,” he says, and he holds it out to a muzzle that just appears above the counter, a muzzle that isn’t interested. Yeah, it’s good, you can seen why he got the job – he is good on bread, and judging. He knows his baking. I wonder who got the dog. Then Paul is set a challenge for himself, in the tent, by former contestants Val and Selasi. Ah, the tables are turned, can he take the pressure himself? Of course he can. Oh, Val’s disappointed by the size of Paul’s roulade. Otherwise it’s perfect – good swirl, lovely flavours, and inspired by family, as it happens. His nan was fond of rose petals and his mum is a big pistachio fan. And she – mum – is one Mrs H who will be featuring in future episodes. Now he’s making her burgers for his mates down at the track. That’s another passion of Paul’s – racing cars. It’s all the same really, all about winning. “In my world, baking is about perfection,” he says. “Well that’s the same as when you drive a race car like this for this team …” Shush, and give me a burger, will you? They do look good, and he baked the buns himself of course: “They’re perfect,” he says. Yeah, but they’re still just burgers, and burgers aren’t going to stop any shows, are they? Next he treats us to an exclusive tour behind the scenes of the actual tent. “On Bake Off, I’m a small part of a big team,” Paul says (see, it is just like the racing). “There are at least 50 people you don’t see behind the camera”. Really? Who would have thought it, camera operators, sound, directors, makeup, catering, etc, all involved in the making of television? Look, there’s Prue, probably firing off a Tweet. What time zone is this, anyway? “We’re like a family,” says Paul, again. Note, no “dysfunctional” in the new set up. “And everyone has an important part to play.” Baking, making television, racing, life – it’s all the same. The show gets better when Paul gets back to doing some fancy baking, a Madeira cake, and he is joined by Prue, then by Sandi and Noel, who help with the icing. Noel offers to be Paul’s apprentice. He hasn’t got much on after the Bake Off, he says. Sandi says she was thrilled when she first met Paul, “and possibly on the turn, because of his eyes”. They are probably a bit embarrassed at having to be involved in this Paul Hollywood vanity project, but they do instantly improve it, with wit and a bit of self-awareness. Let Paul do the baking and the judging, the knowing-what-he’s-talking-about and the blue eyes, and they can help make it presentable. Presenters, and icers, of the cake, of the show. Hey, add an element of competition, a few contestants, members of the public, and there could be the seed of a half-decent TV show somewhere in here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/01/my-son-has-been-watching-programmes-about-nazis-and-serial-killers","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T15:00:45Z","webTitle":"My son has been watching programmes about Nazis and serial killers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/01/my-son-has-been-watching-programmes-about-nazis-and-serial-killers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/01/my-son-has-been-watching-programmes-about-nazis-and-serial-killers","fields":{"headline":"My son has been watching programmes about Nazis and serial killers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I have an 18-year-old son who has had anxiety and depression for some time. I have brought him and his brother up by myself as their father left when they were young. My son had some input from Camhs [child and adolescent mental health services] with varying degrees of success, but his last episode of care with them was useless. Once he turned 18, they discharged him with no advice or support. I have been told by a Camhs psychiatrist that he is on the autism spectrum, but with no official diagnosis. I was advised not to tell him, as he has a problematic relationship with his elder brother, who has a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. My son has an explosive temper and is very hard to live with at times – if he gets angry, he will destroy things around the house. His bedroom door has had to be fixed three times now. However, my latest worry involves what he watches on TV. I recently looked at his viewed programmes, which included documentaries on Nazi Germany, in particular, concentration camps. He has also watched documentaries about Josef Fritzl, several about kidnappers and serial killers and a series about crime scenes and how they are cleaned up. I found this very disturbing but have no idea what I should do about it. If I confront him, he will have a meltdown and accuse me of spying on him. He is constantly angry, but refuses to tell me why, saying: “Why should I tell you what is upsetting me?” He refuses to go to his GP for help about his anxiety. I have told him that I am here to listen if he changes his mind. Seeing the type of programmes he is watching has made me worry about how deep this anger is and I really have no idea how to help him. I can see this is a very difficult situation. Now your son is 18, you cannot make him go to the GP or get treatment. I don’t think it was at all helpful for you (or your son) to be told that he is on the autism spectrum but with no formal diagnosis. Nor is it helpful to discourage you from discussing this with him. Even if his brother has Asperger’s, not all autistic people are the same. I contacted Dr Ian Davidson, a psychiatrist who is autism champion for the Royal College of Psychiatrists (rcpsych.ac.uk). With regard to your son’s viewing habits and your concern about them, he says: “Clearly, anyone can get interested in anything, but an autistic person can get interested [in something] in far more depth.” He felt that, on their own, viewing habits such as your son’s were not a cause for concern; these programmes are on mainstream TV because lots of people find them fascinating. But that, if someone were to take that into everyday life – say, instead of watching programmes about cleaning up crime scenes, they were to purchase items to clear up a crime scene (or to commit a crime) – that would be cause for concern and a call to the police. Equally, if someone were, for example, watching programmes about bombs that would be different from downloading information about making bombs. I hope that gives you a clear distinction. Davidson feels your son needs a “proper assessment. Every CCG [clinical commissioning group] has a legal requirement to do one.” And although you can’t force your son to get an assessment, Davidson says you could “do the preparatory work and ask what the pathway CCG is. Your GP should be able to tell you as you are not asking to discuss anything confidential.” Although, even if diagnosed, there are no entitlements to further services, if your son were to be assessed/diagnosed, he could then get a Care Act assessment done through the local authority and mainstream services, which may be able to help him. If your son were diagnosed, you could then, in turn, get an assessment for your needs as his carer, which could include, for example, counselling. I appreciate that a big stumbling block is making contact with your son, and this won’t be easy. When I asked Davidson how to help someone like your son, he said: “If your son is autistic he won’t necessarily have good communication skills, so you could try something like: ‘You appear to be unhappy. Is there anything we can do to help?’ If he won’t engage, you could then try something like: ‘If it’s too difficult to tell me, there are services that could help you.’ And you could get some information/links for him [I have put some below as a starting point].” While some people don’t find a diagnosis helpful, most find it hugely beneficial. Your son may be anxious, angry and depressed for a myriad of reasons and one of them could be that he has autism and needs support. I would contact the organisations below for more information, and for support for yourself. Go to your GP to find out the pathway for your son to get assessed – I know you have not had good experiences with Camhs, but you may get better support now he is an adult. Then try to present your son with information for him to get help. If he doesn’t listen at first, keep trying – and think about enlisting the help of any family members he may listen to. autism.org.uk; youngminds.org.uk; mind.org.uk Your problems solved Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

My face is the only part of my body left exposed throughout the night, and the nose acts as my thermometer. A warm nose means the flat is temperate enough for me to survive the shock of pulling off my duvet and heading to the freezing kitchen. A cold nose means the duvet is coming with me. It’s cumbersome, but there really is nothing as comforting. I’ve tried all the possible contenders – Aran jumpers, fleece dressing gowns – and all pale in comparison with the 360-degree feather-down extravaganza. Of course, there is the option of setting the heating to come on before we wake up, but that would mean enduring a different kind of chill: the cold shoulder from flatmates when the shared electricity bill comes in. But in some homes, it is possible to stay warm without spending a fortune, such as in this huge five-bed, barn conversion in the London suburbs. It prides itself on energy efficiency, boasting its own heat-loss recovery system, insulation throughout, and triple glazing. This means you can take full advantage of the underfloor heating across all 3,600 sq ft of it, guilt-free.

The phantasmagoric world of this artist who didn’t need stimulants to see double has never looked better than it does here. Paintings by Dalí, from his youthful work Girl at a Window, which convincingly shows what a technical talent he was, to his eerie 1951 religious hallucination Christ of St John of the Cross, demonstrate amply that however kitsch and silly he could be he was one of the 20th century’s wildest dreamers. His friend Marcel Duchamp was a still greater visionary. Duchamp’s readymades, including his snow shovel and bottlerack, are shown in all their philosophically discombobulating glory, along with original notes and sketches that let you into his beguiling thoughts. This is a joyously mind-expanding art explosion for the holidays. • Royal Academy, London, to 3 January. Cézanne If you are desperate for something to keep your brain alive during the shopping and mince pie season, or just want to see great art, don’t miss this startling and absorbing encounter with one of the most profound of all artists. As revolutionary as Picasso, as introspective as Rembrandt, the portraits of Cézanne are supremely intelligent and imaginative. His own personality comes through powerfully in this outstanding survey of his portraits. The unease with which he looks at the world is all too evident in his many paintings of his own nervous, uncertain face. That modern anxiety also haunts his portraits of others, as he seems to seek to penetrate their mystery. Cézanne was a close friend of the radical novelist Zola, but his portraits go beyond Zola’s realism to question the very nature of selfhood. Not at all tinselly, then – but unmissable. • National Portrait Gallery, London, to 11 February. Peter Doig You have to be in Peter Doig’s enviable position as a solid gold art market darling to launch a new exhibition just before Christmas, when most people are more focused on presents and pantos than the latest art. Yet if you do have a craving to see art amid the last-minute shopping – or are a billionaire in search of that perfect gift – you could hardly do better than Doig. His timeless paintings are like visual fairytales to enjoy around a log fire in a remote snowbound cottage, or ski chalet. They evoke a neverland of the imagination, at once peaceful, poetic, seductive and a bit frightening – like hearing a half forgotten folk-rock masterpiece on the radio in the middle of nowhere. Then hearing it again in an uneasy dream. • Michael Werner Gallery, London, 19 December-17 February. Susan Philipsz Ever wondered why we reach for music at times of celebration and community? With carols and Christmassy pop songs filling the midwinter streets, the power of sound is impossible to ignore, not to mention avoid, at this time of year. Philipsz isolates that magic to contemplate it as a thing of wonder. She turns sound itself into sculpture, so that you feel its physical force – literally seem to apprehend its waves around you – only to be startled all over again by its capacity to reach the soul. Her version of David Bowie’s Starman is my Christmas No 1. • Baltic, Gateshead, to 4 March; and Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, to 18 February. Waqas Khan The dreamlike abstract art of this 21st-century visionary is just the thing to take you out of yourself on a voyage to inner realms of peace and mystery. Waqas Khan, who lives in Lahore and spends months on end shut in his studio to create his sensuous, infinitely varied and subtle waves of interconnecting pen marks, is fascinated by the teachings of Sufism. This inward and mystical school of Islam, which has been savagely attacked by terrorists in Egypt and Timbuktu, has a long history of inspiring art, from medieval Persian poetry to Morocco’s Master Musicians of Joujouka. Khan shares their trancelike qualities yet he also a powerful grasp of the American minimal tradition. The result is some of today’s most beautiful and uplifting art. Go on, treat yourself. • Manchester Art Gallery to 25 February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/27/readers-on-the-royal-engagement-prince-harry-meghan-markle","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T15:34:49Z","webTitle":"'I love the idea of a mixed-race princess': readers on the royal engagement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/readers-on-the-royal-engagement-prince-harry-meghan-markle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/readers-on-the-royal-engagement-prince-harry-meghan-markle","fields":{"headline":"'I love the idea of a mixed-race princess': readers on the royal engagement","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"‘For the first time in my life, there will be someone I can relate to in the royal family’: Anna I am delighted that Harry is marrying a mixed-race woman.

It is a sign of how far the UK has moved in our understanding of what it means to be British, as related to the royals who tend to be supported the most by the more traditional end of the nation. It makes me proud to be British and Welsh and I welcome the future Duchess to the fold. The internet went a little far initially but seem to have got it right since then.

The young prince seems to exude a sense of entitlement to all the benefits of his position while resenting the less welcome accoutrements of the role. The young actress is being positioned as a modern strong feminist, which seems at odds with marrying a prince and all that brings. ‘I love the idea of a mixed-race princess to show diversity is the future’: Tim, 50, Hertfordshire As someone with a six-year-old mixed-race British-Chinese daughter I love the idea of a mixed-race princess to show that diversity is the future for this country. ‘It makes me feel I no longer have to feel excluded for the colour of my skin’: Christine, 59, Hampshire What fantastic news; well done Prince Harry for following your heart.

The Body Shop Shea Lip Butter (£4.50) looks like butter indeed, in a cute little pot. It tastes like butter, too. I am not fond of beauty products smelling like food. In addition, I am not convinced by its moisturising property. A good price, though. Next week: All Ages model David Yang on scented winter candles This article contains affiliate links to products.

Local people hurled rocks at police who used bulldozers and the elephants in a show of force in Amchang wildlife sanctuary in Assam state. The police commissioner, Hiren Nath, said five protesters were injured in a scuffle after officers deployed teargas to disperse them. Authorities plan to demolish about 1,000 bamboo and tin huts. The state forest minister, Pramila Brahma, said the area was an elephant habitat and the unauthorised settlements were forcing the animals to leave in search of food. There have been many incidents in which wild elephants have killed people and destroyed crops after entering villages. Nath said the police action followed a court order to clear the forest of illegal encroachment by Thursday. Residents had argued they had legally bought the land before finding out it sat within a protected forestry area. The eviction drive is being carried out by wildlife wardens, with police providing protection against possible attacks by residents. According to a 2014 forestry department survey, about 6,000 people have built homes inside the wildlife sanctuary at 24 locations. Some environmentalists oppose the use of the animals to demolish structures, arguing it runs counter to their natural instincts and can cause them serious injury. But the elephants are able to reach some settlements more easily than excavators. Those living inside the sanctuaries argue they should be given alternative houses before their existing homes are demolished. Two people were reportedly killed and 17 injured, including 15 police officers, when protesters clashed with authorities during an elephant-led demolition drive in Kaziranga national park in September 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/16/christmas-roast-vegetables-penang-thai-curry-vegan-recipe-meera-sodha","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T09:30:01Z","webTitle":"Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for Christmas veg Penang curry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/16/christmas-roast-vegetables-penang-thai-curry-vegan-recipe-meera-sodha","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/16/christmas-roast-vegetables-penang-thai-curry-vegan-recipe-meera-sodha","fields":{"headline":"Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for Christmas veg Penang curry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My mother is the queen of transforming leftovers into new wonders, and she comes into her own on Boxing Day, the biggest leftovers challenge of the year. Christmas, after all, is a game of two halves. The first is Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (which I covered in last week’s Food Special), when there are plenty of fresh ingredients, bright-eyed cooks and extravagant feasts. Then, on Boxing Day and beyond, the kitchen turns into a battleground of odds and ends: pyramids of roast parsnips and spuds, Tupperware as far as the eye can see, when all you want is something that will virtually cook itself. For my mother, using up leftovers was an obsession born of necessity, and she never threw out anything unless it was growing legs and about to walk out by itself. Now, spinning meals out of lonely and lost ingredients is her own one-woman game show, one that gives great joy as another piece of broccoli is saved from the bin. Her past Boxing Day triumphs include: roast potatoes hard fried with tinned chickpeas and lots of chilli and lemon; sprout and spud curry; pav bhaji, a sort of Indian bubble and squeak, piled high into yorkshire puddings; sweet and crunchy carrot and cabbage pakoras with a fiery cranberry chutney. Today’s recipe is a homage to one of Mum’s Boxing Day curries. It’s Thai, not Indian, and not dissimilar to a red curry; but it features more aromatics such as Thai basil, kaffir lime leaves and galangal, and it comes together very simply via a blender and a pan. The result is at once soothing and enlivening, a meal that even the most tired cook can muster up without too much effort. Christmas veg Penang curry A perfect home for leftover roast veg, but salt judiciously, because they’ll have been seasoned already. (If you’d like to roast veg specially to make this, you’ll need about 1.4kg mixed potatoes, parsnips, carrots and sprouts, peeled and roasted in a little oil.) It’s worth hunting down fresh Thai basil, because it has a special aniseed flavour that really pulls the dish together. Serves four. For the Penang curry paste 2 tsp coriander seeds 2 tsp cumin seeds 3 tbsp rapeseed oil 2 birds’ eye chillies, chopped 6 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped 1 banana shallot, peeled and chopped 2 sticks lemongrass, tough outer leaves removed, chopped 6 kaffir lime leaves 1 tbsp galangal paste (I use Bart’s) 1 handful roasted unsalted peanuts 1 ½ tbsp tomato puree For the curry 1.2kg leftover roast vegetables 400ml tin coconut milk 1 ¼ tsp salt 1 ½ tsp caster sugar Thai basil, to serve In a large frying pan, toast the coriander and cumin seeds until golden, then leave to cool. Put the spices in a blender with all the other curry paste ingredients, and blitz to a smooth paste, adding up to four or five tablespoons of cold water to help it along. Put a large pan on a low heat, then add the curry paste, salt and sugar (if your cooked vegetables are pre-seasoned, just season to taste at the end) and cook out the paste, stirring, for about eight minutes, stirring constantly. Stir the coconut milk into the paste mix bit by bit, and once the can is empty, fill it a third-full with cold water and add that, too. Leave the sauce to come up to a simmer, then stir in the leftover roast vegetables and leave to simmer and heat through for a few minutes. (If you’ve made the veg from scratch, they’ll still be hot, so stir them in at the last moment.) Scatter over a handful of Thai basil leaves, check and amend the seasoning to taste, and serve hot with plain rice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/27/conservative-mps-warn-new-defence-secretary-over-spending-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T17:08:54Z","webTitle":"Conservative MPs warn new defence secretary over spending cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/27/conservative-mps-warn-new-defence-secretary-over-spending-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/27/conservative-mps-warn-new-defence-secretary-over-spending-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Conservative MPs warn new defence secretary over spending cuts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The new defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, was put on notice in the Commons that he will face a substantial Tory revolt if a national security review leads to major cuts in the armed services. Williamson, making his Commons debut in his new job, faced Conservative backbenchers who pressed him to stand up to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, over a threatened squeeze on the MoD budget. The threatened rebellion is over a Cabinet Office review of the UK’s national security, originally scheduled to report in December but now delayed until January or February. The review includes the intelligence services MI5, MI6 and the surveillance agency GCHQ but the MoD, with by far the biggest budget, £36bn, is facing the brunt of proposed cuts. One of the strongest warnings to Williamson came from Conservative MP James Gray, who said the Cabinet Office needed to be told the review should not be some kind of camouflage to cut the services. “Will he speak to the chancellor of the exchequer to make sure he digs deep into his pockets to produce the money we need? Above all, will he speak to the chief whip to remind him that if he does not do so, he will face a very substantial rebellion?” Gray said. British defence reviews have followed a predictable pattern down the decades: proposed defence cuts prompt an outcry from Conservative backbenchers, backed by retired generals and admirals. The Cabinet Office review is of a different order, addressing a more fundamental question: whether British armed forces are still relevant to conflict in a world in which cyber-warfare, robots, drones and artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly important. Part of this is whether, after a spate of terrorist attacks and plots in the UK this year, the focus should now be more on counter-terrorism than on potential threats from states such as Russia and China. The MoD has drawn up a list for cuts that includes two ships that help with amphibious landings, HMS Bulwark and HMS Albion; reducing the number of marines from 7,000 to 6,000; delaying or cutting back on the number of F-35 jets to be bought for two new aircraft carriers; and scaling back an ambitious army plan to deploy a 30,000 strong-division by 2025. The MoD says no decisions have yet been taken. Williamson, who only took over as defence secretary from Michael Fallon earlier this month, largely sidestepped a series of questions from Conservative and opposition backbenchers about the review. One of the few hints he gave of his position was when he said the world was rapidly changing but the threats came not just from cyber attacks but from Britain’s peers, by which he meant Russia. Williamson admitted he had not yet met the chancellor to make the MoD case against cuts. Julian Lewis, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, said Williamson should remind the chancellor that during the cold war the UK spent 5% of GDP on defence, is now barely 2% and a target nearer to 3% would help prevent UK forces from being hollowed out. Williamson said he regarded 2% as a base rather than a ceiling. Gen Sir Richard Barrons, who retired last year as chief of joint forces command, suspects, shares the view of backbenchers that the review is an excuse to squeeze the defence budget, which he argues is already about £1.5bn to £2bn short a year. “There is a school of thought led by some who are at the heart of the previous Conservative administration that believes the conventional military is post-history and all that matters now is cyber and the only thing that matters is keeping terrorism away from our shores,” Barrons said. “No one can doubt the urgency of dealing with terrorism but if you look at the actual effect of terrorism, it is quite small and arguably diminishing. We should keep it in perspective.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/27/end-secrecy-of-confessionals-to-protect-catholic-children","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T13:46:23Z","webTitle":"End secrecy of confessionals 'to protect Catholic children'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/end-secrecy-of-confessionals-to-protect-catholic-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/end-secrecy-of-confessionals-to-protect-catholic-children","fields":{"headline":"End secrecy of confessionals 'to protect Catholic children'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Mandatory reporting of sexual misconduct and abolishing the secrecy of the priest’s confessional box are needed to protect children at Catholic schools, the national inquiry into child sexual abuse has been told. At the opening of a three-week hearing into Benedictine schools, lawyers representing scores of victims have called for fundamental changes to the way the church handles complaints and deals with suspected offenders. Richard Scorer, of the law firm Slater and Gordon, who represents 27 core participants at the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), said the failure to make reporting suspected abuse a crime had allowed clerics to evade responsibility. “A mandatory reporting law would have changed their behaviour,” Scorer told the hearing. “At Downside Abbey, abuse was discovered but not reported and abusers were left to free to abuse again and great harm was done to victims. “The Catholic church purports to be a moral beacon for others around it yet these clerical sex abuse cases profoundly undermine it … Why has the temptation to cover up abuse been particularly acute in organisations forming part of the Roman Catholic church?” David Enright, a solicitor at Howe and Co who represents more than a dozen former schoolboys from a Catholic Comboni missionary school – run by an order founded in Italy in the 1860s – said there were more than a million children attending Catholic-run educational institutions in the UK. One former abuser at the Comboni school had not been punished but moved elsewhere after complaints and eventually became a Scouts commissioner in Uganda, Enright revealed. Removing the privileges of priestly confession would help change attitudes, he suggested. “Matters revealed in confession, including child abuse, cannot be used in governance,” Enright said. “One can’t think of a more serious obstacle embedded in the law of the Catholic church to achieving child protection. “The Catholic church is so opaque, so disparate, so full of separate bodies who are not subject to any authority that it is difficult to see how reform can be made to provide good governance and introduce acceptable standards of child protection.” The latest strand of the IICSA’s inquiry is focusing on two Benedictine abbeys and their associated schools, Downside and Ampleforth. Introducing the investigation, Riel Karmy-Jones QC, counsel to the inquiry, said past allegations and convictions at the two schools had exposed a wide range of misconduct. She said these included excessive physical chastisement, sometimes apparently for sexual gratification; voyeuristic beatings where children had been made to strip and to bend over so as to expose their naked bottoms; grooming; fondling of genitalia; buggery and rape. Karmy-Jones said the inquiry was likely to hear allegations of complaints being ignored, pressure being applied to families not to report abuse, the police not being informed and known abusers being moved to other locations to avoid scandal. In other cases, she said, abusers were permitted to stay in their posts and allowed to have contact with children and other vulnerable individuals. “It may be that there is some acceptance of failings, but reliance will be placed on changes that have been made over the years,” Karmy-Jones said. “But as you will hear, concerns remain and you are likely to hear evidence that suggests safeguarding problems are still ongoing, with the inevitable result that children may remain at risk.” Representatives of both abbeys made opening statements expressing regret for past abuse. Matthias Kelly QC, for Ampleforth, offered “sincere and heartfelt apologies”. He said: “We wish to apologise for the hurt, distress and damage done to those who suffered abuse when in our care. We will do everything we can to ensure that there is no repetition. “Before 2005 [when a new abbot took over], there were failings, omissions, a lack of transparency and misguided loyalty [to the abbey]. Ampleforth is committed to learning from the past.” Kate Gallafent QC, for the English Benedictine Congregation, said that as the number of children abused had become apparent, there had been a sense of shame and “intense sadness at the anguish caused to so many people”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/nov/28/goats-martyr-surreal-cost-syria-civil-war-liwaa-yazji-royal-court","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T17:29:31Z","webTitle":"A goat for every martyr: the bitterly funny play about the surreal cost of Syria's civil war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/28/goats-martyr-surreal-cost-syria-civil-war-liwaa-yazji-royal-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/nov/28/goats-martyr-surreal-cost-syria-civil-war-liwaa-yazji-royal-court","fields":{"headline":"A goat for every martyr: the bitterly funny play about the surreal cost of Syria's civil war","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When the protests of 2011 in Syria turned into armed revolution, and the country slipped into civil war, poet and playwright Liwaa Yazji began filling her notebooks with the bizarre, painful details of what had become daily life in her home country. Yazji had been fascinated by war’s tragic absurdity, the cruel compromises it demands of those who want to stay alive, the warping effects of violence, long before it became personal as a student in Damascus. Years later, she realised the stories she had collected from news reports and conversations with friends asked the same questions – about “how we accept and why” – as the works she loved by writers such as Edward Bond and Hungary’s István Örkény. She began shaping them into her latest play, Goats, now at the Royal Court in London. “It started with a very local accumulation of details,” she says. “Then I realised all of a sudden that what I was following was how we normalise surreal happenings in war. So that was the urge.” Dark and bitterly funny, Goats is set in a small Syrian village where the eponymous animals are handed out by authorities to families who lose fathers, sons and husbands in the endless civil war. It is staged with real goats, the most unruly of divas to direct, their bleating as much a distraction and lament to the audience as it is to their village owners. All the major, shocking events are drawn from details Yazji had compiled over years of war and exile. From the grotesque compensation of goats for dead men, to a late, cruel twist that drives home the old truth about war: that the violence you wreak on enemies comes back to haunt you. Every painful, farcical moment has been lived by a Syrian family somewhere – Yazji only used her imagination to anchor the unfolding events in fictional characters and families. The normalisation of the surreal and the unacceptable edged into Yazji’s own life as well. She remembers friends telling her they had written the sounds of conflict into their staging of a play, so it could continue as battles raged outside. Born in Moscow, where her Syrian parents were studying, she grew up in Aleppo and Damascus, studying English literature and theatre. She has published poetry as well as plays, has made documentaries and is working on a thriller series for German television. Many of these works explore the lives of both refugees and Syrians like her, living in unexpected exile: Yazji left Damascus to pursue artistic projects in Germany and is no longer sure she can return. Her book of poems, In Peace, We Leave Home, was published in 2014, the same year she finished an Arabic-language translation of Bond’s Saved, and directed Haunted, a documentary about people’s relationships with their homes during war. It traces why people stay or leave, what they try to save when they flee, what home means when a city or neighbourhood is being ripped apart. In contrast, the people whose lives unfold around the goats of her play live far from the frontline, in areas that have never slipped from the control of President Bashar al-Assad’s government. The suppression that helps keep the government in power makes it hard for outsiders to visit these areas – and it is dangerous for their inhabitants to be open about their opinions in public. In many ways, that makes this play all the more powerful and important, because Syrians living under the government – and those fighting for it – are no more uniform supporters than citizens in any dictatorship. “After six years of fighting I guess the more people know, the more they maybe understand that there is a way to live in this country and we have to stick to it,” says Yazji who has friends and relatives who live in such areas. “I don’t mean by that we have to be collaborators, of course not. I fight against everyone who says that anyone inside Syria is that. It’s just that you have to understand the code.” Goats explores the villagers’ painful choice between accepting the official version of how the war is playing out, or challenging it at huge personal cost. “Has anyone ever told the truth?” asks the persuasive villain of the play, Abu al-Tayyib, chair of the local party and the most powerful man in the village. “Has anyone ever demanded it? Does anyone want it? Does anyone even need it?” Much of the propaganda that plays out during Goats – ceremonies performed for the watching cameras of the national TV channel and formal party meetings – seems almost silly, a spectacle of patently empty devotion or happiness. But for Yazji, who grew up inside the system of censorship and control, that falsity is not a design flaw but a key aspect of how propaganda not only twists reality but also breaks resistance. “When the dictatorship makes you accept trivialities,” she says, “it’s a sign of power. So it’s not only about humiliating you, it’s about ruling you by making you repeat stupid things.” A character in the play puts it more bluntly. “If we keep learning stuff that’s the exact opposite of the last thing we learned,” says a teenager called Jude, “how am I supposed to know which one’s right?” Jude asks this of his teacher, a grieving father, when he backtracks on years of patriotism and says the war is not worth dying for. Yazji does not offer easy answers, least of all to herself. She even questions her own horror at the handover of goats. At first glance they seem to cheapen the lives of the dead but may be a lifeline for families who have lost a breadwinner, or helpful consolation to those worried a sacrifice will be forgotten. “Who am I to decide if this is right or wrong?” she says. “What background am I coming from? I am someone sitting on sofa in a house that was not destroyed, saying that people should not take that goat. Who am I to bring the ethics of peace and apply them to people under war?” For villagers whose suffering has no obvious end, party leader Tayyib offers an argument for pragmatic accommodation with the government, describing resistance at one point as contagious madness: “The war swallows up everything that came before it. All we can do now is see which of us manages to stay alive. What’s on the inside doesn’t matter.” Yazji says: “In no way did I want to justify evil, but I want to create a character and give him the resources to justify himself. I’m not going to create a dictatorship within my work – where the bad character is not given the right to speak.” Goats is also an attack on stereotypes that too often reduce Syrians to ciphers, Isis fighters, or the most vulnerable of refugees adrift at sea. Those images are alienating, says Yazji, even the ones designed to evoke pity. “You cannot imagine yourself in a boat in the middle of the sea, no matter what happens now with your life,” she says, of her audiences beyond Syria. But a drama of families grappling with death and loss is familiar anywhere. “We can reposition ourselves in that place, because that might happen to us. Even if my son is fighting somewhere else, that story could still be the same. “Syria is not the first war and will not be the last. So I’m not always looking at the issue of war as something that is coming from a different planet.” As for the country’s immediate future, she feels bleak. “It just hurts,” she says. “I am not very optimistic.” She quotes a line from her own play when asked if she thinks the conflict can be resolved. “If this lie is uncovered, it’s only to cover another lie.” Goats is at the Royal Court, London, until 30 December.

Age: As old as humanity itself. Appearance: Abandoned and alone. This feels like the premise of an especially troubling Pixar film. Yep, but apparently fewer children than ever have an imaginary friend. Impossible. Stat me. In 2001, almost half of British children had imaginary friends, but now that has dwindled to a measly 17%, according to research. There are now fewer than one million imaginary friends in the wild. Are they all being murdered by John Lewis nightlights? If only. In reality, it’s all the fault of technology. Too much screentime has reduced our children’s capacity for imagination. Why develop anything as laborious as creativity when there’s non-stop Paw Patrol on the iPad? And this is a bad thing? Of course! Imaginary friends help children understand the world, or learn to withdraw from it in a healthy way. They can even act as tools that allow toddlers to role-play authority. They’re hugely valuable. So they’re good? Not always. Some kids invent imaginary friends purely to take the blame for their own innate awfulness, as scapegoats whenever they make a mess or beat up their siblings. So they’re bad? Not really. It takes real creativity to invent a brand new person upon whom to pin your failings. That creativity might one day manifest itself in a cure for cancer or an award-winning book, which will never happen if you’re just watching 10-hour YouTube playlists of Finger Family videos all day long. How can we make our kids adopt imaginary friends, then? Well, the easy way is to cut out screentime and replace it with an environment of child-led play using building blocks and Play-Doh. That sounds boring. Or you could just scream and bang pipes straight after putting them to bed at night, and blame it all on ghosts. Remember, a traumatised child is an imaginative child. Really? Good god, no. I’m not sold on imaginary friends as a concept. This is awkward. I’m not sure how to break this to you, but I invented you in 1992 as a fictional counterpoint to make this article format work. You’re actually my imaginary friend. No! Stop! I invented you! I’m real! I feel pain! I bleed! Well, this got real dark real quick.

A week of sunshine at the end of August this year had abruptly ended and it had been pelting down all day. Miraculously, just as we’d reached the dog-friendly part of the beach, it had stopped raining. Rosie had been haring about the beach, tail up, while Chris and I walked along the seafront. “This half hour has made this trip worth it,” I said. We’d almost cancelled our plans to go to Brighton for the day as the weather had been so foul. When I first saw her, I thought she was out for a swim in a wetsuit. But as we got nearer, we saw she was fully dressed, lying on her back gently sculling the water with her hands. We hesitated: we knew this scene wasn’t right. Then we heard her: “Help, please, I don’t want to die.” We ran to the shoreline. I shouted over: “We are here, you are not going to die, we won’t let that happen. Can you swim to us?” It quickly became apparent from her distress that she had gone out there with the intention of drowning herself, but had then changed her mind. I remember thinking, I can’t believe this is happening; that it is down to us to get this woman out of the water. I looked around to see if there were other people we could share the burden with, but we were alone. We could see she was disoriented, exhausted. She kept swimming away from us and then would change her mind and try to come back inland. Chris was getting ready to jump in, but with no one else around, I panicked about how I’d get them off the beach without help. I tried one last time. Rather than being nice, I found myself getting bossy. “You asked us for help, you want to live, now you must swim towards us,” I said. “Stop swimming away. Just focus on my green umbrella, swim to it and don’t stop.” She seemed not to be moving, until suddenly she was within reach and I waded in to catch her hand. She slumped to the sand. I sat next to her and asked her name. She was my age and kept saying how sorry she was for wasting our time. I couldn’t imagine how much pain she must have been in to feel that desperate. We needed the woman to get to her feet; she was so cold, we couldn’t keep sitting there with her soaked through. We were worried she was becoming hypothermic. “Shall I let you into a secret?” I said. “Four years ago, almost to this very hour, I was taken down to an operating theatre to have a double lung transplant. My life was saved by a stranger, and now here we are, strangers helping you. Please don’t apologise, we are glad to be here.” That was the reason Chris and I had taken the train to Brighton that day: to mark the anniversary of my transplant. Before that operation, I was on oxygen, using a wheelchair, unable to wash by myself. It had taken everything I had to cling to the belief that a better life was waiting for me if I could hold on. The woman on the beach broke my heart when she said I’d deserved to get better, but that she didn’t. I told her we were both just very ill and needed to let other people help us sometimes. We got her changed into a spare windbreaker, and managed to get her to walk back to her friend’s house, who was distraught at her absence. The last I saw of her, she was sitting on a balcony, smoking a cigarette, wrapped in a blanket. She’d asked for one more minute before she talked to the paramedics we’d called for help. The whole episode took 30 minutes, but the odd coincidence of it still makes it feel like a scene from an unfeasible movie in my mind. Every day, I think of the stranger who saved my life; I never contemplated that I would be able to save a stranger in return. That evening one of my friends texted me back to say: “Your donor was able to give yet another gift to this world.” • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.
