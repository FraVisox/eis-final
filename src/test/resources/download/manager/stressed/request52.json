The legal manoeuvre was launched by Jeremy Wright QC following criticism over delays about what to do with the National Fund, which was established in 1928 with the aim of paying off the country’s accumulated financial liabilities. The account was created when an anonymous donor supplied £500,000 – a decade after Stanley Baldwin appealed to citizens to help pay the country’s war debts – with a mandate to build an endowment large enough to pay off all the money the UK owed in one go. With Britain’s national debt at £1.7tn, however, the fund’s trustees concluded nine years ago that there was no prospect of cancelling it and applied to the Charity Commission to change its constitution so it could donate money to charities around the UK. Labour, which estimates that the fund is now worth £475m, supports the call for the money to be redirected to charity, but Wright wants it to go to the original cause. The fund has never grown above 0.066% of the national debt and has in effect been stuck in legal limbo since its establishment. The attorney general’s office argues that it has a duty to adhere as closely as possible to the original purpose of the fund in order to respect the wishes of those who have contributed to it. Deviating from the donors’ wishes would set a precedent that might discourage future donors if they believed the aims of their original gifts could be changed retrospectively. The attorney general said: “Almost 90 years ago, an anonymous donor bequeathed money to the nation and yet we have not been able to put it to good use. We have been working with the Treasury, trustees and the Charity Commission to find a solution consistent with the donor’s original objectives of extinguishing the national debt. “I am applying to the high court to ask that the fund is released and, if that application is successful, the fund could be used to benefit the nation by helping to do what the original donors intended.” The minister has sought the approval of the trustees to enable the terms of the charity to be amended so the money can be released. He will apply for the money to go towards the reduction of the national debt in accordance with the fund’s original intention. But Steve Reed, the shadow minister for civil society, said: “This £475m would be a tidal wave of support for small charities, but it’s a drop in the ocean compared to the national debt. In fact, the national debt is rising so fast that by the end of the same day this payment is made towards it, the debt will have risen by nearly the same amount. “This government never misses a chance to sideline charities. Here’s a real chance to do some real good but the government is threatening to do nothing instead.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/28/the-new-world-comics-from-mauretania-chris-reynolds-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"The New World: Comics from Mauretania by Chris Reynolds – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/28/the-new-world-comics-from-mauretania-chris-reynolds-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/28/the-new-world-comics-from-mauretania-chris-reynolds-review","fields":{"headline":"The New World: Comics from Mauretania by Chris Reynolds – review","bodyText":"Strictly speaking, The New World is not new. All the comics included in it have been published before; the earliest date from the 1980s. But in another, more important way, it is entirely novel. Designed and edited by Seth of Palookaville fame, and luxuriously published by New York Review Books, it gathers together between hard covers a variety of work by Chris Reynolds, the cult Welsh-born artist who remains both underrated and too little known. The result is a collection that isn’t only beautiful to look at and to hold; turning its pages, it strikes you that though these ineffably strange strips were written in another time, they work better in ours. Here, after all, is a world where technology must be treated with suspicion, workers perform random jobs whose nature is essentially pointless, and loneliness is the presiding spirit of the age. Could this be Reynolds’s moment? Perhaps. Welcome, then, to Mauretania, a realm that has nothing whatsoever to do with the Maghreb, or the famous ocean liner launched by Cunard in 1906. It’s a place that looks and sounds a little like the America of Edward Hopper, but it’s also clear that we are far in the future. The Earth having fallen under the control of alien forces, everything is at once the same and vastly different. Nature is in the process of being destroyed, new religions keep appearing, businesses are closed down every day for no good reason, the air reeks of conspiracy. Nothing, in other words, makes much sense at all – neither to Reynolds’s protagonists nor the reader. And then there is Monitor, a Zelig-like figure who always wears a helmet, and whose eyes are always hidden behind a visor. Who is he, and what is his purpose? We never quite find out. Most of these tales – The New World includes 17 short stories, the novella The Dial, and the full-length graphic novel Mauretania – begin straightforwardly enough: a man returns to his family home after a long period away; a couple say goodbye having lost their jobs when the factory that employs them closes down. Only then the ground shifts. People begin talking in riddles; bureaucracy starts to seem ever more nightmarish; mysterious figures suddenly appear in old photographs. The result is unnerving; for the reader, it’s like trying to walk on ice. Resistance, however, is futile. The only possible thing to do is to submit to this sense of disorientation, even of queasiness – and, perhaps, to take comfort in the artist’s marvellously inky drawings, whose thick lines bring to mind both woodcuts and the movies of Hitchcock in his 60s heyday (also, Victorian funeral cards). As the writer Ed Park suggests in his introduction, to call Reynolds’s comics black and white isn’t quite to do them justice; they’re more like black and white and black – and it’s in that extra layer of darkness that his genius may be found. • The New World: Comics from Mauretania by Chris Reynolds is published by New York Review Comics (£24.99).

Mohamed Neda, a Kabul-born chauffeur who lived on the top floor in flat 205, called his loved ones as the fire took hold and left a message in Dari, an Afghan language, which said: “Goodbye. We are now leaving this world. Goodbye. I hope I haven’t disappointed you. Goodbye to all.” His family was one of three to give testimony at the start of the first day of the inquiry. They all spoke of their devastation in front of an emotional audience of survivors. Dozens more are expected to give testimony over six days, this week and next, in what the inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said was “integral” evidence and “will remind us of the fundamental purpose” as it looks for the truth behind the deaths of 72 people. The heart-rending contributions, accompanied by photos projected on to big screens, were heard by an audience at the Millennium Gloucester hotel in Kensington that included Elizabeth Campbell, the leader of Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which owns Grenfell Tower, and Commander Stuart Cundy of the Metropolitan police, who is overseeing the criminal investigation into the fire. The father of Logan Gomes, an unborn child who died, gave the first testimony, paying a tearful tribute to the disaster’s youngest victim. Marcio Gomes sat alongside his wife, Andreia, and told how he had been “broken” by the death of his son, who was stillborn after the fire while Andreia was in a coma. It was the first of dozens of tributes that will be heard. “I held my son in my arms, wishing, praying for any kind of miracle that he would open his eyes, move, make a sound,” he told those gathered at the central London hotel. “As we know, that never happened.” Breaking down, he covered his face with a tissue before continuing, saying how the family had planned a trip to Disneyland and a Gruffalo hunt and had decorated Logan’s nursery on Grenfell’s 21st floor ready for his arrival. He showed slides of an ultrasound scan, happy moments during a baby shower and a picture of a babygrow for him. “He was going to be my superstar ... You don’t know what you are made of until you are broken,” he said, hugging his wife and adding: “Without her strength and courage I would not be here.” The family of Denis Murphy, who died on the 14th floor and who had lived at Grenfell since before 1997, recalled his last phone call, made at 2.32am on 14 June last year. His sister, Anne-Marie Murphy, spoke of his passion for football – particularly Chelsea FC – and his “loyalty, caring, selflessness and non-judgmental approach” to life. “Ever since Denis is gone there is a gaping hole in our hearts that can never be filled and it hurts,” she said. “It really hurts.” She said that all that they were able to recover as a memento from his fire-ravaged flat was a handful of coins. “He is our hero, he was our hero and he will always be our hero,” she said. They were followed by the family of Neda, who was known as Saber. Speaking through their solicitors, they recounted their search of hospitals, mosques and community centres in the hope he might be still alive. His son, Fahad, who was in a coma after the fire, spoke of the “deep pain that my dad will not be at my wedding”. His wife told how they had fled Taliban rule in Afghanistan in 1998 and had come to the UK “as it is a country known around for its respect for human rights and fairness”. They were refugees and moved into Grenfell in 1999 before becoming British citizens. The tributes were met by applause and then breaks for the audience to consider what they had heard. Earlier Richard Millett QC made an opening statement describing the fire as the “single greatest tragedy to befall this country since the second world war” and said it was “fitting that the opening of the inquiry should be dedicated to those that died”. “Grenfell is not a lawyers’ argument or a scientific experiment,” he said. “Grenfell Tower was not a public space. Grenfell was home. Its flats were private and a supposedly safe space where individuals could live their lives. It was a human space for human lives, each unique. That is what a home is.” He said: “It was a joined up community whose members worked, lived, played and prayed together ... and many of them died together.” There was a levelling atmosphere to the inquiry proceedings as they began. In the hour before it began, victims, survivors and their families mixed over cups of tea. Bernard Richmond, second counsel to the inquiry, told survivors to call him Bernie. He said: “It is going to be a very emotional six days.” Richmond said he would warn people about pictures, about voices of the deceased and images of the tower or fire. Describing the commemorations that have been prepared, he said: “The work has been both moving and admirable.” He said: “This room needs to be a calm safe space for those people and all of us. When people are going through and talking can we please keep movement in the room to a minimum. People will of course want to go out because they are feeling overwhelmed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/21/us-stocks-surge-after-us-china-trade-war-truce","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T14:39:05Z","webTitle":"US stocks surge after US-China trade war truce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/21/us-stocks-surge-after-us-china-trade-war-truce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/21/us-stocks-surge-after-us-china-trade-war-truce","fields":{"headline":"US stocks surge after US-China trade war truce","bodyText":"US stocks surged on Monday after the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said the prospect of a trade war was “on hold” following an agreement to suspend tariff threats. In early trading in New York, the Dow Jones was up more than 300 points, or 1.2%, with Wall Street’s S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes also making gains. The markets were buoyed by comments made by the treasury secretary and White House top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who both said the US had reached an agreement with a visiting Chinese trade delegation to ease trade imbalances between the world’s two largest economies. Despite the vagueness of the terms, Mnuchin put a positive spin on the talks, telling CNBC on Monday they had already produced tangible benefits. “I think we’ve made very meaningful progress. Now it’s up to both of us to make sure that we can implement it.” The agreement, or truce, aimed at reducing the US’s annual $337bn trade deficit with China was reached after an announcement from Beijing that it would “significantly increase” purchases of American farm goods, energy and other products and services. “We want China to open up markets, lower tariffs, lower non-tariff barriers, give us a chance. We also want China however to change their behavior with respect to technology transfers and also the theft of intellectual property rights,” Kudlow told CBS on Sunday. However, the two sides avoided specifically addressing underlying American complaints or systemic trade imbalances that led to the Trump administration’s demand on China to increase purchases by $200bn annually – a specific commitment notably omitted from Saturday’s joint communique. After Mnuchin said on Sunday that the two sides were “putting the trade war on hold”, China issued a statement overnight saying it could not guarantee that renewed trade tensions with Washington could be avoided. “Given the increasing interaction between the two countries, we cannot assure you they will not encounter more frictions or disputes in the future,” advised Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, at a briefing. “If the two governments can reach an agreement which is acceptable to both sides, the two governments should certainly abide by it,” Lu added. Shi Yinhong, director of the Center for American Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Associated Press he doubted the truce would be enduring. “I don’t think the truce will last very long,” Shi said. “The antagonism in trade will ebb and flow in China-US relations in the long term.” Analysts at DailyFx, a forex advisory service, said the latest US-China trade skirmish “may ultimately prove to be another stepping stone on the path to deeper global trade integration”. But it cautioned that “a period of discomfort may be in the immediate future; even history shows that the path to trade liberalization hasn’t been a straight line”. In the joint statement, the delegations said they would keep talking over the summer. But Mnuchin insisted on Sunday that despite making “meaningful progress”, the US would be free to impose tariffs if Beijing did not live up to its commitments. “We have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/21/perfect-review-engrossing-family-drama-makes-siblings-of-us-all","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T16:43:28Z","webTitle":"Perfect review – engrossing family drama makes siblings of us all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/21/perfect-review-engrossing-family-drama-makes-siblings-of-us-all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/21/perfect-review-engrossing-family-drama-makes-siblings-of-us-all","fields":{"headline":"Perfect review – engrossing family drama makes siblings of us all","bodyText":"Tessa Bide Productions have devised a finely calibrated family show, based on the thoughtful children’s book Perfect, written by Nicola Davies and lit up by Cathy Fisher’s wistful illustrations. Gentle when it needs to be but committed to exploring complicated themes, Perfect is about a boy who struggles with his emotions when he discovers that his much longed-for sibling has been born with a disability. Director and dramaturg Adam Fuller has cleverly extended the early stages of the story to encourage the audience to share the boy’s impatient excitement about the birth. Eline Hallem plays the boy and is uncannily convincing as she races about with the gangly enthusiasm of a kid not yet used to his body. She interacts easily with the audience and asks them to share stories about their siblings. The children’s answers are incorporated into the script, their stories folded into the fabric of the show. Luned Gwawr Evans’s design feels warm and comforting: a cluster of pastel homes, dappled with sunlight, surrounds the stage. A large projection screen is filled with natural images inspired by Fisher’s illustrations: fluffy clouds, lush grass swaying in the wind, tiny swifts fleeing the nest. When the baby is brought home by the mother (Tessa Bide, loving but slightly adrift in her sorrow), the boy runs away. He comes across an injured swift, represented by an exquisitely crafted puppet, controlled by Bide with emotion etched across her face. Layers of empathy build. Perfect does not shy away from how a family’s excitement for the future is suddenly muddied by confusion and fear. The exceptionally engaged young audience is testament to an engrossing show that is full of compassion and makes siblings of us all. At the Wardrobe theatre, Bristol, 31 May-3 June. Box office: 0117-902 0344.

Alderweireld is out of contract in 2020 and discussions over fresh terms have reached a virtual impasse. The Belgian is conscious he can leave Tottenham next summer for €25m (£22m) due to a clause in his deal, though only if an option to extend until 2020 is activated. United are aware any move to sign Alderweireld will be made difficult by the tough negotiating skills of Daniel Levy, especially as the Tottenham chairman will not wish to sell a prime asset to a direct rival. Should Levy be prepared to sell he would no doubt demand a sizeable fee from United, perhaps even more than the world-record £75m that Liverpool paid Southampton for Virgil van Dijk in January. Whether Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, would countenance such a fee for a player edging towards his 30th birthday remains to be seen, with Alderweireld’s wage demands also to be considered. The player currently earns a basic £50,000 a-week at Spurs and would seek closer to treble that for what would be his last major contract. Alderweireld would fit into the profile of the experienced player Mourinho wishes to add as he seeks to challenge Manchester City next season, a requirement echoed by Nemanja Matic after Saturday’s FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea. While the interest in Alderweireld may put Chris Smalling’s future in the balance, the manager also wishes to add a fresh right-back, left-back, wide forward and at least one midfielder, Shakhtar Donetsk’s Fred is thought to be of interest to Mourinho in the latter position."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-league-tables-2019","type":"interactive","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"University league tables 2019","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-league-tables-2019","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-league-tables-2019","fields":{"headline":"University league tables 2019","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/may/23/just-a-baby-ultra-qualifying-for-the-ultra-trail-du-mont-blanc","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T09:22:00Z","webTitle":"Just a baby ultra?

Qualifying for the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc","bodyText":"When you tell other ultra runners that you are training for the Ultra-Trail du Mont- Blanc (UTMB), they give you a certain look. Oh, you are a serious ultra runner. You can almost feel your trail cred rising. Not because the UTMB is the toughest race, or the longest, or in the most extreme conditions – although it is fairly extreme, being a 105-mile race around Mont Blanc that traverses a route with a total ascent of 34,000ft (10,300m) and passes through three different countries. The main reason they give you that subtle nod of kudos is because just qualifying for the UTMB is an epic feat in itself. To even enter the ballot for a place, you have to accumulate points by running three qualifying races. While you do not need to win or do particularly well in any of these races – unless you’re shooting for an elite place at the UTMB – you do need to finish them all within the cut-offs. That might sound reasonable, but the three races I had to do last year to accumulate my points included a 135-mile run around the Welsh Isle of Anglesey, and a 100-mile slog up and down the slopes of the Pyrenees in the south of France. Both these races have drop-out rates of around 40%. The second one took me almost 40 hours, running non-stop through two nights, hallucinating cocktail parties on candlelit verandas along the way, and leaving my toes feeling numb for months after. And that is just to qualify for the ballot. But now I have a place. The UTMB is also the most competitive ultra trail in the world, with more of the top elite runners turning up each year, treating it as the grand final, the unofficial world championships of the sport. I have no illusions about being competitive anywhere near the front of this race, but after just over a year of ultra running, when something has gone wrong in every race I have run, I am working on being as good as I can be, for what will be the culmination of my two-year ultra running adventure. It began last February when I decided to shoot for the UTMB and ran the first qualifying race, and my first ever ultra, a 35-mile jaunt along the coastal path near my home in south Devon. Since then, I have got lost in races, worn the wrong shoes, forgotten to carry water, had extreme lows – clinging to the side of a mountain during a storm in the night –and extreme highs, when I felt like superman, flying up Holyhead mountain 130 miles into the Ring O Fire Anglesey race, unable to believe that these legs that had struggled even to walk a few hours earlier now felt brand new, straight out of the box and filled with rocket fuel. And so, with my entry to the UTMB confirmed, last weekend I took on one of two final warm-up races before the big one. It was a mere 45-mile race along the Jurassic coast in Dorset. “Just a baby ultra,” I kept telling people beforehand. My latest lesson in this sport is never to underestimate an ultra race. The numbers in ultra running are so big and insane that they start to become meaningless in the space between the races, when you’re talking and thinking about them rather than actually running them. After some of the races I had already done, 45 miles seemed like nothing. That was until about 20 miles in, when I started cramping while climbing up some steps after running along Lulworth Cove beach. It was a hot day and I hadn’t taken in enough salt. Luckily the cramps went away, but then came three brutal hills in quick succession, cliffs, pure vertical madness, interspersed, of course, by three terrifying descents. By then, I was on the point of dropping out. I had my reasons clearly laid out in my mind. This was only a training race, and so 25 miles was quite far enough for a training run. And it was dangerous to run with cramps – they had come back a few times on those three hills. What if I got stuck on my own somewhere remote and couldn’t even walk. It was irresponsible to carry on. But something, and it is still hard for me to fathom quite what it is, pushed me on. Every time I resolved to stop, it said no. Go on, go a bit further. After a while, the miles still left to go and the distances already run started to blur, and my mind stopped counting, focused completely on the simple act of moving, even if it was merely shuffling. The cliff paths and seaside towns were full of holidaymakers enjoying a balmy weekend. I ran through them with my rucksack and the number pinned on my shirt like an oddball. But word of who we were had got out, and people cheered me on, telling me I was amazing, telling me to keep going. I tried to wave or smile back. When did I become the maddest guy in town? There were moments of exquisite beauty, when you would come across an isolated cove that took your breath away. In these ultras, you are so raw, that everything is more extreme. A hug from a loved one at an aid station, or the sudden appearance of nature in full bloom, can bring you close to tears. But you must go on. Perpetual forward motion is the goal. Race positions stop mattering – it ceases to become a race. I had started out with a goal time and position, but six hours on, none of that mattered. All that mattered was to keep moving, one step after another. The race ended at Old Harry Rocks. It was a setting to lift the spirits, but just finishing was ecstasy. To sit on the warm grass, take off my shoes and stare out to sea after eight and a half hours of running. In that moment, it all made sense. And so I have one more warm-up race left to go. A 78-mile run through the Dolomites in Italy. It is a scary prospect, lots more big numbers, but for now I am going to bask a little longer in the glory of another ultra completed. Another step along this crazy path I set out on when I decided, last February, to enter the UTMB."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2018/may/21/culture-secretary-boosts-comcasts-hopes-in-battle-for-sky","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T12:52:45Z","webTitle":"Culture secretary raises Comcast's hopes in battle for Sky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/21/culture-secretary-boosts-comcasts-hopes-in-battle-for-sky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/21/culture-secretary-boosts-comcasts-hopes-in-battle-for-sky","fields":{"headline":"Culture secretary raises Comcast's hopes in battle for Sky","bodyText":"Comcast’s £22bn bid to trump Rupert Murdoch in the battle to take control of Sky has been given a boost after the culture secretary said he was unlikely to call for an investigation by the media regulator. Matt Hancock, who has 10 working days to make a final decision on referring the deal to Ofcom, said: “Having reviewed the relevant evidence available, I can confirm that I have today written to the parties to inform them that I am minded not to issue an [intervention notice] on the basis that the proposed merger does not raise concerns in relation to public interest considerations which would meet the threshold for intervention. “This is a quasi-judicial decision and I am required to make my decision independently, following a process that is scrupulously fair and impartial, and as quickly as possible.” The move is a filip for Comcast, the US pay-TV company that owns assets including NBC Universal. It had said it expected to be free of the regulatory scrutiny that has mired rival Murdoch’s bid for Sky for almost 18 months. If asked, Ofcom could carry out a public interest test on the deal and report back within 40 days. If Hancock decides there are no concerns, he must clear the bid. Critics of Comcast have argued that a number of corporate transgressions over the years means the company should be subject to the same scrutiny as Murdoch’s Fox. In recent years, Comcast has been fined more than $2m (£1.5m) by US regulators and was forced to relocate a rival news service nearer to its news channels on its TV guide. In November, NBC News host Matt Lauer, one of the best-paid TV presenters in the US, was fired after a colleague complained about inappropriate sexual behaviour. In 2016, Comcast paid a $2.3m fine to resolve a federal investigation into allegations that it added charges to customers’ bills for unordered services, including premium channels, set-top boxes and digital video recorders. Comcast, which has 1,300 employees in the UK in subsidiaries including the production company behind Downton Abbey, has made a number of pledges such as keeping Sky’s HQ in Osterley, south-west London, and guaranteeing the editorial independence and funding of Sky News for at least 10 years. The company also said it would not try to acquire a majority interest in any UK newspaper for at least five years – a shot at Murdoch, owner of the Sun and the Times, whose takeover bid is being scrutinised amid concerns that taking over Sky News would give him too much control of UK news media. The Competition and Markets Authority is to deliver its verdict on whether to clear Murdoch’s takeover bid to Hancock by the end of the month. The culture secretary has until 13 June to then make his final decision. If he gives Murdoch the green light, the media mogul will have to significantly increase his bid for the 61% of Sky he does not own, which values the business at about £19bn, well short of Comcast’s £22bn offer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/21/ftse-100-hits-record-high-as-markets-digest-us-china-tariff-truce","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T16:34:01Z","webTitle":"FTSE 100 hits record high as markets digest US-China tariff truce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/21/ftse-100-hits-record-high-as-markets-digest-us-china-tariff-truce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/21/ftse-100-hits-record-high-as-markets-digest-us-china-tariff-truce","fields":{"headline":"FTSE 100 hits record high as markets digest US-China tariff truce","bodyText":"The FTSE 100 soared to a new record on Monday after news of a truce in the contentious trade dispute between the US and China cheered investors and helped send the pound lower against the dollar. News that the world’s two largest economies had backed away from a potentially disastrous trade war and agreed to abandon plans to raise tariffs on each other’s exports lifted the UK’s leading index to a peak of 7868.12, the first time it has climbed above 7800. This beats the previous high of 7792.56 set in the middle of January and is more than 14% above this year’s low of 6866 recorded towards the end of March when the UK expelled Russian diplomats after the Salisbury nerve agent attack. The index lost some of its gains as the day progressed but still ended at a new record close of 7859.17, up 80.38 points or 1.03% on the day. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: “Investors seemingly haven’t been put off by the general lack of specifics surrounding what was actually agreed between the US and China, crucial details like the extent to which America’s deficit with its rival will be reduced and how this new trading ‘framework’ will be implemented.” The UK market has been steadily rising over the past few days, with investors shrugging off concerns about the customs union and the Irish border. The previous record close came as recently as last Thursday, with the market helped by a weak pound and rising oil prices. The trade truce gave another boost to the dollar, removing for the moment at least the fears of the damage the dispute could do to the US and global economy. The pound fell 0.4% against the dollar to $1.3414, giving a lift to the large number of overseas earners in the FTSE 100 who benefit from a weaker sterling. Brent crude rose 0.42% to $78.84 a barrel after climbing above $80 last week, pushing the share prices of oil and commodity companies higher. Dave Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets said: “Supply concerns in light of President Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the Iranian nuclear deal still persist. The relatively high price has encouraged others to keep production levels high.” Mergers and acquisitions have also played a part in boosting company valuations, with GKN and Ladbroke Coral already falling to predators this year and Sky, Sainsbury’s, SSE, packaging group Smurfit Kappa and Shire all involved in takeover situations. Russ Mould, investment director at asset management group AJ Bell also pointed out that investors buying shares in FTSE 100 companies could receive better than average returns. He said: “The FTSE 100 offers a dividend yield above 4%, according to an aggregate of consensus dividend forecasts for each individual constituent. This beats cash and the 1.49% yield offered by the benchmark 10-year government bond or gilt hands down. Such a yield could be a source of support for the index and chip in a healthy percentage of total returns from UK stocks in 2018.” Most European markets were also lifted by the trade talks truce. Germany’s Dax was closed for the Whitsuntide Monday holiday but France’s Cac finished 0.4% higher at 5637 and Europe’s Stoxx 600 added 0.35%. However Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.5% on continuing concerns about the policies of its new coalition government and possible tensions with the rest of the European Union. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.21% higher at 25,013. It was the first time the index had closed above 25,000 since March. But gold slipped back $2 to $1288 an ounce due to the rise in the dollar, and as investors shunned safe havens in favour of riskier assets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/21/barclays-bank-charges-qatar-loan-thrown-out-2008-financial-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T12:20:27Z","webTitle":"Barclays bank fraud charges over $3bn Qatar loan thrown out by court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/21/barclays-bank-charges-qatar-loan-thrown-out-2008-financial-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/21/barclays-bank-charges-qatar-loan-thrown-out-2008-financial-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Barclays bank fraud charges over $3bn Qatar loan thrown out by court","bodyText":"Charges brought against Barclays bank over a $3bn loan made to Qatari investors have been thrown out by a court, in a major setback for the Serious Fraud Office. The charges related to the £11.8bn emergency fundraising conducted by the bank in 2008 as it struggled to maintain its independence and avoid a government takeover. However, charges against the bank’s former chief executive and other top managers remain in place. The Qatari investment that helped prop up the bank has been mired in controversy, and after a five-year investigation the SFO last summer brought charges of conspiracy to commit fraud against Barclays and former senior executives. But in a statement issued to the stock market on Monday the bank said: “Barclays announces that the crown court has today dismissed all charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office against Barclays plc and Barclays Bank plc regarding matters which arose in the context of Barclays’ capital raisings in 2008.” However, the charges dismissed by the court only involve Barclays as a corporate entity. The charges made by the SFO against the individuals – the former chief executive John Varley and other top executives Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris and Richard Boath – still stand and proceedings remain live in their cases. Barclays also admitted its court battle with the SFO is unlikely to be over, noting that “the SFO is likely to seek to reinstate these charges by applying to a high court judge to recommence proceedings via a new indictment of the same charges”. The bank added in the statement that the crown court dismissal of the case “should not be taken to indicate any finding on the issue of whether a criminal offence has or may have been committed by other persons”. The SFO said it was digesting the result of the court hearing and would respond soon. It said in a statement: “We are considering our position in respect of today’s ruling concerning the companies.” Barclays declined to comment beyond its statement to the stock market, but the case dismissal will be a major relief to a bank that has been plagued by legal and regulatory problems. The charges dismissed on Monday include two charges of “conspiring with certain former senior officers and employees of Barclays to commit fraud by false representations”. The other charges dismissed were against Barclays plc and Barclays Bank plc for “unlawful financial assistance contrary to section 151(1) of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to a $3bn loan provided to the State of Qatar in November 2008”. The distinction between Barclays plc and Barclays Bank plc, the lender’s operating company, was important, as the bank’s licences and regulatory approvals are held at the operating level. The charges against Barclays were the first criminal charges to be brought in the UK against a bank for activities during the financial crisis. Andrew Katzen, a partner at lawyers Hickman &amp; Rose said: “The SFO’s most high-profile corruption prosecution has fallen at the first hurdle, but Barclays isn’t off the hook yet. The SFO is almost certain to seek to continue the prosecution by applying to the high court to issue what is called a voluntary bill of indictment. “Nevertheless, the ruling makes for an inauspicious start for the prosecutor as it awaits its new director.” David Green stepped down as director of the SFO last month and the organisation’s chief operating officer, Mark Thompson, has been appointed interim head. Earlier this month in an unconnected case, the Barclays chief executive, Jes Staley, was ordered to hand over more than £1.1m out of his own pocket as punishment for attempting to unmask a whistleblower. Staley was fined a total of £642,430 by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, and Barclays has clawed back £500,000 of his bonus over the matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/24/the-house-of-impossible-beauties-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T10:59:50Z","webTitle":"The House of Impossible Beauties by Joseph Cassara review – disco, drag and tragedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/the-house-of-impossible-beauties-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/24/the-house-of-impossible-beauties-review","fields":{"headline":"The House of Impossible Beauties by Joseph Cassara review – disco, drag and tragedy","bodyText":"This debut novel follows the lives of the major players in New York’s 1980s drag ball scene, made famous by Jennie Livingston’s 1990 film Paris Is Burning. With an admirable ear for the slang of the LGBT underground it depicts, the book imagines how they came to terms with their genders and sexualities, found their communities, negotiated the pressures of racism and queer-bashing and confronted the terrifying emergence of HIV/Aids – or, as it is referred to here, “the virus”. This is a novel about family. It captures the ways in which the protagonists have been damaged by their own families and the pressures to conform to conventional ideals of masculinity, and shows how the all-Latino House of Xtravaganza, a group founded by Hector Valle in 1982 to compete in the balls, took them in and looked after them. The House of Impossible Beauties is especially strong at detailing the sadness of queer life. Whether black or Hispanic, these are people who live on the periphery of society, shoplifting or doing sex work to survive. And there’s another deeper tragedy: having endured so much trauma in the “straight” world, this pain can only reverberate around their tight-knit communities. As a result, the characters hurt each other, and themselves, in ways that are scarcely imaginable. Cassara realises that, often, he barely needs to add to the real-life tragedies of the House of Xtravaganza, familiar to anyone who has seen the film. This is not a bleak novel, however – far from it. The scenes of love and support between the characters have a kindness that more than matches the sadness, and the dialogue, peppered with early 80s disco or TV references and “Spanglais” dialect, is frequently hilarious. (I particularly liked the recurring disdain for the musical Cats.) Many of these lives were all too short, and deserved far more than Paris Is Burning’s 78 minutes. The House of Impossible Beauties does not provide full biographies of its leading figures such as Angie Xtravaganza, Venus Xtravaganza or Dorian Corey, perhaps using fiction where their friends and acquaintances were unable, or unwilling, to fill in the gaps, but it does offer a convincing insight into the world in which they lived.

Your royal wedding debrief","bodyText":"It’s almost a British tradition: waking up on the Monday after a frantic wedding weekend, once the fog of Sunday’s hangover has cleared, you can finally face looking back through social media feeds to see if your hazy recollections can really be true. And after a royal wedding, a whole nation can join in the fun of recalling the odder moments during the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. 1. The commoners DID get catering after all Much fanfare was made of the 1,200 “commoners” invited to the wedding, albeit only at arm’s length and having to provide their own picnic food. They did get a goody bag though, which included a souvenir programme, a fridge magnet, a bottle of water, a chocolate coin, and a 20% discount voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop. 2. Serena Williams and her sensible footwear The tennis legend “shocked” fashion correspondents around the globe by revealing that she had sneakily hidden sneakers under her dress for the evening do. Though described as a “bombshell” revelation by some sections of the British press, any women who have spent a wedding day awkwardly clattering around in an unfamiliar pair of heels will have cheered. 3. Meghan cousin’s less sensible club night Meghan Markle’s cousin Tyler Dooley had an eventful weekend, which culminated with reports that he was barred from entering a club in London for carrying a knife. He reportedly told a bystander it was for protection: “I just brought it because Donald Trump said London was like a war zone.” Dooley, from Oregon, had already hit headlines before the wedding for announcing he would be marketing a new brand of cannabis in the US, called Markle’s Sparkle. 4. Who wore it best? One fashion no-no was turning up in a dress that had featured in the schmaltzy Lifetime movie Harry and Meghan: A Royal Romance, which had been rushed to our screens in advance of the big day. One guest appeared to be wearing the same outfit as that worn by actor Parisa Fitz‑Henley in the TV drama during a scene in which Meghan met the Queen. 5. You suddenly remembered neither Harry or Meghan are their names Weddings are one of the few occasions when your full name gets to be read out loud, revealing to all your friends that you don’t go by the name on your birth certificate. The royal wedding was a double whammy, as Henry and Rachel stood at the altar, and a nation explained to their young children, that yes, this is the right wedding we are watching. 6. The unsolved mystery of the bad breath The Suits actor Rick Hoffman managed to have his own little social media viral moment in the sun, after he was seen on television pulling a variety of memorable faces during the ceremony. He posted an Instagram video with the hashtag #brushyourteeth to explain that bad breath was the reason. “So to answer any questions about the weird face that was made at the wedding, imagine sitting next to people to your right … that [have] halitosis”. 7. The mini Elton John concert As a surprise during the reception, Prince Harry is said to have asked “Does anyone here know how to play the piano?” and Elton John duly stepped forward. One dedicated fan has added the four-track setlist – Your Song, Circle of Life, I’m Still Standing and Tiny Dancer – to the website setlist.fm. As yet, none of the guests have clicked the “I was there” button. 8. The royal dance-off Royal weddings are a mix of the hugely public and the very private. However, in this social media era lots of details leaked, including a picture of the exclusive wedding after-party invite. Harry’s polo-playing friend Nacho Figueras shared, and then deleted, the picture on Instagram. It is rumoured that the Frogmore House party featured a James Corden-compered dance-off between princes Harry, William and their father, a mental image almost too frightening to contemplate. 9. No more memorabilia And as the royal wedding recedes into memory, at least we’ll never have to look at this again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/21/madama-butterfly-der-rosenkavalier-review-glyndebourne-festival-openers-perplex-provoke-and-charm","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T11:36:27Z","webTitle":"Madama Butterfly/Der Rosenkavalier review – Glyndebourne openers perplex, provoke and charm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/21/madama-butterfly-der-rosenkavalier-review-glyndebourne-festival-openers-perplex-provoke-and-charm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/21/madama-butterfly-der-rosenkavalier-review-glyndebourne-festival-openers-perplex-provoke-and-charm","fields":{"headline":"Madama Butterfly/Der Rosenkavalier review – Glyndebourne openers perplex, provoke and charm","bodyText":"Glyndebourne’s new season opens with a pair of revivals. Annilese Miskimmon’s staging of Puccini’s Madama Butterfly, first seen during the 2016 tour, is new to the main festival. Richard Jones’s production of Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier premiered in 2014. Both divided opinion when new, and both are essentially anti-Romantic in stance, stripping away the veneer of sentimentality that each work has accumulated over time. Miskimmon’s Butterfly is more a reworking than a straight revival, though the basic concept remains the same. She updates the opera to the closing years of the American occupation of Japan, and places the narrative in the wider context of an exploitative system that offers local girls the possibility of escaping poverty by becoming GI brides and allows US servicemen to take advantage of conveniently dissolvable marriages. Two years ago, Miskimmon’s anger rode roughshod over the opera’s humanity, resulting in a hardness of edge that sat uneasily with the score’s emotive force. This time round, greater subtlety of detail combined with striking performances allows the drama fully to hit home. Butterfly is played by the Moldovan soprano Olga Busuioc, whose exceptional way with dynamics and tone colour allows her to encompass both the naivety of the opening scenes and the tragic emotions of the later acts. We can completely understand her attraction to Joshua Guerrero’s handsome if weak-willed Pinkerton, and there’s a real sense of rapture in their love duet. But we also notice the telling streak of pride that lurks beneath her vulnerability in the way she loftily dismisses Simon Mechliński’s Yamadori and rounds on Elizabeth DeShong’s fiercely devoted Suzuki. Omer Meir Wellber’s conducting, meanwhile, has a tremendous, slow-burning intensity that draws us relentlessly into the opera’s unsettling world. Musically, Der Rosenkavalier is equally strong for the most part, although conductor Robin Ticciati got off to an awkward start on opening night with an uncharacteristically lacklustre account of the prelude. Rachel Willis-Sørensen is the outstanding Marschallin, sumptuous of tone, witty yet sad. Kate Lindsey makes a comparably fine Octavian, and is gauche, funny, extremely touching in moments of bewilderment. Elizabeth Sutphen’s Sophie sounds exquisite, while Brindley Sherratt’s Ochs combines louche charm with genuine menace. Jones’s staging, however, is by turns admirable and perplexing. As one might expect, he is strong on the class divisions that underpin the opera, sharply differentiating between a declining aristocracy, an emerging bourgeoisie and an urban proletariat on the make. His treatment of the protagonists has great clarity. Ochs’s humiliation of Sophie in act two has rarely felt more uncomfortable, and time really seems to stand still in the Presentation of the Rose and the final Trio. Against that, however, must be set a quirkiness that sometimes gets in the way. The designs, surreally jumbling periods from the 18th century to the 1970s, sit uneasily with an opera that is essentially a realistic comedy of manners. The Marschallin muses on her past as a psychoanalytic patient on Freud’s couch, which strikes an awkward note. And there are moments when parades of servants and flunkies, endlessly shifting furniture, prove intrusive. It doesn’t quite add up to a theatrically satisfying whole, though it is unquestionably beautiful to listen to. • At Glyndebourne until 26 June (Der Rosenkavalier) and 18 July (Madama Butterfly).

Speculation leading up to the big day focused on whether the couple would invite Donald Trump, or his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Around the twin radio masts – a 20th-century riposte to Start Point’s whitewashed gothic lighthouse – a small flock of swallows cut and swerve. Beneath the sea there are signs of spring too. Common spider crabs (Maja brachydactyla), which have been overwintering in the depths, start to appear close to shore, a sight that has become a feature of my first sea swims of the year. Today conditions are perfect: on this cloudless May morning the sea is still and translucent. But even with mask and snorkel on, it takes me over an hour to spot one. I’m ready to call it a day, content with views of tropically brilliant ballan wrasse and the sheer joy of being in such clear water, when I’m stopped by a movement beneath me. Even then I almost miss it, so effective is the crustacean’s disguise. But there, coated with algae and bearded with strands of seaweed, is my first spider crab of the season, looking like an aquatic Green Man. Or, given the season, perhaps a May King. The seaweed tassels are not there by accident. Paul Naylor, a Devon-based diver and underwater photographer, has filmed the crustaceans rubbing pieces of seaweed against the backs of their shells until they stick. They show “remarkable dexterity”, he tells me, adding that slender hooks on the shell act like Velcro to hold the seaweed in place. Naylor’s footage is of a large group of crabs in late summer. The purpose of such “aggregations” is not fully understood, though they may provide protection in numbers during the delicate moulting stage, or form part of the mating cycle. The solitary crab I’m watching scuttles down a slab of rock and, with the delicacy of a diner using chopsticks, teases off clawfuls of weed and levers them carefully up to its jaws. After an hour in 12C water my own extremities are numb and tumid, so I leave the crab to its grazing and kick back to shore for lunch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/19/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-contagion-effect","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T17:58:09Z","webTitle":"Texas high school shooting prompts talk of 'contagion effect'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/19/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-contagion-effect","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/19/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-contagion-effect","fields":{"headline":"Texas high school shooting prompts talk of 'contagion effect'","bodyText":"On Friday, 10 people were killed in a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas. Just two days earlier, a former student opened fire at a high school in Dixon, Illinois. The officer who quickly stopped the shooter was hailed as a hero. Researchers who have studied American mass shootings have found evidence of a “contagion effect”. In the two weeks after a mass shooting or school shooting, one 2015 study found, there is an elevated likelihood that another mass shooting or school shooting will take place. About 20% to 30% of the incidents studied “appeared to be inspired by contagion”, said the lead author of the paper, Sherry Towers, a professor at Arizona State University who specializes in mathematical and computational modeling. Some of the most horrific shootings appear to inspire new shootings not only for weeks but for decades. A common thread in the histories of many mass shooters is an obsession with previous shootings, particularly the 1999 shooting and bomb attack at Columbine high school in Colorado. “Some of these incidents have a longer contagion than others do,” Towers said. Elementary and high school students have grown up practicing “active shooter drills” along with fire drills, preparing for how they should respond if a gunman attacks. “It’s been happening everywhere; I’ve always kind of felt like eventually it was going to happen here too,” the Santa Fe student Paige Curry told the media after the shooting on Friday. Her response went viral. Towers, however, was cautious about the idea that school shootings were becoming common. “The idea that we’re spiraling out of control in school shootings is perhaps not supported by the data,” she said. “That being said, the US per capita has a far higher rate of school shootings compared to any other developed country.” In the first six months of 2018, there have been two mass shootings – shootings with four or more people killed – at American high schools, Towers said. There were only two mass shootings at K-12 schools in the decade prior. “Yes, that is an unusually high number to have in a relatively short period of time,” she said. “Whether or not this is the beginning of a trend in increasing rates remains to be seen.” The “contagion effect” in school shootings does not mean that the risk of becoming a school shooter is contagious in the same way measles or ebola are, said Peter Sheridan Dodds, a professor of mathematics and statistics at the University of Vermont and one of the authors of a 2017 study that found an association between the level of social media chatter about school shootings and the probability of new attacks. “It’s not that it’s an infectious disease. It’s something that if someone is in a particular mindset, they can emulate,” he said. Dodds thinks of school shootings as a pathway previous attackers developed – a pathway that very few people will ever be tempted to take but which has become extremely well documented in the media and in American culture. Though most people will never be interested in following that path, “it’s not hard to figure out how to emulate it,” he said. Some law enforcement officials and parents of Americans killed in mass shootings have urged news organizations to change the way they respond, to give the perpetrators less notoriety, and to avoid coverage that glamorizes perpetrators who seem to be seeking fame. But Towers said that while it was important to acknowledge the contagion effect in mass shootings, to focus only on media coverage and the way some shootings appear inspired by previous attacks was to miss other crucial risk factors. “One of the things that commonly gets pushed is that it’s all about the contagion,” she said. “What’s missed often is the other conclusion of that paper, which found that the availability of firearms is clearly playing a role, a significant role. “States that had a lower prevalence of gun ownership had a lower per capita rate of mass shootings, so it’s not just a contagion effect. “Just focusing on the media component of contagion is missing the entire story. And focusing on one aspect of it is not going to yield a solution.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/19/santa-fe-school-shooting-survivors-suspect-dimitrious-pagourtzis","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T21:52:27Z","webTitle":"Santa Fe shooting: Texas town reels as names of 10 victims released","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/19/santa-fe-school-shooting-survivors-suspect-dimitrious-pagourtzis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/19/santa-fe-school-shooting-survivors-suspect-dimitrious-pagourtzis","fields":{"headline":"Santa Fe shooting: Texas town reels as names of 10 victims released","bodyText":"Officials have released the names of the victims of the Santa Fe high school shooting, confirming that eight students and two teachers died when a student hid a shotgun and a revolver under a trench coat and then opened fire on an art class. The Galveston County medical examiner and sheriff said in a statement those killed were: Glenda Perkins, Cynthia Tisdale, Kimberly Vaughan, Shana Fisher, Angelique Ramirez, Christian Riley Garcia, Jared Black, Sabika Sheikh, Christopher Jake Stone and Aaron Kyle McLeod. Perkins and Tisdale were teachers. The others were students. The massacre, in a town of 13,000 about 35 miles south-east of Houston, was the deadliest US school shooting since 17 students and educators died in Parkland, Florida, three months ago. At least 10 people were injured. A hospital said on Saturday one was in good condition, one was serious and one was critical. Pupils who had been anticipating graduation and a long summer break were left to prepare to bury their friends. The NFL star JJ Watt, of the Houston Texans, reportedly offered to pay for the funerals. Hundreds of people attended a prayer vigil on Friday, a couple of miles from the school. Handcuffed and with his head bowed, Dimitrios Pagourtzis was charged with capital murder. Mumbling “yes sir” and “no sir”, he requested a court-appointed attorney. He was not required to enter a plea. He faces life imprisonment. The US supreme court ruled in 2005 that it is unconstitutional to execute people for crimes committed under the age of 18. On Saturday, Pagourtzis’s family said in a statement they were “as shocked and confused as anyone else”, adding: “What we have learned from media reports seems incompatible with the boy we love.” The family shared “the public’s hunger for answers”, they said. Ashton Wardrup, 16, said students had been confused when the fire alarm went off during first period on Friday, wondering if it was a drill. Then they heard gunshots and teachers urgently told them to evacuate. “We heard a loud pop,” Wardrup told the Guardian. “I thought it was an explosion, and everybody just took off. We got around the corner and then they told us to stand right there so they could get a head count, then they sent us to the Shell station [next to the campus] and that’s when the panicking started, parents started coming in, saw cops – every five seconds there was a group of cops coming in.” The school, which has about 1,400 students, entered lockdown in February over fears of gunfire. On Friday, there was confusion over whether to evacuate or shelter in place. “February I had a plan if somebody was coming because we were in a classroom; we knew there could have been an active shooter so we could make a plan of if they do come into the room, what to do. Today, there was no plan at all,” Wardrup said. “Today my only thought was run. I thought about turning around and going to help. At times I do feel bad for that, for not turning round and going to help but I don’t know how much I could have done.” Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, told reporters Pagourtzis had no criminal history and there had been no clear red flags. He said the suspect planned to kill himself but “didn’t have the courage” and that the weapons appeared to be legally owned by his father. On Saturday a Galveston County judge, Mark Henry, said explosive devices found by authorities were carbon dioxide canisters taped together and a pressure cooker with an alarm clock and nails inside. None could have exploded, he said. Henry also said police exchanged “a lot of firepower” with Pagourtzis. Students were allowed to collect belongings and vehicles, escorted by police. In a press conference, Randy Weber, US congressman for the district, noted that the area was still recovering from Hurricane Harvey. “Santa Fe is what I call a salt of the earth community,” he said. “We will once again laugh. It’ll be a while but we’ll get through this.” Pagourtzis posted a photograph of a T-shirt with the slogan “Born to Kill” on Facebook last month and had a trench coat decorated with pins, including a German military symbol sometimes associated with Nazis. According to an affidavit, he told police “he did not shoot students he did like so he could have his story told”. He played on the defensive line for the junior varsity football team, where Wardrup was a team-mate. “I would never have expected it to be him,” he said. “When I heard that the name was Dimitrios I was trying to find a different one because he was one of our football players. He was always after school working hard, he was always there, you’d always see him.” Wardrup said Pagourtzis was quiet with an even temperament and did not stand out, despite his habit of wearing the trenchcoat whatever the weather. “He’s been wearing it for years,” he said. “Never suspected anything of it. It was just something he wore, just his style of fashion.” Another football player, Kaleb Wisko, 17, said: “He never came across as disturbed or anything like that. He always seemed normal, friendly for the most part … he just practiced with us just like any other team-mate. “We talked about [the coat], that it’s kind of different. We figured that it meant something to him and he never came off as weird or anything like that. This year it seemed like almost every day he wore the coat to school. So it was a normal thing. So to see him in this coat, you wouldn’t think twice that maybe there was a weapon underneath.” In their statement, the Pagourtzis family said they were “gratified by the public comments made by other Santa Fe High School students that show Dimitri as we know him: a smart, quiet, sweet boy”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/20/ireland-referendum-abortion-divided-between-rival-camps-tech-firms-regulate-ads","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T08:59:52Z","webTitle":"As polls narrow before the abortion vote, is rural Ireland setting up a Brexit moment?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/20/ireland-referendum-abortion-divided-between-rival-camps-tech-firms-regulate-ads","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/20/ireland-referendum-abortion-divided-between-rival-camps-tech-firms-regulate-ads","fields":{"headline":"As polls narrow before the abortion vote, is rural Ireland setting up a Brexit moment?","bodyText":"The polls have narrowed so much that a result once nearly taken for granted now hangs in the balance; the media are under fierce attack for bias; and questions are swirling about foreign influence and online ads. As Ireland heads into the last week of campaigning for its historic referendum on abortion, the long shadow of two recent surprise election results – the Brexit referendum across the Irish sea, and Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 US presidential poll – is hanging over Irish voters. They will decide on Friday whether to repeal an amendment dating back to the 1980s that enshrined in the constitution a near-total ban on abortion. The controls are the strictest in any western democracy, meaning that the battle has been closely watched by anti-abortion activists across the world. The campaign began with a clear lead for the Yes campaigners, who support a repeal. But in a country where tradition and the church still have strong influence, the No camp has gained ground. Now the final result is expected to hinge on the one in five voters still undecided. “Obviously, we look at Brexit and Trump and think the media don’t always get it right any more. Or they are projecting one way to advance their own goal,” said Emer Tóibín, of the Meath for Life campaign, which opposes a repeal. She believes the narrowing in polls is due in part to campaigners sidestepping newspapers and television to reach voters more directly. “So much of the country had been fed one side of the story,” she says in a cafe near her home in the county town Navan. “Freedom of speech is not alive and kicking.” She is stepping up the campaign in the run-up to the poll, determined to reach undecided voters and those “reluctant to discuss their views” – the elusive “silent majority” credited in both British and American upsets. Tóibín’s sense of urgency may be the one thing she shares with Sheila Donohue, a Catholic grandmother from a conservative background who admits she doesn’t know where she would have stood had the referendum been held a decade ago. Now, though, she is preparing to go out on the doorsteps appealing to voters for a repeal, inspired by a tragedy that thrust her family reluctantly into the heart of the debate. “I will now go out canvassing,” Donohue said. “I was so irate about things being said by people from a position of ignorance. They are punishing suffering.” In 2010, her daughter Siobhán found out at a routine scan for her third pregnancy that her son would not survive outside the womb, because his brain had not developed. Devastated by the prospect of carrying her baby to term only so that she could bury him, she travelled to Liverpool for a termination. After her return, she began fighting for other women in her position to receive treatment at home through the group Terminations for Medical Reasons. Donohue has always supported her daughter without reservation, but behind the scenes. She even moved churches, choosing a congregation where no one knew her or her husband, to avoid discussing a difficult and highly emotional issue with fellow worshippers. But for the first time this week she will personally appeal to her fellow citizens to support a repeal. The trigger was the narrowing polls and a controversial debate on the national broadcaster, RTE, which was the subject of multiple complaints. “You do have to keep at the back of your mind that it might not get through,” she said. “People are entitled to their opinion, but I will be telling Siobhán’s story.” The already intense campaign was given an unexpected twist, and greater international attention, earlier this month when the US tech giants Google and Facebook said they would be changing the rules on political advertising in Ireland over concerns about foreign interference. Google banned all adverts linked to the referendum, particularly frustrating No campaigners who say they were relying on social media to bypass conventional outlets they accuse of bias. Facebook has barred foreign groups from paying for ads. It has also rolled out a new transparency tool so that anyone in Ireland can track advertisements online, although it requires laborious page-by-page checks in real time. These changes, along with an effective transparency campaign and greater international scrutiny of the nature and impact of online campaigns, make some in Ireland feel like both guinea pigs and pioneers, stumbling towards better ways to regulate democracy in the internet age. “It feels like we are in the middle of this live test case,” said James Lawless, technology spokesman for the opposition Fianna Fáil party, who is pushing for legislation to regulate online advertising. It is one of the first votes held in a major western democracy since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and since US authorities began public attempts to untangle the extent of foreign interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. And it is the first time that activists have tried to track political messages reaching voters through their screens in something of a David and Goliath fight. The volunteer campaign group the Transparent Referendum Institute is logging individually captured ads that tech giants keep on private, easily searchable databases. So far, they have found more than 900 online advertisements, many not from groups registered with Irish election authorities. Eamon Ryan, leader of Ireland’s Green party and an advocate for greater transparency, welcomes attempts to tackle problems but suspects the tech giants are driven more by concerns for their own reputation than for Ireland’s democracy. With inquiries under way on their role in Trump’s win and Brexit, they do not want to face accusations that their platforms helped to skew the outcome in Ireland’s emotive abortion referendum. “I think the decisions of Google and Facebook were largely driven by American political concerns,” he told the Observer. “Their fear was that a certain [result in the] Irish vote would trickle back to American politics.” He also wants them to provide more details about online campaigns, including how much has been spent, and details of why they took such dramatic steps to limit advertising in Ireland, a decision that must have cost them money. “We would like to know what the volume of spending was, how much of that was coming from overseas, what prompted their decision. Was it a sudden increase in overseas spending? Or was it just the political context in the US?” It is vital to get this information before voters go to the polls, he says, so Ireland knows it has had a fair vote on a deeply emotional issue. Both sides believe the intensity of the campaign is likely to seal the issue in legal terms for at least a generation. But for Sheila Donohue, the fight will not be over until she knows no other woman will face her daughter’s painful trip across to Britain. “They keep suffering over and over as they tell their stories. They can’t get over it until this repeal is done.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/19/new-york-royal-wedding-watch-party-harry-meghan-monarchy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T17:19:28Z","webTitle":"'We feel like part of it': watching the royal wedding at a New York bar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/new-york-royal-wedding-watch-party-harry-meghan-monarchy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/new-york-royal-wedding-watch-party-harry-meghan-monarchy","fields":{"headline":"'We feel like part of it': watching the royal wedding at a New York bar","bodyText":"In the city that never sleeps, a 7am start time for the royal wedding was not going to stop more than a hundred people in fancy hats and plastic tiaras from crowding into a bar to watch an American join the royal family. The party at the Churchill Tavern on East 28th Street in Manhattan was one of hundreds of royal wedding parties taking place across the US, where fervor for the British royals persists. “It feels like a fairy tale that we don’t have here and now we’re feeling like we’re part of it because she’s an American,” said Geri Merchant, sipping a mimosa, on vacation from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Merchant admitted she had reached that conclusion after talking to her daughter about why exactly they wanted to go to a bar so early in the morning to watch a televised wedding. When the standing-room-only crowd first saw Markle in her Givenchy wedding gown, squeals pierced the room. As the ceremony continued, a rhythm developed: reverential silence, followed by much less reverential commentary – “Is that person asleep?” – then coos over Princess Charlotte, Prince Harry’s face and the celebrity guests. Desmond Barnes and his friend Octavia Alford, who wore a sequined, spaghetti-strapped Union Jack dress, said they were pleasantly surprised by the American tone injected into the wedding – particularly Bishop Michael Curry’s emotional, energetic sermon that included a reference to slavery. The friends, who are both black, said they had been fans of the royals ever since Diana, Princess of Wales, joined the family. They were lured in by the extravagance of palace ceremonies, they said, but continued to follow the family because they seemed down to earth and were philanthropists. Barnes said that though Markle was biracial, he “didn’t think there would be as many [black faces] as there were”. Americans’ infatuation with the royals existed long before Markle entered the picture, but her background meant this particular wedding held a special place for some black Americans. When the engagement was announced, it fired up “black Twitter”, where people celebrated having a “black American princess” and the fact that Prince Harry’s new mother-in-law, Doria Ragland, had dreadlocks. Such celebrations were met by pointed criticisms. Commentators emphasized that the marriage would hardly revolutionize race relations in either country. That didn’t diminish the event for people such as Tyler Young, who edits a tech newsletter covering innovators of color. “I cannot wait to tell my children one day about this heartwarming multicultural wedding,” she said. “The Duchess of Sussex is forever a ray of light for little black and brown girls.” How Markle uses that role now she is officially part of the royal family is not yet clear, but it is obvious large swaths of Americans will be watching her every move. Americans have long been fascinated by the British monarchy. In 1860, when Queen Victoria’s eldest son, the future King Edward VII, visited North America for four months, tens of thousands crowded cities to see him; stories about his visit dominated magazines and newspapers. For a country on the brink of civil war, the spectacle provided some much-needed relief. Elisa Tamarkin, author of Anglophilia: Deference, Devotion, and Antebellum America, said Americans can in some ways afford to be more excited about the monarchy than the British. “There is a way in which the royal family can remain this vital object of attention, because in many ways it’s of no importance to a nation that can relinquish it,” Tamarkin said. It helps that Americans’ taxes have not provided financial support to the monarchy for centuries. If anything, this wedding has been a small boon to the US economy – specifically, to the media industry. Analysts projected $100m in revenue. Advertising slots, which at some points seemed to only feature ads for wedding rings, commanded rates comparable to major sporting events. NBC’s Today Show built a barn-sized structure on top of a Windsor hotel. Other publications took a more relaxed tone: New York magazine published a pithily titled Royal Wedding Guide for the Apathetic But Curious. Ahead of the ceremony, broadcasters provided Americans with a very tidy picture of the UK, soundtracked to the tune of trumpets. American journalists, with assistance from enterprising British presenters, did segments explaining pieces of British culture such as Eton, without even hinting at all those unpleasant class dynamics. The merest suggestion of republicanism was deeply buried under jars of marmite, Union Jack bunting and royal bobbleheads. At the Churchill, a guest named Herbert Westphalen III acknowledged that people were critical of the monarchy in the UK because of its cost, but said he felt the feeling of pride the family generated was worth any price. “I think that [pride] is so important,” said Westphalen, an American who lives in New York City. “Sadly, in our country, we’re so far from that right now.” Westphalen, who wore an imitation Prince of Wales pin because his actual one was being repaired, said he had been a fan of the royal family since he was a child, because his Prussian ancestors had ties to the British monarchy. “There is an admiration for the British monarchy by Americans,” he said, “because we have nothing to compare it to.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/19/meghan-markles-glossy-friends-raise-the-wedding-fashion-game","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T14:22:24Z","webTitle":"Meghan Markle’s glossy friends raise the wedding fashion game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/meghan-markles-glossy-friends-raise-the-wedding-fashion-game","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/meghan-markles-glossy-friends-raise-the-wedding-fashion-game","fields":{"headline":"Meghan Markle’s glossy friends raise the wedding fashion game","bodyText":"Inside St George’s Chapel for the royal wedding, the aesthetic was: Marvel Studios takes the storyline of a traditional British wedding and makes a 21st century blockbuster. There was an all-star cast – George Clooney as the hero, Tom Hardy as the villain – and no expense spared on the wardrobe. Amal Clooney looked spotlit in vivid saffron yellow, Oprah Winfrey pulled no punches in a knockout hat, and Fergie strutted in alone with her collar flicked up. The look was more Oscars red carpet than garden party. With the sun beaming down, it was like someone had turned the brightness of a late spring day up to 11. Idris Elba, one of the earliest arrivals, set the glamorous tone in a suit that was more black tie than morning dress. Recent American Vogue cover star Serena Williams looked ravishing in blush-pink gown with an asymmetric neckline. Victoria Beckham turned the aisle into a catwalk in her own image, wearing a severe high-fashion dark gown, which made no concessions to romance. In place of the usual sea of pale faces in polite florals, this was a diverse crowd making interesting choices. There were few straw hats with twiddly bits, and plenty of graphic pieces of millinery art, including Amal’s spaceship, and the panama-style of Suits star Gina Torres. Hemlines dipped rakishly (see Delfina Blaquier, the wife of the polo player Nacho Figueras, in turquoise) or fell grandly to the floor (the actor Abigail Spencer in polka dot Alessandra Rich with a sharp white collar).

Young people, the elderly and families sit on blue and yellow plastic seats, their eyes fixed on the court. But there is no game, and these people are not fans but hopeful travellers. The crowds carry suitcases with them and have been waiting to leave, some of them for months. In the middle of the cavernous room, an official sits at a wooden table with a list of people who have been approved that day to exit into Egypt. When he calls a name, that person can join a bus heading across the border. A 60-year-old woman said she had been attempting to get permission to leave from the Egyptian authorities for a year and four months. Although a Palestinian, she has lived for the past three decades in Germany, where she has citizenship, but came back for what she hoped would be a short visit to her parents. “I registered to travel [out of Gaza] a week after I arrived. This is the first time I’m on the list,” said Mufida, holding up her German passport. “No one’s name has been called out today,” she added. Mufida, who asked to give only her first name, received a call last week that she had a permit to leave but would need to wait for her name to be called. For four days she has waited at the stadium. Rumours swirl that several thousand dollars in bribes will get you across, but Mufida smiled and said she did not have the cash. “Nobody should come back here,” she said. Her seven children are waiting for her in Germany. A decade-long blockade on Gaza, the tiny strip of land surrounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean, has led to the collapse of its economy and the enclave is regularly referred to as an open-air prison. It had been hoped that close to two months of protests, sparked by anger and desperation, would lessen this crisis for two million Palestinians. Since late March, tens of thousands have gathered weekly along the frontier with Israel to demonstrate against the conditions they live under. Amid an international outcry and calls for investigations, Israeli fire has killed more than 110 people and thousands of others have been shot, mostly in the legs, according to health officials. The movement peaked on Monday, when an estimated 40,000 descended on the frontier, many throwing stones towards Israeli forces stationed on sandbanks behind the fence. There were attempts to breach the perimeter, although none succeeded, and many more of the wounded were shot dozens of metres back from the fortified fence, including paramedics. Monday’s gatherings were focused on dismay over the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem on the same day. And the protest organisers have called the movement the “Great March of Return”, demanding refugees and their descendants – two-thirds of Gaza’s residents – be allowed to return to homes lost in the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. But the primary goal was ending the blockade, according to Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University. “That is the number-one aim of the protest, even if the slogan is the Great March of Return,” he said. “The most important thing for the protest was to break the siege, to live in freedom and dignity, to live a better life.” Israel says it is forced to control access to the territory for security reasons, although the UN sees the blockade as collective punishment. Egypt, which accuses Gaza’s rulers, Hamas, of smuggling out fighters and weapons, only periodically opens the strip’s southern Rafah crossing. Trucks carrying cement and wood were seen there last week, and Cairo said the exit would remain open for the month of Ramadan – the longest uninterrupted period since 2013. The past few days have seen roughly 500 people cross per day, although thousands remain on lists. Travel is mostly restricted to patients and students enrolled in universities abroad, as well as dual citizens. Israel, however, has not significantly changed access at its crossings. It says Palestinians ransacked one crossing, although it later sent some medical supplies into Gaza through it. Hamas rejected the truckloads of aid, calling it a propaganda stunt. Another four trucks filled with medical supplies from Jordan were allowed to cross on Friday, the UN said, although access remains severely restricted. The protests have failed to elicit much support in Israel, where the bloodshed has been framed in large part as a response to a potential security threat to Israelis. One Israeli soldier has been injured since protests began. A poll conducted this month found 83% of Jewish Israelis believed the army’s open-fire policy was justified. Israel’s government blames Hamas for the deaths of people killed by Israeli forces, saying it has pushed civilians into the line of fire. Defence Minister Avigdor Liberman called Hamas a “bunch of cannibals”. Yehuda Shaul, one of the founders of Breaking the Silence, an anti-occupation Israeli human rights group run by military veterans, said most of Israeli Jewish society had “sadly enough, bought into the talking points of the government”. “It was really devastating to see the response of mainstream Israel, so to speak, on this,” he said. Voices of outrage have been largely muted and sidelined. Small protests across the country condemning the army’s use of live fire have barely reached the low hundreds. “There was a voice of dissent. It’s a minority, but it’s there,” Shaul said. “There is a voice and we are proud of it, but we are a minority.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/19/meghan-markles-wedding-was-a-celebration-of-blackness","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T08:56:25Z","webTitle":"Meghan Markle's wedding was a rousing celebration of blackness | Afua Hirsch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/meghan-markles-wedding-was-a-celebration-of-blackness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/meghan-markles-wedding-was-a-celebration-of-blackness","fields":{"headline":"Meghan Markle's wedding was a rousing celebration of blackness","bodyText":"Sometimes Twitter is capable of poetry. In this case, I read it between the lines, on a sunny Saturday afternoon in Windsor, in the juxtaposition of two separate trending phrases. #RoyalWedding and #BlackExcellence are not unusual on their own. But to see the two together, in a combination that would once have been unthinkable, speaks volumes about what has just changed. The setting is unlikely. The place – Windsor Castle – is the oldest inhabited castle in the world. The ritual – a wedding of the Queen’s grandson – is full of arcane and ancient British tradition: heraldry, knights of the garter, a choir that has been in continuous existence since the 13th century. But that is not what this royal wedding will be remembered for. When Oprah Winfrey entered the chapel at Windsor Castle, one TV anchor joked that for some people, it was the moment the real queen arrived. Winfrey’s attendance was a reminder that, between her and Meghan Markle, the bride whose wedding she had come to watch, perhaps the two most famous women in the world today are of African heritage. Also present were Serena Williams, who was there with her husband Alexis Ohanian, and other black royalty, including Idris Elba, with his fiancee Sabrina Dhowre, and Gina Torres, Markle’s fellow actor in the TV series Suits. At this royal wedding, talented black people were more than adornment. The sermon, delivered by the Episcopalian church leader the Rev Michael Curry, began with a quote from Martin Luther King Jr before enlightening the congregation on the wisdom of spirituals – traditional African American music rooted in the experience of slavery – and casting Jesus as a revolutionary. If there had been any doubts about what cultural experience Curry would bring to the service, they were swiftly and decisively answered. And as the cameras took in the facial expressions of guests in the chapel, I couldn’t help but wonder how many of the British royal family and aristocracy in attendance had ever had an experience like this before, one in which they were showered, generously, in the particular emotion of the rousing, rumbling rhetoric of a powerful black pastor. Zara Phillips – much to the enjoyment of regular black churchgoers on social media – was visibly in a state of shock. “A black reverend preaching to British royalty about the resilience of faith during slavery, 10000000% not what I thought I was waking up for,” wrote a black Canadian journalist. “The royal wedding is good.” Markle used her wedding to introduce her new peers to blackness. The teenage cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason was framed by flowers as he revealed the depth of talent that made him the first black person to win BBC Young Musician of the Year award. The Kingdom gospel choir sang soul classic Stand By Me: a love song, yes, but one that first rose to fame in the midst of the civil rights movement, becoming a soundtrack to protest and unity in the face of racial injustice. For people used to being part of the majority, these may be symbols they don’t easily see. But for those who relate to Markle’s situation – a person of colour entering perhaps the whitest and most exclusive of spaces in the world, the British royal family – they speak to an everyday sense of being the first, of bringing a heritage that changes the atmosphere, of having to decide whether to downplay it or wear it with pride. Markle’s choice was clear, and people responded. The wedding has transformed Windsor itself – a town only 20 miles from London but which, in its lack of visible diversity, can feel culturally thousands of kilometres away – that is suddenly full of people of colour. The day before the wedding, I saw African American women dressed in white lace dresses, some wearing tiaras, others wearing Meghan Markle masks. For all the talk about whether Markle is really black, for all the critique of her being “white-passing” or ambivalent about her black heritage, there are certainly black women in America who feel one of their own has entered British royalty. Since Markle’s father could not be there, commentators were speculating that, by arranging for Prince Charles to accompany her towards the altar, the royal family were making a statement of their acceptance of the newest family member. I like to see it differently. By choosing Prince Charles, Markle was making a statement that she embraces them. For a woman of her background, this is not an easy thing to do. Not everyone feels it’s a step forward. But at least by allowing her wedding to be not just a pageant of tradition, but also a celebration of blackness, she’s started as I hope she means to go on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/20/if-risk-is-such-a-good-thing-why-is-it-heaped-on-young-and-struggling-philip-green-carillion","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T05:00:50Z","webTitle":"If risk is such a good thing, why is it all heaped on to the young and struggling? | Sonia Sodha","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/if-risk-is-such-a-good-thing-why-is-it-heaped-on-young-and-struggling-philip-green-carillion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/if-risk-is-such-a-good-thing-why-is-it-heaped-on-young-and-struggling-philip-green-carillion","fields":{"headline":"If risk is such a good thing, why is it all heaped on to the young and struggling?","bodyText":"The Tories have got a youth problem and they’re going to fix it with peri-peri chicken. Not how they’d put it, but you hardly need to be a marketing whiz to work out that their latest big idea to tempt in new members – a Nando’s discount card – isn’t aimed at octogenarians in the home counties. It comes hot on the tracks of the government’s new millennial railcard, which offers a third off rail fares, presumably to distract 26- to 30-year-olds from the fact they’ll never be able to afford a house. Someone in Conservative HQ has been swotting up on their millennial stereotypes. But they’d be better off reading the report of the Resolution Foundation’s intergenerational commission. It busts some of the popular millennial myths: no, they don’t waste all their cash eating avocado on toast in trendy brunch spots; no, they don’t spend more on their phones than older generations; no, there’s no evidence they relate differently to big-name brands. And, most seriously, they are not the flighty job-hoppers that stereotypes would have us believe. The intergenerational gulf is often conceived of in hard cash. From housing, to pensions, to university education, young people are having to shell out more to approach the same standard of living as their parents and grandparents. This makes family background – whether you have parents who can help you out – more important than ever and means we’re creating a social mobility time bomb. But the divide is not just about resources. As the Resolution Foundation points out, young people are being expected to take on more risk. The obvious example is pensions. Gone are the days when companies pledged to pay retired workers a guaranteed income for the rest of their lives; today’s workers must, instead, save into an individual pot that must last. If you’re unlucky enough to retire just after a stock market crash has slashed the value of your pension – tough. It’s not just pensions. There are financial risks associated with homeownership, but young people who will spend most, or all, their lives renting are exposed to serious uncertainties: short-term tenancies, with the constant worry over whether this will be the year they and their kids end up needing to find somewhere else to live; and the risk of inflation-busting rent rises. It is young people who have been most exposed to the precarious slice of the labour market characterised by zero-hours contracts and low-paid self-employment, where companies have succeeded in shifting risk on to workers who can least afford to bear it. Exposure to risk, in moderation, can be a good thing: the world would be a messed-up place if people experienced all the upsides but none of the downsides of their actions. But it can fast become debilitating. Living with the knowledge that there could be any number of events around the corner that could send you into a downward spiral – getting cancer, losing your job, being in a car accident – results in a life of constant worry. It leaves people unable think about taking potentially life-changing productive risks, such as switching jobs, investing in a training course or dumping the life partner who’s making their life miserable. That’s why we as a society have developed collective approaches to dealing with bad risks, such as the NHS. Were he alive today, Nye Bevan would be scratching his head at our reluctance to contemplate a collective solution for older care, one of the biggest social challenges of our age. We don’t force someone with cancer to pay the huge costs of their care if they can afford it; why would we do so for someone unlucky enough to get dementia? The wealthy should pay more – but surely that should be everyone who can afford to put in, rather than just those who get the disease? It’ll be a while before we know the long-term consequences of forcing individuals to bear more risk. But there are clues: back to the myth of the job-hopping millennials. Changing jobs is an important means of securing promotion and boosting earnings. Yet the Resolution Foundation highlights that millennials are significantly less likely to move jobs voluntarily than generation X at the same point in their careers. It points to the higher levels of risk they face as one of the culprits. The effects will be worst for young people who can’t rely on a cushion of parental support. We’ve got exactly the reverse problem at the other end of the spectrum: there’s far too little personal risk associated with making terrible business decisions. No one illustrates this better than businessman-of-the-moment turned Sir Shifty, Philip Green. We’re encouraged to heap praise on the wealth creators who have supposedly taken big but smart risks to generate jobs and growth. David Cameron even put Philip Green in charge of a review of government spending in 2010. But it’s all too easy for unscrupulous “entrepreneurs” to make vast sums through wealth extraction, rather than wealth generation. Green made hundreds of millions out of BHS, leaving thousands of people without jobs and depleted pensions. Nothing shows quite how little has changed since than the spectacular collapse of Carillion in January. There are many familiar elements: greedy directors paying themselves huge bonuses the company couldn’t afford, dodgy accounts presented to investors, just on a grander scale – BHS on steroids. So it would be missing a trick just to think of inequality in terms of wealth: we need to ask hard questions about why young people are being expected to bear increasing amounts of individual risk while incredibly wealthy individuals can drive long-standing British companies to collapse and get off scot free. If the Conservatives really want to fix their youth problem, I might politely suggest this would make a better starting point than Portuguese chicken. • Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/19/royal-wedding-american-influence-meghan-markle-prince-harry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T15:49:14Z","webTitle":"Millions in US watch a royal wedding imbued with American spirit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/royal-wedding-american-influence-meghan-markle-prince-harry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/royal-wedding-american-influence-meghan-markle-prince-harry","fields":{"headline":"Millions in US watch a royal wedding imbued with American spirit","bodyText":"“IT’S ROYAL WEDDING TIME!!!” blared the celebrity website TMZ. Later, the deed done, the headline switched. “THEY GOT HITCHED AND IT WAS AWESOME!!!” it shouted. And so it was across three US time zones, as millions excitedly watched a royal wedding imbued with markedly American values, from the words of the civil rights movement and the ideals of love to a gospel choir belting out the Ben E King classic Stand By Me and the spiritual This Little Light of Mine. “We gotta get y’all married!” announced Michael Curry, the first African American presiding bishop and primate of the US Episcopal church, as he invoked Martin Luther King Jr in a homily about love that could have been delivered in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he served as a bishop for 16 years. “There’s power in love,” he said. “Love can help and heal when nothing else can. There’s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will.” Such power could be seen in the service, Curry continued, saying: “Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.” Nor was the US under-represented on the guest list. Taking its lead from the bride, the star of the USA Network hit Suits, now titled Duchess of Sussex, the bright star power of American glamour radiated from Oprah Winfrey, Serena Williams and George Clooney. Across the cable networks, anchors, commentators and guests filled six hours of early morning coverage with expressions of mounting delight. “If there’s any question about Meghan Markle bringing some change to the royal family, this ceremony was the beginning,” Anderson Cooper enthused, anchoring coverage for CNN. “She did it in a way that was incredibly bold,” agreed the commentator Bonnie Greer. “This was not a tiptoeing gesture. She changed the tenor of the ceremony completely.” Over on CBS, the former Vanity Fair editor and guest royal expert Tina Brown gushed: “It was a real blend of black and white, American and British.” “Perfection from beginning to end, a fairy tale,” the host Gayle King agreed, between hourly changes of her fascinator. The service also evoked deep historical roots between black America and the crown, dating back to the loyalists who, for a promise of emancipation from slavery, fought for Britain in the American revolutionary war. Though black abolitionists often understated the historic fight for the British, as they tried to win favour in mainstream American politics, some connections remain. “A general coincidence of anti-oppression – and British honoring of the Loyalists over time – is clear,” the historian Alan Gilbert, author of Black Patriots and Loyalists, told the Guardian. “Meghan is becoming a royal while keeping to her views. Britain (and more France) have been friendly to American blacks despite rapacious British colonial racism. So it is all somehow connected, if not quite sharply.” Almost 100 years after the revolution, in the mid-19th century, British-controlled Canada offered freedom to African Americans. On Saturday, the bridal veil contained Commonwealth references in the forms of more than 50 national flowers. Seeking to explain the American sense of connection to the crown, other historians and commentators simply point to the notion that American culture is built on the idea of fairy tales being the ultimate achievement in love. US TV viewership for Markle’s wedding was expected to easily exceed the 23 million who tuned in for Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011. Veronica Hefner, a quantitative media scholar at University of California, told NBC this wedding may prove more popular because the bride “is literally living out the American princess fairy tale”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/may/21/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T14:00:27Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/may/21/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/may/21/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. War was a frequent subject for discussion last week. Ben Macintyre’s Operation Mincemeat kept beerbart intrigued: Macintyre has a well-deserved reputation of crafting entertaining, accessible and informative narrative history particularly on war events or spy stories. This is no exception. I’m enjoying the rich cast of eccentrics and novelists (Ian Fleming was heavily involved in the plot and execution) all conspiring to fool the Germans who by all accounts were dreadful at this spy game during the war. Zigzag is his best book for me but this is running it close. Anne Frank’s diary has been in the news recently, and coincidentally, nina1414 has also just finished The Definitive Edition edited by Otto H Frank and Mirjam Pressler - and found it unexpectedly “uplifting”: As she points out herself, she never mopes. She takes comfort in looking at the sky - it makes her feel happy. She keeps busy and she has dreams for the future - she’d like to be a writer and she’d like to make a difference. One thing I hadn’t been aware of was that she and her family were actually German. She talks of wanting to take on Dutch nationality as she loves the country and is upset at the growing anti-Antisemitism there and hopes it is just a passing phase. I feel a bit bereft now. I’ve been reading 50 pages a day and now it’s come to an end. The Armies by Evelio Rosero, a “devastating portrait of life during the Colombian civil war”, fascinated Tom Mooney: Ismael, a slightly pervy retired teacher, spends his days picking oranges and spying on his neighbour as she sunbathes naked. He visits the cafe in town and chats with the locals. He spars with his wife of 40 years. But life in this small town is scarred by the ongoing war, which breezes sporadically through, leaving in its wake a hurricane of violence and death. Disappearances, murder, explosions, then gone. Which side was it this time? Who knows? Who cares? Written in sultry, classic prose, Rosero paints the profound effects of war on those innocent bystanders caught up in its terror. Elsewhere, fatbuddha1 has enjoyed the depiction of post-war Glasgow in Lennox by Craig Russell: It concerns a Canadian gumshoe, making a shady living in post war Glasgow. It’s very good on historical detail, I think, I know nothing of post war Glasgow but it rings true, and is excellent on disrespecting Edinburgh. I think the author had great fun thinking up so many inventive ways to slag the place and the people off. It’s a like a mash up of Chandler and Malcolm Mckay, with a bit of Carl Hiassen thrown in. The good news for me is that there is more where that came from, and I shall be enjoying the series. Umberto Eco’s In The Name Of The Rose has (mainly) impressed paulburns: A wonderful novel about monastic life in Italy in the early 14th century. Covers the heresy hunt against Franciscan Spirituals, aspects of medieval philosophy, theology, etc, including the evils of the Inquisition. But it is mostly a fascinating detective story - William of Baskerville - brilliant. Though I did find Adso’s enthralment in church decoration etc and his naivety a bit longwinded. A wonderful new (Disc)world is opening up for janey smit who has just read Mort by Terry Pratchett: My first ever and I liked it. How about that? Finally Larts has re-read JL Carr’s I read A Month In The Country: I was, as ever, deeply moved by the whole novel. The humour and pathos coming so close together. It’s a short novel but boy does it cut deep. Do I weep for Birkin or myself at the end? It takes a special kind of book to make you feel that way... Interesting links about books and reading Ireland has a vibrant journal scene. It really does. Daniel Kalder on dictator literature, and writers as the “engineers of the human soul.” Meanwhile, Xi Jinping has written a Big White Book. Great literature or Nine Inch Nails lyric: can you tell the difference? A close reading of the glorious first paragraph of Charles Portis’s True Grit. Yelena Moskovich on building a lesbian literary canon. If you would like to share a photo of the book you are reading, or film your own book review, please do.

Along with anticipation of the dress and gossip about her extended family has come a debate about how much Meghan Markle will transform both the royal family and perceptions of blackness and Britishness. It’s a debate as dysfunctional as the Windsors themselves. According to the 2011 census, 2.3 million people in Britain are either married to, or living with, someone of a different ethnicity. The excitement and, for some, apprehension at Harry doing the same is a reflection not of how much the monarchy is being modernised, but of how anachronistic it really is. In today’s celebrity culture, Meghan may actually be the most authentic royal of them all. In the past, the mystique of the royals derived from the distance between their lives and those of their subjects and from the secrecy with which they surrounded their affairs. Now, the royals capture the imagination for exactly the opposite reason: they’ve become a soap opera in which their every sneeze is splashed across the gossip pages. Welcome to Meghan’s world. As for the belief that Meghan will break down barriers for black people and make minorities more accepted as truly British, that’s as anachronistic as the monarchy. Faced by an abusive skinhead or by a police officer about to stop and search me, my first thought has never been: “If only there was a black Windsor, then I might be accepted more.” Nor can I work out why adding a few more black dukes and duchesses, or even kings and queens, should be a step forward. Equality does not mean making inherited privilege more “diverse”. It requires us to get rid of the whole shebang. Adding a splash of colour to a feudal relic is not my idea of social progress. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/may/19/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-marcus-rashford-fa-cup-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T20:49:25Z","webTitle":"Marcus Rashford’s toils show up José Mourinho as a man without a plan | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/19/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-marcus-rashford-fa-cup-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/19/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-marcus-rashford-fa-cup-final","fields":{"headline":"Marcus Rashford’s toils show up José Mourinho as a man without a plan","bodyText":"On a sweaty, heavy, oddly gruelling Wembley day Manchester United’s sweaty, heavy, oddly gruelling season was finally euthanised to a close. It has been a good season in some ways, with obvious progress made in the Premier League. But it passed here without the garnish of a trophy as Eden Hazard’s first-half penalty settled a largely forgettable FA Cup final in Chelsea’s favour. Chelsea have had a mixed season, too. Victory at Wembley was a reflection not of a team finding its gears, but of the fact in Hazard they had the best player on the pitch, enough to make a difference even in just the briefest glimpse. For United this felt like something else, a dose of necessary medicine where the gleam of another trophy might have concealed the symptoms, hid the deeper snags and knots. Either way it seemed a fitting reflection of United’s status right now to end the season watching this sluggish red‑shirted machine spend 90 minutes trying and failing to score a goal. This remains the single most interesting thing about this powerful, strangely burdened team. From Anfield to St James’ Park, from Andalucía to Ashton Gate, United’s season has been a heavy kind of thing, with a sense throughout of trapped energy, of cogs that refuse to click, of results wrung out of bloody‑minded will. Look back and this has been the one constant of the post‑Ferguson era. Through five years and three managers successive teams have shared this clogged aspect, lacking in the vital notes of grace and fluency. Against all expectations Manchester United have somehow become the Daleks. Mourinho’s team has now ended the season with seven goals in their last eight games, with fewer away goals than Leicester in the league, with a single goal over 180 minutes against Sevilla, with four goals in a game just once since a fine scoring run in the autumn. Albeit, even in those most liberated moments there has been a clanking quality, like an android replicant making brief, sullen attempts to dance the Charleston. If any player embodied this struggle at Wembley it was probably the frantic figure of Marcus Rashford, who was never on his heels, who ran constantly, passed accurately; but who seemed throughout to be playing through a kind of fog, blunt when he needed to be sharp, a player making all the right runs, just not necessarily in the right order. With Romelu Lukaku unfit for anything more than the bench this was a wonderful opportunity for Rashford to play as a starting centre-forward in a season-defining game. Not that his year to date had provided much significant preparation. Rashford did get a start as a centre-forward against Brighton just a couple of weeks ago, a game that inspired a pretty wretched piece of public politicking from Mourinho afterwards. “Why always Lukaku? Now you see why,” was the verdict of a man charged with building the confidence, self-esteem and general pastoral wellbeing of one of the brightest young attacking talents in England. Or not, as the case may be. Here Rashford lined up just ahead of Alexis Sánchez here in a vague, ungrooved, energetically incoherent impersonation of a two-man attack. After five minutes and 30 seconds someone in a red shirt finally passed to him. For a while he made runs: curving runs, runs across the back three, runs behind the full-backs. After all it’s good to keep yourself busy. Meanwhile a football match happened 30 yards away. Rashford is still only 20 and in the middle of one of those difficult seasons young players are allowed to have. The wider issue is the sense of a player drifting into a kind of dead zone where he seems unsure not just of his role but of his own basic skills. Mourinho’s keenest fans will be eager to excuse him from any part in this. But something is missing here. Rashford has talent and willing. There has simply been no development, just a sense of irritation that this young player is not a ready-made elite No 9. Either way Rashford looks more like an over-promoted youth-team player now than when he actually was one. Certainly it is clearer than ever how important Lukaku is to José’s United. Second balls, bouncing off defenders, fighting for scrappy possession: this is the job now. United did surge after half-time, making concerted attempts to force the ball through Chelsea’s lines in a red-shirted bludgeon. With no obvious attacking plan, United went into blitz mode, midfield storming forward, the full‑backs battering in crosses. But they never really threatened to find the right forward gear. There is nothing wrong with defensive football, which has its own kind of beauty. Mourinho has been the master of victory through constriction, and in the process has provided some of the most memorable and overachieving European teams of the last couple of decades. But the past tense is significant here. Reactive, strangulating football remains his base note, but it is hardly reflected in the wider world where the most successful teams tend to pour their energies and planning into moving forward, concentrating on the weaknesses not the strengths of an opponent. No goals: no trophy. The extent to which Mourinho is willing, never mind able, to regear this United team over the summer will surely be key to the immediate future of both."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/may/19/anwar-ibrahim-when-it-is-denied-freedom-torture-malaysia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T22:13:09Z","webTitle":"Malaysia’s Anwar Ibrahim: ‘When it is denied to you, freedom is a torture’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/19/anwar-ibrahim-when-it-is-denied-freedom-torture-malaysia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/19/anwar-ibrahim-when-it-is-denied-freedom-torture-malaysia","fields":{"headline":"Malaysia’s Anwar Ibrahim: ‘When it is denied to you, freedom is a torture’","bodyText":"Anwar Ibrahim has seen it all. He has seen prison, he has seen betrayal, he has seen courtrooms, he has seen the highest office and opposition exile. And last week, emerging from prison after serving a second jail sentence for sodomy – charges which have been confirmed as trumped up and politically driven – he saw freedom in an entirely new light. “I’ve always talked about democracy, freedom, liberal ideas, but there is a difference when you taste it: you value these ideals more,” said Anwar. “When it is denied to you, freedom is a torture and also a reason for survival.” Speaking to the Observer exclusively at his home in Kuala Lumpur, days after being released, the 70-year-old former deputy prime minister, who has long been the face of reform and hope in Malaysia, is relaxed and serene. Certainly he is riding high both on his new-found freedom, following a pardon from the king for a “miscarriage of justice”, but also because, for the first time in his life, Malaysia has embraced his reformasi (reform) agenda. In an election which has featured a gripping mixture of betrayal, alleged corruption and the unseating of an authoritarian regime, Malaysia has found itself with its first opposition government since independence in 1957. This was all the more extraordinary because the opposition was led by 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, who was Malaysia’s longest-serving prime minister, in post between 1981 and 2003. Back then he was head of the UMNO party, part of the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, and his golden boy and heir apparent was Anwar, the charismatic reformer who advocated for a pluralistic, democratic form of Islam. That all changed in 1998 when Anwar dared to challenge Mahathir over his penchant for awarding huge state contracts to friends, leading to allegations of cronyism. Anwar was sacked, and then, thanks to Mahathir, found himself on trial for sodomy. The trial was an exercise in humiliation – semen-stained sheets brought out, male witnesses (who later admitted to being pressured into testifying) accusing Anwar of forcing them into sexual acts. Anwar, who had a young family at the time, was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in jail. He spent six years in prison, in solitary confinement and denied access to his family, before he was released in 2004. He joined the opposition, formed his own party, the PKR, and when he was finally allowed back into politics ran against the ruling coalition, then led by Najib Razak, in the 2013 election. He lost, but won the popular vote, and Najib panicked. As Anwar puts it: “I never supported him, I had strong views against him and he took it very personally back then, which is why he wanted to finish me off.” Using the judiciary, Najib ensured that Anwar was once again tried for sodomy. So in 2015, Anwar was back behind bars once again. It was not easy, Anwar said, to be in prison and know “if the 2013 elections had been free and fair, we would have won and I would not be in jail.” Was he not filled with anger at the system? “Yes,” he concedes. “But after you have experienced jail for a long time, after so many years, you don’t really have that bitterness. I’m not pretending to be this great humanitarian, merciful person, but honestly I didn’t feel bitter. In the end you philosophise and just accept the unfolding drama.” Yet no element of the elections has been more unexpected, and more turbulent, than the reconciliation of Anwar and Mahathir this year. And there was no one it took by surprise more than Anwar himself. After all, their fallout was more than political: it was personal and vindictive. When Anwar was fired as deputy prime minister in 1998, he was told to move out of the official residence immediately. He asked for a few days as he had young children: Mahathir ordered for the water and electricity to be cut off. Standing outside the court after he was charged with sodomy in 1999, Anwar described Mahathir as “a coward who will not seek responsibility for his own evil … Mahathir’s lust for power is insatiable”. In return, when Anwar was in jail, Mahathir made sure visiting requests from his young family were denied. And even after Anwar got out in 2004, Mahathir continued his tirade. “Imagine having a gay prime minister. Nobody would be safe,” he said in 2005. Anwar unsuccessfully tried to sue Mahathir for slander as a result. Anwar said he was extremely suspicious when, in January, Mahathir asked to visit him in jail in the hope of reconciliation and partnership. “It was very difficult for me and initially I said to Mahathir: ‘Why would I want to have anything to do with you any more. I will forgive you, but goodbye: that’s it’,” said Anwar. “But after we talked and knowing the man as I do – filled as he is with self-confidence, self-indulgent at times – suddenly coming to see me, his nemesis, in prison, was a sign that he was really desperate or he had really mellowed quite a bit. And that was precisely what had happened.” But his children, who had lost their father for most of their childhoods, were not so open to reconciliation (Nurul Izzah, Anwar’s daughter, is now a prominent politican in the opposition in her own right). “My children refused to participate, and were in tears in the corner,” said Anwar. “They couldn’t understand why I would meet this man who made their life hell. They disagreed with me, told me I should not make a deal with Mahathir, said to me ‘you suffered, we all suffered, because of him’. “But I told them ‘what do you do when your so-called enemy comes and says, “let’s be friends and forget the past?”’ It is very difficult to say no.” Nonetheless, Mahathir has still failed to apologised for what he put Anwar’s family through, though he did say that he should not have fired Anwar, which “coming from Mahathir, is good enough for me”. Even in prison, Anwar started to have an inkling that the tides of Malaysia were turning in favour of the opposition in the election: once-hostile prison guards and doctors began to be friendly to him, slipping him phones, and finally coming in on election day to whisper that they had voted for the opposition. While Anwar will run as an MP in the next few months, he will not serve in Mahathir’s cabinet, and there is a sense he wants to keep himself somewhat distant from the government should it not prove to follow through on all promises for reform. Anwar’s wife, Wan Azizah, currently serving as deputy prime minister, is also keeping a watchful eye on Mahathir. However, he has not lost his desire to be prime minister and has his sights set on office in two years – after all, as he himself says, he and his family have paid a “high price, probably too high a price” for his reformist beliefs, and wants to finally put them into practice. Yet in the meantime Anwar is unwavering in his belief that Mahathir is fully behind the opposition reform agenda, and also has no doubts that he will hand over power in two years – a confidence probably helped by the fact that while Mahathir seems to be in perfect health, he is nonetheless in his mid-nineties. Already in their meetings, Anwar says, they are “slipping back into old ways”, and can now joke with each other about their 20-year dispute. Their joint determination to pursue Najib for the corruption he is accused of carrying out in office is also a uniting factor. An investigation into the 1MDB scandal, where, under Najib, over $4bn was embezzled out of a government fund, with an alleged $681m ending up in Najib’s personal bank account, is already under way, and Malaysia has been gripped by a raid on Najib-linked properties which has seen 284 Hermes handbags and 72 bags of cash, watches and jewellery seized. After all that happened between Anwar and Najib, it was also a surprise to him on election night to be handed the phone by a prison guard and told it was the prime minister on the phone with a request: Najib was refusing to accept he had lost the elections, could Anwar help them convince him to concede? Despite all of their history, Anwar agreed to speak to Najib, and on the other end of the phone found a man who was “so, so scared. He was shattered and in complete denial.” Even after a second phone call telling Najib to concede for the sake of democracy and the country, he said a devastated Najib still could not accept defeat. But with heavy irony, just as Anwar leaves jail, Najib appears to be facing serious legal trouble. Does he have any advice for the former prime minister? Anwar smiles slyly. “Have good defence lawyers,” he said with a grin. “And express remorse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/2018/may/20/azed-crossword-2397","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T23:01:40Z","webTitle":"Azed crossword 2,397","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2018/may/20/azed-crossword-2397","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2018/may/20/azed-crossword-2397","fields":{"headline":"Azed crossword 2,397","bodyText":"Click here for a printable version.

Conte watched his team dig out a 1-0 win against Manchester United in the FA Cup final to finish a trying season on a high. The trophy followed his Premier League title success from last season – his first at Stamford Bridge. Yet the Italian did little to clear up the uncertainty over his position, with the expectation remaining that he will not be around to fulfil the final year on his contract. Chelsea finished fifth in the Premier League this season and missed out on Champions League qualification. “When you are used to winning every season, this type of season can create some problems in yourself,” Conte said. “But I also think in a difficult season like this, I showed I’m a serial winner. To win in this way this season gives me more satisfaction than my wins in the past.” Conte made it plain that he would not and could not change his ways and that if the club did not want to carry on with him, he would understand. Equally, he said that he remained committed. It added up to a “back me or sack me” message. “After two years, the club knows me very well,” Conte said. “If they want to continue to work with me, they know me. I can’t change. I am this and my past speaks very clearly, as a player and as a manager. “I’m a serial winner. I showed this in England in a difficult moment for the club after a 10th-place finish [in 2015-16]. In two seasons, I brought two trophies for this club. “I have a contract and I’m committed for this club. As you know very well, our job is not simple. I understand that the club can make a decision, a positive decision or a negative decision. I’m the first to understand. “You have to understand if, in this season, we had the maximum or not. There is the possibility, with this group of players, that we did the maximum. “For sure, we’ll make the best decision. I’m the first to accept every decision for the future. After these two seasons, I will always love this club and these fans – also if my future must be in a different way.” José Mourinho said Romelu Lukaku had made himself available only as a substitute in the FA Cup final. Lukaku had missed United’s previous three games with an ankle injury. “I knew the opponent I was going to play against, that they have a compact low block with lots of physicality,” said the United manager. “Without a target man it would be difficult. When a player tells you he’s not ready to play, to start, then the question is: ‘How many minutes do you think you can [play]?’ How can I convince a player that is not ready to play?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/19/cannes-2018-cheering-if-baffling-set-of-prizes-cap-a-curious-year","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T21:15:01Z","webTitle":"Cannes 2018: cheering – if baffling – set of prizes caps a curious year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/19/cannes-2018-cheering-if-baffling-set-of-prizes-cap-a-curious-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/19/cannes-2018-cheering-if-baffling-set-of-prizes-cap-a-curious-year","fields":{"headline":"Cannes 2018: cheering – if baffling – set of prizes caps a curious year","bodyText":"So once again, the decisions of the Cannes jury are wildly different from the social-media-fuelled consensus of the Anglophone press, and certainly my own predictions were horribly wrong. It was disappointing that Cate Blanchett’s jury could find nothing for Lee Chang-dong’s brilliant mystery thriller Burning or for the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan and his deeply sympathetic and beautifully filmed homecoming fable The Wild Pear Tree. But there is something very satisfying about the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda getting his Palme d’Or for the rich, and complex family drama Shoplifters. That would not have been my exact choice, but it is still an excellent film. Kore-eda is a film-maker who has been a presence at Cannes for almost 20 years and the intelligence and subtlety of his films have been an important contributor to the Cannes gold standard of world cinema. Shoplifters is about a rascally man and his boy who make a living stealing from supermarkets; one winter evening after a hard day’s thieving, they see a homeless little girl and this man resolves to take her home and look after her in the bosom of his extended, and rackety family. Is this a redemption? A right turn on the path to morality? Not exactly. He wants to “steal” this little girl in the way he steals every thing else, and, Fagin-like, train her up in the ways of shoplifting. And his own extended family is not what it seems. Kore-eda delivers an extraordinary, almost M. Night Shyamalan-type surprise twist, but does it so calmly, so matter-of-factly, that the audience is rubbing its eyes, wondering what’s happened. It’s a very complex film – one which pays its audience the compliment of treating them like intelligent people who are prepared to engage intensely with his film. Kore-eda has to be considered a great Japanese master, and spoken of in the same breath as Ozu and (his own personal model) Naruse. Spike Lee’s fierce knockabout satire BlacKkKlansman won the Grand Prix, and this was a period movie based on the true story of the black police officer who masterminded the infiltration of the KKK in Colorado. Of course, Lee reinvents this as a parable of present and future times, a story stuffed with unsubtle – but often very funny and certainly pertinent – premonitions of Donald J Trump. It is an angry film, a strident and passionate film and one that insists that there is no value in talking about the historical past, or in reviving the Blaxploitation tropes of 30 or 40 years ago, if these references are not put to the service of the present – of attacking the current situation, and the dangerous complacency, narcissism and chauvinism of America’s political masters in 2018. Clearly, the passion and anger of BlacKkKlansman spoke to this jury. The Jury Prize surprised and disappointed me a little – especially given the calibre of films which had been overlooked – although Nadine Labaki’s Capharnum had certainly melted critical hearts harder than mine. It is a poignant and emotionally direct story of a boy in present-day Beirut, who runs away from home, fetches up with an illegal Ethiopian immigrant who is then imprisoned, and who then winds up looking after her baby. It is a story with a silly framing device, about this boy launching a lawsuit against his parents from prison, but there is no doubt that it lands an emotional punch in the solar plexus, and it has its own ethical and emotional integrity. UK audiences will have the chance to make up their own minds when it reaches British cinemas, as it surely will. For me, the single biggest hitter on this list is the Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski, whose Cold War got him the director’s prize – the story of a star-crossed love affair in the gloom and drear of postwar Poland. It is a brilliantly made and passionately acted film. My own choice for Palme d’Or was Alice Rohrwacher’s sublime and beautifully conceived fable in the style of Olmi – Happy As Lazzaro. It didn’t go away empty –handed, sharing a screenwriting prize with Nader Saeivar and Jafar Panahi, co-writers of the Panahi-directed Three Faces. The brilliant Italian actor Marcello Fonte was a highly popular choice for best actor as the nerdy little dog-groomer and mobster coke-dealer in Matteo Garrone’s extravagantly exciting Dogman. Fonte could be the Roberto Benigni of his generation. Samal Yeslyamova, the star of Kazakh director Sergei Dvortsevoy’s Ayka, won the actress — beating out the much-fancied favourite, Joanna Kulig from Cold War — for her performance as the eponymous Ayka, a woman who gives birth in conditions of almost unimaginable squalor and poverty and has to contend with menacing loan-sharks and heartless landlords. It was a much-admired performance which certainly commanded assent among the jury. You would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at Jean-Luc Godard being given the “special” Palme d’Or for his challenging, sulphurous, angry, bewildering, and disorientating essay-film Image Book. The jury’s attempt to timidly offer up a “special” top prize is unconvincing – and one can only imagine the great director’s frosty lack of gratitude or even interest. Perhaps Godard is at once too special or not special enough for the actual Palme d’Or or any prize actually commensurate with his actual worth. But it is, at any rate, satisfying and heartening to see such respect lavished on Hirokazu Kore-eda, one of the great Japanese film-makers of the modern age."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/may/19/chelsea-1-0-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-player-ratings","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T19:22:03Z","webTitle":"Chelsea 1-0 Manchester United: FA Cup final player ratings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/19/chelsea-1-0-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-player-ratings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/19/chelsea-1-0-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-player-ratings","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea 1-0 Manchester United: FA Cup final player ratings","bodyText":"Chelsea Thibaut Courtois Preferred to Willy Caballero, he had little to do but made a brilliant left-hand save to deny Phil Jones in his first FA Cup match of the season. 7/10 César Azpilicueta The Spaniard marshalled the back three impeccably and made a couple of important blocks, namely from Anthony Martial. 6 Gary Cahill A commanding display by the Chelsea captain but he was never rushed off his feet; comfortable with what was thrown at him. 7 Antonio Rüdiger Was rarely troubled and looked assured when needed; he formed a crucial part of the blue defensive wall that closed the game out. 6 Victor Moses Quiet going forward and a little clumsy defensively. He was fortunate to avoid a booking for a couple of plucky fouls on Ashley Young. 5 N’Golo Kanté Was still running when everybody else was walking. Took the sting out of countless United moves and dictated midfield tempo. 8 Tiémoué Bakayoko Was a bold call by Antonio Conte to persist with him over Willian given his struggles and was busy without doing anything special. 5 Marcos Alonso Presented with the chance to add a second but his effort on goal was fairly pedestrian. Not exactly at his best. 6 Cesc Fàbregas The Spaniard lost his FA Cup winners’ medal from 2005 but will surely keep this one safe after a gutsy display in both boxes. 6 Eden Hazard The best player on the pitch on his 300th appearance in a Chelsea shirt. Displayed guile and class, typified by his ice-cool penalty. 9 Olivier Giroud He linked well with Hazard and gave Chelsea a constant outlet but should have been punished for costly slip when Paul Pogba headed wide. 7 Substitutes: Álvaro Morata N/A (for Giroud 89); Willian N/A (for Hazard 90). Manchester United David de Gea Made a routine save from Hazard before going the wrong way for the penalty. Denied Alonso to keep United in it with 20 minutes to play. 6/10 Antonio Valencia The Manchester United captain had few chances to push forward and was kept on the back foot. Booked for a foul on the marauding Hazard. 5 Chris Smalling Easily dealt with the threat of Giroud, especially in their aerial duels, and made a couple of smart interventions. Strong display. 7 Phil Jones Led a merry dance by Hazard, who he scythed down for penalty. Worrying dress rehearsal for when England meet Belgium in June. 4 Ashley Young Lucky that Michael Oliver did not refer to VAR when the England defender appeared to handball a Moses pass in the box. 5 Ander Herrera Was asked to stifle and man-mark Hazard but he ultimately tried and failed to stifle the Chelsea playmaker. Fairly anonymous display. 5 Nemanja Matic It spoke volumes that the former Chelsea midfielder was United’s most lively player. Unafraid to do the dirty work, as ever. 7 Paul Pogba Barring the odd foray forward, the Frenchman never really got into his stride; a wayward strike as good as it got. Nodded a free header wide. 4 Jesse Lingard The midfielder was shackled and struggled to dent the Chelsea backline before being replaced by Anthony Martial late on. 5 Alexis Sánchez Showed glimpses of quality and, occasionally, nimble footwork but was sloppy in possession. Another frustrating outing in a United shirt. 5 Marcus Rashford A willing runner and had a couple of half-hearted efforts on goal but largely failed to seize his chance to impress. 5 Substitutes: Romelu Lukaku 4 (for Rashford 73) Not fit enough to start and ineffective off the bench; Anthony Martial 5 (for Lingard 73) Had a half-chance blocked by Azpilicueta; Juan Mata N/A (for Jones 87)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/19/chelsea-manchester-united-fa-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T18:14:00Z","webTitle":"Chelsea’s Eden Hazard spot-on to sink Manchester United and win FA Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/19/chelsea-manchester-united-fa-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/19/chelsea-manchester-united-fa-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea’s Eden Hazard spot-on to sink Manchester United and win FA Cup","bodyText":"If this turns out to be Antonio Conte’s final game as Chelsea manager – and who could really be surprised if they do part ways? – at least he has gone out on a high. For all the problems, the unending politics and the clear impression of a manager who knows his time is up, another trophy has been added to the collection. Last year, the Premier League, this season, the FA Cup; only at Chelsea, perhaps, could a manager with that return now be cut loose. It is an eccentric twist bearing in mind Chelsea have just won the eighth FA Cup of their history, moving joint third with Tottenham on the all-time list. But this can be an unorthodox club, and who can possibly say the boom-and-bust policy does not work when Chelsea, on Roman Abramovich’s watch, have accumulated so much silverware? This was the 15th trophy of the Abramovich era – and that is not even using the José Mourinho tactic of counting Community Shields. The Portuguese, in fairness, managed to get through a galling day for Manchester United without feeling it necessary to aim any gratuitous digs at his former club. Well, apart from saying it was undeserved and describing Chelsea’s tactics as “predictable”, namely by aiming the ball up to Olivier Giroud and hoping Eden Hazard could sprinkle some magic on the occasion. Predictable but effective would have been a better way of putting it and unfortunately for Mourinho his own team had nobody to menace Chelsea in the way Hazard did Phil Jones and the rest of United’s defence. Jones, in particular, looked dizzied by the experience and Hazard, with the decisive first-half penalty, chose a good day to put in one of his more illuminating performances of the past year. The same goes for Antonio Rüdiger as Chelsea defended with the stoutness that was reminiscent of Conte’s title-winning season. Gary Cahill has rediscovered his best form and, on this evidence, Chelsea’s captain might have overtaken Jones in the pecking order to start for England in the World Cup. Jones is too prone to these kind of accident-laden performances. He finished the game with a bandaged head and a sore hamstring but nothing will hurt as much as watching back the key moments, in the 21st minute, when Chelsea put themselves in a position of strength. Jones’s first mistake was to back off as Cesc Fàbregas curled the ball into Hazard’s feet. The Belgian came forward, trying to make space for himself. His first touch left Jones stranded and United were vulnerable as soon as Hazard started picking up speed, running inside his marker before shaping to shoot inside the penalty area. Conte was enraged that Jones avoided a red card for the flailing, desperate challenge that brought down Hazard. It was a clear penalty and the referee, Michael Oliver, was surrounded by Chelsea players wanting to know why Jones had not been sent off. Conte still looked incensed even after Hazard had expertly rolled the penalty past David de Gea but it was the correct decision if the referee thought Jones had made a legitimate attempt to play the ball. In that case, the regulations state referees ought to show a yellow card, regardless of whether it denies a goalscoring opportunity. After that, Chelsea had to withstand some concerted pressure, especially in the second half, when Conte’s side started to defend more deeply. A linesman’s flag denied Alexis Sánchez a close-range equaliser and Thibaut Courtois had a fine game. It would be an exaggeration, however, to depict United’s second-half improvement as a full-blown assault. The width was generally provided by United’s full-backs, Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia. Otherwise, it was a six-out-of-10 performance from the more advanced players and in the closing minutes, when an onslaught might have been expected, Chelsea were largely untroubled. Romelu Lukaku could not make any difference when he replaced Marcus Rashford in the 73rd minute and Mourinho, reflecting on a season without silverware, seemed keen afterwards to clarify that United’s leading scorer had gone to him, rather than the other way round, to say he did not feel ready to start. Rashford flickered only occasionally and it was a laboured performance from Sánchez, as it often has been since his defection from Arsenal. Hazard, on the other hand, always shimmered with menace when Chelsea looked to spring their opponents on the break. The disappointment was the lack of refinement from the two teams that finished second and fifth in the Premier League, featuring some of the more celebrated players in English football’s top division. The game hotted up in the final half an hour but, Hazard apart, it lacked any real sophistication and always had the feel of a papering‑over‑the‑cracks final. United finished 19 points behind Manchester City in the league, with Chelsea 30 adrift of the top, and nobody could have left Wembley thinking that the gulf felt like a deception. Ultimately, though, it finished with Hazard swigging from a bottle of champagne, a blizzard of ticker tape fluttering at the Chelsea end and Blue is the Colour being pumped out as the trophy was passed down the line of victorious players. Afterwards, there were all the usual questions for Conte about whether he will be leaving. If he does, there is one clear certainty – they cannot allow Hazard to follow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/19/donald-trump-jr-meeting-saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-report","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T20:28:38Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump Jr met Gulf states emissary offering election help – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/19/donald-trump-jr-meeting-saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/19/donald-trump-jr-meeting-saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-report","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump Jr met Gulf states emissary offering election help – report","bodyText":"Donald Trump Jr met with an emissary for foreign governments seeking to help his father’s presidential campaign three months before the 2016 election, the New York Times reported on Saturday. Citing several anonymous sources with knowledge of the meeting, the Times said Trump Jr met at Trump Tower on 3 August 2016 with an emissary for the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Also present, the paper said, were an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation, Joel Zamel, and Erik Prince, the founder of the private military contractor formerly known as Blackwater. Zamel represented a firm that employed several Israeli former intelligence officers and specialized in data collection and social media persuasion. At the time of the meeting, the Times stated, “the firm had already drawn up a multimillion-dollar proposal for a social media manipulation effort to help elect Mr Trump”. The meeting, which the Times said was facilitated by Prince, is the first evidence that countries other than Russia sought to influence the US election in favor of Donald Trump. The US intelligence community and the Senate judiciary committee agree that Russian election interference aimed to help Trump defeat his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating that interference and alleged links between Trump aides and Moscow. Trump has repeatedly denied collusion and called the investigation a “witch-hunt”. During the Trump Tower meeting, the Times said, George Nader, the emissary for the two crown princes, indicated that leaders in Saudi Arabia and the UAE wished to help Trump. Nader, the Times said, is now cooperating with Mueller. Under US law, the involvement of foreign governments or individuals in American elections is illegal. It is not known if anything came of the alleged offer for assistance. The Times stated that Trump Jr responded “approvingly”. Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr, told the Times: “Prior to the 2016 election, Donald Trump Jr recalls a meeting with Erik Prince, George Nader and another individual who may be Joel Zamel. They pitched Mr Trump Jr on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it.” A lawyer for Zamel told the Times neither he, “nor any of his related entities, had any involvement whatsoever in the US election campaign”. The lawyer also said Zamel had “provided full cooperation to the government to assist with their investigation”. The paper said Prince declined to comment. It quoted a lawyer for Nader as saying he had “fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation and will continue to do so”. The report cited “a senior official in Saudi Arabia” who it said denied Nader had ever been authorized to speak for the Saudi government. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. The allegations will bring further scrutiny to Trump Jr’s activities during the campaign. The president’s oldest son emerged as a central figure in the Russia investigation after it was revealed last year that he facilitated a now infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that also involved the Trump aides Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort and a group of Russians including a lawyer with links to the Kremlin, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The White House issued a misleading statement about the meeting, claiming it was about adoptions. It was later disclosed that the encounter was arranged when the Russians offered to provide incriminating information about Clinton. Informed of the offer, Trump Jr responded: “If it’s what you say, I love it”. The president’s son has said his father was not aware of that Trump Tower meeting. But according to a transcript of his testimony to congressional investigators released this week, Trump Jr was unable to recall if any of three calls he placed to a blocked number before and after the meeting were to his father. The August meeting reported by the Times was not previously known to the public. Nader became a close ally of Trump officials. He met frequently with Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and Michael Flynn, who would become Trump’s first national security adviser. In November, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the former Russian ambassador to the US. He has been cooperating with the special counsel. Trump has closely aligned himself with Israel, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. His first foreign trip was to Riyadh. Last year, Trump embraced a Saudi-led blockade against Qatar, a key US ally, against the counsel of his foreign policy advisers. Recently, the president withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal – a move championed by Israel, Saudi Arabia and the UAE."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/19/exeter-don-armand-newcastle-premiership-semi-final-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T17:51:39Z","webTitle":"Exeter crush Newcastle and prove folly of England tour selection | Robert Kitson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/19/exeter-don-armand-newcastle-premiership-semi-final-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/19/exeter-don-armand-newcastle-premiership-semi-final-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"Exeter crush Newcastle and prove folly of England tour selection","bodyText":"Two potentially gripping semi-finals, two painfully one-sided outcomes. If Saracens were runaway winners in north London, the rumbling Exeter juggernaut proved even harder to stop beside the M5 on a gorgeous afternoon in Devon. Newcastle had made the long trip south with high hopes of troubling the champions; had their outside backs known in advance how infrequently they would touch the ball they would have been sorely tempted to stay at home. The only consolation for the Falcons is that denying the Chiefs a Premiership final appearance is an increasingly tough assignment. Reaching three Premiership finals in a row may not yet compare with Leicester’s remarkable run of nine but Exeter do not look a team, or a club, who are remotely finished yet. Those who reckon Saracens will regain their title this year should not put their mortgage on it. Newcastle were always dogged defensively but were comprehensively battered in virtually every department. The tackle count was nothing short of wince-inducing from a very early stage, the possession stats almost as bad. By half-time the Falcons had already been forced to make 154 tackles to the Chiefs’ nine, with a mere 10 metres of ground gained. Halting Exeter’s momentum is every opposition team’s objective but, on days like this, it is easier said than done. The European champions, Leinster, are probably the only team to have outmuscled them in a big game at Sandy Park this season and even then Chiefs were slightly unlucky to lose. They have such depth these days that international quality forwards such as Matt Kvesic cannot even make the bench and local heroes such as Gareth Steenson and Ian Whitten are mere reserves. It provokes the question: how many more of them should be touring South Africa with England next month? Eddie Jones, as things stand, has decided he can do without Don Armand and Alec Hepburn; whatever the tactical reasons, it seems increasingly like a perverse stance. Dave Ewers and Mitch Lees add significant ballast to any pack and the day when Joe Simmonds joins his brother Sam in an England squad may not, on this evidence, be too far away. If any fly-half would have enjoyed such a luxurious armchair ride, Simmonds typifies Exeter’s continuing refusal to stand still. At the heart of their success, on top of the collective organisation, work-rate and positive intent, remains a determination to give opportunities to talented local lads who want it badly enough. The Chiefs may be high flyers these days but they will never abandon their roots. They are smartly coached, too, aware other teams are working hard on ways to stop their driven mauls and continuity game. There were, accordingly, some little variations to the usual theme, designed to keep the Falcons’ defence guessing. At one point the buzzing Nic White stood five metres off a scrum, collected Sam Simmonds’ pass from the base and slung it back to a charging Jack Nowell to explore the blindside. It did not work but it showed a telltale willingness to do something other than the obvious. Even when Newcastle did belatedly score a try, through Alex Tait late in the third quarter, the most enduring image was of Lachie Turner hurtling off the line to charge down Toby Flood’s conversion attempt. As a symbol of Exeter’s fitness and unflagging desire with the game already all but won it was hard to beat. If Tait was also guilty of the game’s biggest howler – dropping the ball in the act of touching down over the try-line with no one anywhere near him – the loudest roar was reserved for the spectacular late line-break by Thomas Waldrom, playing his final game in Devon before heading home. Had he finished it off himself, rather than sending Armand under the sticks, it would have been the perfect farewell flourish but there will be another chance at Twickenham next Saturday. Exeter’s footballers, as last year, will be at Wembley two days later for the League Two play-off final; the region’s sports fans now commute up to the smoke on an annual basis around this time of year. It will take a concerted Saracens roadblock to stop the Chiefs from defending their title."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/20/observer-view-on-abortion-donald-trump-gag-rule","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T05:00:49Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on the global threat to access to abortion |Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/observer-view-on-abortion-donald-trump-gag-rule","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/observer-view-on-abortion-donald-trump-gag-rule","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on the global threat to access to abortion","bodyText":"During his eight years in the White House, one of the themes President Obama frequently reflected on in speeches was the non-linear nature of social progress. “Progress doesn’t travel in a straight line,” he told Rutgers students in his commencement address in 2016. “It remains uneven and at times for every two steps forward, it feels like we take one step back.” Those words feel particularly apt in relation to women’s rights. In the last year, the #MeToo movement has seen women globally assert their right to live and work without the threat of sexual assault and harassment. But in the world’s wealthiest democracy, women’s reproductive rights are more imperilled than they have been in 30 years. Last Friday, President Trump’s administration confirmed it would be reviving the “gag rule”, introduced by Ronald Reagan in 1988 but rescinded by Bill Clinton before it was ever implemented. Under this rule, health clinics offering reproductive health services that either provide or refer women to abortion services are barred from receiving any federal funds. As it was during Reagan’s presidency, this rule will be subject to legal challenge. But if implemented, it would have the effect of further limiting women’s access to abortion in the US. While a woman’s right to abortion was established by the historic supreme court case Roe v Wade in 1973, in many states, access to abortion has been gradually chipped away by the introduction of restrictions on abortion clinics, such as insisting that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Hospitals often refuse doctors working at clinics these privileges; a doctor at the only remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi was refused admitting privileges at no fewer than seven hospitals. In this way, state legislators can make it virtually impossible for abortion clinics to exist. Trump’s intervention also follows several states introducing new limits on abortions that directly contravene Roe v Wade, in a deliberate attempt to get the supreme court, which now has a conservative majority, to reopen the issue. It comes after his reinstatement of an international version of the gag rule that bans any international health clinics providing or discussing abortion services with women from receiving US development funds. It is difficult to overstate what is at stake. Access to reliable contraception and safe abortion has unshackled women from the burdens of unwanted pregnancy. Women’s progress in the workplace and in society has been utterly reliant on the realisation of their reproductive rights. But 80,000 woman still die every year worldwide as a result of unsafe abortions, while more than a billion women live in countries where abortion is banned altogether unless her life is at risk. If abortion rights were set back three decades in the US, this would not only have appalling consequences for those American women denied a safe abortion as a result – it would also send a terrible moral signal to the rest of the world. Those who argue against abortion rights say they do so out of moral concern. Yet throughout history, women have sought abortions whether or not they are legal and whether or not they are safe. Abortion is no less common in countries where it is banned. Latin America is home to some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world, yet its abortion rate is higher than in Africa and Asia and more than double that in North America. What makes the difference is not whether abortion is legal, but whether women can access contraception. The only consequence of restricting access to abortion is that more women die as a result of seeking abortion in dangerous settings. Their deaths should be a blight on the conscience of all anti-abortion campaigners. It’s not just the US where women’s rights are at risk. Here in Europe, even as Ireland stands on the brink of a historic referendum on the legalisation of abortion, the rise of the far right in countries such as Poland represents a threat. There, the ruling Law and Justice party is pushing for further restrictions on abortion, which is already banned in most circumstances. Complacency in the UK would be misplaced. Our abortion law remains stuck in Victorian times: abortion is still a criminal offence and a woman is only permitted to have an abortion if two doctors confirm that continuing with the pregnancy poses a greater risk to her physical or mental health, or that of her existing children, than terminating it. This is demeaning, paternalistic and out of step with public opinion: 70% of the public believe a woman should be able to access an abortion if she does not want to proceed with the pregnancy. Women living in Northern Ireland have to travel to mainland Britain to access abortion and, until recently, had to pay. Our antiquated laws mean that women having a medical abortion have to take pills at a clinic that can perfectly safely be taken at home, then rush to get home, sometimes in severe pain, before they start to miscarry. Two steps forward, one step back. That step backwards causes pain and ruins lives. It’s not inevitable, but preventing it means never taking progress for granted or banking it and moving on. The fight for social change will never truly be over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/19/a-moment-in-history-royal-wedding-thrills-visitors-from-far-and-wide","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T15:51:43Z","webTitle":"‘A moment in history’: royal wedding enchants visitors from far and wide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/a-moment-in-history-royal-wedding-thrills-visitors-from-far-and-wide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/a-moment-in-history-royal-wedding-thrills-visitors-from-far-and-wide","fields":{"headline":"‘A moment in history’: royal wedding enchants visitors from far and wide","bodyText":"More than 100,000 people lined the streets of Windsor and the grounds of its famous castle to celebrate the wedding of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex. People had flown from across the world especially for the event. Many camped out on the streets of Windsor overnight in the hope of getting a glimpse of the royal family and the celebrity guests as they made their way to and from the chapel. There was a friendly and relaxed atmosphere among those waiting along the route. Jill Palmeter, from Novia Scotia, Canada, and Susan Thompson from California made friends while camping outside the castle grounds. When Thompson found out the wedding was to be in May, she was so determined to be at the front that she booked a hotel room for every weekend of the month and cancelled the others when the exact date was announced. She said: “I’m really into the royals and I watched William and Kate’s wedding back in California. But this time I decided I would really love to be there. “I’m so excited that the bride is American. The other reason is because I think when Diana died, it was a moment that defined a generation. Everyone remembers where they were when she died and a lot of people feel we should support William and Harry as they don’t have their mother any more.” Palmeter agreed: “It’s a moment in history.” Nearby, Thomas and Alan Defois, who arrived on Friday from Paris, had been eagerly awaiting their favourite royal – Harry – as well as the first glimpse of the bride’s dress. They slept on the street overnight to secure places at the front of the barrier near the castle’s Henry VIII gate. Alan, who works for the French government as a civil servant, admits he is the reason they came all the way from Paris for the wedding. He said: “About 15 years ago, I got a magazine all about the royals and have been a big fan since then. Harry is my favourite because he is the future of the monarchy.” “We have got a really good spot, which is good, as Alan is such a huge fan,” Thomas said. “There was a really good atmosphere here last night. Everyone is so friendly. There are people here from Italy, Belgium and Switzerland. It’s been great.” Inside the castle grounds, 2,640 members of the public had been invited by the couple to celebrate the special day and were able to hear the service via loudspeakers. There were guide leaders, magistrates, religious leaders, volunteers, teachers and staff from the royal households who waved flags and cheered as the sun blazed down on them. Although they were not offered food on site, a decision that raised eyebrows when it was announced, guests were handed gift bags with branded shortbread, a giant chocolate coin and a bottle of water. Most had brought their own picnics and said they were just grateful to have front-row seats. Raj Shamji from Walsall, who was invited in honour of his interfaith community work, attended with his wife and friends including Rena Annobil, a radio producer from London. They were particularly impressed by the service and how different it was from other royal weddings. Shamji said: “It was great that people from different communities were invited. I think it’s really nice that a local boy from Walsall who has done nothing particularly special, apart from some community work, has been invited for that reason. It’s really special and I think it shows the tone that Meghan and Harry wanted for their wedding. “I think they achieved that, especially with the parts of the ceremony where you heard songs from black America and the American pastor. It was fantastic.” Annibol said: “The service was a nice blend of American and British. It was very different from the royal family, I thought. I was surprised but really liked the sermon from the American preacher. I wasn’t expecting that kind of a sermon but I thought it was great to reflect Meghan’s dual-heritage culture.” Windsor locals Stephen Chapman and Judeline Nicholas were enjoying a drink in the sun opposite the chapel after the service ended. The couple were able to enter the grounds due to Chapman’s job with the Crown Estate, which runs and manages the land surrounding the castle. He described how the excitement had built in the run-up to the ceremony. “You could really feel it and the tension was rising on the estate. We have been working really hard getting the Long Mile ready and cutting foliage for use in the church and reception. We have been flat out, but it’s been really nice to see the end result.” Nicholas said Windsor was the ideal location for the wedding: “It couldn’t have been done anywhere else in the world. They got it absolutely perfect.” Meanwhile, in south-east London on the lawns of the National Maritime museum, Greenwich, beside the Queen’s House, crowds gathered to watch the royal wedding on a big screen. They had brought with them picnics and waved union flags. Among those in attendance was Nigel Wraxall, 45, alongside his wife and kids. His family was celebrating with another couple, who they went to university with, and their children. “We are from Greenwich, so we have not come far … I have come because it’s a great excuse for a celebration and it’s a wedding. It’s also a nice day and we’ve not had too many of those,” he said. His son, Joe, 11, added that he was excited. “I like the royals. I like the Queen. She’s impressive for a 90-year-old and you’ve got to be nice to her as she chops people’s heads off,” he said with a grin. Other people who came to celebrate include Michelle Flynn, 37, and Sherene Ward, 35, who were watching the royal wedding with a large group of friends and family. The group had brought with them an array of picnic items including strawberries, Victoria sponge, sausage rolls, jerk chicken, coleslaw and prosecco. “The wedding was a landmark moment. It’s like someone who is relatively normal has been accepted into an establishment that has been closed off for years … She is like the girl next door and she has gone through trials and tribulations, professionally and racially, and battled through it all to be part of the royal family,” said Flynn. Ward added that Meghan Markle’s dress was breathtaking. “It was quite mesmerising when she stepped out of the car,” she said. The pair said they were surprised that there was a gospel choir during the ceremony, adding that they had found some names on the guest list quite surprising. But, they added, the best part about the day was seeing two people who genuinely love each other get married. “This is the other thing: they genuinely seem to be in love. It’s a marriage not of convenience, but just a marriage of love. I think that’s nice and I hope us as a general public give them the privacy they need to engage in life and enjoy the future,” Flynn said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/19/perfect-wedding-dress-for-a-californian-royal-clare-waight-keller-givenchy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T15:16:25Z","webTitle":"'A long, cool glass of water': the perfect wedding dress for a Californian royal | Jess Cartner-Morley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/perfect-wedding-dress-for-a-californian-royal-clare-waight-keller-givenchy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/perfect-wedding-dress-for-a-californian-royal-clare-waight-keller-givenchy","fields":{"headline":"'A long, cool glass of water': Meghan Markle's wedding dress was perfect for a Californian royal","bodyText":"The dress of the year turned out to be beautifully simple. Clare Waight Keller, who in 2017 became the first female artistic designer to lead the historic house of Givenchy, created a haute couture dress of clean lines and timeless elegance, with minimal adornment on snowy silk. The spectacular gown – whose secret was successfully kept – marks a huge moment for 47-year-old Waight Keller, who helmed Chloé and Pringle before joining Givenchy. Her Paris fashion week collections for Givenchy have won praise for their modern glamour, but this commission will catapult her name to a new level. The design recalled Hubert de Givenchy’s most famous client, Audrey Hepburn, with a bateau neckline similar to the wedding dress worn by the actor in the 1957 film Funny Face, for which Givenchy made the wardrobe. After the chaos of the days leading up to the ceremony, the dress turned out to be one element of the narrative over which the wedding party had retained smooth control. Waight Keller’s name was barely mentioned among the runners and riders in the rumour mill. For fashion observers who had been led to expect a gown by Ralph &amp; Russo, known for their lavishly decorated, crystal-bedecked gowns, this pure white dress looked like a long, cool glass of water. By choosing a British woman to make her dress, the Duchess of Sussex followed in the footsteps of her sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge, whose 2011 gown was designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen. Formal and demure but with crisp, unfussy lines, the dress seemed nicely weighted between the demands of a royal wedding and the personality of a Californian-born, independent-spirited bride, who looked not only radiantly happy, but cheeringly comfortable. The dress, refreshingly, did not appear to be corseted to within an inch of its life, and the wedding up-do was just a dressier version of Markle’s trademark messy bun. For an American audience whose impression of what the British aristocracy look like has been shaped by Downton Abbey, this dress had the required glamour. The diamond bandeau tiara was Queen Mary’s, but had a touch of Wonder Woman about it. For a woman who is being framed as both princess and feminist icon, it was the perfect finishing touch. Message-wise, it was left to the veil to do the heavy lifting. The bride, who intends to make the Commonwealth the focus of her official role, asked to have all member states represented. Waight Keller researched the national flora of each country, and embroidered 55 flowers into the silk tulle – from the African violet of Tanzania to the Solomon Island’s hibiscus – as well as Wintersweet, which grows in the garden of the couple’s Nottingham Cottage home, and the California poppy to represent her place of birth. There was more storytelling in the bouquet. Prince Harry picked white flowers from the couple’s garden on Friday to mix with sweet peas and lily of the valley, and forget-me-nots, which were the favourite flower of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.

Rowett is highly regarded at Stoke and was a strong contender for the manager’s job four months ago, after Mark Hughes was sacked. Stoke, however, were left frustrated on that occasion and turned to Paul Lambert, who was unable to steer the club away from relegation, winning only two of his 15 matches, which prompted the Stoke board to let him leave on Friday. Stoke are determined to return to the Premier League at the first time of asking and Rowett, who knows the Championship well, could be trusted with the task of delivering promotion. The 44-year-old impressed during his time as Birmingham City manager and he led Derby County into the play-offs this season. He signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with the club in January but is now keen to move away from the iPro Stadium. “Derby County can confirm that Gary Rowett has asked for permission to speak with Stoke City regarding the vacant manager’s position at the bet365 Stadium,” read a Derby statement. “The club is now in discussion with Stoke and will update our supporters in due course.” Stoke would have to pay sizeable compensation for Rowett, who started his managerial career with Burton Albion, and it remains to be seen how hard Derby would try to keep him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/23/chelsea-flower-show-eight-ideas-for-home","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T10:30:20Z","webTitle":"Chelsea flower show: eight great ideas to steal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/23/chelsea-flower-show-eight-ideas-for-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/23/chelsea-flower-show-eight-ideas-for-home","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea flower show: eight great ideas to steal","bodyText":"1 If you take home one slice of Chelsea, make it this: spurges, AKA euphorbias, are the unsung heroes of the sunny border – unfussy to the point of thriving on neglect, coping with droughts and providing long-lasting acid-green flowers that are the perfect foil for more ephemeral spring delights such as tulips and irises. I was particularly drawn to the compact evergreen cultivar Euphorbia ‘Black Pearl’ in Chris Beardshaw’s Morgan Stanley garden, although I also spotted architectural caper spurge (E. lathyris, often maligned as a weed), bright-yellow-flowered Wallich spurge (E. wallichii) and lime-yellow cushion spurge (E. epithymoides) all over the showground. 2 Fancy giving room to the prehistoric-looking black-ribbed stalks of scouring rush (Equisetum hyemale), which popped up in a couple of Chelsea gardens this year? Don’t be put off because it’s a relative of the horribly invasive weed horsetail: this is a brilliant low-maintenance architectural plant that loves swampy spots and pond edges. It was shown off to good effect in Nic Howard’s garden, set against a simple charcoal-grey wall and softened with Mexican fleabane (Erigeron karvinskianus). Stuart Towner paired it with Hosta ‘Devon Green’, Japanese forest grass (Hakonechloa macra), Gunnera magellanica and European wild ginger (Asarum europaeum). Scouring rush will spread relentlessly if given free rein, so contain it in a trough or water feature. 3 If you are looking for low-maintenance, low-cost alternatives to paving your front garden, gravel has much to recommend it, and at this year’s Chelsea several gardens took this theme in different directions. Sarah Price showed how to use a Mediterranean plant palette with the papery pink flowers of the Cretan rockrose (Cistus creticus) and the vivid red flower clusters of the blood pink (Dianthus cruentus). Gravel’s also a good mulch for shade planting: see Nic Howard’s row of the huge (and thankfully slug-resistant) leaves of Hosta ‘Sum and Substance’ planted in gravel along a narrow bed that would work perfectly in a gloomy side return. 4 If I was in any doubt about the rise of the houseplant, the visitors swarming over the displays of cacti, succulents and orchids in the Great Pavilion were proof of their staying power. It’s not only because these plants are so Instagrammable – Popsy the Cactus from Craig House Cacti is now so popular she has her own Twitter account – but because for many of us without much outside space, an air plant or two is a far more realistic prospect. A collaboration between Ikea and Indoor Garden Design offers clever ways to display plants indoors, from space-saving hanging planters to planters on peg boards. You’ll see houseplants creeping into show gardens, too, from the blue chalksticks succulent (Senecio serpens) in Sarah Price’s garden to the cast-iron plants (Aspidistra elatior) dotted through Stuart Towner’s garden. 5 Want garden furniture that will never require repainting and doesn’t need covering in winter? What about a slab of rock? Jo Thompson’s show garden for Wedgwood shows how it’s done, with flat-topped chunks of York stone serving as chair or table or both; simply add a comfy cushion or blanket. Just make sure you think carefully about where to position them, as you won’t be able to move them easily. If you’re more of a wood type, take the lead from Nic Howard, whose garden seats are simple cubes of oak, charred and shaped to make the perfect resting spot. 6 If summer bedding leaves you cold, try planting up containers with succulents instead. The Pearlfisher garden cleverly employed echeverias, kalanchoes, sedums, crassulas and the like to mimic an underwater scene, while communicating its message about the perils of marine plastic pollution. The key to success is a very free-draining growing medium (use cactus and succulent compost, and choose a pot with plenty of holes in the bottom) and the sunniest spot you can muster. Remember to bring them inside to a frost-free place once summer starts to fade. 7 It may be the flower show, but some gardens demonstrated that big and bold foliage can offer as much impact. Stuart Towner’s Spirit of Cornwall garden is a masterclass in combining different shapes and textures to create a big-leaved border, using the palmate-leaved false castor oil plant (Fatsia japonica), the pleated leaves of rodgersias and the huge corrugated leaves of Chilean rhubarb (Gunnera manicata). If you want a really unusual bold-leaved foliage shrub for your garden, get your hands on a spikenard (Aralia cordata), as shown off by Tom Stuart-Smith in his Weston garden in the Great Pavilion. 8 Bare concrete in a garden is usually shorthand for something ugly and municipal, but this year’s Chelsea shows how to use this material in an inspired way, from the concrete cubes that break up frothy planting in Robert Barker’s Skin Deep conceptual garden to Stuart Towner’s simple oval concrete patio in his Spirit of Cornwall garden. Just make sure the lines are clean, the finish professional and the planting abundant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/22/texas-primary-laura-moser-runoff-democrats-progressives-moderates","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T10:00:53Z","webTitle":"Democratic divide: Texas runoff sets up battle between progressives and moderates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/22/texas-primary-laura-moser-runoff-democrats-progressives-moderates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/22/texas-primary-laura-moser-runoff-democrats-progressives-moderates","fields":{"headline":"Democratic divide: Texas runoff sets up battle between progressives and moderates","bodyText":"In Texas’ 21st congressional district, walking from street to street, knocking on doors and asking for votes is not as straightforward as it sounds. The district covers parts of the state’s liberal heartland in central Austin, dips down to the north-eastern suburbs of San Antonio and protracts about 200 miles west into remote and ultra-conservative cowboy country. The district’s shape is so contorted by gerrymandering that when Mary Wilson canvasses in urban areas of Austin and San Antonio, she sometimes has to get out a map to check which side of the boundary she’s on. But there is another dividing line, next to which Wilson stands on the left: a Democratic divide between progressives and moderates that will be closely watched on Tuesday, as Texas holds party runoff elections ahead of November’s midterms. Democrats need to flip 23 seats to take control of the House and were it not for the way Austin is carved up, the 21st would be a likely victory rather than an intriguing outside bet. The city is covered by six districts that extend far out into conservative strongholds, diluting the influence of Travis County, where Hillary Clinton won 66% of the vote in 2016. Austin residents comprise a minority of each district’s population; five of the six are in Republican hands. In a year when the Democratic base is highly energised and the 21st’s Republican incumbent, Lamar Smith, is retiring, the district is a test case for whether Democratic prospects are best served by a candidate who can inspire exceptional turnout from liberals or one that could woo moderate crossover Republicans, disturbed by the party’s direction under Donald Trump. Wilson, a minister and former math teacher, believes that the Washington establishment, in the form of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), favours her runoff rival, Joseph Kopser, a decorated army veteran and entrepreneur with endorsements from a number of party figures. The DCCC has not officially endorsed a candidate in the race. “How did I, this lifelong Democrat, become that ‘anti-establishment’ candidate?” she asked. “Well, I became that because the DCCC decided they liked my opponent’s story, they thought somehow he can win, and lo and behold he [raised] nearly $800,000 on a primary and came in second and didn’t even break 30% of the vote. “I don’t know why then we should consider him to be the most viable candidate to win in November when he couldn’t win in March with every advantage. It just doesn’t make any sense to me. I think quite frankly what that really points to is what the voters want is something different than what the DCCC has picked.” Despite being a virtual unknown who raised only $40,000, Wilson finished ahead of Kopser in the primary. “I think that we are in an election cycle in the United States right now where voters want more female voices,” she said. “Being a progressive-minded person, social justice advocate – and being a female social justice advocate – really fits the tenor of the mood in the country right now.” If Wilson wins on Tuesday her path to victory in November will require a high turnout in Austin and San Antonio. Kopser believes he can persuade substantial numbers of Republicans to cross sides in a district represented for three decades by Smith, a notorious climate science sceptic and favourite of the fossil fuel industry who is chairman of the House science, space and technology committee. “You have two candidates, Mary and I, who line up very nicely on all the progressive issues we’ve been fighting for as a community for so long,” Kopser said, “whether rights of women, rights of immigrants, rights of workers, rights of the working middle class, protecting the environment, doing all of it. The only difference is we just have a very different set of backgrounds.” His campaign, he argues, can “build a bridge of those independents and ‘orphaned’ Republicans, build a bridge of trust for them to know that we can give them the top cover they need to come over and vote for a Democrat”. ‘Unify the vote’ A similar battle is taking place to the east in the seventh congressional district, which covers some of the wealthiest parts of Houston. Home to Ted Cruz and George H W Bush, it first attracted national attention as a traditionally Republican area that could be ripe for a surprise result. Then, in February, the DCCC released opposition research designed to discredit Laura Moser, fearing the anti-Trump activist and writer is too leftwing to stand a chance in November. The moved seemed to backfire by galvanising her campaign, which enjoyed a fundraising boost. With no candidate securing a majority of the vote, Moser forced a runoff by finishing second in the primary to Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a business attorney who has been endorsed by Emily’s List, an influential group that works to elect pro-abortion rights Democratic female candidates. Moser’s campaign held a barbecue and rally in a Houston park on Sunday afternoon, with a “unify the vote” theme. “Lizzie’s more centrist, moderate, middle of the road,” said Joshua Butler, who finished sixth in the Democratic primary and is now backing Moser. “Laura does have a little bit more of a left-leaning approach but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. At this stage right now we’ve got to have new ideas and different ways of getting things accomplished.” The park is in a neighbourhood known as the energy corridor, home to many conservative-leaning white-collar oil and gas industry employees. “This part of the district is not as Republican as the Republicans think, but we just have to engage new voters out here,” Moser said. “I think this is a year where we really need politicians who are committed to changing the way we do business in Washington, who won’t just be like a safe vote, who won’t adhere to the status quo because it’s just not really working.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/22/dundee-on-lonely-planet-best-in-europe-hotlist-2018-emilia-romagna-cantabria","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T05:30:46Z","webTitle":"'Dynamic' Dundee earns place on Lonely Planet's Best in Europe 2018 hotlist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/22/dundee-on-lonely-planet-best-in-europe-hotlist-2018-emilia-romagna-cantabria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/22/dundee-on-lonely-planet-best-in-europe-hotlist-2018-emilia-romagna-cantabria","fields":{"headline":"'Dynamic' Dundee earns place on Lonely Planet's Best in Europe 2018 hotlist","bodyText":"The “thriving, creative” city of Dundee has been rated as one of the best places in Europe to visit this year by Lonely Planet.

It earned the spot for its “head-turning” urban redevelopment, including the transformation of its historic waterfront and the opening of a new branch of the V&amp;A this September . Lonely Planet describes it as an “exciting moment” for a city that has often been overlooked by visitors to Scotland, and praised its “nationally important museums and attractions” and “dynamic, creative spirit”. The number one spot went to Emilia-Romagna in Italy. The region was picked out as an alternative to Tuscany, Campania and Veneto, and for its emergence as one of the best foodie spots in the country. Emilia-Romagna is the home of ragù, Parma ham, balsamic vinegar and Parmesan cheese. Recently Bologna, the regional capital, saw the opening of the world’s largest culinary theme park, Fico Eataly, where visitors can sample all manner of local cuisine. Other picks on the list included the wild beaches, mountains and “enchanted” villages of Cantabria, Spain (a far cry from the overcrowded attractions of Barcelona and the Costa del Sol); and Kosovo, which boasts “dramatic hiking trails, Ottoman-era history and a growing cultural scene”. “There is growing concern over the increase in tourism to popular European destinations, particularly over the busy summer months, so with this list we wanted to show that there are a wealth of incredible alternatives to discover across Europe,” said Lonely Planet editorial director, Tom Hall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2018/may/21/lear-review-shakespeare-valda-setterfield-queen-elizabeth-hall-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T14:00:27Z","webTitle":"Lear review – Shakespeare epic becomes howling hour of whimsy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/21/lear-review-shakespeare-valda-setterfield-queen-elizabeth-hall-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/may/21/lear-review-shakespeare-valda-setterfield-queen-elizabeth-hall-london","fields":{"headline":"Lear review – Shakespeare epic becomes howling hour of whimsy","bodyText":"Anyone who has done time watching a theatrical knight bellow his way through King Lear may relish this 60-minute dance distillation. It’s slimmed to four, gender-switched performers – the ageing monarch is played by Valda Setterfield, doyenne of the New York dance scene, with three men as her wayward daughters. A paper crown on her head, silver rings on her fingers, Setterfield gazes out with her mournful dromedary profile. Courtly hands swim in the air, then seem frantically to beat away the noise of the world – head of a family, of a kingdom, she has less control than she hopes. John Scott’s production is a telescoped tumble through Lear’s tragedy. Setterfield scatters sweets to placate her competitive offspring and howls at the storm as sheets of paper printed with scraps of Shakespeare swirl around her. In between, she phones an unseen, neglectful child. “We miss you,” she implores. “Do you need money? The dog misses you.” Some flourishes would gee up a conventional production – especially a Cordelia (French dancer Kevin Coquelard) who is no willowy ingenue but rants “Stupid Lear!” before departing the stage in a snit while singing a Piaf number. But I’m not sure how much this gravely whimsical collage of movement and text illuminates King Lear – more interesting is how Shakespeare’s tragedy rethinks the dependency of ageing. The production closed the Southbank’s (B)old festival, featuring work by older artists; Setterfield, who has performed with everyone from Merce Cunningham to Woody Allen, is 83. As parent and children boss about and harry each other, make and resist intemperate demands, it reminds us that each socially isolated, memory-blurred senior retains an emotional life as rich and searing as Lear’s own."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/21/lazios-late-implosion-against-inter-could-haunt-the-club-for-years-to-come","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T10:12:29Z","webTitle":"Lazio's late implosion against Inter could haunt the club for years to come | Paolo Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/21/lazios-late-implosion-against-inter-could-haunt-the-club-for-years-to-come","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/21/lazios-late-implosion-against-inter-could-haunt-the-club-for-years-to-come","fields":{"headline":"Lazio's late implosion against Inter could haunt the club for years to come","bodyText":"Stefan De Vrij folded himself up small and hid his face underneath a training top, but he could not stop the cameras from honing in on him as he sat for the final time in Lazio’s home dugout. The curtain was coming down on the 2017-18 Serie A season, and the team whose shirt he was still wearing had just lost its Champions League spot to the one he will play for next year. A messy situation under any circumstances, but even more so for how events unfolded. Lazio had led 2-1 with 12 minutes remaining against Inter, in a game they only needed to draw. That was before De Vrij gave away a penalty, scything down Mauro Icardi. The Argentinian converted, and the Nerazzurri went on to win 3-2. Of course, there was more to it than that. Between Inter’s goals, Senad Lulić got himself sent off for a needless second yellow. Even before the penalty, Lazio’s manager, Simone Inzaghi, had ceded the initiative by taking off lone striker, Ciro Immobile, and sending on a full-back, Jordan Lukaku. There were echoes here of Inter’s collapse at home to Juventus last month. We might also point out that De Vrij was forced into his desperate challenge as a result of team-mates’ mistakes. Éder was granted too much space as he played a ball over the top to Icardi, whose run should have been tracked by Bastos. Thomas Strakosha could have been out quicker to close the angle too, but instead De Vrij was left scrambling. He might have been better served by keeping his feet, but would critics have been mollified if doing so had allowed Icardi to breeze past and bury a shot from open play? De Vrij, solid otherwise, was caught making a split-second decision for which there might not have been a right answer. The greater question is whether he ought to have been on the pitch in the first place. Then again, the dilemma facing Inzaghi was hardly straightforward. Lazio were without two key men – Luis Alberto and Marco Parolo have combined for 15 goals and 20 assists, before we even get into their broader contribution – and with Immobile only just back from injury. To deprive himself of De Vrij, his best centre-back, on top of that could hardly be done lightly. Inzaghi’s comments at the start of the week suggested he was considering his alternatives. It was only after a reported meeting between the defender and a group of the team’s ‘senators’ – senior players including Immobile, Parolo, Lulić, Lucas Leiva, and Ştefan Radu – that the final decision was made. The manager might also have considered how De Vrij saved Lazio from a potential defeat in their previous game, against Crotone, with a goal-line clearance. He refused to throw De Vrij under the bus, reminding reporters his team had opportunities to seal the deal sooner. Fourth place was theirs to lose after Inter lost at home to Sassuolo. If Lazio had just beaten Crotone – themselves relegated this weekend –Sunday’s match would have been a dead rubber. Instead, it is an occasion that may haunt this club for years to come. This has been an exceptional campaign for Lazio, whose 89 goals scored were both a club record and the most in Serie A. Inzaghi’s team also beat Juventus to the Supercoppa,reached the Coppa Italia semis as well as the quarter-finals of the Europa League. None of this was expected of a team whose budgetlags behind Inter, Juventus, Roma, Milan and Napoli. Credit is due to Inzaghi for forging a clear identity – that of a side who relinquish possession in favour of devastatingly direct counters – and sporting director Igli Tare, for building a squad so deep that Felipe Anderson, scorer of his team’s second goal on Sunday, can no longer hold down a regular starting spot. Lazio have, in Inzaghi’s words, “come one centimetre away from everything”. They exited the Coppa Italia on penalties, and the Europa League after blowing a three-goal aggregate lead in Salzburg – conceding three in five second-half minutes. Even in Serie A, they still finished levelwith Inter, behind them only by virtue of head-to-head results. Not that the Nerazzurri will feel much sympathy. The Stadio Olimpico will forever be the ground where they lost a title on 5 May 2002, with Lazio twice coming from behind to win 4-2 despite having nothing to play for on what was the final weekend. Inter, who began that day in first place, were overtaken by Juventus and Roma. Their fans, nevertheless, have a long-standing gemellaggio (twinning) with Lazio’s, which permitted a convivial atmosphere on Sunday. The number of Inter supporters attending the game was estimated at between 12,000-15,000. They celebrated long into the night, and will no doubt carry on into the summer. Inter have not played in the Champions League since 2011-12. To return to that competition is a critical element of the business plan drawn up by their Suning ownership group and might also have been the difference between hanging on to Icardi – who finished level with Immobile as Serie A’s top scorer on 29 – or seeing him depart. “Finally, all these goals are worth something,” said Icardi. He has scored 100 in five league seasons with Inter. Asked about De Vrij, he dismissed any suggestions of a conspiracy: “I don’t think he did it on purpose. Every professional tries to do things to the best of their ability, so if something like this happens it’s just fate.” Not everyone in Rome was feeling so generous, though De Vrij’s late substitution did not bring down the universal cacophony of jeers some might have expected. He has been a committed servant and key figure for Lazio these last four years. And now, in part thanks to his own foul, he is off to play in the Champions League for someone else. Talking points • Some way to sign off for Milan, who thrashed Fiorentina 5-1 to tie down sixth and spare themselves Europa League qualifying in July. It also guaranteed that Atalanta return to Europe, despite losing to Cagliari. • Crotone were unable to repeat last season’s great escape, losing 2-1 to Napoli. Walter Zenga appeared legitimately crushed, describing himself as “dead” and lamenting with understandable bitterness how direct rivals had put together runs of two or three wins at the end. • As for Napoli, victory meant they become the first team to break the 90-point barrier and not win a Scudetto. Whether Maurizio Sarri will still be in charge next season remains to be seen. The manager said he still needs to speak to his family, but owner Aurelio De Laurentiis indicated there was no more time for stalling. • And finally, farewell to Gigi Buffon – for Serie A, at least. There’s no way I could say everything that needs to be said in the few words left to me here, but this league will not be the same without the greatest keeper I’ve had the privilege to watch. Here’s hoping the next adventure proves as eventful and entertaining as the past 23 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/may/21/untranslatable-world-idioms-quiz-man-booker-international","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T12:06:20Z","webTitle":"'You're getting on my biscuits': can you translate these world idioms? – quiz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/21/untranslatable-world-idioms-quiz-man-booker-international","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/21/untranslatable-world-idioms-quiz-man-booker-international","fields":{"headline":"'You're getting on my biscuits': can you translate these world idioms? – quiz","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/may/21/ryanair-hand-luggage-airline-strikes-profits-michael-oleary","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T08:28:53Z","webTitle":"Ryanair: rising number of bags at gate may prompt review of rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/21/ryanair-hand-luggage-airline-strikes-profits-michael-oleary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/21/ryanair-hand-luggage-airline-strikes-profits-michael-oleary","fields":{"headline":"Ryanair: rising number of bags at gate may prompt review of rules","bodyText":"The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has said the airline may have to review its new luggage policy if large numbers of passengers continue to hand over their bags at the gate. Ryanair has introduced a stricter cabin bag policy, which means customers have to pay £5 for priority boarding to avoid having their main cabin bag checked in to the hold at the departure gate. This has improved boarding and punctuality, the airline said, but O’Leary added that “it is creating a handling issue, especially at peak periods” such as bank holiday weekends and during the summer. “There are many flights where we’re now having to put 100 or 120 gate bags free of charge into the hold,” O’Leary said in a video presentation. “If that continues to build, it’s something we may have to look at again.” Ryanair’s net profit rose 10% to €1.45bn (£1.27bn) in the year to the end of March, despite a rota fiasco that led to pilot shortages and 10,000 flight cancellations. This forced the budget carrier to recognise unions and raise pay. However, O’Leary warned of a fall in profits this year, saying the outlook was “on the pessimistic side of cautious”. He said there could be strikes in some countries over Ryanair’s discussions to recognise trade unions, but the airline would face any action down. The company warned profits would fall back to €1.25bn to €1.35bn in the current year, a decline of up to 14%, due to rising oil prices and nearly €200m of extra staff costs. O’Leary said air fares were likely to be flat over the coming year, as it takes about 12 months for changes in fuel prices to feed through to fares. He added that he believed airlines that had not hedged oil prices, such as Norwegian, would struggle next winter and that this would “accelerate the shakeout” in the industry, with some carriers going bust. Ryanair averted widespread Christmas strikes by unilaterally recognising unions in December for the first time in its 32-year history, but it has struggled to formalise relations in some countries. “Being unionised means we will have occasional strikes,” O’Leary said. Ryanair repeated its warnings about the risk of a hard Brexit, and said it would scrap voting rights for non-EU shareholders if there was no transition agreement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/prize/27525","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T23:00:02Z","webTitle":"Prize crossword No 27,525","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/27525","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/prize/27525","fields":{"headline":"Prize crossword No 27,525","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/may/21/ed-sheeran-kendrick-lamar-2018-billboard-music-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T09:15:29Z","webTitle":"Ed Sheeran and Kendrick Lamar top 2018 Billboard awards with six wins each","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/21/ed-sheeran-kendrick-lamar-2018-billboard-music-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/21/ed-sheeran-kendrick-lamar-2018-billboard-music-awards","fields":{"headline":"Ed Sheeran and Kendrick Lamar top 2018 Billboard awards with six wins each","bodyText":"Ed Sheeran and Kendrick Lamar were the biggest winners at the 2018 Billboard music awards, with six wins each. Sheeran triumphed in some of the most prestigious categories including top artist and top male artist, while Lamar won three rap award categories – rap artist, male rap artist and rap album – plus two song streaming awards after the huge success of his single Humble. Unlike the Grammy or Brit awards, which are voted for by other musicians and industry figures, the Billboard awards are based on popularity: the wins and nominations are determined on a number of measures, including sales, airplay, and social media interaction. Taylor Swift won two big awards: top female artist, and top-selling album for Reputation. Rock group Imagine Dragons picked up four awards, while dance duo the Chainsmokers scored three. They dedicated their top dance/electronic act award to fellow nominee Avicii, the Swedish EDM producer and DJ who killed himself earlier this year. “He is someone who made us believe that this is something we could do with our lives,” Drew Taggart said. “Inspired all of us. Influenced our music and influenced pop music in general. He will be missed and I hope he’s found peace.” The pair led a separate tribute to him with their guest vocalist Halsey, who said: “It’s a reminder to all of us to be there and support and love our friends and family members who may be struggling with mental illness.” Another notable speech came from Janet Jackson, who alluded to the #MeToo movement as she accepted her Icon award: “I believe that for all the challenges, for all our challenges, we live at a glorious moment in history. It’s a moment when at long last women have made it clear that we will no longer be controlled, manipulated, or abused. I stand with those women and with those men equally outraged by discrimination who support us in heart or mind.” Presenter Kelly Clarkson, who opened the show with a medley of cover versions, said in her opening monologue that the organisers had asked her to lead a minute of silence in memory of the 10 people killed in the Santa Fe high school shooting on 18 May, but she refused. “Once again, y’all, we’re grieving for more kids that have died for just no reason at all,” she said. “I’m so sick of moments of silence! It’s not working! So why don’t we not do a moment of silence, why don’t we do a moment of action, a moment of change.” Teen pop-R&amp;B star Khalid, who won the top new artist award, performed with Shawn Mendes and the choir from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a shooting incident in February. Other performers at the Las Vegas ceremony included Jennifer Lopez, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Christina Aguilera and K-pop boyband BTS."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2018/may/21/the-job-increase-is-less-inspiring-than-the-government-would-like-you-to-believe","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T18:00:32Z","webTitle":"The job increase is less inspiring than the government would like you to believe | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/21/the-job-increase-is-less-inspiring-than-the-government-would-like-you-to-believe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/21/the-job-increase-is-less-inspiring-than-the-government-would-like-you-to-believe","fields":{"headline":"The job increase is less inspiring than the government would like you to believe","bodyText":"Last week came the news that 1m jobs had been created since September 2013, and while it is an achievement that has seen the government crow loudly, a look at the data suggests that population growth and part-time work has been the main driver. It indicates that the achievement is rather less boast-worthy than the government would suggest. Back at the end of 2012, Tony Abbott pledged to create 1m jobs in five years and 2m in 10 years. Last month marked more than 1 million more people employed since the 2013 election in September that year – meaning the government have beaten it by five months. This was a bit of a surprise, not because this is a stunning achievement, but because even a year ago it looked unlikely. In May last year, the government was 16,000 jobs down on what they needed to be on track for 1m jobs in five years, and an annual employment growth rate of 1.8% was needed – but the 2017-18 budget was only forecasting growth of 1.5%. The past year has seen such strong employment growth that the target was reached with time to spare: But how significant is the achievement and how has it been achieved? Back when Tony Abbott made the pledge in late 2012, I wrote that “while a million jobs sounds wonderful in a sound-bite kind of way, the reality is that achieving a million jobs over the next five years is easier than it was in 2001-2006, let alone in the mid-1980s. Clearly, Australia’s population continues to grow and thus a million new jobs ain’t what it used to be.” And this has very much turned out to be the case. One million jobs in five years is not an unprecedented number. It had happened in the late 1980s and during the mining boom from 2006 to 2011: Of course the target is a tad easier now than then. In early 1988 when 1m jobs in five years was first achieved, we had a population above 15 years of age of around 12.7 million. At the end of 2005 when it was next achieved, the population was up to 16.3 million. Now it is around 20 million. It’s why the better measure of looking at employment has always been the employment to population ratio – as that takes into account population growth – whether it be natural or migration. And here things are rather unimpressive. In September 2013, 61.1% of the adult population was employed, now it is 62%. That 0.9% point increase is welcomed but hardly stunning – and certainly not over a five year period. Consider that when 1m jobs were created from December 2000 to December 2005, the employment to population ratio rose from 59.1% to 62.1%. Even more damming is that since September 2013 the percentage of adults employed full-time has actually fallen. At the time of the 2013 election, 43% of adults worked full-time, now it is just 42.4%. That is a fairly clear representation of how uninspiring is the 1m jobs boast. Part-time employment makes up 31% of all employed, but it accounted for 47% of the 1m jobs created. Even more divergent is the growth of full-time work for men – 43% of all employed are full-time men, but they accounted for just 25% of the 1m jobs: This over-representation of part-time work among the employment growth has also led to a rather small growth in the average number of hours worked per capita since September 2013. Back in September 2013 adults worked an average of 86.1 hours a month (this includes all adults, even those not in the labour market), now it is up to 86.7 hours – the highest level for five years, but still a rather weak level of growth given the overall increase in employment: The big story however of the 1m jobs is not so much population or even part-time work, but female workers. The growth of women in the labour force has been rather stunning. In September 2013, the participation rate of women was 58.6%; now it is 60.7%. By contrast the participation rate of men has fallen from 71.2% to 70.8%. And yet more than half of the increase in women’s participation has occurred just in the past 12 months: Had the surge in women entering the workforce not occurred, the 1m jobs pledge would still be waiting to be achieved and would be unlikely to come true. It took 41 months to get half way to the 1m total, and just 15 months to get the rest of the way – and 55% of the employment created in the past 15 months has been for female workers. And as I have noted previously, the NDIS and other health care and social assistance work has been the main driver of that surge. Once again showing that, despite the Liberal party’s protestation of the contrary, yes, governments can create jobs. There has also been a strong growth in employment of people over 65 – up 33% since September 2013. Such workers also accounted for an oversized share of the 1m jobs – around 13%, despite accounting for just over 4% of the total workforce: The addition of 1m jobs in under five years is something that the government will boast about, but it is pretty clear the large part of the increase is due to population increase and also a major increase in government funding for the NDIS which has created a surge in work in the healthcare sector. The small increase in the percentage of the population employed compared to previous periods where 1m jobs had been created in five years demonstrates the mark was hardly shooting for the stars. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27523","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T23:00:04Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,523","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27523","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27523","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,523","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27520","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T23:00:37Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,520","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27520","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27520","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,520","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/21/hat-looks-good-slug-birth-rates-us-falling-reasons-why-family-policies","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T14:45:11Z","webTitle":"Of course US birth rates are falling – this is a harsh place to have a family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/21/hat-looks-good-slug-birth-rates-us-falling-reasons-why-family-policies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/21/hat-looks-good-slug-birth-rates-us-falling-reasons-why-family-policies","fields":{"headline":"Of course US birth rates are falling – this is a harsh place to have a family","bodyText":"America’s birth rate has fallen to a 30-year low, let the hand-wringing and finger-pointing begin. It’s those selfish women, wanting careers before kids! Or, gasp, not wanting kids at all! It’s all those abortions! It’s Obama’s fault! The reality is, for all its pro-family rhetoric, the US is a remarkably harsh place for families, and particularly for mothers. It’s a well-known fact, but one that bears repeating in this context, that the US is one of only four countries in the world with no government-subsidized maternity leave. The other three are Lesotho, Swaziland, and Papua New Guinea, countries that the US doesn’t tend to view as its peer group. This fact is met with shrugs from those who assume that companies provide maternity leave. Only 56% do, and of those, just 6% offer full pay during maternity leave. This assumption also ignores the fact that 36% of the American workforce, a number expected to surpass 50% in the next 10 years, are contract laborers with no access to such benefits. That gig economy you keep hearing so much about, with its flexible schedule and independence? Yeah, it sucks for mothers. That doesn’t stop companies and pundits from pushing it as a great way for working moms to balance children and career. As a gig-economy mother myself, I can tell you exactly how great and balanced it felt to go back to work two hours after giving birth. If they return to work, mothers can look forward to an increasingly large pay gap for every child they have, plus fewer promotions. Who could resist? The option for one parent to stay home with kids is increasingly not economically viable for American families, either. A data point that got far less attention than the falling birth rate was released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics last month: 71.1% of American mothers with children under 18 are in the workforce now. It’s not just because they want to be (not that there’s anything wrong with that), but increasingly because they have to be in order to support the family. Think millennials are our problem, shirking their breeding responsibilities because they’re too busy taking selfies? Show me your all-time low birth rate and I will raise you an all-time high student debt load (it hit $1.4tn this year). Millennials have an average of $37,172 in student loans when they graduate, a fact that has been blamed for their record-breakingly low home ownership. Generation Z won’t be much help either, given that about 40% of them are expected to default on their college loans when they can’t find jobs, according to Brookings. Let’s see, what else is at an all-time high? Credit card debt. It hit $1tn in the US for the first time this year. Childcare costs are another record-breaker. According to the Economic Policy Institute, in 33 states and the District of Columbia, infant care costs exceed the average cost of in-state college tuition at public four-year institutions. The few companies that offer discounted, on-site daycare have found that it more than pays for itself in tax breaks and retention and recruitment boosts, but it’s still rare. In the Fortune 100, only 17 offer any sort of on-site daycare. The US has flirted with the idea of subsidized daycare a few times, but a longstanding cultural notion that there is something inherently shady about daycare has kept us from ever really doing it, except during the second world war when we needed women to work. Perhaps if the birth rate gets low enough, we can get over our collective daycare aversion. Guess what else is at an all-time low? Pay raises. Despite economic growth, since the 1970s, the hourly inflation-adjusted wages received by the typical American worker have grown only 0.2% per year. Which is basically nothing. Guess what though? Worker productivity hit a three-year high in 2017. In the midst of the harsh economic reality facing parents and would-be parents in America is a looming physical threat: climate change. As the president and his EPA head parrot talking points from the fossil fuel industry, pointing to volcanoes and natural temperature cycles as the culprits for warming temperatures, the global scientific community tells us that we have essentially run out of time to do anything about it. That any children we have will be at a higher risk of dying in a super storm or a massive fire. That because a small handful of men decided that their own profits and comfort were more important than the rest of the world’s safety, any new humans that join the world will face greater challenges than the generation that came before.

Addressing crowds of supporters outside the presidential palace in Caracas on Sunday night, Maduro hailed the “impeccable electoral process” that had returned him to power with 67.7% of the vote. “This was a historic day! The day of a heroic victory! The day of a beautiful victory - of a truly popular victory,” Maduro shouted. “The whole of Venezuela has triumphed! Democracy has triumphed! Peace has triumphed! Constitutionality has triumphed [These were] elections that were constitutional, legitimate and legal,” he insisted, before claiming: “We have a president of the people! A working president!” The 14-nation Lima group of Latin American countries plus Canada issued a statement on Monday saying it did not recognise the legitimacy of Venezuela’s presidential election. The statement said the countries would call their ambassadors back from Caracas for consultations and hold a meeting to coordinate a regional response to outflows of Venezuelans “who have been obligated to abandon their country”. Venezuela’s election board put turnout at just 46.1%, way down from the 80% registered at the last presidential vote in 2013, due to a boycott by Venezuela’s mainstream opposition. Tibisay Lucena, the head of Venezuela’s electoral commission, told reporters Maduro had received more than 5.8m votes compared to the 1.8m of his nearest rival, Henri Falcón. As results came out, Maduro supporters reportedly let off fireworks in poor Caracas neighbourhoods and danced to Latin pop around the downtown Miraflores presidential palace. But even before Maduro’s victory speech, domestic opponents and much of the international community were denouncing the election as a “fraud foretold”. Henri Falcón claimed widespread vote buying and electoral irregularities meant the election was “illegitimate”. “We do not regonize this electoral process as valid,” he told reporters. “As far as we are concerned there has been no election. There must be new elections in Venezuela.” “All Venezuelans know what happened today,” tweeted Henrique Capriles, who narrowly lost to Maduro in the 2013 election and was subsequently barred from running again. “Our beloved Venezuela must have truly free and democratic elections where the will of our People is reflected in the result.” Luz Mely Reyes, a prominent Venezuelan journalist, tweeted: “Today is a sad day for democracy. The government clings on and manipulates, the opposition is divided and lacking a strategy. And voters are without guides or leadership.” The United States’ mission to the United Nations indicated it would reject the result. “Today’s so-called election in Venezuela is an insult to democracy ... It’s time for Maduro to go,” it tweeted. The president of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, said that his country, “like the majority of democratic countries”, would not recognise the vote. “Venezuela’s elections do not meet the minimum standards for a true democracy. They are not clean or legitimate elections and they do not represent the free and sovereign will of the Venezuelan people,” Piñera wrote. Maduro dismissed such criticisms in his late-night victory address and vowed to work swiftly to stablize his country’s economy, amidst a calamitous economic meltdown that saw the economy shrink by 13% last year and has seen more than a million people flee abroad since 2015. “You have put your trust in me and I will pay back this infinite, loving trust,” he said. To cries of “Vamos, Nico!”, Maduro added: “Today I love the Venezuelan people more than ever before!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/13/jennie-formby-looks-set-to-be-labours-general-secretary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T20:52:26Z","webTitle":"Jennie Formby looks set to be Labour's general secretary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/13/jennie-formby-looks-set-to-be-labours-general-secretary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/13/jennie-formby-looks-set-to-be-labours-general-secretary","fields":{"headline":"Jennie Formby looks set to be Labour's general secretary","bodyText":"Jennie Formby, an organiser for the Unite union, looks all but certain to be Labour’s next general secretary, completing Jeremy Corbyn’s control of the most senior posts in the party, after the GMB union threw its weight behind her. Formby’s candidacy has been keenly promoted by Corbyn’s office, and supportive Labour MPs include Chris Williamson, and party chair Ian Lavery. But other trade unions were initially concerned at what they regarded as a Unite stitch-up – and Jon Lansman, leader of the pro-Corbyn grassroots campaign group Momentum, put himself forward, complaining about “machine” politics inside Labour. Lansman withdrew his name on Sunday and, with the GMB’s backing, Formby appears almost certain to clinch the post, which is voted on by members of the party’s ruling national executive committee. In a statement, the GMB’s general secretary, Tim Roache, said: “This isn’t a small decision, we’ve taken time as a union to discuss it, to think about where Labour needs to be. “GMB members first and foremost need a Labour government, and we need our party to understand us. Jennie has been a trade unionist for decades. I have no doubt she understands the challenges and issues working people face and that she’ll do everything she can to put them at the heart of Labour’s campaign for government.” The post became vacant after the party’s longstanding general secretary Iain McNicol announced his departure. McNicol was controversial with many Corbyn supporters because of his role in the row over which party members could vote in the 2016 Labour leadership contest; but he worked closely with the leaders’ office during last year’s general election. Another high-profile departure was announced on Tuesday, with Emilie Oldknow, one of the party’s executive directors, emailing staff to say she would be “leaving in the summer to pursue some new and exciting opportunities”. One senior party figure said: “She ran the Labour party, Iain was the general secretary in name only – her departure is far more significant than Iain’s.” There have been a series of resignations in recent months as Corbyn’s team continue transforming Labour party machinery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/15/brother-by-david-chariandy-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T09:00:32Z","webTitle":"Brother by David Chariandy review – a family on the edge of disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/15/brother-by-david-chariandy-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/15/brother-by-david-chariandy-review","fields":{"headline":"Brother by David Chariandy review – a family on the edge of disaster","bodyText":"“You can always do things to let the world know you’re not nobody. You never know when your break is coming,” says older brother Francis, advising Michael to relax, to be less clueless, less of a pussy. But Francis learns early on that his break isn’t coming, that it is dangerous to hope. Narrated by the adult Michael, Canadian author David Chariandy’s tightly crafted, gracefully elegiac second novel alternates between present-day and early 1980s Scarborough, a hopeless Toronto neighbourhood of poor immigrants and their disenfranchised children. Nicknamed Scarlem and Scarbistan and Scar-bro, it is a study in the cultural divide between the displaced and their offspring. The parents have “useless foreign degrees” framed on the walls of their corner shops, advertising “back home tastes” on hand-painted signs. Their feral children, “oiled creatures of mongoose cunning”, hang out in barbershops, mix music and watch The A-Team and The Dukes of Hazzard. In the present day, Francis is gone and Michael is left to care for their mother alone. When Aisha, Michael’s studious childhood girlfriend and now a writer, returns to the neighbourhood, she forces mother and son to reckon with their “complicated grief” and memories of Francis. Michael and Francis’s mother is from Trinidad. During their childhood, she travels hours each day for cleaning shifts, her guilt as she locks her young boys in for the night manifesting in threats “mined from the deepest hells of history”. She warns them not to waste food, not to open the door, not to watch TV late at night. She knows they won’t listen, but she has to go, and her despairing rages become the heartbeat of the story. Her body is always on the brink of giving out, her breath stinking from a rotten tooth, and in her daily toil she exemplifies the fine line between survival and disaster. There is a moment, Michael understands, when “the limbs feel like meat, and it takes every last strength from a mother to make the two additional bus transfers home”. Through her pain and sweat and undying belief in “arrival and opportunity”, she forces her sons to try to live by the rules. “You all is harden,” she accuses in a melodic Trinidadian accent, warning them that despite what the world expects, no son of hers can ever become a “crimi-nal”. In the novel’s most powerful childhood scene, just after someone is killed in a convenience store, the boys can’t sleep because they are afraid of “the black murderers”. Their mother tells them they are safe, begs them to believe it, but Francis refuses. “I don’t believe you,” he says, frantic, to which she replies: “But I need you to believe me.” And it is with this foundational belief in her safety that her universe diverges from that of her sons. Here is their most fundamental culture clash: she is a woman with a country where she is wanted, far away though it may be, and while her striving may lead nowhere, it probably won’t get her murdered by police. As they grow older, Michael begins to see what Francis sees. “One morning I peered with Francis into a newspaper box to read a headline about the latest terror and caught in the glass the reflection of our own faces.” Still, Francis tries. He takes care of awkward Michael, who is prone to misfiring with the neighbourhood boys (“Yeah, homeboy is indubitably dope!”). Francis keeps him at arm’s length from the dangers and futile dreams that take shape in Desirea’s barbershop, a place where, among the do-rags and sharp fades, children of immigrants “found new language … kept the meanings close as skin”. Francis and Mother share a quiet devotion and endless conflict that is unique to first-born children and single mothers. Her sadness is the subject of Chariandy’s most beautiful prose, from the casual way she explains her presence to overattentive sales people (“just window shopping”) to passages such as this: Mother’s face seemed ready to break … Like watching a glass ball being dropped in a slow-motion movie. That fraction of a second just after the glass hits the ground and it’s still a ball, but the cracks are everywhere, and you know it’s not going to be a ball much longer. Chariandy’s writing is accomplished and confident: every word hits its mark. Mother stops to “neat up” her dress. A gunshot victim leaks “a wet pink balloon” from his head. Thick Brylcreemed hair looks like “the black snap-on do of Lego-Man”. Michael searches for a clue in the “expressive space” between Francis’s mouth and nose. Chariandy handles some of the most emotional issues of our time – the casual indignities of being a poor child of immigrants, the impervious power-posturing of police in the black community, murders dismissed as lawful – with care and wisdom. The result is seething and persuasive. Near the end of the novel, Mother takes her teenage boys for a walk. They watch tiny moths circle a plant near the creek. Michael describes them as torn pieces of an old book, “a scattered and wasted alphabet. Without any meaning at all.” But Mother retains her hope, useless as it may be. “Look closer,” she says. “Cup your hand and feel the proof of them against you. They’re not trash. They’re living things. And they’re flying.” Brother is an exquisite novel, crafted by a writer as talented and precise as Junot Díaz and Dinaw Mengestu. It has a beating heart and a sharp tongue. It is elegant, vital, indubitably dope – the most moving book I’ve read in a year. Dina Nayeri’s non-fiction book, The Ungrateful Refugee, will be published by Canongate next year.

Exactly","bodyText":"“If the league was based on budgets, we’d be relegated at the start of every season,” says the Accrington Stanley midfielder Sean McConville. As it is, though, the Lancashire club, with 10 games to play, are on course for an overdue promotion to League One after missing out on goal difference on the final day of the season in 2016. Last year it was a case of too little, too late. On the first day of pre-season before this campaign John Coleman sat his squad down, plus the kit man, chief executive and other non-playing staff, to set the bar high, with automatic promotion the explicit target. After a December dip Accrington’s form since Christmas, with 11 wins from their past 13 matches, has accelerated them to the summit of League Two. More recently, after training, Coleman informed his squad that the top-scorer Billy Kee, his strike partner Kayden Jackson and McConville had more league goals and assists combined than Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané. “We were all laughing with each other, to have stats like that is frightening with how Liverpool are playing,” McConville says. In the process Accrington are eating away at their image as the country’s minnows, exacerbated by the infamous Milk Marketing Board television advert in the 1980s. “I think our performances over the past two years have helped to shake that tag to be honest,” he says. Promotion would be remarkable given the club’s resources and the manner in which they were plucked apart for their best players last summer. The Northern Ireland international Shay McCartan signed for Bradford City, Matty Pearson exited for Barnsley the day before the campaign started and Omar Beckles joined Shrewsbury Town. Coleman, though, has an eye for a player – an educated punt as he puts it – and he has found a way to do more even than plug the gaps. “We can’t pay riches but what we can do is give them opportunities,” the 55-year-old says. “We are not signing players on one-year deals any more, so we can protect the clubs’ interests as well. For me it’s the perfect model if you can get it right: we sign players who are hungry, develop them, they give you two good years and then you move them on. They get a lot more money and we get a few bob.” When players sign, Coleman offers them a race to the halfway line, with £50 at stake. “The new lads will look at the gaffer and think: ‘He must be 50-odd, I fancy myself here,’” McConville says, laughing. “He will put his money down and say: ‘The only stipulation is you have got to drink a cup of water halfway through.’ The new lads will think: ‘Well, yeah, I can drink a cup of water and still beat him.’ Then the assistant comes out with the water that has just been boiled from the kettle. It’s on the marks, get set, go and the new lads get to the water and they just can’t physically do it. He’s then just running past them as they are trying to drink boiling hot water. It’s just a little thing but he makes it a fun environment to come into.” These days, while Accrington operate on a budget of around £15,000 a week, thought to be the joint-lowest in the Football League, the owner Andy Holt, a local businessman who made his money in the plastics industry and took over three years ago, has given the club a sound footing. “He has cleared the debts and tried to get it as a working business so that we are not haemorrhaging money,” Coleman says, adding one of the things he is proudest about is the fact the club has never gone into administration “despite being one of the ones that maybe should have”. Accrington did not have to sell players last summer – Coleman was able to “accept or decline decent offers” – but it made financial sense. The manager has been able to pay fees – albeit modest – for players, with Harvey Rodgers arriving from Fleetwood Town in January. It is a world away from 2009, when McConville and his team-mates would worry about getting paid on time. “The manager would have had to sell those players to make ends meet,” he says, “to make sure the lads got paid the next month because it was hand-to-mouth type stuff back then.” Not everything is perfect, though. Accrington train a mile from their stadium, on a rented 4G pitch at the council-run Hyndburn Leisure Centre. They are told when they can and cannot train and turfed out at midday. “That hampers us more than anything,” Coleman says. “The lads probably complain to each other but they don’t complain to me. Once that gets rectified, and I know the chairman has got plans in the pipeline, my job will be easier again.” Stanley, who play 19th-placed Forest Green Rovers on Saturday, continue to punch gloriously above their weight. “If somebody would have told me when I first came here that we would be playing Coventry in a league game and would beat them home and away, I would have laughed at them,” says Coleman, who is in his 17th season in charge across two spells. “There has never been a better time to be at Accrington Stanley than right now. The club is going in the right direction.” The club’s 15-year journey from playing part-time in the Unibond Premier League to here might yet become even more astonishing. “It’s scary to think that Accrington could be playing Sunderland or Birmingham in a league fixture – it’s dizzy heights for a club of our size but it’s one we are all striving for,” McConville says. Talking points • It seems Middlesbrough are not finished yet and kudos to Tony Pulis for quietly steering the Championship club into the play-off places. Patrick Bamford’s goals have been a big plus in winning four of their past five matches. Pulis, though, is staying typically grounded. “We have nine games to go,” he said. • In the seven weeks since sacking Pep Clotet, Oxford United have picked up only one victory and are yet to name the Spaniard’s successor. But the club’s recently appointed chairman, Sumrith “Tiger” Thanakarnjanasuth, the former majority shareholder at Reading, expects to name a new manager next week. • Swindon Town have appointed their ninth manager in seven years, with Phil Brown drafted in to sneak the club into the top six over what the 58-year-old described as a “10-game season”. Meanwhile, in League One, Walsall are looking for a manager after sacking their longstanding coach Jon Whitney, who arrived at the club as a physiotherapist in 2003. Adi Viveash, the former Chelsea development squad manager currently assisting Mark Robins at Coventry, is the leading candidate. • And Saturday’s derby between Notts County and Mansfield Town will see the clubs compete for the Matt Salmon Trophy, as well as local bragging rights. Salmon, who worked in both clubs’ medical departments, died of cancer aged 25 last May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/14/cheltenham-festival-tipping-guide-min-altior-champion-chase-horse-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T00:01:37Z","webTitle":"Cheltenham day two tips: Min can defy favourite Altior in Champion Chase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/14/cheltenham-festival-tipping-guide-min-altior-champion-chase-horse-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/14/cheltenham-festival-tipping-guide-min-altior-champion-chase-horse-racing","fields":{"headline":"Cheltenham day two tips: Min can defy favourite Altior in Champion Chase","bodyText":"Willie Mullins could not turn over the Nicky Henderson-trained favourite in Tuesday’s big race but he came closer than was generally expected, his Melon failing by a neck in the Champion Hurdle. Revenge could be his when Min takes on Henderson’s Altior, hitherto unbeaten over fences, in the Queen Mother Champion Chase. For all Altior’s talent he has had a far from ideal preparation, missing months of the winter after a wind operation and then going lame on Monday. Most of his races have been on a much sounder surface than this and those two factors may combine to make him vulnerable. Min (3.30) loves testing ground and his career-best effort last time puts him right in the reckoning. 1.30 Day two at the Festival starts, like day one, with an Irish hotpot and perhaps Samcro will suffer a similar fate to Getabird. Both are chasers in the making, after all, and Samcro may not have had much left at the line last time, bearing in mind this race is significantly longer. Vision Des Flos cannot be rated far below him after his Exeter romp last time, when he showed the benefit of a breathing operation. Odds of 16-1 underestimate him. 2.10 Pat Kelly’s Athenry yard has punched miles above its weight in delivering winners at the last two Festivals and here comes the third in a row, possibly, as Presenting Percy has an obvious chance. Last year’s Pertemps winner has taken brilliantly to fences and his one length defeat by Our Duke last time is the standout bit of form on offer. So long as he has recovered from that, he can prove he is a Gold Cup contender for next year. 2.50 It was something to see at Newbury in December when The Organist turned on the afterburners to rocket past two rivals in the last 100 yards of a three-mile race. This shorter trip seems sensible in view of conditions and she still looks nicely weighted. She can be forgiven her defeat last time, a run which qualified her for the Pertemps Final here, for all that connections decided not to take up that option. At 33-1 she has been completely missed by the market but is a serious challenger to William Henry, whose position at the head of the market is deserved. 4.10 Cause Of Causes should be remembered as one of the great big-race horses of all time, having won a different race at each of the last three Festivals as well as Ascot’s Ladbroke Hurdle back in 2012, to say nothing of a game second place in the last Grand National. If he is on song once more, there is nothing to touch him in this field, with the possible exception of The Last Samuri, having his first spin round the cross-country course. 4.50 The 16-1 about Eragon De Chanay looks a mistake, in view of his easy success at Sandown which has got him in at the bottom of the weights with a penalty. Clearly it is a real challenge for a four-year-old to run to his best on heavy ground for the second time in five days but that effort will put him at the top of most ratings lists for this race. 5.30 The market and stable vibes favour Blackbow but Willie Mullins has another strong contender in Carefully Selected, the comfortable winner of both his bumper outings. His pedigree suggests he is all about stamina and he is as well placed as any to cope if this turns into a slog."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/mar/18/daniel-evans-interview-chichester-festival-theatre-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Daniel Evans: ‘I am quite unashamedly a populist.

He has performed at the RSC, National Theatre and on Broadway, and won Olivier awards in 2001 for Merrily We Roll Along, and in 2007 for Sunday in the Park with George. In 2009, he became artistic director of Sheffield Theatres, and in 2016, artistic director of Chichester Festival theatre. His production of Quiz transfers to the West End this month. What was your initial reaction to Quiz, James Graham’s play about Charles Ingram, “the coughing major” accused of cheating on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Great excitement, because I remember seeing the documentary [Millionaire: A Major Fraud] back in 2003, and having that proper sick feeling because it makes you think that the Ingrams were absolutely guilty. It was fascinating to find out more about the case itself. The audience have to vote whether they think they’re guilty or not at the end of each act; every performance except two we had a guilty verdict in Act 1 and an innocent verdict in Act 2. So it’s great fun, but it also has something substantial to say about the elasticity of truth. Do you have a hunch yourself? The chutzpah of thinking you could cheat by coughing, when you consider the studio itself, the geography of it… whatever happened, I don’t believe they did it by coughing. Are you a fan of a pub quiz? I love a pub quiz. I’m not particularly good – there are massive gaps in my knowledge, particularly around sport. How’s it been moving from Sheffield to Chichester? I thought it would be very different. But this Brexit statistic tells you everything: in Sheffield, where I expected the Remain vote to be very high, the Leave vote was actually 51%; in Chichester, perceived to be a much more Conservative place, the leave vote was also only 51%. Perceptions aren’t always true. One big difference is that it’s really lovely to live by the sea – and it’s always two degrees warmer! What’s the biggest challenge for an artistic director today? To make the funding go as far as possible. That’s about putting on pertinent shows, but it’s also about the work we do off the stage, particularly with major cuts happening to arts education. Schools are so pressed for cash that they are reliant on organisations like ours. How did you get into theatre? I was taken by my grandmother to the Park &amp; Dare theatre in Treorchy. And in the Rhondda Valley there’s a great amateur tradition. I also went to chapel, and I’d get up in the pulpit and read chapter and verse – so there was a bit of theatricality going on there! Have you ever put on a play in Welsh? Yeah, I directed a play for the Welsh language national theatre [Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru], by Saunders Lewis, called Esther. My father is first-language, so I grew up bilingual; it means a great deal to me. There’s a 50:50 gender-balance commitment for actors this summer at Chichester. What spurred that decision? It was something I’d done in Sheffield and was really proud of. Last year we got our feet under the table, and then I thought, hang on – we do need to start looking at our civic duty, and our artistic duty, which is to reflect the world. We’re not doing that if we’re constantly merely reflecting the stories of men. Why not make that explicit for playwrights and directors too, or right across the entire company? Ultimately, that’s where we’re going. It’s bit-by-bit. Watch this space! Do you miss performing on stage? I’ve just started to, strangely. I miss singing – there’s a certain kind of release you get. I hope at some point I will act at Chichester. It’s hard, though; you never want it to seem like an ego trip: ‘I’m casting myself as Hamlet’… I don’t think so. It’s clear that musicals have a special place in your heart. There is something about that communal sound I find very moving. I’m certainly not a snob. I am quite unashamedly a populist: I like making big shows in big spaces for a lot of people. • Quiz is at the Noël Coward theatre, London, from 31 March to 16 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/14/mike-pompeo-gina-haspel-nominations-senate-hearings","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T12:22:48Z","webTitle":"Pompeo and Haspel nominations set up contentious Senate hearings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/14/mike-pompeo-gina-haspel-nominations-senate-hearings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/14/mike-pompeo-gina-haspel-nominations-senate-hearings","fields":{"headline":"Pompeo and Haspel nominations set up contentious Senate hearings","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s sudden decision to replace the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, with Mike Pompeo, the director of the CIA, and elevate his deputy to run the spy agency has set in motion a partisan battle on Capitol Hill ahead of what is likely to be a pair of contentious confirmation hearings. Trump announced on Tuesday that he would nominate Pompeo, the former Tea Party congressman and a hawk who shares the president’s foreign policy impulses, to be the nation’s top diplomat. To replace him, Trump tapped Gina Haspel, who currently serves as the deputy director of the CIA. Top Senate Republicans say they intend to move quickly on the nominations, noting the urgency of the timeline: delicate, high-stakes negotiations with North Korea, looming deadlines to continue compliance with the Iran nuclear deal and heightened concern over Russian aggression. Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican and chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, assured Pompeo after the announcement that his panel would move through the confirmation process “as expeditiously as possible”. The hearing is expected in April. But resistance to the nominees is building among Democrats, who are already under intense pressure from their liberal base to oppose Trump’s agenda. The backlash is not expected to prevent their confirmation, but it is an indication that the nomination process will not be as smooth or speedy as Republicans hope. The Senate Democratic minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said that the nominees would face “outstanding questions” during their Senate confirmation hearings, but he has not advised Democrats to oppose either Pompeo or Haspel. The Senate confirmed Pompeo to be director of the CIA in a vote of 66 to 32 in January 2017. Perhaps the fiercest line of questioning will be reserved for Haspel, a career spymaster who would be the first female CIA director. Democrats and Republicans are demanding to know more about her reported role overseeing a CIA “black site” prison in Thailand, and her involvement in efforts to destroy videotapes that show detainees being subjected to brutal “enhanced interrogation techniques”. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican and a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, said Haspel “needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA’s interrogation program during the confirmation process” and expressed confidence that the Senate would examine her record “as well as her beliefs about torture and her approach to current law”. Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois and an Iraq war veteran, said “supporting torture should disqualify people from having the privilege of serving the American people in government ever again, but apparently Donald Trump thinks it merits promotion”. Pompeo, a West Point graduate and army veteran, has, in past remarks, defended waterboarding as an interrogation tactic and argued for Congress to permit domestic surveillance on a mass scale. But during his confirmation hearing to be director of the CIA, Pompeo was asked if he would restart the CIA’s use of so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques” should the president ask him to do so. “Absolutely not,” he replied. As a member of Congress, Pompeo appeared much more in sync with the nation’s intelligence community than Trump on Russia. But last year, he drew criticism for falsely stating that the intelligence community had concluded that Russian interference did not affect the outcome of the US presidential election. And Pompeo, like Trump, takes a hardline view of Iran and sympathizes with the president’s desire to withdraw the US from the multinational accord, brokered by the Obama administration to curb Tehran’s nuclear program. Democrats saw Tillerson as one of the members of Trump’s cabinet willing to publicly break with him and have expressed unease with Pompeo’s closeness to the president. Senator Brian Schatz, the Hawaii Democrat, who supported Pompeo’s nomination for CIA director, told reporters on Tuesday that he would not commit to doing so again. Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat and a member of the Senate intelligence committee who opposed Pompeo’s nomination to be CIA director, said he would again vote to block his nomination for secretary of state. “Before and after his confirmation as CIA director, Mike Pompeo has demonstrated a casual relationship to truth and principle,” said in a statement. “He has downplayed Russia’s attack on our democracy, at times contradicting the intelligence community he is supposed to lead. He has also made inconsistent and deeply concerning statements about torture and mass spying on Americans.” Wyden also intends to oppose Haspel’s nomination, arguing that her background makes her “unsuitable” to serve as director of the spy agency. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who also serves on the intelligence committee and played an instrumental role in the effort to release a more than 6,000-page report on the CIA’s use of torture to interrogate terrorism suspects, said she has had concerns with Haspel in the past as a result of her “connection to the CIA torture program”. She added, however, that Haspel has appeared to have done well in the current role as deputy director of the nation’s spy agency. “To the best of my knowledge she has been a good deputy director and I look forward to the opportunity to speak with her again,” Feinstein said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/14/exxonmobil-doesnt-expect-to-pay-any-australian-tax-until-2021-inquiry-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T01:50:08Z","webTitle":"ExxonMobil says it doesn't expect to pay any Australian corporate tax until 2021","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/14/exxonmobil-doesnt-expect-to-pay-any-australian-tax-until-2021-inquiry-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/14/exxonmobil-doesnt-expect-to-pay-any-australian-tax-until-2021-inquiry-hears","fields":{"headline":"ExxonMobil says it doesn't expect to pay any Australian corporate tax until 2021","bodyText":"ExxonMobil told a Senate inquiry on Wednesday it did not expect to pay any Australian corporate tax until 2021, meaning it would not have paid the tax for eight years, and was again accused of misleading the inquiry over its links to tax havens. The oil and gas giant’s Australian tax affairs have faced close scrutiny since the release of an investigation by the Tax Justice Network (TJN) last year that exposed a complex web of hundreds of foreign subsidiaries designed for tax avoidance. The allegations prompted a fresh hearing of the Senate’s corporate tax inquiry on Wednesday, where unions slammed the company as a “very, very bad corporate citizen”. ExxonMobil told the inquiry on Wednesday that it did not expect to pay corporate tax in the next three years. It had paid no tax since 2013 because of the “unique” circumstances it was facing, after years of huge capital investment. It expected not to pay any tax until 2021, because it would offset current losses against its future taxable income. Last year’s TJN report exposed the company’s web of hundreds of foreign subsidiaries, and showed its Australian operations were ultimately owned by entities in the Netherlands, a nation increasingly known for tax avoidance, and the Bahamas, a jurisdiction with no corporate tax. The TJN accused the company of using related-party loans between its internal subsidiaries to reduce taxable profits in Australia, an allegation the company strongly denies and describes as “baseless”. It was one of 732 corporations that paid no corporate tax in the 2015-16 financial year. In fact, the multinational giant has not recorded a taxable income or paid corporate tax in Australia for three years in a row, despite reporting revenue of $9.6bn in 2013-14, $8.5bn in 2014-15 and $6.7bn in 2015-16. Wednesday’s inquiry heard ExxonMobil had not disclosed its links to the Netherlands or Bahamas entities to either the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or to a previous hearing of the Senate inquiry. The Tax Justice Network’s Jason Ward, who led the investigation, said Exxon must be punished for the deception. He said their actions and statements show “complete disrespect” for the committee and the Australian people, and mirrored ExxonMobil’s global track record of “arrogance and disrespect”. “Exxon did mislead this committee in 2015, and there should be consequences,” Ward told the inquiry on Wednesday. “Why is Exxon continuing to hide the facts?” ExxonMobil’s chairman in Australia, Richard Owen, flatly denied any attempt to mislead the inquiry. “The accusation by the Tax Justice Network was that we misled this community,” Owen said. “And I clearly say that we have not misled this community. That we have answered truthfully all the questions that have been put to us.” “And therefore we find the accusation very disappointing.” ExxonMobil released new data on its financial affairs and structure to counter what it described as “misinformation” and “innuendo”. Owen said ExxonMobil had “decades and decades” of paying tax in Australia, including more than $2bn since 2000, averaging $200m a year. In the 1970s and the 1980s, the company was providing 14% of all government tax receipts, the inquiry heard. ExxonMobil said it was now in a unique position due primarily to the cost of $21bn in capital investment in Australia over the past decade, including in its operations in the Bass Strait and Western Australia. Lower prices were driving down income, the company said, and there was a high cost associated with the debt it had taken on to fund its investment. “We are in a unique period, and expect it to be short-term in our corporate history, with no income tax paid since 2013,” Owen said. “And that’s due to the recovery of invested capital, lower prices that are driving down income, and the cost of debt to fund the significant amount of investment ... that we’ve made.” It had received two related-party loans, one from its US parent company, and another from the Bahamas entity worth $1bn. The company said it used about 2% of the loan to partially deduct from its taxable income. The inquiry heard the Australian Tax Office had audited ExxonMobil. After the TJN’s report, ExxonMobile used a submission to the inquiry to accuse Ward of defamation. ExxonMobil has sued outspoken individuals who have criticised it in the United States, the inquiry has heard. The Labor senator Doug Cameron said it was the first time in 10 years he had seen such a threat, and said he would be “very concerned” if the multinational was trying to intimidate a witness. Owen denied the statement was meant as a threat. But he said the TJN’s allegations were defamatory and misled the inquiry. The company has paid the petroleum resource rent tax for its operations in Australia, the inquiry heard. ExxonMobil said it had paid $440m a year for the past 14 years through the PRRT. But even the PRRT, a royalty scheme, was not achieving fair or adequate returns from companies extracting Australia’s natural resources, the inquiry heard. Both BHP and ExxonMobile operate a joint venture in the Bass Strait, but ExxonMobil had paid far less in PRRT. The inquiry heard a lack of transparency with the royalty scheme made it difficult to understand why there was such a divergence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/15/rapsody-i-wanted-to-tell-my-story-something-that-spoke-for-black-women","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T13:28:25Z","webTitle":"Rapsody: 'I wanted to tell my story, something that spoke for black women'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/15/rapsody-i-wanted-to-tell-my-story-something-that-spoke-for-black-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/15/rapsody-i-wanted-to-tell-my-story-something-that-spoke-for-black-women","fields":{"headline":"Rapsody: 'I wanted to tell my story, something that spoke for black women'","bodyText":"In January, 35-year-old Rapsody became the fifth woman ever to be nominated for best rap album at the Grammys, for Laila’s Wisdom – and picked up a nomination for best rap song, too. The self-described “tomboy” offers a ferocious voice to the voiceless: loaded with intricate rhyme patterns, wordplay and metaphors, her music coolly captures the essence of black women with a Maya Angelou-like grace. At her fiercest, she damningly critiques the US’s complex prison system – “I know prison business, but nobody know how many innocent in it,” she raps on Nobody – and attacks negative perceptions of the darker skinned. “Black and ugly as ever and still nobody fine as me / No one been as kind as me,” she sings on Black &amp; Ugly. These are vulnerable, complex stories not being told by the likes of Nicki Minaj and Cardi B – who are all braggadocio and self-empowerment – and so Rapsody sits in parallel to rap’s female resurgence. “I want to make music that people can feel and connect with,” she says in a soothing low register before her sell-out show at the Jazz Cafe, London. “I love making music that I care about, and if you listen to it, you can tell I care about my craft and people and our communities.” Growing up in Snow Hill, North Carolina, Rapsody watched pioneers MC Lyte and Queen Latifah exert their influence on TV, and became immersed in the art of rapping to perfectly execute untold stories. “I just loved [rap’s] freedom of expression,” she says. “Whether that was the fashion, how you dance, how you walk – everyone had their own styles, and we could co-exist. That was the beauty of hip-hop for me.” Initially, she says it was “just a dream. I didn’t have enough confidence to pursue [rapping]. It took me going to college and having my friends push me for me to take it seriously.” In the early 2010s, Rapsody began her ascension, wielding lyrically dense odes to self-advancement and the sprawl of the black American experience. Mainstream rap was still a landscape in which lyrical skill was secondary, for men and women. Conscious, creative rappers such as Lupe Fiasco faced battles with their record labels, and underground veterans such as Jean Grae remained exactly that: underground. Rapsody had her own jarring experiences. “Women weren’t looked at as being talented or able to compete with the men,” she says. “We were always reduced to fighting among each other; to some people, we had to prove we could rap, and, to others we had to look the part. But for what? What’s the point? Men can coexist, and women can do the same thing. But it feels good to know that I made it this far and didn’t have to compromise or change my style, how I looked, how I rapped and what I rapped about. My journey shows women do have something to say, and you can’t box us in and try to define us any more.” Rapsody also earned the respect of rap’s elite – Kendrick Lamar included her on his epochal To Pimp a Butterfly album, where she delivered a magnificent perspective on the notion of black beauty for Complexion (A Zulu Love). Mainstream recognition was fully realised on Laila’s Wisdom, featuring Lamar, Anderson .Paak and jazz virtuoso Terrace Martin, among others. “That was the album where I said: fuck it, I’m not worried about proving to anyone that I can rap or that I’m not worthy enough,” she says. “I’m not going to waste time trying to fight for the same three million people [as] everybody else” – the established fanbase of rap – “I’m focusing on my lane and letting it build. I wanted to tell my story, something that spoke for black women, and not be afraid to tell the honest or ugly parts.” In the Migos and Future-led era of money, drugs and excess, Rapsody has found a meaningful pocket within the culture. Although no Grammy was forthcoming, she remains determined to stand for those voices who are seldom heard. “I remind myself that making good music and being myself got me here,” she says. “My purpose has always been to inspire and touch people, and you can’t hold that to an award – it’s so much bigger than that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global/2018/mar/13/england-ben-stokes-tests-new-zealand","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T17:37:30Z","webTitle":"England keep Ben Stokes in the ranks for Test series against New Zealand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/mar/13/england-ben-stokes-tests-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/mar/13/england-ben-stokes-tests-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"England keep Ben Stokes in the ranks for Test series against New Zealand","bodyText":"Ben Stokes will resume his Test career among the ranks after the England management opted to retain Jimmy Anderson as the vice-captain for the two-match series in New Zealand. Anderson fulfilled the role during the Ashes defeat when Stokes was unavailable for selection but, though the all-rounder is back in the fold before his trial that starts on 6 August, Joe Root’s deputy will be unchanged when the first Test gets under way in Auckland next Thursday. “I’m delighted Joe has asked me to do it again,” Anderson told BBC Sport. “It doesn’t change my role in the team a huge amount. I see myself as a senior player and, if Joe needs help on the field, I’m there for him.” Stokes played all five matches of the recent 3-2 one-day series win over New Zealand in what was his international comeback, having been missing from the England squad owing to his arrest in Bristol on 25 September. A back niggle means Stokes was expected to miss the first of England’s two-day warm-up matches that begins in the early hours of Wednesday in Hamilton – a pink-ball fixture to prepare for the floodlit first Test – but he is expected to be fit for the second that begins on Friday. Chris Woakes and Craig Overton are also expected to be rested because of respective hamstring and quad issues, although the two seamers are similarly not considered major doubts for the final leg of England’s epic winter schedule. Root’s side will be looking to arrest a disturbing run of results that has seen them lose nine of their past 11 Tests overseas, including 4-0 defeats at the hands of India and Australia. On the latter Anderson said: “I don’t think we were far away. I know the scoreline says 4-0 and it looks like we got thrashed but in each Test I don’t think we were that far away. “We got ourselves into games at certain times and it was a bad half-hour or an hour here and there that really cost us the games we lost. I think that’s the learning curve for us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/13/punters-beat-bookmakers-on-first-day-at-cheltenham","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T20:10:53Z","webTitle":"It’s hell for Cheltenham bookies as fans and favourites make light of wet | Chris Cook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/13/punters-beat-bookmakers-on-first-day-at-cheltenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/13/punters-beat-bookmakers-on-first-day-at-cheltenham","fields":{"headline":"It’s hell for Cheltenham bookies as fans and favourites make light of wet","bodyText":"“When it’s wet, don’t bet,” says the old maxim, used by many a gnarled punter to warn youngsters against races run on heavy going. Not for decades has the Cheltenham Festival started on such a soggy surface as this time and it appears the old cliché has, on this showing, no wisdom in it whatsoever as one well-backed winner follows another up the famous hill. “It’s turned into a bloodbath,” grimaces John Hughes, a bookmaker from Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland who has long held the treasured “number one” pitch in Cheltenham’s boisterous betting ring. In that position, he is the first of dozens of bookies that punters come across and he has queues in front of him all afternoon. Punters hand over their stakes and then, 10 minutes later, they come back for their winnings. “It’s the best betting I’ve ever seen in Cheltenham. It was colossal. Unfortunately, it just turned out, our punters backed the winners.” How much had John lost? “I can’t say. Oh God, the wife would leave me.” All types of punters appear to be celebrating. At the sober, form-studying end of the spectrum there is Robert McCullough, who has been coming here from Maybole, Ayrshire for half a century and who tells of winning £20,000 on Best Mate’s third Gold Cup. He has drawn his horns in these days but says before the Champion Hurdle that Buveur D’Air is the only possible play of the day. “I probably bet too heavy for my means, if you understand,” McCullough says. “But I think the game’s more difficult now. It’s difficult to get on. The bookies are keeping everything short.” Where’s the incentive to do anything else when even first-timers are finding the winners? Jubilant Dave, down from Middlesbrough, is on Summerville Boy because he was once a fan of Bronski Beat. He sticks the winnings on Mister Whitaker, having admired the horse’s trainer, Mick Channon, when he was scoring goals for England. “Fantastic!” is his verdict on the day, delivered as Elizabeth, his wife, returns from the ring clutching thick folds of £20 notes. “Overall, we’ve done in about 12 grand,” says Geoff Banks, climbing down from his pitch in the Centaur, which during the Festival is a sort of mosh pit of betting, drinking and cheering. Banks, familiar from many a gig on Channel 4 Racing, is usually as effervescent as bookmakers get but the afternoon has been taxing enough to turn him serious. “Once the punters get ahead in this game, they’ve literally got you by the balls. We’ve had a lot of each-way thieves winning and things like that. It’s not as bad as a few years ago, when all of the Rich Ricci horses were winning. That was particularly bad. If you hear any sob stories from the big firms this time, it’s just good PR. We’ll all have lost but we’re still going.” “You can get such a run of money in here, it can be scary,” says Andy Geraghty, taking bets behind the stands, by the See You Then bar. Geraghty is the last bookie in the area to be offering 9-5 about the first favourite, Getabird, and mainly Irish punters congregate in front of him to take the offer. He gets that one beaten but it is not enough. “I wanted the second in the mares’ race. That got me the absolute jackpot. And it went odds-on in running,” he groans. Hughes gets a brief moment of encouragement in the next as Footpad plunges through an early fence just as the bookie is reeling off a long list of four-figure bets he has taken on the horse. But soon the commentator is calling the favourite as “cruising up to lead” and the crowd’s answering roar drowns him out. Three Geordie lads are jumping up and down after Coo Star Sivola holds on by a neck, half an hour later. Darren explains why he stuck £100 on: “I had a couple too many drinks in Birmingham, had a dream about the horse and thought, I best back it big. I’ve never been so shaking in me life.” “He had an epiphany!” shouts his mate, Jamie. “Right after he was sick …”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/13/trump-in-california-first-official-visit-met-with-protests-and-scorn","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T23:43:49Z","webTitle":"Trump in California: first official visit met with protests and scorn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/trump-in-california-first-official-visit-met-with-protests-and-scorn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/trump-in-california-first-official-visit-met-with-protests-and-scorn","fields":{"headline":"Trump in California: first official visit met with protests and scorn","bodyText":"Donald Trump has started a whirlwind visit to California by promoting his immigration crackdown and bashing Democrats, sparking protests and scorn in a bastion of resistance to his administration. Air Force One landed at a Marine Corps air station in Miramar, outside San Diego, on Tuesday morning, heralding Trump’s first presidential visit to the US’s most populous state and economic powerhouse. He inspected prototypes of his proposed border wall at Otay Mesa, yards from the border with Mexico, while a mile down the road police in riot gear separated rival groups of demonstrators chanting for and against Trump. Some gave the presidential motorcade the middle finger. “For the people that say no wall, if you didn’t have walls over here, you wouldn’t even have a country,” Trump said, repeating a line from his campaign. The US needed a strong border to stop criminal and terrorist infiltration, he said. “Truly our first line of defense … it’ll save thousands of lives. The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas. They don’t tell you that.” Trump expressed preference for a see-through wall to let border patrol agents monitor the other side. He asked an official which of the eight prototypes was likeliest to deter would-be border jumpers. “These are like professional mountain climbers.” He also assailed the state’s governor, Jerry Brown, as soft on crime and illegal migration. “The place is totally out of control. You have sanctuary cities where you have criminals living.” Brown responded in a tweet stressing California’s economic might. “Thanks for the shout-out, @realDonaldTrump. But bridges are still better than walls. And California remains the 6th largest economy in the world and the most prosperous state in America. #Facts” Heavy security corralled protests on both sides of the border, a scene expected to be repeated in Los Angeles where Trump was due to attend a GOP fundraiser in the evening before returning to Washington on Wednesday. No president since Franklin Roosevelt has waited this long to visit California. Trump did so trailing upheaval in Washington where he had fired the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, via tweet – later phoning Tillerson from Air Force One – before resuming an unprecedented White House confrontation with California. Democrats, who dominate statewide posts and the legislature in Sacramento, poured scorn on their visitor even before he touched down. “Some people think that medieval walls might keep us safe in this country,” Xavier Becerra, the attorney general, told reporters. It would be good only to deter knights on horses, he said. Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor who is running for governor, released an animated video caricaturing Trump and his slogan, “Make America great again”, as “Make America white again”. “Donald Trump finally worked up the nerve to visit California, bringing his fear-of-everything agenda with him,” Newsom said in a voiceover. “Let’s get real. Donald Trump’s border wall is a monument to idiocy.” Community and Latino groups rallied in and around San Diego and the Mexican city of Tijuana, which abuts the border. Police restricted demonstrators near the wall prototypes to a “free speech zone” and banned potential weapons including glass containers, rocks, slingshots, knives and guns. Members of the US Secret Service were reportedly in Tijuana in recent days coordinating security with Mexican authorities. A protest on the Mexican side of the San Ysidro point of entry passed off peacefully in the morning. Others were expected. Trump lost California to Hillary Clinton by 4.3 million votes, costing him the national popular vote, but red pockets in the state cheer the president’s vow to build a wall and to expel undocumented migrants. Dozens of supporters gathered near the prototypes to greet him with American flags, red hats and signs saying “Secure our border” and “Build the damn wall”. The visit is expected to play well with Trump supporters across the country who see California as a criminal-coddling, tax-hiking liberal dystopia. Californian Republicans running for Congress in November’s midterm elections, however, are expected to steer clear of the president to avoid further alienating voters in tottering GOP redoubts. After inspecting the wall prototypes Trump addressed troops at the air station at Miramar. He bashed the media as fake news, prompting jeers for the travelling press corps, boasted about increased military spending, mused on building an outer “space force”, and vowed the wall would become reality. “People won’t be able to come over it, the drugs will stop by a lot. We have two or three [prototypes] that really work.” He did not mention Mexico paying for it. Later he was due to fly to LA to attend a $5m fundraiser for the Republican National Committee reportedly to be hosted at the Beverly Park mansion of Edward Glazer, whose family owns Manchester United and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Police sealed off parts of downtown in anticipation of protests by immigrant, LGBT and other advocacy groups. The White House seemed to stoke tension before the visit. Last week the justice department sued California, alleging it is interfering with the enforcement of immigration laws. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, ratcheted up the temperature further by accusing the state’s Democratic leaders of violating the constitution. Governor Brown shot back by calling Sessions a liar and accusing him of “going to war” with California. On Monday James Schwab, the San Francisco spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), a federal agency, resigned over what he described as “false” and “misleading” statements by Trump officials in relation to “criminal aliens” supposedly evading arrest. • This article was amended on 14 March 2018.

Mike Pompeo may be worse","bodyText":"Rex Tillerson will go down as one of the worst secretaries of state in US history. And yet, with his departure and replacement by CIA director Mike Pompeo, things could get a whole lot worse for US national security. Donald Trump made clear his disdain for diplomacy from day one of his presidency, and that he views foreign policy as an endeavor for the military, not the state department. He proposed enormous increases in the military budget while attempting to slash the state department budget by roughly a third. Trump appointed generals to be secretary of defense, national security advisor (twice) and White House chief of staff, while appointing as secretary of state someone with no diplomatic experience. If Trump’s contempt for diplomacy somehow wasn’t clear, he did his best to actively undermine his secretary of state, criticizing him in public on a number of occassions. In the fall of 2017, as Tillerson attempted to open a diplomatic process with North Korea, Trump tweeted to the world, “I told Rex Tillerson … he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.” When a Middle East dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar broke out in 2017, as Tillerson scrambled to calm the situation and mediate, Trump undercut him by publicly siding with Saudi Arabia. So it should come as no surprise that Tillerson would find out he was fired when his boss tweeted the news to the world. Despite this poor treatment, it is hard to shed a tear for Tillerson. He has been a good soldier in enabling a military-first foreign policy, in which the state department is relegated to an afterthought. He has worked aggressively to gut the state department, not filling key positions, and implementing freezes on hiring, all of which have contributed to a hostile environment and low morale. The nation’s most senior diplomats have resigned over the last year, leading to a wave of exits of career diplomats at all levels that has depleted the ranks of the nation’s diplomatic corps. It will take years to rebuild the state department in the wake of the damage inflicted by Trump and Tillerson. On leading America’s diplomacy with the world and running the state department, Tillerson has been an utter disaster – but his policy views were about as moderate as they come inside the Trump administration. He has been one of the administration’s strongest voices for diplomacy with North Korea. He was reportedly an advocate of remaining in the Paris climate change agreement. And he supposedly tried to keep the US in the Iran nuclear deal. If and when Pompeo replaces him, we should be deeply concerned – both because of Pompeo’s more hawkish views, and where they might take America on the critical foreign policy decisions coming down the pike. The fate of the Iran deal is once again hanging in the balance, and with it potentially more conflict in the Middle East. Trump has set a 12 May deadline for getting European allies on board with changes to the Iran deal, and has reportedly said that he will exit the deal if those changes aren’t made. While Tillerson advocated remaining in the deal, Pompeo has been a vocal critic of the 2015 agreement. If the US unilaterally withdraws from the deal, there’s no telling where tensions with Iran – which is already fighting proxy wars in Syria and Yemen – could go. This development doesn’t bode well for diplomacy with North Korea, either. As Trump prepares for a possible summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Tillerson’s exit could signal a much harder line on talks. Whereas Tillerson has been a proponent of diplomacy with North Korea, Pompeo’s public language on North Korea has been more aggressive, and he has openly hinted at regime change. A negotiation with North Korea is one of the most difficult diplomatic endeavors one can imagine – and Pompeo, like Tillerson, has no diplomatic experience. And then there’s Russia. Tillerson has hardly been tough on Russia, prioritizing attempts at cooperation over pushing back against clearly destabilizing actions by Russia, including its interference in the 2016 election. While Pompeo held critical views of Russia during his time in Congress and has admitted that Russia interfered in the election, it’s unclear for which policies Pompeo will advocate. To those ends, there are reasons for concern: at Trump’s request, Pompeo met with a conspiracy theorist peddling the falsehood that the hack of the Democratic National Committee’s emails in 2016 was an inside job, not Russian hacking. He also falsely claimed that the CIA concluded that Russian meddling did not affect the election’s outcome. As war rages in Syria and Ukraine, and Russia continues interfering in US politics, Pompeo will be a key player in leading US policy on all. At the end of the day, the president directs foreign policy, and no change in personnel will alter the unique chaos of Trump’s foreign policy. But if past is prologue, Pompeo appears much more willing than Tillerson to toe Trump’s line – a very dangerous prospect. This development may prove that no matter how bad things look, in Donald Trump’s administration, they can always get worse.

Unshackled Trump making more unilateral decisions","bodyText":"Donald Trump has demonstrated yet again that he is the opposite of his reality TV persona who relished telling contestants to their face: “You’re fired!” In real life, FBI director James Comey learned of his termination last year from television screens in a room where he was making a speech to bureau agents in Los Angeles. And on Tuesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson found out about his demise when Trump announced it in a tweet, according to state department officials. Strangely for a hard-nosed, swaggering New York businessman, Trump appears to have a congenital aversion to delivering the bad news in person when it’s not a TV show. Former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus was also ousted by tweet, while former chief strategist Steve Bannon got wind of his imminent removal while Trump was at Camp David. But why now for the secretary of state? Tillerson – who had reportedly branded Trump “a fucking moron” and been challenged by the president to an IQ test – appeared to have weathered the worst storm. Last November, White House officials let it be known there was a plan to replace him but, after a lunch with Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Trump proclaimed that it was all “fake news”. The secretary of state reached his first anniversary in charge. Perhaps even he was surprised. At an event with one of his predecessors, Condoleezza Rice, in Stanford, California, in January, he was sufficiently relaxed to joke about Trump: “Well, he’s world class at social media and I’m not and I want to confess here in the heart of the creation of this great technology, I have no social media accounts. I have never had any and I don’t intend to have any.” But as the low-tech Tillerson trudged on, something changed in the White House in recent weeks. The turnover of staff, already dizzying, gathered even more momentum. Many close observers have described Trump as newly unfiltered and unshackled, with fewer and fewer pairs of hands to save him from himself. This has two components. First, more unilateral decision-making by Trump himself. Last week alone he followed one of his few core ideological beliefs by announcing trade tariffs on steel and aluminium, despite warnings of a global trade war, then suddenly said he was ready to meet North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Secondly, personnel. Trump is creating an administration in his own image, not likely to contradict him but rather to provide affirmation. Less a team of rivals than a chorus of praise singers. “So I’ve gotten to know a lot of people very well over the last year and I’m really at a point where we’re getting very close to having the cabinet and other things that I want,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. The tariffs decision led to the resignation of his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, another moderating influence who had dared to disagree. The North Korean move exposed how Tillerson was being left out of the loop. On Tuesday, Trump also highlighted how the two men differ over the Iran nuclear deal, with Tillerson in favor and Trump against. Trump’s replacement secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is on “the same wavelength” as his boss, as the president put it. Trump and Tillerson, an imperious corporate CEO from Texas, did not have that kind of chemistry, and the president’s mind was made up by the end of last week. Chief of staff John Kelly called – and woke up – the secretary during his tour of Africa, though what was said remains disputed. Disagreements over Russia in the past 24 hours were therefore not decisive, and Pompeo is no fan of Vladimir Putin. The exact timing seems best explained by Tillerson having arrived back on US soil on Tuesday morning. Even so, the optics of firing him soon after he condemned Russia in appreciably harsher terms than the White House were jarring. It also remains perpetually curious that Trump shows more respect to Putin than Tillerson or Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Other potential side-effects for the news cycle: the Tillerson story may overshadow Tuesday night’s House special election in Pennsylvania, where a Trump-backed Republican appears on course for defeat, as well as the dismissal of White House aide John McEntee and allegations of Trump having had an extramarital affair with pornographic actor Stormy Daniels. Whether these were on the president’s mind when he hit send on his tweet is, of course, anyone’s guess."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/13/lizzie-kelly-cheltenham-dream-ride-coo-star-sivola-ultima","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T18:51:06Z","webTitle":"Lizzie Kelly turns nightmare into dream Cheltenham ride on Coo Star Sivola","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/13/lizzie-kelly-cheltenham-dream-ride-coo-star-sivola-ultima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/13/lizzie-kelly-cheltenham-dream-ride-coo-star-sivola-ultima","fields":{"headline":"Lizzie Kelly turns nightmare into dream Cheltenham ride on Coo Star Sivola","bodyText":"There can be few public embarrassments to match being dumped on the turf in front of the Cheltenham grandstands after jumping only two fences in a Gold Cup and few better ripostes than a winner on your next afternoon at the Festival. “After last year, I made my peace with never being a Cheltenham Festival winner,” Lizzie Kelly said after winning the Ultima Handicap Chase on Coo Star Sivola. “And now I am.” Kelly was the first female jockey to ride in the Gold Cup for 33 years last season and her desolation after falling from Tea For Two was one of the abiding images of the meeting. She also had the pick of two runners from the Nick Williams stable in the Fred Winter – and got off the 33-1 winner. Yet she rode a nerveless race on Coo Star Sivola, rewarding the faith of the backers who sent them off favourite at 5-1. Kelly was settled behind the leaders from the off and while there was a moment when it seemed she might have hit the front a second too soon, she got an exceptional jump from Coo Star Sivola at the last. That earned them a lead which was shrinking all the way to the line but enough to resist the challenge of Shantou Flyer by a head. “I came here today and it was like I had grown up five years,” Kelly said. “This time around, I was much more relaxed and I had a dream ride. Coo Star Sivola travelled really well and jumped from fence to fence. I knew he would gallop all the way up the hill but that was like the longest hill in the world. I was half-watching the camera so I could see what was coming but he felt it too and it just feels so surreal.” Willie Mullins took the Arkle Trophy Novices’ Chase for the third time in four years as Footpad beat four rivals under a masterful ride by Ruby Walsh. A less experienced jockey might have panicked as Petit Mouchoir and Saint Calvados raced clear of the field but Walsh cruised closer on the run to the home turn and passed the post 14 lengths clear of the runner-up, Brain Power. “His jumping has just gone up another gear [after switching from hurdles to fences],” Mullins said, “and he can stay, so we might just have a Gold Cup horse on our hands.” Mullins completed a treble thanks to Benie Des Dieux in the Mares’ Hurdle and Rathvinden, with his son Patrick in the saddle, in the National Hunt Chase."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-spring-statement-more-bad-news","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T18:32:19Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the spring statement: more bad news | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-spring-statement-more-bad-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-spring-statement-more-bad-news","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the spring statement: more bad news","bodyText":"This country is supposed to leave the European Union in 2019. Just when Britain needs to muster all its resources, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts the economy will grow at only 1.3% – half the rate it did a decade ago. Clearly, something has gone badly wrong. Yet instead of identifying the problem and fixing it, Conservative chancellors have made a bad situation worse by running perverse austerity programmes. Philip Hammond had a chance to change tack today and adopt a new economic model based on an activist fiscal policy which would boost public spending and produce the jobs people want and need. This would have been a message of hope and security in bewildering times. But Mr Hammond was unmoved. Instead he labelled detractors of his austerity plans “Eeyores”, claiming he was more Tiggerish about the UK’s outlook. Pooh-like is a polite way of describing such unwarranted optimism. The chancellor’s plans for a sustainable recovery rest upon a combination of marketisation, public spending restraint – alleviated by some extra cash – and tax cuts. These are just the same failed austerity policies repackaged for a wearier age. The chancellor continues to take advantage of the fallout of the financial crisis to shrivel the state. His problem is that his policies are shrinking the economy faster. The UK is now experiencing the weakest growth since Clement Attlee was prime minister and the longest squeeze in living standards since the Napoleonic wars. Contrary to Mr Hammond’s assertion, income inequality is going up and under the Conservatives the rich are benefiting at everyone else’s expense. Average earnings are flatlining. Families struggling to make ends meet will be hit by the biggest annual benefits cut for six years. Thousands of people now sleep on the streets while more than a million food bank parcels are handed out every year. What Mr Hammond sees as a vision is really myopia. The relentless squeeze on state finances has meant public services have been either shut down, rationed, shrunk, or allowed to get worse. The Conservatives have got away with inflicting wide-scale damage on the country by reframing the economic debate after the crash. The public accepted the necessity of austerity in part because they had been conditioned to think of the economy as a household with the nation’s credit card maxed-out. This is poppycock. The documents released on Tuesday reveal that the original plan to eliminate the deficit will not be achieved until well into the next decade. That would mean almost 20 years of public spending cuts. It’s important to recognise that if the Conservatives wanted to achieve a budget surplus, they could have done so by this year but they decided since 2010 to cut taxes instead. People have wised up to these sleights of hand. Aware of this shift in the public mood, Mr Hammond now warns that the national debt of £1.8tn – 86.5% of GDP – “is higher than a safe level”. The chancellor knows this is wrong but is happy to dissemble in the service of an ideological agenda. Britain has historically seen much higher levels of public debt, notably when the welfare state was created. Countries that borrow in their own currencies never have to default on their debt. The calculated undermining of growth by austerity and the government’s tardy appreciation of zombie banks’ lack of lending has reduced aggregate demand and left Britons working less efficiently on lower wages. Mr Hammond needs to update his worldview. To refuse to do so would be bad for him – and bad for Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/13/philip-hammond-public-spending-increases-spring-statement","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T19:24:40Z","webTitle":"Philip Hammond hints at public spending increases later this year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/philip-hammond-public-spending-increases-spring-statement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/philip-hammond-public-spending-increases-spring-statement","fields":{"headline":"Philip Hammond hints at public spending increases later this year","bodyText":"Philip Hammond has dropped the broadest possible hint that he will announce spending increases later this year as he sought to use a modest improvement in the public finances to indicate more money was on the way for hard-pressed public services. The chancellor seized on new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility showing a £5bn drop in the government’s budget deficit to say that he expected to have scope to act in his autumn budget. Hammond was accused of “astounding complacency” by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, but said higher spending had to be accompanied by further action to reduce government borrowing and the national debt. “If, in the autumn, the public finances continue to reflect the improvements that today’s report hints at, then in accordance with our balanced approach ... I would have the capacity to enable further increases in public spending and investment in the years ahead,” the chancellor said. The first spring statement, the replacement for the traditional March budget, was designed to include no new tax or spending decisions but did announce: That Britain’s post-Brexit payments to the EU could continue until at least the mid-2060s. A consultation that could lead to the end of the 1p and 2p coins and the £50 note. The possibility of lower vehicle excise duty for vans using cleaner fuels. Although the chancellor was in upbeat mood as he presented his statement, the OBR said not much had changed since the government’s independent forecaster issued its last set of economic and financial forecasts in November 2017, which contained a sharp downgrade of the economy’s long-term growth potential. “The economy has slightly more momentum in the near term, thanks to the unexpected strength of the world economy, but there seems little reason to change our view of its medium-term growth potential,” said the OBR. Over the next five years, the OBR said it expected growth to average 1.4% a year, with a slightly better performance in 2018 matched by a weaker forecast for 2021 and 2022, with growth expectations revised down by 0.1 percentage points to 1.4% and 1.5% respectively. It noted that average earnings adjusted for inflation would increase by just 3.5% over the next half decade, leaving them similar to their 2007-2008 level in 2022-23. The forecaster also warned that there had been seven recessions in the past six decades and that there was a 50-50 chance of another one in the next five years. McDonnell said: ”Today we have the indefensible spectacle of a chancellor congratulating himself on marginally improved economic forecasts, while refusing to lift a finger as councils go bust, the NHS and social care are in crisis, school budgets are cut, homelessness has doubled, and wages are falling.” The head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, Paul Johnson, said the economic forecasts were “dreadful”. Hammond repeatedly took aim at Labour during his speech, hinting at the battle lines for a future general election clash by claiming McDonnell’s economic policies would “undermine our recovery, threaten investment in British jobs, burden the next generation and waste billions and billions of pounds more on debt interest”. By contrast, he repeatedly promised to take a “balanced approach”, adding: “There is indeed light at the end of the tunnel, but we have to make absolutely sure that it is not the shadow chancellor’s train hurtling out of control in the other direction towards Labour’s next economic train wreck,” he said. Hammond’s statement was warmly cheered by Conservative MPs, a growing number of whom have been warning Downing Street about the intense pressure on public services in their constituencies. Johnny Mercer, the MP for Plymouth Moor View, said, “the great news about the debt he’s talked about is important; but it’s not going to win us many voters on the doorstep. But he talked about increasing public spending, and he sent a strong signal on the NHS – and I’ll be lobbying away between now and the autumn and trying to make that happen.” By November, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, hopes to have agreed the outlines of the UK’s future relationship with the EU27, allowing the OBR to carry out a more detailed forecast. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, welcomed Hammond’s upbeat tone, but said he was right to be cautious about turning on the spending taps, and should not “undermine our own argument about fixing the roof while the sun is shining”. “I’m not sure anyone would say that the sun’s really out at the moment,” she added. Labour’s Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business select committee, said: “It’s all jam tomorrow. What schools and hospitals need is money now.” The OBR also set out full details of the Brexit bill the government agreed to pay in December’s EU withdrawal agreement. It estimates that about 75% of the £37bn financial settlement will be paid by 2022 – with smaller payments, based on future EU pension liabilities, extending to at least 2064. By 2022-23, that means the government will be paying £5.8bn less to the EU than as a member – but the OBR said that sum has been more than accounted for by spending pledges such as maintaining the level of farm subsidies, and continuing payments into some key EU institutions. Taking back control of Britain’s EU contributions became a key element of the leave campaign during the 2017 general election, with Vote Leave suggesting they could be diverted to the NHS. But the OBR warned the economic effects of Brexit would likely outweigh the reduced contributions into the budget. “It is important not to view these figures in isolation,” it said. “While this is one of the more direct ways in which leaving the EU impacts upon the public finances, it is unlikely to be the largest one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/13/rex-tillerson-iran-nuclear-deal-us-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T19:49:49Z","webTitle":"Fears grow for future of Iran nuclear deal in wake of Tillerson's removal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/rex-tillerson-iran-nuclear-deal-us-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/rex-tillerson-iran-nuclear-deal-us-eu","fields":{"headline":"Fears grow for future of Iran nuclear deal in wake of Tillerson's removal","bodyText":"The abrupt dismissal of Rex Tillerson as US secretary of state was seen overseas as a hardening of the Donald Trump’s America First policy, a serious blow to the future of the Iran nuclear deal, and a possible harbinger of a full-blown trade war with the European Union. In his brief comments on Tillerson’s removal, Trump mentioned policy disagreements over Iran. The US president has made no secret of his distaste for the multilateral 2015 deal – known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan for Action – which imposed strict curbs on the Iranian nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Tillerson, by contrast, had consistently argued that the US should remain in step with European allies and support the agreement. On Tuesday, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tweeted: “Mr Trump has made habit of being unpredictable and thus unreliable for anybody to engage with. Nobody will be interested in reaching any agreement with the White House if US signature only good for 4-8 yrs.” Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, will also be unnerved at the likely impact of Tillerson’s dismissal on the Iran deal. France, Germany and the UK have been under relentless US and Gulf pressure to tear up the deal, or at least add supplementary treaties, covering the Iranian ballistic missile programme. Although France and the UK agree with the US on Iranian ballistic missiles, the EU defends the overall deal not just as a successful contribution to nuclear disarmament, but as a symbol of multilateralism in action. Tillerson’s successor, Mike Pompeo, has been critical of the Iran deal. In his year leading the CIA, Pompeo approved new authorities to target leaders of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps through intelligence operations. In Germany, politicians expressed fears that Tillerson’s departure reveals Trump is determined to wage a full-scale trade war with the EU, a move that Tillerson – a former businessman – had opposed. In remarks aimed at Berlin, Trump at the weekend tweeted: “Many of the countries that treat us the worst in trade and military are our allies, as others like to call them.” He followed this up with an attack on Mercedes-Benz. Michael Roth, a deputy foreign minister for Europe, tweeted: “The firing of Rex Tillerson won’t make things better...” Center-left lawmaker Thomas Oppermann described Tillerson as “a reliable, intelligent interlocutor” whose departure would be a “further setback for German-American relations”. Oppermann, the deputy speaker of parliament, said Trump’s decision showed the US president was “capricious and erratic”. In Moscow, Tillerson’s removal – shortly after he had condemned Russia over the poisoning of the Russian double agent Sergei Skripal – was mocked by a foreign ministry spokeswoman, who asked whether Vladimir Putin was already being blamed for his dismissal. But British politicians drew a circumstantial link between Tillerson’s strong statement of support for the UK in its diplomatic battle with Moscow and Trump’s decision to fire him. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokeswoman, Jo Swinson, said: “Trump fires Tillerson after he expressed support for UK over Russia attack. Clear message: ‘special relationship’ with Trump’s US administration is worse than meaningless. Putting all our trade eggs in the US basket is madness.” Pat McFadden, the former Labour Europe minister, implied Trump’s true special relationship was with Vladimir Putin, saying: “When the White House said they would stand by their closest ally we thought they meant us.” Former Labour cabinet minister Liam Byrne said: “Secretary Tillerson &amp; US State Department stood with us over Russia this week – now the White House needs to do the same.” The abrupt departure was a blow for Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, since in a statement on Tuesday morning he had leaned heavily on Tillerson’s support for the UK position – only hours before Tillerson was given the final vote of no confidence by Trump. No 10 later said: “We are grateful for the excellent relationship and cooperation that we have had with Rex Tillerson and look forward to that continuing under the new US secretary of state.” Tillerson’s departure is likely to please Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who have been frustrated by his even-handed response to their dispute with Qatar. And when Saudi Arabia and its Emirati allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in June, Trump immediately took Riyadh’s side while Tillerson criticised the Saudi ambush and tried to broker a solution. But Gulf expert Michael Stephens at the defence thinktank Rusi said: “If anyone from the Gulf really thinks a US administration as dysfunctional as the current one is suddenly going to see things their way because Tillerson left, they’re quite badly wrong. There is no new dawn … policy will stay as it is.” The crown prince of Saudia Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, is due to visit Washington next week and has relied upon the White House rather than the state department for political support. Saudi Arabia’s great ally in the Gulf, the UAE, had privately lobbied for Tillerson’s dismissal, according to emails leaked to the New York Times."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/13/why-you-need-baby-wipes-in-your-spy-kit","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T17:48:06Z","webTitle":"Why you need baby wipes in your spy kit | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/13/why-you-need-baby-wipes-in-your-spy-kit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/13/why-you-need-baby-wipes-in-your-spy-kit","fields":{"headline":"Why you need baby wipes in your spy kit","bodyText":"I have always wondered what the secret ingredient of baby wipes was (‘Perhaps they should have got the army in a little earlier’, 12 March), which I have used for many household purposes, notably to remove paint splatters.

In every generation as people grow older, they become more economically and socially conservative. As they accumulate wealth, redistribution becomes less appealing, unemployment less of a threat and inflation more frightening. Social liberalism also becomes jarring. While societal change is stressful, it is especially disruptive when we get older. Studies reveal that as we age we become less intellectually curious, less tolerant of ambiguity and less tolerant of change in our environment. This conservativism is even deemed to reduce stress among older voters. In the past, this voter attrition was mitigated by partisan loyalty. However, after decades of declines in party identification and the relevance of social class, it has become more difficult to hold on to these voters. Merely maintaining the party’s level of support requires replacing these lost voters with new ones. In contrast to the older demographic, the party’s core policies are most attractive to those under 45 years of age. The challenge is to repeatedly and comprehensively win over these voters; the party must capture the zeitgeist of each generation as it comes of age. This requires repeated reinvention, and requires the party to be the vanguard of economic and social progress. Centre-left parties have, in many cases, ignored this necessity at their peril. They have focused on their existing coalition while hoping the prevailing economic winds might blow in their favour. They have allowed their focus on “equality” to slip from wealth and income inequality to identity politics, which yields little concrete support and necessarily alienates them from their base. The decline of the centre-left across Europe is in sharp focus in France, Germany and Italy. In Britain, the necessity for repeated renewal is represented not only by Tony Blair’s “modernise or die” mantra but also the change under Jeremy Corbyn. While a different generation needs a different message, the importance of appealing to a new generation is consistent across both leaderships. It is clear that Corbyn has managed to reconstitute the Labour party as representing younger voters defined by being on the left and against the current trajectory of Brexit. While this coalition needs to be targeted with emphasis on the left and on remain, party strategists and MPs will continue to be haunted by the “former Labour voter”. This is a risk. Focusing on the voters the party will (unavoidably) lose rather than the ones it could win paralyses the dynamism required for the party to convey a coherent message. One infamous example of this under the Ed Miliband regime was his turn towards a restrictive policy on immigration, which only served to undermine his authenticity. Deep down, the Labour party has a sentimental attachment to the notion of representing the working-class voter. This undermines the party’s dynamism. It is not the noble cause of seeking to represent ordinary people on lower pay that is foolhardy, rather the hypothesised notion of a homogenous working-class voter. To a pollster, it is clear that social class is an archaic classification that bears little resemblance to the complexities of post-industrialised societies. Put simply, there is no longer a broad homogenous group of “working-class” people with the same titles, pay, conditions and lifestyles dictating their social attitudes. When baseline personality traits drive attitudinal differences within social classes, it is clear that it is impossible to capture the demographic group that effectively no longer exists. Undoubtedly, the Labour party can and should still target voters with poor working conditions, rights and prospects. Indeed, there is plenty to oppose in the context of global capitalism in the 21st century, including the impact of automation, unregulated labour markets, weak regulation of financial markets, rampant global inequality, and chronic housing shortages. Furthermore, there is a moral imperative to do so that is fully in line with the values of the Labour party. However, these issues align more closely with younger voters who, as it stands, according to the Resolution Foundation, are the first generation expected to earn less than their parents. These voters also overwhelmingly voted remain. The most recent election successes in Kensington and Canterbury have undoubtedly caused an unease among those with notions of what the Labour vote “should be”, with particular concern for the type of voter the Labour party is attracting under a potential policy of opposing the current trajectory of Brexit. However, these constituencies represent a very small proportion of the Labour vote. The leftwing credentials of Labour remainers (those who supported both Labour and remain in the 2016 and 2017 elections) are in fact no less pronounced than those of Labour leavers. Indeed, evidence from the British Election Study indicates that, on average, Labour remainers place themselves marginally to the left of Labour leavers. Indeed, they are also just as likely to disagree with the notion that private enterprise is the best way to solve Britain’s problems, and just as likely to agree that major public services and industries should be in public ownership. While some traditional heartlands are now more difficult for Labour is partly the result of the decline in importance of social class and part the result of the ageing composition of those constituencies as a consequence of the wave of urban migration that followed the global economic crisis. It is undoubtedly the case that the Labour party’s future is, as always, with younger voters and, at least for a short time, in the context of the UK leaving the EU and the problems faced by those under 45, the party should seek to represent those views. After all, it is also abundantly clear that Labour remainers are far more concerned with Brexit, while Labour leavers are not. • Kevin Cunningham is a former targeting and analysis manager for the Labour party"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/13/the-state-of-21st-century-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T17:48:31Z","webTitle":"The state of 21st-century football | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/13/the-state-of-21st-century-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/13/the-state-of-21st-century-football","fields":{"headline":"The state of 21st-century football","bodyText":"I laughed at almost every line of Anthony Clavane’s diatribe (Spitting on the grave of what was once a beautiful game, 13 March).

Corinthian values were in short supply on and off the pitch during the 60s and 70s: skinhead thuggery was endemic, full-on pitch invasions by fans were commonplace, and football hard men stalked every match.

The agreement has been hailed as a “major step forward” in acting on recommendations made by the royal commission into child protection and detention. Both governments have previously voiced overall support for the recommendations but costs and funding reviews have been points of friction in recent weeks. A particular sticking point was the NT’s refusal to let the Productivity Commission review commonwealth expenditure on NT child services. On Thursday the federal minister for social services, Dan Tehan, and assistant minister for children and families, David Gillespie, met members of the NT Labor government, including the chief minister, Michael Gunner, in Darwin. According to the NT government the two parties agreed to establish a joint coordinated funding framework “which would provide an agreed approach to the planning, funding and delivery of services for families and children”. It would also “set the groundwork to have a coordinated approach to funding – this would be a major step forward in providing coordinated services that support all children and families in the Territory”, the statement said. The NT government has called for the federal government to match financial commitments for rebuilding youth detention centres, as well as assisting in other aspects of the required overhaul of the protection and detention systems. It spent $27m on its share of the royal commission’s running costs, as well as a further $16m in legal bills and staffing. The NT government had pushed back on calls for a review into its spending of commonwealth funds, claiming the recommended review referred to commonwealth-funded services in the NT, and Gunner would instruct public servants not to cooperate. Thursday’s announcement appeared to be a reversal of the government’s position. Multiple NT governments have been found to have spent federal funds drawn from GST revenue in areas other than what was intended, prompting accusations of siphoning money away from Indigenous disadvantage and avoiding transparency. Last month Gunner accused the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, of calling the royal commission only as a PR stunt, after the federal government said it was not responsible for most of the more than 230 recommendations. “It’s clear from the prime minister’s response and the Australian government’s response to the royal commissions that their only motivation for calling this was dealing with an issue at the time,” he said last month. “It’s crisis management.” On Thursday the NT government said the ministers welcomed the chance for a “frank and positive conversation”. “Discussions were positive, constructive and practical. The importance of working together to address the recommendations of the royal commission was strongly supported.” Thursday’s announcement included the establishment of a tripartite government and community sector forum to oversee youth justice and protection policies, and the development of a 10-year “generational strategy”. Earlier this month the NT government gave full or in principle support to all but 10 of the recommendations, but would not guarantee funding until after a budget review. The offices of the NT minister for Territory families and the chief minister were contacted for further information.

The foreign secretary said Russia had deliberately chosen the Soviet-era nerve agent novichok in the Salisbury attack as a warning to opponents of Vladimir Putin. Theresa May will visit Salisbury on Thursday to meet local businesses and members of the public, as well as receiving a briefing from Public Health England. Speaking as the international community rallied behind the UK, including the previously sceptical French, Johnson said: “Russia is the only country known to have developed this type of agent. I’m afraid the evidence is overwhelming that it is Russia.” Commenting on Russia’s dismissal of the accusation, he told BBC News: “There is something in the kind of smug, sarcastic response that we’ve heard that indicates their fundamental guilt. They want to simultaneously deny it, yet at the same time to glory in it.” He also suggested that Putin had some responsibility for the attack. “There is very little doubt in people’s minds that this is a signature act by the Russia state – deliberately using novichok, a nerve agent developed by Russia to punish a Russian defector as they would see it, and in the run up to Vladimir Putin’s election. “This was a former Russian agent living in this country who had been singled out already by the Russian state as an object for revenge and retaliation, and Vladimir Putin has been on the TV only recently saying that such people deserve to be poisoned, to choke on their own 30 pieces of silver. This is a way of showing look at what happens to people who stand up to our regime.” Johnson said he had been “very heartened” by the strength of the support around the world for Britain’s stance against Russia. On Wednesday a spokesman for the French president, Emmanuel Macron, cautioned the UK not to engage in “fantasy politics”. But on Thursday after holding talks with Theresa May on the incident, Macron shifted stance, saying France shared the UK’s conclusion that there was “no other plausible explanation” other than the involvement of Russia. The Elysée Palace said the UK had “kept France closely informed of the clues gathered by British investigators” as well as the “evidence demonstrating the responsibility of Russia in the attack”. France “accepts this conclusion” and “expresses its full solidarity with its ally”, the statement said. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, gave unambiguous support to the UK at the security council. Pressed repeatedly on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about earlier French scepticism about the UK’s claims, Johnson said: “President Macron has issued a very strong statement of condemnation.” He added: “Different French spokespeople were saying different things.” Johnson also confirmed the UK would provide samples of the nerve agent used in the attack to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. He said: “We have been entirely in conformity with OPCW procedures … We will be submitting a sample so that they can look at the novichok and make their own assessment. We believe the evidence is absolutely overwhelming.” He defended the UK’s decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats in response to the attack. He said: “What we have done in expelling 23 diplomats, probably undeclared agents, is something far beyond what Vladimir Putin had bargained for. We have basically eviscerated his intelligence capabilities in this country for decades to come.” Johnson’s comments come after he employed deliberately Churchillian language in an opinion piece for the Washington Post, writing: “A tranquil medieval city has witnessed the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since World War II.” He added: “Britain is striving to uphold the rules on which the safety of every country depends. I hope and believe that our friends will stand alongside us. “There is a reason for choosing novichok. In its blatant Russian-ness, the nerve agent sends a signal to all who may be thinking of dissent in the intensifying repression of Putin’s Russia.” Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, accused Britain of refusing to cooperate with Moscow in the investigation of the incident. Zakharova, who said Moscow was concerned about the use of chemical weapons in Britain, said allegations that Russia was involved were “insane”. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has chaired an across-government ministerial recovery group, to begin plans for the clean-up operation after the attack. A Downing Street spokesman said May would also be continuing conversations with world leaders. The prime minister’s national security advisor Mark Sedwill will address Nato later on Thursday. “We are looking for a robust international response,” the spokesman said, adding the precise action was still being discussed. “We have spoken with our allies, there’s been a very positive response. The conversations continue to take place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/mar/16/unions-business-bashing-ads-fall-off-the-back-of-a-bus-the-weekly-beast","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T22:55:33Z","webTitle":"Union's business-bashing ads fall off the back of a bus | The Weekly Beast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/16/unions-business-bashing-ads-fall-off-the-back-of-a-bus-the-weekly-beast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/mar/16/unions-business-bashing-ads-fall-off-the-back-of-a-bus-the-weekly-beast","fields":{"headline":"Unions' business-bashing ads fall off the back of a bus","bodyText":"The union movement launched a multi-million dollar advertising campaign on Sunday, its biggest in a decade, with the simple message that big business has too much power and that working people must “change the rules” to get better pay and more secure jobs. The TV ads created for the Australian Council of Trade Unions have the tagline: “It’s time to change the rules.” But the expensive and well-planned campaign to appeal to Australian workers hit a snag when billboard company APN Outdoor changed its mind and refused to carry the ads on the back of buses across the east coast capital cities. The ACTU says the creative had been approved by the company, only to be turned down later. APN Outdoor is now run by James Warburton, who hit the headlines when his very short stint as CEO of Network Ten came to an end. The reason given by APN for cancelling the booking was that the ads were “too negative”. Canberra airport meanwhile said they were too political. “We were disappointed but not surprised that some bookings were cancelled, even after creative materials had been approved,” ACTU chief of staff Ben Davison told Weekly Beast. “The notion that working people should have the power to negotiate on an even footing with big business is one that does not necessarily sit comfortably with the owners and senior management of some big media businesses. “All materials carried an authorisation. The AEC guidelines state that when in doubt material should be authorised and we erred on the side of caution.” In a swipe at the ACTU’s campaign, the Australian reported on Friday that the woman who plays the single mum struggling to make ends meet in the TV ads, is actually a successful actor, corporate trainer and facilitator. Ballard to worse Tom Ballard’s Tonightly show may have had the last word this week on the segment on Seven’s Sunrise show that had critics crying racism. The ABC comedy show created its own panel which called for the “white media pundits” on Sunrise – host Samantha Armytage, Prue McSween and Ben Davis – to be removed from television for their own good. “They’re clearly distressed, probably in danger,” Ballard said echoing the Sunrise panel’s call for Indigenous kids to be removed from their families. As it happens, by Thursday the entire Hot Topics segment had been removed from Seven’s social media accounts after the network had been defending it all week. Seven says the clip was taken down for for copyright reasons. We think the widespread condemnation and a complaint to broadcasting authorities from David Shoebridge, Greens MLA in New South Wales, may have had something to do with it. “Armytage made no attempt condemn or rebuke it. No Aboriginal voice was referred to or given prominence in this unbalanced and one-sided ‘debate’,” Shoebridge wrote to the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The Sunrise segment picked up on front-page reports in the major News Corp tabloids. The federal minister quoted by the News Corp papers, David Gillespie told the Guardian he never used the words “white families”. But reporter Natasha Bita and her editor Sam Weir at the Courier Mail told Weekly Beast on Thursday they had still not received a complaint from the minister about the story. Cake news The ABC is under so much pressure to be balanced it appears no story is complete without the opposing view, not even a radio feature on a landmark legal case in the US supreme court. A complaint about the excellent Law Report program on Radio National only presenting one perspective has been upheld by ABC’s independent Audience and Consumer Affairs. “The program featured an interview with James Esseks, a lawyer who acts for the couple at the centre of the ‘Masterpiece cake’ case, currently before the US supreme court. The case is focussed on the right of a baker to refuse to supply a cake to a homosexual wedding. The segment was timely and newsworthy, as the Australian parliament was then debating the passage of the same-sex marriage bill. However, given the degree of contention, the fact that Mr Esseks was a key protagonist for one side of the Masterpiece cake shop case, and the failure of the program to provide further viewpoints or necessary context, the ABC acknowledged that the interview was not in keeping with the ABC’s editorial standards for impartiality and diversity of perspectives.” Sunday mourning The negative press is growing for Lisa Wilkinson and her new gig at network Ten. Wilkinson was praised late last year for taking a stand and leaving Today after management refused to give her equal pay with her Today co-host Karl Stefanovic. But Nine CEO, Hugh Marks, denied she was a victim of gender-pay disparity. Nine said she didn’t have equal pay with Stefanovic because he had a bigger role. So Wilkinson inked a deal with Ten to co-host The Sunday Project, a strange fit because it’s aiming for a younger demographic. But the former Nine breakfast star has been dogged by rumours that her exorbitant Ten salary, reportedly $2m, has angered her co-hosts at the Project, including Carrie Bickmore. Now the ratings are coming in and they aren’t good. When she first appeared on the Sunday Project the show attracted 481,000 viewers in the five capital cities but by last Sunday that had dropped to just 227,000 viewers by 6.30pm. By comparison Married at First Sight on her old network had 1.34 million. Wilkinson has been given a second string to her bow in the new role of executive editor of Ten’s yet to launch Ten Daily, a digital news project. Double bolt Hardly a week goes by without Andrew Bolt saying something outrageous and we often try to ignore him, but this week we thought it was worth noting his comments about the ABC’s new radio host Sami Shah. Shah and co-host Jacinta Parsons replaced veteran Red Symonds on Melbourne Radio’s breakfast show this year and as expected the ratings have dropped for their first survey. Bolt blames it all on the ABC’s political correctness and the replacement of a white man with a brown man. “And at the end of last year Symons was out, replaced by co-hosts Sami Shah and Jacinta Parsons,” Bolt wrote. “The white bloke with an Australian accent was replaced by a brown one with a thick Pakistani accent and by a woman. “Shah had the leftist views obligatory at the ABC. He hated Donald Trump, abused immigration minister Peter Dutton and tweeted: ‘Make America Go Away.’ Culturally, he fitted in. But professionally he and Parsons fell short.” Shah responded on Twitter that he wasn’t hired “because I’m brown or I’m Muslim” and that he was an English major from the University of Virginia, had published four books in English, “spent over a decade in print and broadcast (TV &amp; Radio) journalism, and even worked for BBC Radio 4”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/20/warped-and-elitist-are-australias-selective-schools-failing-the-fairness-test","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T21:31:12Z","webTitle":"'Warped and elitist': are Australia’s selective schools failing the fairness test?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/20/warped-and-elitist-are-australias-selective-schools-failing-the-fairness-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/20/warped-and-elitist-are-australias-selective-schools-failing-the-fairness-test","fields":{"headline":"'Warped and elitist': are Australia’s selective schools failing the fairness test?","bodyText":"Monica Garcia-Pineda remembers feeling as though the partially selective Sydney high school she attended was made up of two completely different places. “I can’t describe it in any other way,” she says. “It felt like going to two schools. There was always this divide between the selective and community kids, because you weren’t treated like you were in the same school. “The selective kids were always encouraged to choose more academically challenging subjects so there was very little opportunity for the cohort to kind of be alongside one another in class, which affects how you socialise when you’re not in class. “We used to sit on different sides of the quad.” Selective school policies have come under increased scrutiny in recent months as state governments grapple with evidence that the schools are overwhelmingly populated by students from advantaged backgrounds and may be reinforcing existing class differences. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The overwhelming majority of Australia’s selective schools are in New South Wales – 19 fully selective and 29 partially selective. Its education department last year announced a review of competitive entry tests to address concerns that the system was being gamed by wealthy families who could afford tutoring. Garcia-Pineda was a selective student at Macquarie Fields high school in Sydney’s south-west. She grew up in Wattle Grove, only about 12km away but another world in the socially complex jumble of Sydney’s western suburbs. “I never used to hang out in the area at all,” she says. “I really didn’t feel like I was part of it.” Macquarie Fields is demographically typical of western Sydney. Unemployment is higher and wages are lower than the Australian average. Fewer people are university educated and the population is dramatically more multicultural than the rest of the country. A few years before Garcia-Pineda graduated in 2008, Macquarie Fields made national headlines when teenagers threw stones and molotov cocktails at police officers during riots sparked by the deaths of two local teenagers who were killed during a police car chase. The statistics are reflected in the makeup of most of the local public schools. Education data published by the federal government breaks school populations down into four “socio-educational” advantage quartiles. At Ingleburn high school, 2km away from Macquarie Fields, 54% of students come from the bottom quartile while only 3% come from the top. At another neighbouring school, Sarah Redfern high, the figures are almost identical. Both neighbouring schools rank below the national average for educational advantage, a yardstick determined using the Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage, or Icsea, which measures factors such as parents’ occupations, education level and the location of the school. But at Macquarie Fields only 15% of the students come from the lowest advantage quartile, and 27% are from the top. Its Icsea score of 1,054 is above the national average of 1,000. It’s a trend which is reproduced over and over across Australia wherever selective schools are found. Analysis of My School data by Guardian Australia reveals that students at selective schools are strikingly more advantaged than other nearby schools. They are overwhelmingly attended by the most educationally advantaged students and in many cases are dramatically unrepresentative of the suburbs in which they are located. The divide is more pronounced in fully selective schools than partially selective. In fact, Guardian Australia’s analysis found that in some cases partially selective schools are less advantaged than their neighbours. But at fully selective schools such as Penrith high school in western Sydney, the Icsea is 1,163, compared with an average score of 976 at the 20 closest schools. Only 1% of the school’s students are from the bottom advantage quartile. At Jamison high school, about 3km away, the figure is 42%. The trend is even apparent for schools in highly affluent areas of Sydney and Melbourne, though these have the smallest gap between selective and non-selective. The difference comes in part because selective schools do not have geographic catchment areas like public schools and can therefore be attended by students from anywhere in the state. Education data suggests some selective schools may be becoming more advantaged over time. In 2013 the average score for students at Macquarie Fields was 1,047, rising to 1,054 in 2017. But changes to the way the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (Acara) calculates disadvantage means it’s impossible to accurately assess how much the school’s demographics have changed over a longer period. Christina Ho, an academic from the University of Technology, Sydney, says selective schools are reinforcing class and cultural divisions. “They’re elitist. And not only are they elitist but they’re becoming more elitist,” Ho says. Any review of selective schools’ admissions would amount to “tinkering around the edges” of a system she says has become “warped”. “There is obviously an education culture emerging that means these schools have a certain kind of status within the community which is quite different to what it was designed to be,” she says. “Selective schools were supposed to be public schools that were accessible for gifted kids. The fact that there are almost no disadvantaged kids in these schools tells us they’re no longer accessible and they’re not genuine public schools because they’re not open to anyone except the most advantaged families in NSW.” ‘There were a lot of opportunities’ Not everyone agrees the system is broken. Jae Yup Jared Jung, a senior lecturer in the school of education at the University of NSW, says the positive role of gifted education programs such as academically selective schools is backed up by research. He points to a 2016 US academic paper which reviewed 100 years of research on ability grouping in education. The study, published in the Review of Educational Research, looked at 172 papers on “ability grouping” published between 1922 and 1994, and concluded that the “preponderance of existing evidence” suggested special grouping for gifted students can “greatly improve K–12 students’ academic achievement”. He says the process of choosing students for selective schools “isn’t perfect”, but that the system helps gifted students advance faster by coupling them with students of similar ability. “There are certain selective schools with students from a higher socioeconomic background than other schools, but you could say the same thing about the Catholic and independent sectors,” he says. “There’s no perfect way of selecting students for selective schools, but I have confidence in the NSW department of education that the current systems are such that someone who doesn’t deserve to be there isn’t being permitted to enter.” Brendan Ma graduated from James Ruse Agricultural high school in 2015. The school’s Icsea value of 1,236 is one of the highest in Australia, and in 2017 87% of its students came from the top advantage quartile. But Icsea doesn’t consider income, and Ma says it is wrong to assume that most selective students come from advantaged backgrounds. “I had a lot of friends from my cohort who would have parents working double jobs, coming from an immigrant background where their parents still didn’t have a strong grasp of English,” he says. For Ma, going to a selective school meant getting access to opportunities he never would have been able to afford otherwise. “For a lot of people at my school who might have worked really hard or been academically gifted there were a lot of opportunities to advance those gifts,” he says. “Study tours, musical events, things that cost a lot money. Usually it wouldn’t be something they could go to because their parents couldn’t pay for it, but our school made a really strong effort to make sure they could provide opportunities at low cost or for free.” Guardian Australia’s analysis also compared the percentage of selective school students from a language background other than English with that of neighbouring schools. It found that across fully selective schools the average proportion of students from a non-English speaking background in 2017 was 66.5%, compared with 36.2% at nearby non-selective schools. In some schools the difference was more stark. At James Ruse, 97% of students come from non-English speaking backgrounds, compared with 38.7% at nearby schools. In February Guardian Australia reported on research showing Indigenous students were disproportionately represented in Australia’s most disadvantaged schools. Christina Ho argues that the concentration of students – mostly from east Asia – in selective schools is another example of “monocultures” forming within the education system. “Because these schools are now seen as ‘too Asian’ there’s been a real backlash from non-Asian families, so Anglo Australians are now saying ‘those schools are not for us’,” she says. But Ma, the James Ruse student, says being at a selective school allowed him to explore his identity. “I think for a lot of students who did come from immigrant backgrounds it did in some way support their development of an identity,” he says. “My experience coming from a Chinese immigrant background was that as a young person you get conflicting signals about what your identity should be or how you fit into the Australian landscape. “I found though that I could be more comfortable with my identity at school. All those doubts I had about being proud of my heritage or language I could be open with people who understood.” --- In January the NSW education minister, Rob Stokes, said he was concerned selective schools could “create a rigid, separated public education system”, and raised the idea of opening more selective schools to local enrolments. Laura Perry, an associate professor specialising in education research at Murdoch University, says schools with partially selective academic programs in specific subject areas such as music or sports are preferable to fully selective schools, because they have the dual benefit of keeping high-performing students in the public sector while “promoting socially mixed schools”. For Garcia-Pineda, despite experiencing a social divide between selective and community students at her school in western Sydney, there were benefits in being exposed to students from different backgrounds. “I think for a lot of kids who were in the selective part of the school it was a good experience for them because they mostly came from families with money and weren’t always exposed to that,” she says. “I know for me it was confronting. When I came to high school I didn’t know people who came from single-parent households [or] grew up living in housing commission. “I think that’s a major benefit of a school with a mixture of backgrounds. You become a different kind of person. It opens your eyes a little bit.” Notes Guardian Australia analysed figures from the My School website by comparing the Icsea and language background other than English (%) for selective and partially selective schools with the mean scores of schools in the same area.

A single bull shark was caught in the nets around Ballina in January and February, while 55 other animals were either killed or trapped. The nets killed four great hammerheads, a harmless shark that is listed as a “vulnerable” species, as well as a common dolphin and an Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin. A loggerhead turtle was caught but released alive, while dozens of rays were either killed or trapped. The latest data, released this week, is from a second trial of shark nets on five beaches in Ballina and Evans Head in the state’s north. An earlier trial on the same beaches last summer showed the same trend. Just 3% of the marine species caught in the nets were target sharks. But the by-catch included a critically endangered grey nurse shark, 11 threatened turtles and four dolphins. Nets are primarily designed to catch and kill target sharks, and do not act as a barrier to the entirety of the beach. They can, however, deter the approach of sharks without entangling them. Environmentalists said the latest data was yet more evidence of the nets’ ineffectiveness. Humane Society International marine scientist Jessica Morris said they were continuing to do unacceptable damage to harmless and protected marine life. “How many more months of damning data will it take for government to finally realise this experiment is an utter failure, and shut it down?” she said. “Non-lethal alternatives to nets are available and we cannot afford to keep killing harmless and protected species for the next 18 months or more.” The primary industries minister, Niall Blair, said the government was currently trialling modifications to the nets, designed to reduce the amount of bycatch. The modifications include setting nets closer to the water’s surface to allow air breathing animals to breath when they get entangled. The governments are also increasing the mesh size to allow smaller animals to get through. Twine capacity has also been increased to better retain target sharks. Blair said: “We are currently half way through a trial in which we are testing and trialling modifications to the nets to reduce the amount of bycatch; to terminate the trial at this stage will prevent informed decisions about the use of mesh nets for mitigating the risks of shark-human interactions. “An independent community survey carried out before the first mesh net trial clearly indicated that Ballina Shire and Evans Head residents were more positive than negative towards the trial of nets and felt that it increased their feelings of safety for their families and the community,” he said. Proponents of shark nets point to their record in Queensland and New South Wales. Just one shark-related fatality has been reported in Queensland since the introduction of lethal shark mitigation measures in the 1960s. The nets between Newcastle and Wollongong in NSW have similarly been associated with low deaths. Only one shark-related death has occurred at a meshed NSW beach since the 1930s. Late last year, a Senate inquiry into shark mitigation and deterrent measures found the nets could not guarantee safety and tended only to give beachgoers a false sense of security. The inquiry said their effectiveness was not clear. The damage done by the nets to non-target marine life, however, was obvious. “The committee is concerned that a heightened fear of sharks has led to responses that may calm the public and appear to provide an effective response but which are not verified by scientific evidence,” the report said. The committee recommended NSW and Queensland governments immediately replace lethal drum lines with Smart drum lines and phase out shark meshing programs. The trend seen in the trials in NSW’s north reflect results across the state more broadly. Last season, nets at 51 beaches between Wollongong and Newcastle caught 56 endangered or vulnerable marine species. Six grey nurse sharks were killed by the nets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/15/platypus-milk-unlikely-weapon-in-fight-against-superbugs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T06:05:04Z","webTitle":"Platypus milk: unlikely weapon in fight against superbugs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/15/platypus-milk-unlikely-weapon-in-fight-against-superbugs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/15/platypus-milk-unlikely-weapon-in-fight-against-superbugs","fields":{"headline":"Platypus milk: unlikely weapon in fight against superbugs","bodyText":"They are duck-billed, egg-laying, semi-aquatic mammals with poisonous spurs on their webbed feet: the Australian platypus is so weird that early European zoologists thought it must be an elaborate hoax. But now a team of Australian scientists have found something else unique to the strange little animals: their milk has a novel chemical structure that could be used to fight superbugs. Molecular biologists from Australia’s national science agency CSIRO have isolated the monotreme lactation protein structure for the first time, identifying a novel three-dimensional fold that the researchers say could lead to the creation of a new type of antibiotics. “Platypus are such weird animals that it would make sense for them to have weird biochemistry,” said Janet Newman, CSIRO scientist and lead author on the research, which also involved scientists from Deakin University in Geelong, Victoria. In 2010 scientists from Deakin discovered platypus milk contains a lactation protein with potent antibacterial properties. “This special component has antibacterial properties against some of the nastier bugs you find in the environment but not against some bacteria found in the guts of the young,” Newman said. Platypus and echidnas are monotremes, the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. They don’t have teats, so the mothers express their milk onto their bellies for their young to feed. The scientists hypothesise that the antibacterial properties are related to this milk delivery system, evolving in order to protect the young from the possibility of infection. When mammals evolved teats, a sterile delivery system for milk, the protein was no longer as important in an evolutionary sense. The Deakin researchers approached specialists at CSIRO’s collaborative crystallisation centre to replicate the protein and decode its shape in the laboratory, to seek clues to understanding its potency. The scientists dubbed it the Shirley Temple protein because of its ringlet-like formation. Most intriguingly, the protein has a novel fold in its structure that has not been identified in any of the more than 100,000 known protein structures, Dr Newman said. “That’s interesting, because it’s the shape of proteins which dictate their function,” she explained. “So the hope is that the novel structure, in the best possible world, would eventually lead to a therapeutic that is based on a completely different way of dealing with microbial infections than our current antibiotics,” she said. The research identifying the new protein fold, which was published on Thursday in the journal Structural Biology Communications, will inform ongoing drug discovery work, Dr Newman said. Since 2014 the World Health Organisation has warned of a potential “post-antibiotic era” where antibiotics are no longer effective against common infections and minor injuries. Superbugs are bacteria that were once responsive to antibiotics but have built up resistance to them, leading to ineffective treatments and more persistent infections and sometimes to fatalities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/15/sydney-more-expensive-to-live-in-than-london-and-new-york-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T04:48:09Z","webTitle":"Sydney more expensive to live in than London and New York, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/15/sydney-more-expensive-to-live-in-than-london-and-new-york-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/15/sydney-more-expensive-to-live-in-than-london-and-new-york-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Sydney more expensive to live in than London and New York, study finds","bodyText":"Sydney is among the top 10 most expensive cities in the world to live, with the cost of living now higher than in New York and London, according to a new report. The study by the Economist Intelligence Unit raised Sydney by four places from last year’s list to 10th place. Comparing the prices of 160 products and services, the Worldwide Cost of Living 2018 Report analysed 130 cities based on the cost of food, clothing, rent, transport, utility bills, private school fees, domestic help and recreational costs. Singapore remains the world’s most expensive city to live in, with two other Asian cities in the top 10: Hong Kong (fourth) and Seoul (sixth). Seoul, Tokyo and Hong Kong are the three most expensive places in the world to buy staple goods, but Tokyo – the world’s most expensive city until 2013 – and Osaka have been pushed out of the top 10 by low inflation in Japan. Apart from Paris (second), cities outside the eurozone were the most expensive in Europe, with Zurich, Oslo, Geneva and Copenhagen all reaching the top 10 due to particularly high prices for household items, recreation and entertainment. There are no US cities in the top 10 in this year’s report, with New York slipping from ninth in 2017 to 13th this year, and Los Angeles from 11th to 14th position. The sharp fall in the pound after the Brexit referendum drove prices down in the UK, making London (ranked 30th) the cheapest it has been in over 20 years for overseas visitors, the report’s authors said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/15/elena-mondragon-police-shooting-california-no-video","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"Police shot a pregnant California teen – but with no video, the case dried up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/elena-mondragon-police-shooting-california-no-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/elena-mondragon-police-shooting-california-no-video","fields":{"headline":"Police shot a pregnant California teen – but with no video, the case dried up","bodyText":"The undercover officers were dressed in plain clothes and armed with AR-15 rifles when they ambushed the car of teenagers. As the car’s driver attempted to speed away – he later said he thought they were being robbed – two of the policemen fired at the vehicle, missing the driver and striking Elena Mondragon, a 16-year-old girl in the passenger seat, killing her. The killing of Mondragon – who was pregnant and unarmed – was as shocking and tragic as many of the fatal police shootings that have sparked viral hashtags, national protests and widespread media coverage in recent years. But her death in March last year in Hayward, California, barely made headlines outside local news. That’s largely because no one recorded the incident on a smartphone. Likewise, none of the officers present turned on the body cameras they were wearing. As a result, law enforcement’s narrative – that the shooting was necessary as they tried to arrest the driver – has largely prevailed. The policemen were cleared and sent back to work. The case offers a window into how families alleging police brutality struggle to get justice or mainstream support without video evidence, even when many facts of the killing are undisputed and disturbing. “When there’s no video, that’s a battle for us,” said Melissa Nold, an Oakland attorney whose civil rights law office filed a federal lawsuit against police on Wednesday on behalf of Mondragon’s family. “People just tend to believe what is reported by the police. The public just takes it at face value, and it just sort of disappears.” Police said officers were attempting to arrest a 19-year-old named Rico Tiger, who was wanted for several armed robberies and was driving the vehicle, which had been reported stolen. A group of officers had been surveilling the teenagers and had planned to arrest Tiger by blocking his car before they drove off, prosecutors said. But the plan failed, and Tiger drove off before police confronted him. They tried to stop and arrest Tiger, and Sgt Jeremy Miskella and Detective Joel Hernandez of the Fremont police department eventually fired at the vehicle as it accelerated away. “This is standard procedure. You do not shoot into a moving car,” said John Burris, an attorney for the family, speaking to a row of local television cameras in a small office conference room. About two dozen relatives sat by his side, many sobbing and holding each other, wearing shirts that said “Ebbie”, Mondragon’s nickname. “It is unconscionable,” said Burris. “What has happened here is a cover-up for that botched police work.” Although it is widely accepted that officers should not fire into fleeing vehicles, the officers claimed to investigators that they feared the car could kill one of them. The local prosecutor accepted this argument and ruled that the killing of Mondragon, who was not a suspect in the police investigation, was justified. The Alameda county district attorney’s office has charged Tiger in the murder of the 16-year-old girl – despite the fact that he told investigators he was driving away because he “got scared” and thought the undercover officers were trying to rob them. He said he would have stopped and complied had he known that they were officers. (The officers said they had announced that they were police while pointing their rifles at Tiger.) The exact sequence of events and commands will forever remain unknown, since the officers chose not to turn on their cameras, even though they had been preparing for the arrest prior to the confrontation. But even without video, Mondragon’s grieving relatives said it should be obvious that police made a series of egregious errors. “We’re not getting the justice we deserve,” said Christina Flores, Mondragon’s aunt. “She was taken from us. It was so preventable. It never should have happened.” The family’s press conference took place just two miles from the Fruitvale station where an unarmed young black man named Oscar Grant was killed by an officer in 2009. It was one of the first in a wave of high-profile killings of black men by US police that was caught on a cellphone camera, sparking major protests. Many well-known cases of police killings since then have received international attention only after footage went viral, including Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. Elena Mondragon’s name never trended widely on social media. Her family said they were grateful for the support they’ve received, but her uncle, Miguel Minjares, said he didn’t understand why the killing of a young girl did not get as much coverage as other stories. “It’s surprising it hasn’t gotten more attention,” he told the Guardian, as his family gathered to head to a vigil for the first anniversary of Mondragon’s death. Earlier, he told reporters that the family wanted to use the platform they were given to fight for police reforms, and wanted to remind the public that they were still suffering as much as they were the day she died. “We are sitting here broken-hearted. We will never be the same,” he said. The prosecutor’s office declined to comment. A Fremont police spokeswoman, Geneva Bosques, said the officers “were found to be within policy” and have “returned to full duty in their same positions”. The department, she added, has made no policy changes since Mondragon’s death."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/15/microplastics-found-in-more-than-90-of-bottled-water-study-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T01:46:27Z","webTitle":"WHO launches health review after microplastics found in 90% of bottled water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/15/microplastics-found-in-more-than-90-of-bottled-water-study-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/15/microplastics-found-in-more-than-90-of-bottled-water-study-says","fields":{"headline":"WHO launches health review after microplastics found in 90% of bottled water","bodyText":"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has announced a review into the potential risks of plastic in drinking water after a new analysis of some of the world’s most popular bottled water brands found that more than 90% contained tiny pieces of plastic. A previous study also found high levels of microplastics in tap water. In the new study, analysis of 259 bottles from 19 locations in nine countries across 11 different brands found an average of 325 plastic particles for every litre of water being sold. In one bottle of Nestlé Pure Life, concentrations were as high as 10,000 plastic pieces per litre of water. Of the 259 bottles tested, only 17 were free of plastics, according to the study. Scientists based at the State University of New York in Fredonia were commissioned by journalism project Orb Media to analyse the bottled water. The scientists wrote they had “found roughly twice as many plastic particles within bottled water” compared with their previous study of tap water, reported by the Guardian. According to the new study, the most common type of plastic fragment found was polypropylene – the same type of plastic used to make bottle caps. The bottles analysed were bought in the US, China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Lebanon, Kenya and Thailand. Scientists used Nile red dye to fluoresce particles in the water – the dye tends to stick to the surface of plastics but not most natural materials. The study has not been published in a journal and has not been through scientific peer review. Dr Andrew Mayes, a University of East Anglia scientist who developed the Nile red technique, told Orb Media he was “satisfied that it has been applied carefully and appropriately, in a way that I would have done it in my lab”. The brands Orb Media said it had tested were: Aqua (Danone), Aquafina (PepsiCo), Bisleri (Bisleri International), Dasani (Coca-Cola), Epura (PepsiCo), Evian (Danone), Gerolsteiner (Gerolsteiner Brunnen), Minalba (Grupo Edson Queiroz), Nestlé Pure Life (Nestlé), San Pellegrino (Nestlé) and Wahaha (Hangzhou Wahaha Group). A World Health Organisation spokesman told the Guardian that although there was not yet any evidence on impacts on human health, it was aware it was an emerging area of concern. The spokesman said the WHO would “review the very scarce available evidence with the objective of identifying evidence gaps, and establishing a research agenda to inform a more thorough risk assessment.” A second unrelated analysis, also just released, was commissioned by campaign group Story of Stuff and examined 19 consumer bottled water brands in the US.It also found plastic microfibres were widespread. The brand Boxed Water contained an average of 58.6 plastic fibres per litre. Ozarka and Ice Mountain, both owned by Nestlé, had concentrations at 15 and 11 pieces per litre, respectively. Fiji Water had 12 plastic fibres per litre. Abigail Barrows, who carried out the research for Story of Stuff in her laboratory in Maine, said there were several possible routes for the plastics to be entering the bottles. “Plastic microfibres are easily airborne. Clearly that’s occurring not just outside but inside factories. It could come in from fans or the clothing being worn,” she said. Stiv Wilson, campaign coordinator at Story of Stuff, said finding plastic contamination in bottled water was problematic “because people are paying a premium for these products”. Jacqueline Savitz, of campaign group Oceana, said: “We know plastics are building up in marine animals and this means we too are being exposed, some of us every day. Between the microplastics in water, the toxic chemicals in plastics and the end-of-life exposure to marine animals, it’s a triple whammy.” Nestlé criticised the methodology of the Orb Media study, claiming in a statement to CBC that the technique using Nile red dye could “generate false positives”. Coca-Cola told the BBC it had strict filtration methods, but acknowledged the ubiquity of plastics in the environment meant plastic fibres “may be found at minute levels even in highly treated products”. A Gerolsteiner spokesperson said the company, too, could not rule out plastics getting into bottled water from airborne sources or from packing processes. The spokesperson said concentrations of plastics in water from their own analyses were lower than those allowed in pharmaceutical products. Danone claimed the Orb Media study used a methodology that was “unclear”. The American Beverage Association said it “stood by the safety” of its bottled water, adding that the science around microplastics was only just emerging. The Guardian contacted Nestlé and Boxed Water for comment on the Story of Stuff study, but had not received a response at the time of publication."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/15/australian-pm-turnbull-roundly-condemns-russia-over-spy-poisoning-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T02:14:39Z","webTitle":"Australian PM Turnbull roundly condemns Russia over spy poisoning scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/15/australian-pm-turnbull-roundly-condemns-russia-over-spy-poisoning-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/15/australian-pm-turnbull-roundly-condemns-russia-over-spy-poisoning-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Australian PM Turnbull roundly condemns Russia over spy poisoning scandal","bodyText":"Australia has sided firmly with the UK in its condemnation of Russia over the spy poisoning scandal, telling Moscow it is gravely concerned a Russian-developed nerve agent had been used in the attempted assassination. Former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were exposed to a banned nerve agent – probably manufactured in Russia – in the southern English city of Salisbury last week. They remain in hospital. The UK said Russia is responsible and expelled 23 diplomats in retaliation. In a statement issued on Thursday, the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and the foreign minister Julie Bishop said British prime minister Theresa May had “made a compelling case on the responsibility of the Russian state for this attack in an unlawful use of force by Russia against the United Kingdom and her people”. The statement said Australia was “gravely concerned that a military-grade nerve agent developed by Russia” was used in an attack on British soil, and “we share the UK’s outrage over this targeted attempt to commit murder using chemical weapons”. “Australia stands with the UK in solidarity and supports, in the strongest terms, prime minister May’s response to this heinous attack, the first use of chemical weapons in Europe since world war two,” the joint statement said. Turnbull and Bishop said Australia supported the May government’s efforts to investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice, and also backed the UK’s right to take “retaliatory measures, including its decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats and to call for an emergency session of the UN Security Council”. Australia is considering its options by way of response, in coordination with the UK government and other allies. Speaking at the Human Rights Council in Geneva overnight Wednesday, the Charge d’Affaires of the Australian mission to UN in Geneva, Lachlan Strahan, said Russia’s interventions outside its borders were of global concern. “We remain concerned about the impact of Russia’s interventions in Ukraine, Syria and Georgia on the human rights situation in those countries and are gravely concerned that Prime Minister May confirmed a military grade nerve agent of a type originally developed by Russia was used in an attempted assassination in the UK.” The Russian embassy in Canberra released a furious and vaguely-threatening statement over media coverage in Australia over the incident. “Russia is ready to help in the investigation of S Skripal’s case,” ambassador Grigory Logvinov wrote , “but as an equal partner, not as questioned and moreover ‘nominated’ defendant. “It is surprising that history of 20th and the early 21st century hasn’t taught some persons that it is impossible to speak to Russia on the language of ultimatums.” At the Human Rights Council in Geneva overnight, four countries, including Russia, were listed for consideration under Item 4, which are human rights situations in specific countries requiring the council’s attention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/15/doctors-stunned-to-find-huge-air-pocket-where-part-of-mans-brain-should-be","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T09:51:25Z","webTitle":"Doctors stunned to find huge air pocket where part of man's brain should be","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/15/doctors-stunned-to-find-huge-air-pocket-where-part-of-mans-brain-should-be","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/15/doctors-stunned-to-find-huge-air-pocket-where-part-of-mans-brain-should-be","fields":{"headline":"Doctors stunned to find huge air pocket where part of man's brain should be","bodyText":"An elderly man who turned up in an emergency department in Northern Ireland after a series of falls has stunned doctors who found a huge air-filled cavity where part of his brain should have been. The 84-year-old was referred to A&amp;E by his doctor after several months of feeling unsteady on his feet and experiencing falls, and three days of weakness in his left arm and leg. The details, published in the journal BMJ Case Reports, reveal that blood tests showed nothing out of the ordinary and there were no signs of facial weakness, speech problems or confusion. But when the man was given CT and MRI brain scans, the medical team discovered an air-filled cavity measuring 9cm in his right frontal lobe. It also showed up a benign bone tumour, essentially a bony growth, within his nasal sinuses. “[It] has been growing slowly over time and put pressure on the base of his skull causing a small erosion,” said report coauthor Dr Finlay Brown, a trainee GP who was part of the medical team involved in the case. “And subsequently because air goes through your sinuses, air is able to move through this and through the erosion into the skull.” Brown said the eroded area and the tissue above it had formed a one-way valve. “The air can get in, but it can’t get back out again,” he said. While the brain scan images appear as though a hunk of the brain has disappeared, Brown said that wasn’t the case; rather, the air cavity had compressed the brain. “As the pressure builds, the wall of the skull isn’t going to move so the brain has to move,” he said. The patient was offered the option of surgery to release the pressure in the brain, fix the erosion and remove the bone growth, but decided not to take it up given the possible risks. “It is a big surgery for anyone to have to fix that at any stage in their life,” said Brown. While the authors note that the patient’s left-sided weakness had gone away after 12 weeks, what happens next is far from certain. “In theory the brain could possibly absorb, or the body could reabsorb, some of the air, but it could also get worse. We just don’t know,” said Brown, adding that there was also a risk of infection or stroke. “He actually sustained a small stroke, probably due to the pressure effect over time, and there is I suppose a risk of that happening again.” Brown said the man had been given preventative treatment. Brown said he had seen air in the cranial cavities of other patients and that it can occur as a result of trauma or infection. Some studies have suggested it is common among those who have had part of their skull removed during surgery, he said. But, he added, the size of the air cavity in the latest case, and its organisation in one place, was remarkable. “I have never seen anything like it,” said Brown. “I can’t imagine that I’ll ever see it again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/16/kangaroo-film-is-shocking-and-gruesome-but-is-the-analysis-sound","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"Kangaroo film is shocking and gruesome – but is the analysis sound?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/16/kangaroo-film-is-shocking-and-gruesome-but-is-the-analysis-sound","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/16/kangaroo-film-is-shocking-and-gruesome-but-is-the-analysis-sound","fields":{"headline":"Kangaroo film is shocking and gruesome – but is the analysis sound?","bodyText":"The film begins late at night, with scuzzy, clandestinely shot black and white footage capturing kangaroos being hunted and killed. Later, we see emotive images of the animals majestically hopping across a sun-kissed landscape, contrasted with subsequent, horrific images of their body parts and mangled corpses strewn across bloodied land – the aftermath of a gruesome and unlawful slaughtering session. After watching Kangaroo: A Love-Hate Story, a new documentary that argues Australia is terribly mistreating its beloved national animal and mascot, two things are crystal clear. One: the film-makers are on the side of environmental activists, outraged by the animal’s treatment. And two: their button-pushing documentary will be a lightning rod for controversy. Co-directors Michael McIntyre and Kate McIntyre Clere were expecting A Love-Hate Story to ruffle some feathers. Nevertheless, they have been gobsmacked by the response. “We were shocked at how polarising this is. We knew it would be polarising, but not this polarising,” says Michael McIntyre. “Especially among the scientific community. I thought that’s why you become a scientist, to have these robust debates. But that’s not happening. All that’s going on is this incredible attempt to discredit anybody who stands up for the kangaroos. “There doesn’t seem to be any middle ground, including in the general public. There is nobody willing to be mature about this and to bring parties together, so we can at least discuss this in a mature way.” Predictable parties have attacked the film, including the kangaroo meat industry and conservative media who, the filmmaker says, have slammed it sight unseen. It is reasonable to assert, however, that the directors themselves – with their incendiary and impassioned, emotional approach – have not exactly occupied the middle ground either. One issue core to the film, and the broader discussion about kangaroos, is population count. At a key point in A Love-Hate Story, close to the end, just before a beautiful close-up of a kangaroo looking directly into the lens, one interviewee puts forward an alarming hypothetical, saying: “As Australians we take them for granted, that they’re always going to be there. What if they’re not?” The implication is clear: the very existence of kangaroos may be in danger. Earlier this week, however, Fiona Simson, president of the National Farmers Federation, claimed the film was misleading and said there are nearly 50 million of the animals in Australia. Kangaroo: A Love-Hate Story incorporates official estimates, of 27 to 33 million, but then questions the methodology by which kangaroos are counted, arguing these estimations are deeply problematic. Even if official estimates are off by a whopping amount – let’s say, they double the actual number – that would still mean there are around 15 million kangaroos. But, says McIntyre: “That’s a hypothetical that’s too hypothetical to answer. There are some population estimates we saw that had an error rate of 80% to 90% ... I just think it has been so misrepresented that, you know, I don’t even think we are close to even knowing the truth. “Anecdotally, I travelled extensively throughout New South Wales and Queensland. I was expecting to see a lot more kangaroos. I know I am not an ecologist, but boy I was expecting to see a lot more.” Amid the hullabaloo surrounding the film’s release, ethicist Peter Singer, who appears in it as an interviewee (with others including Tim Flannery, Terri Irwin, Lee Rhiannon and Ken Henry) clarified to ABC News that he does not think the animals are at risk of extinction. Missing from the film is a rigorous analysis of exactly what effect kangaroos have on the Australian ecosystem. This might have helped audiences understand whether they are indeed “pests”, a label often attached to them. McIntyre says there was no room for this: “There was so much we couldn’t fit in the film. We certainly wanted to cover that.” Although, he adds: “How can an animal that has basically evolved long before human settlement, have possibly created a scenario where they are causing the problem?” One more or less indisputable aspect of the documentary, which is powerfully argued by the filmmakers, is the existence of a double standard when it comes to the ethical treatment of kangaroos compared to other animals. Most people are much more vocal about the welfare of other animals found in the supermarket, such as cows and chickens. What McIntyre calls our “hatred of wild animals” has its roots in colonisation, he says: “Our belief now is that it started that far back, with white settlement. As soon as white pastoralists arrived, the native animals were something to be dealt with, rather than them saying ‘let’s figure out how we can exist with this precious wildlife’.” The gruesome footage the directors include is confronting, to say the least. It says something about their approach that they chose not to explore a core issue – how kangaroos affect the ecosystem – but did include visions of bashed joeys, severed heads and body parts. It is reasonable to assume, however, that most viewers would be sickened and outraged by such footage, and that it is in the public interest for it to be seen. “You should have seen what we left on the cutting room floor,” McIntyre says. “We were shocked. We sought advice on whether it was going too far or not. But this is a nightly reality, not a fiction. This is a fact that’s going on every night around Australia. As Australians, we thought we had to represent this. It’s uncomfortable, but this is an uncomfortable issue. We make no apologies about it being uncomfortable to watch.” • Kangaroo: A Love-Hate Story is in cinemas now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/16/sa-election-promises-compared-how-do-the-policies-add-up","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T23:09:37Z","webTitle":"SA election promises compared: how do the policies add up?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/16/sa-election-promises-compared-how-do-the-policies-add-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/16/sa-election-promises-compared-how-do-the-policies-add-up","fields":{"headline":"SA election promises compared: how do the policies add up?","bodyText":"Costings for campaign promises in the South Australian election have been released by Labor and the Liberal party, but the SA Best leader, Nick Xenophon, has declined, arguing the party’s primary role will be to hold the others to account. According to the Labor treasurer, Tom Koutsantonis, Labor will outlay $550m due to new commitments, separate from the nearly $2bn in “investing expenditure” covering projects such as level crossing removals. Election promises from the Liberals would cost $300m a year, largely covered by budget cuts including 1.7% in efficiency dividends across most government departments. The Liberals would also spend $449m on new capital works. The parties have copied or matched each other’s commitments in some areas, so here are the major points of difference: Energy and the environment If the Labor premier, Jay Weatherill, is reelected, $100m in interest-free loans will be provided for 10,000 home battery or solar systems, as well as $24m in grants and loans for the Crystal Brook “hydrogen superhub”, and $32m in loans and grants for a Tesla virtual power plant scheme involving 50,000 home battery storage systems. The new 25% energy storage target will be backed by a $20m subsidy. Labor would also invest $28m into a network of parklands and walking trails. The Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, would put $200m into a fund for grid connections with other states, including a second interconnector to New South Wales. The Liberals also promise $100m in support for 40,000 home battery storage systems. SA Best would establish a not-for-profit energy retailer, and commission a $5m review into restoring beaches. Economy Labor will invest $350m to develop the old Royal Adelaide hospital site for future industries including renewable energy and AI, and $35m into rolling out Australia’s fastest internet across the Adelaide city centre. The Liberals would spend $60m on a culinary school at the old Royal Adelaide hospital site, which would also house an Aboriginal museum and an innovation hub. A Marshall government promises payroll tax cuts for small businesses, at a cost of $44.5m per year, and to reduce the Emergency Services Levy in a way that yields annual savings of $600 for a home worth $450,000, costing $90m per year. The party also plans to cut land tax, at an estimated cost of about $32.3m a year from 2020-21. SA Best has pledged to make emergency services personnel exempt from the Emergency Services Levy, and to cut it for everyone else. Xenophon would also exempt small businesses from paying payroll tax on the wages of up to five new employees. SA Best plans to introduce a levy on pokie venues that don’t have live music. Healthcare Labor has commited $30m to a hospital for eye treatment, $22.7m to mental health, $15m to disease prevention, $5.5m to suicide prevention, and $4m to training chronic medical condition nurses. The Liberals will invest $40m in shortening elective surgery waiting lists, and at least $14m on a trio of aged care facilities. New health investments will be funded by an efficiency dividend of 0.75% in current healthcare spending. Frontline roles such as doctors and nurses will be “quarantined from the efficiency dividend in a similar way” to that contained in the Weatherill government’s recent mid-year budget review. SA Best is calling for a royal commission into healthcare, and proposes investing $25m into palliative care and $5m into home clinical trials for patients with rare forms of cancer. Infrastructure and transport Labor is spending big in this area, promising $1.33bn to fix up seven level crossings, $538m in building tram lines out to north Adelaide and Norwood, and $150m each for a new ports authority and construction of 600 housing trust homes. Infrastructure savings will come from cutting SA Water’s budget to the tune of $55m over four years. The Liberals will scrap the tram expansion plans, and instead spend $37m on allowing trams to turn right onto North Terrace, and $20m on the business case for a rail/airport freight link at Monarto. The party pledges that 30% of mining royalties will be directed to regional infrastructure projects. A Marshall government would establish an agency to independently consider infrastructure needs, in a bid to end government pork-barrelling, with an initial 10 projects to consider, including an underground rail link. Xenophon has proposed a project costing between $125m and $150m to turn the old Port Stanvac oil refinery site into a mixed-use housing development, suggesting it could pay for itself if done right. SA Best will also spend $11m on rolling out a locally invented stormwater capture technique, and provide free public transport to seniors and a $10,000 handout to taxi drivers. Education Labor has pledged $100m of Tafe investment, $70m for laptops for public high school students, $37.5m for children’s centres, and $6m for natural play areas at schools. Instead of Tafe, the Liberals would put $100m into 20,000 new apprenticeships, and contribute $12m to school sport. SA Best would invest $3m per year into community education and gambling help services. Governance Labor would save $41m by cutting public service executive numbers by 10%, and save $60m a year by “driving a harder bargain” on government stock and materials purchasing. The Liberals pledge to save $75m by reducing the use of consultants and contractors, $15.7m in cutting ministerial staff numbers, and $15m in reduced advertising and communications expenses. A Marshall government would crack down on some government perks, removing three chauffeur-driven cars from the ministerial fleet and banning “long boozy lunches at the taxpayers’ expense”. SA Best is seeking to ban chauffeur-driven cars from government entirely. The party would introduce legislation to cut the House of Assembly from 47 members to 34 and the Legislative Council down from 22 members to 17. Xenophon would additionally provide an extra $1m in funding for the Commissioner For Victims’ Rights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/mar/15/trade-war-fears-markets-trump-kudlows-china-tariffs-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T14:41:03Z","webTitle":"Trade war fears weigh on markets as Trump's new adviser blasts China - business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/mar/15/trade-war-fears-markets-trump-kudlows-china-tariffs-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/mar/15/trade-war-fears-markets-trump-kudlows-china-tariffs-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Trade war fears weigh on markets as Trump's new adviser blasts China - business live","bodyText":"Newsflash: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has urged countries to avoid being sucked into a global trade war in the wake of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. In a new blogpost, Lagarde calls for a multilateral approach to trade disagreements, and warns that no-one can win a trade war (That looks like a rebuttal of Donald Trump’s claim that they’re easy to win). Lagarde writes: “Policy makers need to work constructively together to reduce trade barriers and resolve trade disagreements” without resorting to such tactics, “They should ensure that the recently announced U.S. import tariffs do not lead to a wider escalation of protectionist measures. Economic history clearly shows that trade wars not only hurt global growth, but they are also unwinnable.” Time for a recap Donald Trump’s new top economic advisor has called for a “trade coalition of the willing” of allies to work with America to tackle China over trade. Larry Kudlow argues that Beijing deserves a ‘tough response’ - a sign that the White House isn’t ending its protectionist push. China has hit back, with a government official warning that ‘appeasement’ was not an option if Washington unleashed more tariffs. A Chinese state-owned tabloid newspaper also called the US out, saying it should make Americans “more hard-working”. Germany has weighed in too; its economy ministry fears ‘tangible’ damage to the global economy Worries over tariffs have helped to push the aluminum price down to a three-month low today. Stocks, though, have managed a small rise -- the Dow is up, after three daily drops in a row. Financial analysts have warned that a trade war would hurt the markets, and send investors diving out of riskier assets. Donald Trump has revealed that he pretended the US had a trade deficit with Canada when he met Justin Trudeau recently. On the economic front, the number of American’s filing new claims for jobless benefit has dropped. I’ll be back later with any major developments.... The aluminum price has hit a three-month low today, suggesting that the new US tariffs are beginning to bite. The cost of a tonne of aluminum fell to $2,085 per tonne, its lowest level since before Christmas 2017. President Trump’s decision to put a 10% tariffs on aluminum imports (excluding Canada and Mexico), is one factor; Norbert Ruecker of Julius Baer points out that they will hit demand: “If you look at the impact, the trade tariffs will, in the end, be deflationary globally,”. The president is defending himself over today’s story that he challenged Canada’s prime minister over trade without knowing the facts (see earlier post). But....as Bloomberg’s Mike McKee points out - the US government’s own trade offices says it runs a surplus! Worries over trade wars seem to be hitting Boeing again. Shares in the aircraft maker are down almost 1.7% in early trading, making it the worst performer on the Dow. That’s despite reports that Boeing could scoop a major new order, to supply fighter jets to India. Ding Ding: The New York stock exchange has rung the opening bell, and investor are trying to break a three-day losing streak. The Dow has opened higher, gaining 80 points of 0.3%. Traders are encouraged by today’s strong US jobless figures. Energy stocks and financial firms are leading the way, with JP Morgan up 0.4% Some experts are relieved that Donald Trump has chosen Larry Kudlow as his new top economic adviser. One alternative was Peter Navarro, who helped craft Trump’s “America First” policy. He’s a big supporter of tariffs, and a vocal critic of free trade - arguing that America is getting a rough deal as its intellectual property is snaffled by China. In contrast to Navarro, Kudlow is a more reassuring choice for the markets. Rabobank analyst Bas van Geffen told clients: “Markets may actually find some comfort in the fact that Mr. Trump decided to give the job to Kudlow, rather than someone with more radical economic beliefs, such as Peter Navarro, who is even more skeptical about the current free trade paradigm. Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research, dubbed Kudlow a “cheerleader for growth”, adding: “He regularly says ‘Free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity.’ He is a forceful advocate for open markets and trade liberalization, and more generally an economic libertarian who favors low taxes and less regulation.” A dream candidate for Wall Street, in other words. But there is still jitteriness, simply because president Trump will be the one making the big calls on whether to slap fresh tariffs on Chinese technology imports, or European cars. Donald Trump should be cheered by the latest drop in US unemployment claims, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at trading firm UFX.com: “The US employment market has remained on a steady course of late, and with the latest figures showing a further fall in initial claimants, Donald Trump will surely use the opportunity to champion his job-boosting credentials as he embarks on the formative stages of a re-election campaign. “A robust jobs market was a key pillar in his road to the White House and although there may be some who argue the success has come on the back of a healthier international economy, it’s hard to argue with the results. Newsflash: The latest US unemployment figures show that America’s labor market remains pretty strong. Just 226,000 Americans signed on for unemployment benefits last week, down from 230,000 in the previous seven days. That’s close to the 48-year low struck in late February. It’s also the 158th month in a row in which the ‘initial claims’ figure has come in below 300,000 -- traditionally the threshold for a robust jobs market. Wall Street analysts fear that Boeing could be a major victim from a trade war. Shares in the airline have fallen by over 8% this month, as tensions over president Trump’s protectionist leanings have intensified. China is a key market for Boeing, which secured a $37bn deal to sell 300 planes to China Aviation Suppliers last November. Larry Kudlow’s plan to build a coalition to force China to change its trade policies could put future such deals in doubt, if relations between Washington and Beijing deteriorate. As Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, put it to CNBC: “The question is really not economic. It’s political at this point.” China has pushed back against the criticism from Donald Trump and Larry Kudlow. With fresh tariffs looming, Beijing argues that America needs to work harder if it wants to close its whopping trade gap. Chinese officials are also warning that they will hit back, if America presses on with unilateral tariffs [Trump wants to cut the US-China trade deficit by $100bn]. Reuters has the details: In a Thursday editorial, widely-read Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said the United States was trying to play the victim. “If the U.S. wants to reduce its trade deficit, it has to make Americans more hard-working and conduct reforms in accordance with international market demand, instead of asking the rest of the world to change. “Once a trade war starts, capable countries won’t bow to the U.S. China has tried hard to avoid a trade war, but if one breaks out, appeasement is not an option.” Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said history showed that trade wars are in nobody’s interests, but that China would protect its legitimate rights if “something happens we don’t want to see”. Ever the early riser, president Trump has just tweeted that America can look forward to years of ‘fair trade’. He’s also confirmed Larry Kudlow’s appointment to lead his National Economic Council. A profit warning from soapmaker PZ Cussons has taken the shine off the mood in the City today. Shares in PZ Cussons, which makes Imperial Leather soap and Original Source shower gel, tumbled by 15% as traders made a clean exit from the company. It admitted that earnings will miss forecasts, claiming that British consumers were cutting back on washing products. The UK washing and bathing division has continued to experience lower levels of purchases reflecting consumer caution across all retail channels caused by economic uncertainty and inflation out-stripping wage growth. This has also hit other consumer goods makers, with Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser both down around 1.5%. Across the markets, the European stocks markets are a little higher, but trade war worries abound. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says: The FTSE started the day higher, although there appeared little for traders to cheers. Sentiment remained downbeat as concerns of an all out trade war weighed, particularly in light of the Team which Trump is building at the White House, which is pointing to the more aggressively interventionist as far as foreign policy goes. Added to the concerns over Trumps newly formed team, reports that the President is looking to slap tariffs on $60 million worth of imports from China, no longer just steel and aluminium, is unnerving investors. Germany is increasingly worried that a global trade war could break out, hurting its growth and the wider global economy. In a new monthly report, the German economy ministry warns that the new US tariffs on some metal imports could cause uncertainty, and hurt trade. The ministry points out that the global economy is strengthening, but fears that protectionism could scupper this progress. It says: For the global economy, the IMF and, more recently, the OECD for the years 2018 and 2019 now expect growth of 3.9% each. However, this does not take into account the recently introduced US tariffs on steel and aluminum. These could significantly affect trade in some regions. However, the impact on the global economy as a whole should remain manageable. However, a possible escalation of a trade war and increasing uncertainty among market participants could cause tangible damage. It’s important to note that Unilever isn’t quitting its impressive headquarters at Blackfriars. Some staff will move to the new corporate HQ in Rotterdam. However, the company - dubbed Uni-leaver by some wags on social media - says its 7,300 UK-based employees won’t be affected by the change. Even so, legal blogger David Allen Green is struck by the symbolism: The London Mayor’s office are gutted that Unilever has chosen the Netherlands over Britain as its single legal base. Rajesh Agrawal, deputy mayor for business, argues that it shows the importance of keeping close ties with the EU after Brexit (even though Unilever insist Brexit wasn’t a factor): Agrawal says: “Unilever’s decision to move its headquarters to the Netherlands is clearly disappointing news for the capital. It brings into sharp focus the need for the Government to secure a Brexit deal that secures London as Europe’s leading business centre. The best way to do this is for London and the UK to remain part of the Single Market and Customs Union.” The big news in the City this morning is that Unilever has chosen Rotterdam over London as the site of its new corporate base, ending its dual-HQ structure. After weeks of speculation, the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant plumped for the Netherlands over the UK. It is insisting that Brexit isn’t to blame, and there won’t be job losses, but the decision is a blow to the City’s prestige. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant, has picked Rotterdam over London as its main base in a move seen as a blow to the government in the wake of the Brexit vote. The group, which makes a number of well-known consumer brands including Persil, Dove and Marmite, has been based in London and Rotterdam for nearly a century. The Unilever chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, insisted Brexit “was absolutely not a factor” in the decision, which was announced after a board meeting and a year-long review. Here’s her full story: The Daily Mail think Unilever is trying to protect itself from a hostile takeover, having fought off Kraft Heinz last year. Overnight, Donald Trump gave a worrying insight into his negotiating approach with other world leaders. Speaking to donors at a fundraiser in Missouri, Trump bragged about how he’d argued with Canada’s Justin Trudeau over trade - without actually knowing the facts. The Washington Post has the story: President Trump boasted in a fundraising speech Wednesday that he made up information in a meeting with the leader of a top U.S. ally, saying he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the United States runs a trade deficit with its neighbor to the north without knowing whether that was the case. “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,’ ” Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio obtained by The Washington Post. “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in — ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed. “... So, he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. … And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case, I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check, because I can’t believe it.’ Trump’s punchline is that America does run a trade deficit with Canada (as he claimed). However, US trade data actually shows a $12.5bn surplus (a $25bn surplus in services, minus a $12.5bn deficit in goods). Here’s the full story: In fundraising speech, Trump says he made up trade claim in meeting with Justin Trudeau My colleague Ed Helmore has written a profile on Larry Kudlow. It covers his time working with Ronald Reagan in the 80s to his rehabilitation after being fired from Wall Street firm Bear Stearns over his cocaine addiction. Mazen Issa, senior foreign exchange strategist at TD Securities, says investors are concerned about Donald Trump’s next move: “The Trump administration is rumoured to be preparing another tariff, this time aimed at China” “Taken in conjunction with speculation of additional cabinet reshuffles, broader risk sentiment could be vulnerable.” Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM warns that trade wars are bad for growth: With Wall Street pummelled by rising fears of U.S protectionism on Wednesday, U.S stocks are at risk of extending losses this afternoon if the negative sentiment prevails. Risk aversion could become a dominant market theme moving forward, as concerns intensify over escalating trade tensions negatively impacting global growth. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets wonders if Kudlow and Trump will get along like a house on fire: Concern that the US administration was looking to widen the scope of tariffs to Chinese goods to the tune of $60bn weighed on investors’ appetite for risk, though the declines were fairly moderate. This may have been down to the appointment of Larry Kudlow as President Trump’s new economic adviser, who has stated that he is not a big fan of blanket tariffs, which should make for an interesting discussion with his new boss. America’ Dow Jones index shed 1% last night, with Boeing dropping 2.5% amid worries about an escalating trade spat. Asian markets have been mixed today; Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 has dropped by 0.25%, India has dipped a little, while the Philippines index has shed almost 2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The prospect of a protectionist trade war between the world’s major economics continues to loom over the markets today. Donald Trump’s new economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, has intensified the pressure by claiming that Beijing hasn’t played by the rules - and needs reining in. Kudlow was named as the new director of the National Economic Council on Wednesday, and promptly went on the air to tell China to expect a tough approach. He told CBNC that: “I must say as somebody who doesn’t like tariffs, I think China has earned a tough response not only from the United States... “A thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they’re breaking the rules left and right,” . That’s the way I’d like to see. You call it a sort of a trade coalition of the willing.” [that’s a reference to George Bush’s 2003 Iraq War coalition...] This has done little to assuage concerns that Trump will soon launch new tariffs on Chinese imports, such as technology and telecommunications products. Kudlow (a former Reagan advisor and Wall Street economist), has criticised tariffs in the past. But he’s happy to back Trump’s new steel and aluminium tariffs. He told CNBC that he was relieved that Trump had exempted Canada and Mexico, and perhaps Australia. Europe might also qualify for an exemption too, he hinted, if they cut some of the tariffs they impose on US goods. I don’t like blanket tariffs and I don’t think you should punish your friends to try and punish your enemies in international affairs. My problem is the principle of the thing, I just don’t like blanket tariffs.

I’ve always been happy in my identity and – give or take bullying at school, the nasty experience of coming out to my parents (long since healed), and being diagnosed HIV positive 20 years ago – life has been happy and fulfilling. I’ve had two long-term relationships and have now been with my husband for 19 years (still no kids, though we keep trying). We’ve opened up our relationship and are doing well, having negotiated rules and boundaries. I’ve had a lot of fun: hot sex with guys – both known and anonymous – as well as deep and meaningful connections with casual partners and my husband. There isn’t much I haven’t tried and je ne regrette rien. However, now that I’m in my 50s, I find myself feeling increasingly bi-curious. Having gone from finding women lovable all my life, but not in the least sexually attractive, my fantasies now unaccountably flip between being caught at the bottom of a slippery, naked rugby scrum and wondering what it would be like properly to pleasure a woman orally. It will never happen – I’m too old for hook-up apps or meat-market bars, and I can’t imagine how, from a practical point of view, I would even go a little bi now. My husband is a bit weirded out by it all, but he’s generous and trying to get his head around it, so I feel grateful. I’m not at all sure this makes me bisexual, but I’m starting to think polar labels such as gay and straight are a distraction from what we should be aiming for: finding ways to love each other and make a better world.

That once fanciful idea seems creepily closer now that a complete pig’s brain has been successfully treated, frozen, rewarmed and found to have its neural connections still intact. This achievement, by the cryobiology research company 21st Century Medicine (21CM), has just won the final phase of the Brain Preservation Foundation’s prize – a prize that demanded all of a brain’s synaptic connections be preserved in a way that allowed for centuries-long storage of the entire information content of a whole large mammal’s brain. They used a pig’s brain, which was perfused with lethal glutaraldehyde before being frozen at –135C, a method called aldehyde-stabilised cryopreservation (ASC). This process kills any chance of the brain being brought to life again, but they won because when the treated brain was warmed up again its connectome – the brain’s wiring diagram – was amazingly well preserved. In fact it was so well preserved that even the fine ultrastructural details of dendritic spine synapses could still be seen with a 3D electron microscope. This means potentially 150 trillion connections, all of which may be implicated in storing memory. A human brain treated this way could never be brought back to life. Yet all its preserved information could potentially be uploaded into an artificial or virtual body indistinguishable from the previously living one – like “uploading a person’s mind” after a long wait. Would this then be “you”? A few years ago I was asked to become an adviser to the foundation. At first I adamantly refused, but they persuaded me that they needed doubting sceptics as much as enthusiasts and I soon realised that brain preservation raises deep questions about mind, consciousness and self that interest me greatly. My doubts have not gone away. They partly concern overpopulation and unfairness – what a horrible world it would be in which rich old people could have their minds uploaded, taking resources from younger people on an already overcrowded planet. What hubris for anyone to think their brain is worth preserving when everyone else’s is not. But I have much deeper doubts. What is a mind anyway? We are far more than just brains and stored memories. We are whole embodied humans, deeply embedded in social worlds. Who am I? I am partly a product of my communications with everyone else. If my brain were preserved today and used in a brilliantly natural-seeming artificial body in a year’s time, then I might indeed wake up and go, “Wow, here I am again”, and take up my old friendships, family connections, email habits, website and Facebook page and still feel that I was the same person – just with a bit of a gap in time like being ill or going travelling for a year. But what if this were done a century hence – when the technology matures? The world is changing ever faster and so are our “selves”. Each of us is connected with large groups of people in ways that were impossible only a few years ago. We rely heavily on external devices to explore the world and tell other people about ourselves, so that who I am is already becoming my output stream and the way it’s taken up and passed on by others – in other words, the memes that make up “me”. If, as philosopher Daniel Dennett suggests, a person is “an ape infested with memes”, then the nature of persons will inevitably change as technology and artificial intelligence evolve ever faster. My guess is that “I” would wake up in my new, perfect artificial body and think, “Wow, here I am again”, only to realise that I was a completely inadequate “person” in this new world. Everyone else’s minds would be so far expanded beyond their original brains into other devices, implanted and external, that they would see me as a profoundly backward human or some kind of throwback from a primitive world they could hardly imagine.

But without free classes, they can’t","bodyText":"I rarely find myself disagreeing with Louise Casey. She is one of few in the government who consistently and bravely speaks out about social and cultural issues in an honest and straightforward manner. Many of her recommendations on integration and cohesion, especially on supporting women and the often forgotten white working-class communities, not only need to be made but should be acted upon. But while I understand the need to push the government to be take action and be bold, I disagree with the call for a “Speak English” cut-off date without explicit parallel investment for free English classes. Unless the government funds English classes for those who don’t speak English, any deadline becomes a crude white elephant. One simply cannot exist without the other. The expectation that all UK citizens should speak English is right and proper. I am a firm believer in people learning the language of the country they reside in long-term or for life. It would be inconceivable to expect to live and work in another country without learning the basics of its common language. British immigrant retirees on the Costa del Sol conceded, insular enclaves are hardly examples we should try to emulate. Speaking English in England aids integration and creates a valuable shared sense of identity and values. In difficult times, we should be doing all we can to nurture a collective sense of belonging and speaking in “our” tongue is one of the most basic but effective ways to achieve this. Yet the government seems to be unclear about how to deal with all this mixedness. In the bonfire of the vanities targeting local government, funding for free English classes went up in flames. The government has cut English for Speakers of Other Languages (Esol) classes funding drastically. A Refugee Action briefing titled Safe but Alone detailed the impact of government cuts on integration. “Government funding in England fell from £203m in 2010 to £90m in 2016 – a real terms cut of 60%.” The cuts took away opportunities for individuals to learn English. Sandhya Sharma, a project worker from Safety4Sisters, said: “Esol helps refugees rebuild their lives and reduces isolation for vulnerable members of our society. Learning English is the key to BME migrant women’s ability to access, integrate, gain freedom, independence and literally communicate in the UK. Women need Esol classes so desperately, they have less ability then men to publicly interact, have less outward facing chances and opportunities. This is a fundamental right for women seeking to live in the UK and it’s to the benefit of us all. We all gain as a society from women’s access to Esol.” Sharma is right. Women are particularly vulnerable. Let’s hope those in power are listening. My mother’s generation was impeded by traditional gender roles that discouraged women from dealing with the “outside” world, and many still remain dependent. Sadly many younger women face similar pressure as patriarchal structures fight to maintain control. Over the years, I have spoken to women who come under immense pressure to maintain traditional roles and not seek work outside the home or who have to ask permission to access basic support structures. Less than 2% of the population, according to the 2011 census, cannot speak English well or at all. We need to support this minority to fully integrate while at the same time, robustly tackling institutions that are not teaching younger generations the basics of being a citizen. We currently have ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools where children are not taught English but Yiddish and unregulated Islamic schools that do not teach comprehensive gender equality. When it comes to integration, religious schools or institutions should not get a “get out of jail free” card. • Amina Lone is co-director of the Social Action &amp; Research Foundation"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/15/baghdad-iraq-war-another-day-us-invasion-female-artists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T06:30:16Z","webTitle":"Blood, bullets and contraband vodka: female artists on life in Baghdad after the US invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/baghdad-iraq-war-another-day-us-invasion-female-artists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/15/baghdad-iraq-war-another-day-us-invasion-female-artists","fields":{"headline":"Blood, bullets and contraband vodka: female artists on life in Baghdad after the US invasion","bodyText":"Irada al-Jabbouri remembers Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. “It was like a ghost town, under curfew, its streets almost empty by 4pm,” recalls the Iraqi novelist and women’s rights activist. “Day and night were organised according to a mysterious schedule of when car bombs might go off, or mortars or improvised explosive devices or kidnappings. More than once, I escaped from snipers’ bullets passing in front of me. Once, US soldiers went mad and started firing at the houses in my neighbourhood after an explosive device had gone off. All the windows in our house were shattered; the shards of glass were like shrapnel. “I saw a young man riding a motorcycle get shot. He fell off the bike and drowned in his blood while the wheel of the fallen motorcycle kept spinning.” Staying at home was no guarantee of survival. “Your house might be hit by a stray mortar shell; Iraqi or US military or criminal gangs wearing military uniforms might invade a house and arrest someone inside it. That person would not be found until after he’d become a corpse, either in the morgue or dumped in a pile of garbage.” Jabbouri had been unable to write fiction since the US tanks rolled in in 2003. “It was like a rent in my soul, a bleeding,” she tells me. “We deserved better than the dictator [Saddam Hussein] and better than the invasion.” But she could record her day-to-day life. Her journal notes now form part of the script of Another Day in Baghdad, a movie in the early stages of filming. Set in the last week of 2006, it is an ensemble piece focusing on the lives of ordinary citizens trying to survive the occupation while coming to terms with the Saddam era. The characters include a woman whose son was “disappeared” by Hussein’s regime; a man who was a prisoner of war in Iran; a man blackmailed into accepting bribes at work; a blocked novelist called Sara, who is a single mother; and a student who distracts herself from daily violence with fashion and music. There is also a Christian character forced into exile in a city that used to be known for its religious diversity and mixed neighbourhoods. Everyone associated with the film, including the Iraqi actors who auditioned in 2014 and 2016, had their own experiences to add to the story. “They were people who had dug their heels in and stayed, but there had been one thing that was the straw that broke them,” says the film’s director, Maysoon Pachachi, born in Iraq but now living in London. “Someone gets kidnapped and his vocal cords are cut; one woman was from a minority group and they burned her sister in front of her; a guy had three shops taken over by the mafia, his son was kidnapped and died as a result of torture using drills. I spoke to a teenage girl about seeing her first corpse on her way to school, with its eyeball hanging out. “And that’s the thing – the unthinkable becomes normal. You’re sitting in the car and you hear gunshots and someone has been shot next to you, or one of these crazy people has exploded something. People would find bits of body parts on their roof after an explosion.” Pachachi set the film in 2006 because this was the year that Shia/Sunni sectarian violence “started to become intense”. “Of course, this is the fallout from the US invasion, because that’s how they divided the country. They had this attitude of tabula rasa [blank slate]. They didn’t think about the past, and when they did think, it was all about Shia/Sunni. It’s all they saw. “In February 2006, there was a big explosion at a Shia shrine outside Baghdad and that lit the touch-paper. The Shia Muslims really reacted to that. The explosion was caused by al-Qaida in Iraq, the forerunner of Isis. Suddenly, the city became divided by these big concrete security walls, split according to ethnicities or religions.” The violence led to a particular, regressive threat against women, she recalls. “Women were under pressure from the religious militia. Lots of women’s bodies were found on the street or thrown in the river, and their bodies had writing on them: ‘This is what happens to fallen women.’ They were killed for wearing the wrong thing, or because they were out of the house. A friend of mine was in a taxi going to the university and the driver said: ‘Did you girls at the university get our letter? We don’t like what the girls are wearing.’ The girls were wearing jeans. And a few weeks later the girls at that university got blown up.” Despite this, people tried to continue with normal life, taking their children to school but keeping them off the streets to avoid “child traffickers, militias, gangs and opportunistic criminals”, in Pachachi’s words. Another Day in Baghdad’s production designer, Raya Asee, was one such parent. Life in Baghdad in 2006 was “really horrible”, she says. “I had to wear the hijab and I am not religious. Otherwise, the militia came to our house.” She describes one of her friends daringly putting her uncovered head outside the house, into the wind, “just so I can feel something happening to my hair”. She remembers being afraid to give a taxi driver directions in case the route she chose put them in the path of an explosion, and feeling guilty for enjoying a coffee with her mother on the same morning that her young son’s school was bombed. On New Year’s Eve, because of the curfew, it wasn’t possible to celebrate without spending the whole night in the house you were visiting, and there were no halls, cinemas or hotels to be used as venues for weddings or events. “All the tiny details of life changed. And we fought it – it wasn’t our choice.” Asee’s son’s school was closed, leaving him and many other children housebound. “We had a generator for necessary things in the house,” she says, “but we decided to give him all the electricity so he could play Xbox.” As a result of these conditions, says Asee, an entire generation of Iraqi children are “socially isolated. They can’t share anything, not even their feelings.” Her son “always thinks he is the champion and he is the hero, because he plays Xbox. When he played Monopoly with a neighbour and lost the game, he got upset because he couldn’t imagine losing against another child.” Asee runs workshops on peace-building and conflict resolution with civil society groups in Baghdad. She works with many young people born around 1999 or 2000, who are now coming of age and “wouldn’t recognise what kind of life we older Iraqis had, because they were born in the middle of the tragedy. “There used to be gardens everywhere, people on bicycles everywhere. When I grew up it was a tradition to go to the cinema once a week; when my son was young there was no cinema he could go to. Young people feel they have the right to be angry, to be in the army. They don’t believe in peace. But we tell them what happened in reality: blood everywhere, garbage everywhere. Whenever someone died, I had to remove their name from my mobile phone. I thought I’d soon just be a name needing to be removed from someone else’s mobile.” Asee does find some bleak humour in the situation. She recalls having to hide alcohol in a Fanta bottle. “So now when I say: ‘I want a Fanta,’ my friends say: ‘You mean a vodka.’” Both Pachachi and Asee remind me that the story of Iraq is not just about one invasion, one war or one event. “There were many, many women of my mother’s age living through the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s,” Asee says. “They didn’t tell their stories of how they lived without men and built their lives. It happened again in 1991 in the Gulf war and it happened again in 2003.” Pachachi mentions the sanctions that preceded the latest US occupation “tearing society to shreds” and describes an “ongoing relentless loss that people have had for decades. It’s about the loss of the place you thought you lived in, the people you thought you lived with, major cultural institutions being blown up.” Jabbouri feels the country has been viewed with ignorance by the rest of the world: “Iraq has been presented for decades as a source of evil and cruelty and a threat to its neighbours and the world. The media did not differentiate between the dictator and the individual citizens of the country.” Another Day in Baghdad will show the lives of ordinary citizens, she says, which are “absent in the media and absent from the conscience of the world. It was very easy to blame these absent people and hold them responsible for what happened [on 9/11] in a place thousands of miles away, such as the United States.” While Jabbouri stayed in Baghdad throughout the occupation, Asee was forced to leave in 2007 to protect her son. He was cared for by relatives in Jordan while Asee pursued her asylum case (successfully) in Sweden. She returned to Baghdad as soon as her son was old enough to go away safely to college. Like Jabbouri, she feels a powerful love for the city: “I’m from this place; I have to defend it against all the things that pushed me out.” All three women say that life in Baghdad has improved somewhat. Explosive violence and intimidation have been replaced by a wary shell shock, with economic difficulties, inadequate infrastructure, basic services and state corruption – which, says Jabbouri, “has now become the culture of the society as a whole”. She warns: “The space of our freedoms narrows day after day, by which I mean personal freedoms, especially for women of all political parties, who are demanding their rights.” Pachachi adds: “People think that when the shooting stops, everything’s OK. But if you look at Baghdad, the walls, the pavements, they’re cracked. The whole history of what has happened is there on people’s faces and on the walls. You can see the marks of everything.” Speaking to Pachachi, Jabbouri and Asee, I am struck by the way these women’s individual lives, their pride as Iraqis and their love for Baghdad, their political activism, feminism, intellect and creativity are indivisible from one another. All three mention the power of art in resisting oppression and representing viewpoints that usually go unseen. For Jabbouri, Pachachi’s film will be a corrective to macho, war-fetishising stereotypical depictions of the Middle East. Another Day in Baghdad aims to “express a feminist stand against destruction and patriarchal control in the world, from international patriarchy to local social and cultural patriarchy”. It also foregrounds women’s stories and promotes women’s authorship behind the camera, in a year when, despite the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements, neither the Golden Globes nor the Baftas nominated any women in their best director category and a major study showed no improvement for women directors in Hollywood in more than a decade. Pachachi says: “This film is a small step toward bringing women back into history and into film art as active actors and not passive ‘things’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/14/england-rugby-six-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T23:17:37Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones apologises for offensive comments about Ireland and Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/14/england-rugby-six-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/14/england-rugby-six-nations","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Jones apologises for offensive comments about Ireland and Wales","bodyText":"Eddie Jones and the Rugby Football Union have both issued apologies after video footage emerged of the England head coach referring to “the scummy Irish” and Wales as a “little shit place” during a speech last year. Jones said he was “very sorry” for remarks he concedes were inexcusable. Jones made the comments during a talk on leadership for the truck manufacturing company Fuso, the Japanese sister company of the England team sponsor Mitsubishi, last July but they have only come to light now. England host a grand slam-chasing Ireland side in the final round of this season’s Six Nations at Twickenham on Saturday, with Jones desperate for revenge having lost in Dublin last year. “We’ve played 23 Tests and we’ve only lost one Test to the scummy Irish,” he told his audience. “I’m still dirty about that game, but we’ll get that back, don’t worry. We’ve got them next year at home so don’t worry, we’ll get that back.” Jones was also recorded discussing Wales in the context of Japan Under‑20s losing 125-0 against their Welsh counterparts shortly after he took over as the Japan head coach in 2012. “Wales. Who knows Wales? Are there any Welsh people here? So it’s this little shit place that has got three million people. Three million!” A spokeswoman for the Rugby Football Union said it would be apologising to both the Irish and Welsh unions for the “inappropriate” remarks, which Jones also regrets. “I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused – no excuses and I shouldn’t have said what I did,” the head coach said. It is only a fortnight since Jones was complaining about uncomplimentary references to the English before the Calcutta Cup game last month, after which he was abused by Scottish train passengers. “If you talk about hate and you talk about rubbing people’s nose in the dirt, and all those sorts of things, it incites certain behaviours,” he said. “Are they the sorts of behaviours that we want to see?” The furore overshadowed a depressing day of fitness updates for England with the announcement of their matchday squad to face Ireland having to be delayed. The captain, Dylan Hartley, and the Lions winger Elliot Daly are both understood to have endured setbacks in their race to be fit, with Nathan Hughes and Courtney Lawes both facing operations this week on knee ligament injuries sustained in Paris. Hughes is expected to be out for action for 12 weeks and Lawes for up to 14 weeks, effectively ruling both out of England’s June tour to South Africa. Jones will have no option but to name a reshuffled pack when he confirms his starting XV on Thursday morning, with Owen Farrell again standing by to deputise for Hartley as captain. England’s management, meanwhile, have brushed aside any suggestion of sharp practice at Ireland’s expense after it emerged one of the match officials this Saturday visited their camp this week to assist their preparations. South Africa’s Marius van der Westhuizen, an assistant referee this weekend, oversaw a training session in Bagshot at the request of England’s coaching staff. Inviting leading referees in to offer guidance to players is common practice but usually only involves officials with no connection to a team’s next fixture. World Rugby regulations forbid the pre-game involvement of the actual match referee but make no mention of his assistants, which means England will avoid any official sanctions. While there is absolutely no suggestion the 34-year-old Van der Westhuizen’s integrity has been compromised, there might be some debate about a potential conflict of interest should Ireland be denied a grand slam by a marginal call favouring the home team. A similar scenario would certainly raise an eyebrow or three in football circles but England’s defence coach Paul Gustard has dismissed such concerns. “I see no issue with it at all,” said Gustard. “Why wouldn’t it be appropriate? The opportunity to get foreign referees in to give their viewpoint in how they see things is important for our growth as a squad.” Ironically the same referee, Jaco Peyper, who awarded a whopping 16 penalties and two free‑kicks against England in France will be on the other touchline at Twickenham."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/16/the-magic-flute-review-ingmar-bergman-does-mozart","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T09:00:06Z","webTitle":"The Magic Flute review – Ingmar Bergman does Mozart with dreamlike strangeness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/16/the-magic-flute-review-ingmar-bergman-does-mozart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/16/the-magic-flute-review-ingmar-bergman-does-mozart","fields":{"headline":"The Magic Flute review – Ingmar Bergman does Mozart with dreamlike strangeness","bodyText":"Ingmar Bergman’s 1975 production of Mozart’s The Magic Flute, originally made for television, is now rereleased as part of the Bergman centenary retrospective at London’s BFI Southbank. It has gaiety and mystery. To consider it between, say, his Smiles of a Summer Night and Fanny and Alexander, is perhaps to see the Mozartian quality of Bergman’s work generally; to savour an influence on his own registers of seriousness and mischief, and his use of symbolism. Bergman’s production is a cool, frank presentation of the opera, an imagined theatrical performance that begins by looking at members of the audience in turn, but in the course of the action periodically returning to a single young girl’s smiling or thoughtful face – infrequently enough for us to realise that we had forgotten about her, and that another, quieter narrative is running alongside the story: that of this girl’s enjoyment and judgement. Ulrik Cold sings the part of Sarastro, the high priest, here also the father of Pamina (Irma Urrila), whom he has taken away from her mother, the Queen of the Night (Birgit Nordin). She induces Prince Tamino (Josef Köstlinger) to get Pamina back, in which quest he is accompanied by the genially comic Papageno (Håkån Hagegård). But they find that Sarastro is the guardian of a Masonic brotherhood of wisdom and virtue. It is a mythology that sets up the victory of a masculine ideal over feminine iniquity, but in the opera’s dreamlike exotic strangeness, this is hardly noticed. The intelligence and clarity of Bergman’s The Magic Flute is a marvel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/may/07/going-underground-the-subterranean-secrets-of-londons-super-rich","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T14:39:01Z","webTitle":"What lies beneath: the subterranean secrets of London's super-rich","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/07/going-underground-the-subterranean-secrets-of-londons-super-rich","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/07/going-underground-the-subterranean-secrets-of-londons-super-rich","fields":{"headline":"What lies beneath: the subterranean secrets of London's super-rich","bodyText":"The subterranean secrets of London’s super-rich are revealed in a study of 4,650 basements granted planning permission in some of the capital’s most affluent neighbourhoods, with hundreds of swimming pools and cinemas in the most luxurious developments. Almost 1,000 gyms, 376 pools, 456 cinemas, 381 wine stores and cellars and 115 staff rooms, including bedrooms for nannies and au pairs, were found in the plans for the basements approved by seven London boroughs between 2008 and 2017. The data, collected by Newcastle University’s global urban research unit from planning applications, identified two basements with more than one pool, including one with an artificial beach. The study, Mapping Subterranean London: the Hidden Geography of Residential Basement Developments, maps their proliferation in Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Camden, Islington and Wandsworth. The researchers calculated that the combined depth of all of the schemes would be 15,289 metres, almost 50 times the height of the Shard. The study only covers the basements granted planning consent under existing properties. Other basements have been constructed under new homes. One new mansion in Notting Hill, on sale for £25m, includes a double-level basement with a 21-metre swimming pool. The researchers do not know how many of the basements they found have been built, because current planning law allows owners to commence work up to three years after permission is granted, with no deadline to complete. Several leading basement architects and developers said, however, that the vast majority of approved projects are completed. Other amenities uncovered in the research include 547 media rooms, 340 games and recreation rooms, 242 saunas or steam rooms, 63 underground garages and parking facilities, and one car museum. The study, undertaken for the Guardian, classified the basements into three size categories. Standard developments, of a single storey under the footprint of the house, made up four in five of the schemes. Their amenities were generally utilitarian, often containing extra living or utility rooms. The researchers also identified 785 large basements, of at least two storeys under the footprint of the house, or one storey extending well under the garden. Most were large enough to house a swimming pool. Another 112 basements were classified as mega, of at least three storeys in depth under the footprint of the house or two storeys in depth and extended under the garden. Some of the largest were up to 18 metres deep and bigger than the rest of the property above ground, warranting the nickname of iceberg homes. The most extravagant schemes include a three-storey basement in Holland Park, Kensington and Chelsea, with amenities including a swimming pool, plunge pool, beach, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, media room, gym and staff quarters. A three-storey scheme in Mayfair, Westminster, which was granted planning permission under an existing basement, features a swimming pool, cinema, car park, sauna, steam room and dance floor. A single-storey basement in Primrose Hill, Camden, includes a Turkish bath, Roman bath, cigar room, swimming pool, plunge pool, sauna, massage room, cinema, games room and bar, wine store, pilates room, gym and banquet hall. Roger Burrows, professor of cities at Newcastle University, said: “In many areas of ‘super prime’ London planning restrictions often makes it impossible to extend properties laterally or add floors on top. Consequently residential basement developments in the wealthiest parts of London have increased markedly.” Becky Fatemi, the managing director of Rokstone estate agents, said 34% of the 140 properties the company has sold in the last five years had basements, with the most expensive sold for more than £20m in Kensington. Demand has grown recently for basements with accommodation for a nanny and other staff. The study shows how the size and splendour of basements varies across the seven boroughs. Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster, the wealthiest boroughs surveyed, have the highest number of swimming pools. In contrast, the researchers found only three mega basements in Hammersmith and Fulham, and none in Haringey, Islington or Wandsworth. The Kensington and Chelsea MP, Emma Dent Coad, said the local council had once approved a three-level basement with a diving board. “I have sympathy for people who need more space for an expanding family, but building a beach under your mansion when you’re hardly going to be there is something else entirely,” she said. “While we have people sleeping on the streets we really have to look at what we’re doing in our borough because that is bad planning.” The streets with the highest numbers of basements granted planning permission include Tregunter Road in Chelsea with 22 and Hamilton Terrace in St John’s Wood with 16. Some of the latter basements extend to properties on the adjacent Hamilton Close. Sir Hugh Cortazzi, a former British ambassador to Japan, and his wife Elizabeth, who live on Hamilton Close, said the number of excavations under houses on the mews in the past decade had blighted their lives. “It’s depressing,” he said. “We’ve had huge dumper trucks blocking the mews. There’s still work going on. I fear the demand will go on and on.” Karen Buck, the MP for Westminster North, who has campaigned for tighter restrictions on basement developments, said: “The sheer opulence of many of the larger basement excavations caused jaws to drop even in fairly affluent neighbourhoods like St John’s Wood and Bayswater, where neighbours have sometimes found themselves under siege from these developments. And it wasn’t uncommon to be told that the building was scarcely occupied at the end.” The study found that council policies introduced to restrict the size of basement developments had led to a downturn in applications in recent years, but the researchers added that the numbers being granted approval in the past two years were similar to those in 2008-12, only now there were fewer mega-basements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/mar/14/tacita-dean-portrait-and-still-life-review-national-gallery-national-portrait-gallery-london","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T13:58:39Z","webTitle":"Tacita Dean: Portrait and Still Life review – 'I find myself holding my breath'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/14/tacita-dean-portrait-and-still-life-review-national-gallery-national-portrait-gallery-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/14/tacita-dean-portrait-and-still-life-review-national-gallery-national-portrait-gallery-london","fields":{"headline":"Tacita Dean: Portrait and Still Life review – 'I find myself holding my breath'","bodyText":"In a room in the National Portrait Gallery’s permanent collection, hung with portraits including John Donne and William Shakespeare, three groups of jewel-like miniatures, lit in such a way that they appear from a distance as glimmering points of light, sit on the grey wall. The rhythmic clattering sound of a projector rumbles. On a screen no wider than a hand’s breadth, three actors pose for the camera. Sometimes seen alone, sometimes all together, David Warner, Ben Whishaw and Stephen Dillane sit and lounge and stand. The light shifts across their faces. All of them have at some time played Hamlet on the London stage, and the title of Tacita Dean’s film, His Picture in Little, is taken from the play. Sometimes appearing to exchange glances, at others ignoring one another entirely, the three actors have nothing to do, no part to play, except to be there and to be filmed. There are private expressions, appeals to the camera (and by implications, ourselves), smiles and twitches and wry glances. You watch them thinking, waiting, being. They don’t even have to be still, as they would were they being painted. Sometimes one or other disappears. Trees appear, clouds, the light shifting along with the sitters’ unknowable thoughts. Warner does some wry actorly grimacing and eye-twinkling, as if he’s thought of a private joke. His resplendent eyebrows do their thing. Whishaw examines a mug of tea, and stands beside a window, coruscated by daylight. We only imagine their thoughts, their patience and unease. Dillane sits as though in a photo-booth, waiting for the camera’s flash. Sometimes they lie down under a big sky. Actors rest and actors wait. The three were never together, never exchanged a look, yet they occupy the same frame, coexisting on the same bit of celluloid, the 35mm film masked with stencils. Dean shot them on the same strip of film, in different cities and countries, using a technique she developed for Film, her Turbine Hall commission in 2011. Like the painted portraits hanging in the room, she brings her subjects together in a way they never were in life. This is no CGI montage or ghastly holographic illusion. Dean calls this a “blind cohabitation” of the film frame, not only by her subjects, but of different times and spaces. And so it goes on, in the companionable silence for the film’s quarter-hour, the actors on their side of the screen, we on ours, crowding together and leaning in to get a better look. Like the painted miniatures nearby, His Picture in Little is magical and compelling. Dean has used the technique again for Providence, a film portrait of Warner alone, with hummingbirds hovering and flitting about the grasses in a California field. There’s a hummingbird, there’s Warner’s eyebrows again. He looks like a tufted owl. This is shown down in the temporary exhibition spaces at the NPG, now filled with Dean’s filmed portraits. David Hockney smokes and maunders about in his LA studio. Seated in the shade in his garden, Arte Povera artist Mario Merz fondles a pine cone and is disturbed by the sound of church bells, as though they were an omen. The cicadas sizzle, loudly. Eventually, Merz wanders off across the lawn. What a face that man had. Claes Oldenburg arranges and rearranges objects on shelves. Julie Mehretu and her assistants work diligently on a vast painting, Mehretu’s hand skittering across a surface, leaving a little trail of marks. We watch over her shoulder. I find myself holding my breath. Film after film, Dean approaches her subjects with a cool eye and a calculated distance. Yet what we get is proximity, a sense of the impending, the tension between the watcher and the watched. And which is which? Scale matters here, grain and light, sound and silence. In the largest gallery we are met with the clatter of several projectors, the looped films chuntering through the gate. Pointing this way and that, aimed at large and smaller walls, in close up and seen at a distance, choreographer Merce Cunningham sits for his portrait. Cunningham is performing stillness, holding his position and expression for the four minutes and 33 seconds of his partner John Cage’s silent composition 4’33”. Except there is no silence in Cunningham’s dance studio, with its mirrors and cavernous gloom. New York roars outside, and there are other noises from somewhere in the building. Far from sitting it out, Cunningham composes himself not once but six times for his allotted four-and-a-half minutes. Cage’s silence, Cunningham’s silence, the old man in his chair, the silence of your own heartbeats, the squeak of a shoe on the wooden floor, the tidal cacophony of New York flooding in. I find this incredibly moving. Moving around the gallery, I keep thinking Merce is watching the shadows dance across the screens, as viewers move about between the projectors and their shafts of light. All I find I can do is describe what these intimate confrontations and voyeuristic, what-the-butler-saw moments are like. Film doesn’t just capture the subjects. It captures our looking too, the camera’s gaze, qualities of light and atmosphere, these portions of time past and time passing. Through the spine of the gallery, Dean has lined the wall with photographs of details of Cy Twombly’s studio, with all its paraphernalia. Rolls of paper, a stone, glimpses of objects and the artist’s incidental conjunctions: there are 50 of these large and small images, plus one photograph that was shot in Giorgio Morandi’s preserved studio in Bologna. We don’t know which this extra image is. I could tell you but it would spoil the guessing. Dean treats portraits as still life, and still life as portraiture. The world is stilled and then moves on again. In her two rooms at the National Gallery, I began to see the procession of paintings, photographs and films as the frames of a single film, each image flowing into the next around the walls, as if there were some story there. Momentarily, it was the actual films themselves that seemed stilled. It is a risk, perhaps even foolhardy as well as unprecedented, for an artist in mid-career to mount an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery and National Gallery at the same time. Before both shows close at the end of May, a third, Landscape, will open in the new wing of the Royal Academy. Dean’s intervention at the National Gallery, Still Life, draws both on the gallery’s collection and other sources. Dean is good at curating other artist’s work, as her An Aside at Camden Arts Centre in 2005 demonstrated. Here, she leavens seriousness and surprise with cheek and humour. A photograph of two stacked plates on a table by Thomas Demand is in fact a model, made entirely of paper. This is followed by the head of St John the Baptist by an unknown 16th-century Italian painter, then a very large, late Philip Guston, depicting a hat. Is it sitting on a table, or is the hat the only visible part of a man, walking behind a wall? Telephone wires or laundry lines festoon the black sky. Turn round and high on the far wall of the gallery is a film of a bird singing on a wire under a blue California sky. Below it hangs a painting of a birdcage that might almost be a house, by Gwen John, and an anonymous photo of someone’s dead pet budgerigar lying in state. High above, Dean’s live bird sings its heart out on a wire. In Prisoner Pair, Dean has filmed pears slowly dissolving in jars of schnapps. The camera dwells on stems and bubbled skin, light on the glass and refracted light within the jar. Things in jars have a kind of anatomical, forensic quality. Here, decay is suspended, or turned slowly into alcohol. The pear dissolves in the liquor. The film seems to me to be about air and alcohol, glass and light, things dissolving into liquid transparency. Are there two pears here? In the next room, Roni Horn’s Dead Owl presents us with two photographs of stuffed snowy owls. Or is there only one owl, seen twice? What complex shuttling from image to image, painting to photograph. Mysteries and affinities, loaves of bread, glasses and bottles, translucent plastic boxes on Wolfgang Tillmans’ windowsill, and, next a beautiful Zurbarán still life of a cup of water and a rose. Dean’s show plays all sorts of quiet games with what still life means. I feel time collapsing into a single interminable moment. Though Still Life is full of dead things, it is also full of life. Even when her camera circumnavigates a lump of flint, turning about the stone, closing in on its smoothed and sheered surfaces, its holes, it seems almost alive. These last two films seem to presage her Landscape exhibition at the RA in May. What is most alive is the camera’s gaze, its swerves and changes of focus, its lapses and concentration. Tacita Dean: Still Life is at the National Gallery, London, and Portrait at the National Portrait Gallery, both from 15 March to 28 May. Landscape is at the Royal Academy, London, from 19 May to 12 August"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/14/a-run-on-neutradol-all-across-the-historic-county-of-lancashire","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T16:15:29Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | A run on Neutradol all across the historic county of Lancashire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/14/a-run-on-neutradol-all-across-the-historic-county-of-lancashire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/14/a-run-on-neutradol-all-across-the-historic-county-of-lancashire","fields":{"headline":"A run on Neutradol all across the historic county of Lancashire","bodyText":"THE ROUND OF NORTH LONDON &amp; SOUTH-WEST MANCHESTER (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE ROUND OF NORTH LONDON &amp; AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF ANDALUSIA) As you will clearly remember, and there’s no need to go back and check, the Fiver yesterday unequivocally predicted serious trouble ahead for Manchester United. Yes sir. And so it came to pass, as José Mourinho’s absurdly ponderous side delivered a Big Cup performance which stank out the metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester so badly there’s been a run on Neutradol all across the historic county of Lancashire. It’s being said that cans of the original aerosol spray are swapping hands for upwards of £100, while the black market economy for other products in the world’s No 1 odour-neutralising range has spiralled out of control to the extent that if you want any meadow-fresh carpet deodorizer you might have to turn a few tricks. Meanwhile Mourinho has been drenched in so much spittle-flecked opprobrium that his critics make Jamie Carragher look like a man suffering from a serious case of xerostomia. Oh José! How could you! To be honest, Mourinho has brought a lot of this fresh flak on himself, having only worked out that it was a good idea to try to score a goal against Sevilla at the point at which United required three of them in 12 minutes, rather than just one in 90. With plenty of moral credit in the bank after last season’s two-trophy haul, and his annual tactical evisceration of Liverpool still fresh in the memory, he might have got away with that minor error of judgment/gigantic act of craven tactical cowardice that betrays open contempt of a 62-year continental legacy. But following it up by shrugging in the insouciant style while pointing out that United have suffered similar Big Cup defeats before, and that he knows this “because I have sat in this chair as manager of Porto and of Real Madrid”, probably wasn’t the wisest political move. Unless it’s the deliberate opening salvo in a war of ambiguous motivation, like the one that served Chelsea so well a couple of years ago. But who’d want to go through something that unpleasant again, just for kicks, not long after signing a new contract? Meanwhile on the continent – where PSG, Real Madrid, Milan and Inter are all rumoured to be on the lookout for a new manager – Mourinho’s former charges Chelsea take on Barcelona at Camp Nou in Big Cup. “It is not simple to sleep a lot, especially before these types of games,” says Antonio Conte, stifling a yawn. “I hope my players also have the same excitement.” Ten out of 10 for going through the motions, at least. And in fairness, Chelsea do have reason to be excited. They were the better team in the first leg – i.e. Willian was more impressive than Lionel Messi – and they did a number on Barça on their last visit to Catalonia, a 2-2 semi-final comeback which was the precursor to their becoming champions of Europe. Also Barça haven’t beaten Chelsea without the help of Tom Henning Øvrebø since 2006, and even then they needed Asier del Horno to give them a leg up. So it all augurs well for Conte and his men. Though if they do get knocked out – and you know how our predictions sometimes go – you’d think it certain that Conte will be sniffing around the job market come the summer. The Fiver wonders just how crowded that particular fair might be. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!

The West End venue – which had been criticised by the play’s award-winning Indian author, who claimed the play had been shelved – said in February it had had to postpone and then withdraw the production for “financial reasons” in 2017 and that it was now committed to producing the play in spring next year. Correspondence released under the Freedom of Information Act now reveals details of discussions about the play, Pah-La, between the theatre and the British Council, the UK government’s cultural diplomacy arm. The play’s scheduled West End run, from October to November last year, would have had an impact on a joint arts programme being run in China as well as coinciding with “significant political meetings” in China, the theatre was told by a high-ranking British Council official serving as a first secretary in the UK’s embassy in Beijing. Pah-La deals with life in contemporary Tibet, drawing on personal stories of Tibetans with whom the playwright, Abhishek Majumdar, worked in India, which is home to a substantial community of Tibetan exiles including the Dalai Lama. Tibet has long been governed as an autonomous region of China – which sent in troops in 1950 to enforce a territorial claim and has staged a large-scale relocation of Han Chinese civilians into the region – but the allegiances of many in the largely Buddhist territory lie with their exiled spiritual leader. The Royal Court sent the British Council official, Nick Marchand, a draft of the play and sought advice on how it could affect a project that it and the British Council had been running with 16 writers in China. “All we can do is give you a feel for the sensitivities and potential consequences,” wrote Marchand, the British Council’s “director arts, China and North East Asia. “It is considered advice, based on recent similar situations. It has to be up to the Royal Court to decide where the balance of artistic interests lie. “Frankly, we do feel that Pah-La will likely jeopardise the Royal Court’s ability to do further work in/with China for some time. By extension, we suspect it would be the end of the writing project.” Marchand mentioned there had been “a slightly similar situation” with the presentation of something else where they had “to pull the work with a week to go” – although details of this are among parts of the correspondence that have been heavily redacted. The British Council told the Guardian it had made the redactions because disclosure could affect the likeliness of the Chinese government to engage with activities organised by the body. The correspondence sheds light on the tightrope that UK arts have to walk in terms of ongoing outreach work with artists in states such as China where democracy is limited but which are being wooed by the British government as it attempts to strike post-Brexit trade deals. Vicky Featherstone, the Royal Court’s artistic director, told the Guardian it was vital that vulnerable artists did not become “collateral damage” in what she described as “the intersection between foreign and economic diplomacy and culture”. “It is evident to us, in a post-Brexit era where cultural diplomacy is being used as a bridge to trade, that we must protect potentially silenced voices more than ever,” she said. “The writer is at the heart of everything the Royal Court does. Internationally we have been navigating the complex, fragile and varied circumstances within which our writers work in countries like Cuba, Zimbabwe, Palestine, Syria, South Africa, India, China and Russia for more than 20 years.” Majumdar had criticised the theatre’s decision to put the play on ice, saying the matter “encapsulates many deep questions of censorship and internationalism”. He later praised an apology issued by the theatre and its announcement that the play would be produced in spring 2019. The freedom of expression group English PEN said last month that the controversy revealed how China sowed anxiety among artists and arts organisations. It described it as “a chill on artistic freedom”. The affair has echoes of previous controversies. The British Council was accused in 2012 of excluding Chinese dissident and independent voices from the London Book Fair when it was focused on the Chinese market. In 2010 it cancelled a performance of a ballet created for the Shanghai Expo because it was dedicated to the people of Tibet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/14/goodbye-claudia-fontaine-the-unknown-famous-face-of-80s-pop","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T14:02:50Z","webTitle":"Goodbye Claudia Fontaine, the unknown famous face of 80s pop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/14/goodbye-claudia-fontaine-the-unknown-famous-face-of-80s-pop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/14/goodbye-claudia-fontaine-the-unknown-famous-face-of-80s-pop","fields":{"headline":"Goodbye Claudia Fontaine, the unknown famous face of 80s pop","bodyText":"I didn’t know Claudia Fontaine’s name until this week, when she died at the age of 57. I knew her face, though, and her voice: she was as much part of my pop adolescence as being poised over the pause button of the radio cassette recorder while listening to John Peel, or wondering whether I’d get back to Paddington from some London venue for the last train home to Slough. Fontaine was part of Afrodiziak, first as a duo with Caron Wheeler (later of Soul II Soul), and later as a trio with Naomi Thompson, who were the British record industry’s backing singers of choice for much of the 1980s. In those days, even for mimed appearances, solo artists or groups would often bring along to the Top of the Pops studio the people who actually appeared on the records, and so Afrodiziak became regulars at BBCTelevision Centre, as well as on Channel 4’s The Tube. That’s Fontaine in the background when Marilyn performed Calling Your Name on Top of the Pops. There she is again as Elvis Costello does Everyday I Write the Book, and with the Special AKA demanding Nelson Mandela’s freedom. She wasn’t there when the Jam did Beat Surrender, but she was on stage when they played it on The Tube; she’s there with Madness, playing Sweetest Girl on Saturday Live and No 73. She’s back on ToTP with Howard Jones, when he sang Things Can Only Can Better. Some backing artists become famous in their own right. Sometimes it’s because of one specific performance: Merry Clayton on the Rolling Stones’ Gimme Shelter; Clare Torry on Pink Floyd’s The Great Gig in the Sky. Sometimes it’s because of the enormous number of incredible records they appeared on: the Funk Brothers at Motown; the Wrecking Crew in Los Angeles; the Swampers in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. You wouldn’t make those claims for Fontaine. Afrodiziak’s contribution to Sunset Now by Heaven 17 is not, whichever way you cut it, going to be talked about in the way of the Swampers’ performance on Aretha Franklin’s I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You) – but that’s fine. If you were growing up in the 80s, Afrodiziak – even if you didn’t know who they were, as I didn’t – felt as oddly central to Top of the Pops as Ooh Gary Davies, awkward teenagers and the feeling of embarrassment as you demanded silence from your family for the three minutes of your favourite band. They weren’t the only constant but unknown presences in 80s pop. I think the first time I became aware of a musician who wasn’t one of the stars was through the gurgling bass sound on the singles from Paul Young’s album No Parlez. That turned out to be the work of Pino Palladino, who became ubiquitous through the 80s in the same way as Afrodiziak did. I discovered that the gurgling sound was the result of him playing a fretless bass, and I started to notice it on other records, and realise: that’s Palladino again. And there he would be, too, on Top of the Pops. The more obsessed you become with music, the more likely you are to look out for the names below the headlines. You start to recognise the kinds of records they will be associated with, and be able to take an educated guess about whether you’ll like their music. So, as an indie fan in the mid to late 80s, I could be pretty sure that, even if I had never heard of the group concerned, a single produced by John A Rivers and recorded in Leamington Spa would interest me. Indeed, so associated did Rivers and Woodbine Street studios become with a certain strain of lo-fi, 60s-inflected jangly pop, that the unknown groups of that era have been commemorated in a series of Nuggets-like compilations called The Sound of Leamington Spa, which has just reached its eighth volume. I still do it, too. My knowledge of dance music is minimal to the point of nonexistence, but if I am sent an album with a note that it’s been produced by the sometime DJ and remixer Ewan Pearson, I put it straight on, because he seems to have worked on so many of my favourite records over the last few years. The people in the background – low down the credits on the back cover; in the edge of frame on the TV appearance; getting on stage for just two songs of the gig – are never going to be pop’s heroes. But the peculiar ecosystem of British pop in the 80s, with its wealth of televisual opportunities, means Claudia Fontaine was one of its most recognisable faces. And this week she’s being mourned even by those of us who never knew her name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/16/the-magic-gang-the-magic-gang-review-amiably-harmonic-lovelorn-indie","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"The Magic Gang: the Magic Gang review – amiably harmonic, lovelorn indie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/16/the-magic-gang-the-magic-gang-review-amiably-harmonic-lovelorn-indie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/16/the-magic-gang-the-magic-gang-review-amiably-harmonic-lovelorn-indie","fields":{"headline":"The Magic Gang: the Magic Gang review – amiably harmonic, lovelorn indie","bodyText":"The last time major labels were signing amiable, jangly indie bands came in the aftermath of Creation Records’s dissolution, when Columbia Records attempted to turn Teenage Fanclub’s Britpop-adjacent success into hot cash. Spoiler alert: it didn’t work, and the two parties amicably parted ways. Which makes the Magic Gang’s debut even more surprising. At a time when guitar bands have fallen out of favour, it’s a pleasant surprise that Warner Bros would sign one that’s admirably devoid of edge and the kind of rock posturing that usually excites A&amp;Rs with budgets to burn. The Magic Gang are a Brighton four-piece apparently weaned on Norman Blake’s aforementioned group, Weezer, the Beach Boys, the Beatles and the recently departed London duo Ultimate Painting. Their songs breeze along idly, their amiable guitar-playing tethered by enough craftsmanship to stop things slipping into tedious slackerdom, and enlivened by the band’s keen ear for texture: fuzz is judiciously deployed, and solos unfold with the effortless grace of a skateboarder grinding along a rail. Open chords chime with optimism; their hooky choruses are as indelible as a pier-end neon sign flashing in the night sky. The best thing about their self-titled debut might be their four-part harmonies: a raggle-taggle chorus full of personality. They do a mean line in tender paeans to girls – Oh Saki, Jasmine and the reassuring Caroline, in which their sunny insistence that she’ll be fine is the stuff that immediate recoveries are made of. In fact, girls appear to be the album’s primary subject matter, as the band collectively try to make sense of a relationship that’s going off the rails. “I realise that we’ll survive together / ’Cause you and I could compromise for ever”, they sing on All This Way. I’ll Show You, one of a couple of endearingly shambolic piano ballads in debt to Jon Brion, features lyrics as deft as any Taylor Swift kiss-off: “We’ll pretend I never ever met you – though I met you.” As love slips away, their harmonies become faintly hysterical, almost desperate, adding a welcome human touch of agitation to an otherwise preternaturally chilled and charming debut."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/15/wherever-you-are-in-this-miraculous-multiverse-thank-you-readers-tributes-to-stephen-hawking","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T09:52:35Z","webTitle":"'Wherever you are in this miraculous multiverse, thank you': readers' tributes to Stephen Hawking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/15/wherever-you-are-in-this-miraculous-multiverse-thank-you-readers-tributes-to-stephen-hawking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/15/wherever-you-are-in-this-miraculous-multiverse-thank-you-readers-tributes-to-stephen-hawking","fields":{"headline":"'Wherever you are in this miraculous multiverse, thank you': readers' tributes to Stephen Hawking","bodyText":"Stephen Hawking, the brightest star in the firmament of science, whose insights shaped modern cosmology and inspired global audiences in the millions, has died aged 76. For fellow scientists and loved ones, it was Hawking’s intuition and wicked sense of humour that marked him out as much as the fierce intellect which, coupled with his illness, came to symbolise the unbounded possibilities of the human mind. We asked Guardian readers to tell us the impact Stephen Hawking had on their lives. ‘Hawking destroyed harmful prevalent stereotypes’: Heather Wolf After breaking my neck and suffering reflex sympathetic dystrophy (CRPS), and two major neck reconstructive surgeries, I was terrified of my future. I often thought of Hawking, loving life and producing extraordinary works of genius in physics from a wheelchair. Knowing he existed drove me to endure pain and physical limitations because he showed with his life and with his actions that life is absolutely precious and that the scope of it is bounded only by our will, tenacity and imagination. He stood alongside Einstein and Feinman who loved questions. Endowed with a never ending sense of awe he embraced life exactly as it is and he found a way to love it. He showed not only what a human being is capable of but also the nature of what we are. We are capable of wonder if we love the questions themselves as the poet Rilke once wrote. I’m a human rights advocate and founder of Cure CRPS Foundation – a coalition for the terminally ill, disabled and elderly. Hawking is the ultimate role model. He reminds us that what resides within a human being is far greater in value than our society assigns. We are all capable of extraordinary achievements. That the actual substance of life is about allowing others to help you so that you can continue to embrace life from the new point of view. Hawking destroyed harmful prevalent stereotypes that the terminally ill are incapable of contributing to society. Dear Hawking, wherever you are in this miraculous multiverse, thank you. Thank you for inspiring us. Thank you for driving hope and light into our hearts. Thank you for never giving up, for never giving into fear. Thank you for igniting in generations a childlike sense of wonder. Thank you for exemplifying what human beings are actually capable of. And thank you for sharing your life with all of us. I will never stop asking why, I will never give up and I will never give in. ‘I will be forever grateful to Hawking for sparking off the journey that helped me to come to terms with myself’: Alexander, 26, student I had no personal encounters with Stephen Hawking, but at a crucial juncture in my life, and without meaning to sound trite, I found him to be truly inspirational. For the majority of my life I have struggled with mental illness. I had depression from a very early age, and had countenanced suicide on a number of occasions in my darkest moments. I then turned to drink and drugs in my late teens in order to self medicate my depression, which inevitably made it worse. Becoming clean and sober was terrifying for me, because it meant I had to grapple with my depression head on. I felt trapped by it, and it seemed like my only choices were death through drink and drugs, or a lifetime of clean and sober misery. It was then I stumbled upon Hawking’s eloquent quote. “Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up.” For someone like me this was a very powerful message. Living with depression for so long convinced me that life was not worth living. For these words to come from a man who was afflicted with such a debilitating illness seemed extraordinary to me. I will be forever grateful to Hawking for uttering those words and sparking off the journey that helped me to come to terms with myself. I always took an interest in Hawking after that. And for all his great scientific achievements, it was his humanity that I most admired. I was shocked and bereft when I heard the news of his death. The universe is a darker place without him. ‘Hopefully the new generation of young scientists will not forget his legacy and be inspired to continue his work’: Silvia Mallaschitz, 41, analyst I discovered his books and work at a time where I had no real interests or direction in life. And while studying and working in a completely different field, the fascination with physics and the universe his books ignited, made me realise how much I truly don’t know. He was really the one who sparked my interest in studying physics on my own and read more and more about it. His approach to making the masses easily understand even difficult topics with a lot of humour was amazing. Science needs more of such popular rock stars like he truly was. There’s a vast empty space left behind now, which will be very hard to fill. But hopefully the new generation of young scientists will not forget his legacy and be inspired to continue his work. Every time I look up at the night sky, I’m very grateful to this man to make me think on a larger scale and discover every day the beauty of the universe around us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/15/my-golden-days-review-arnaud-desplechin","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T09:00:32Z","webTitle":"My Golden Days review – rich, fluent exploration of student love","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/15/my-golden-days-review-arnaud-desplechin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/15/my-golden-days-review-arnaud-desplechin","fields":{"headline":"My Golden Days review – rich, fluent exploration of student love","bodyText":"Arnaud Desplechin is such a distinctive storyteller: intriguing, perplexing, seductively indirect.

There is also a generic ambiguity; Desplechin deploys memories that stray to the edge of whimsy and fantasy. My favourite is Kings &amp; Queen (2004); this latest film, in fact his last-but-one, was in the Director’s Fortnight section of the Cannes film festival in 2015, and has only now found a UK release. For me, the incomplete jigsaw of its narrative ultimately felt less than entirely satisfying. It is about the unbearably sweet and unchangeable nature of remembered youth, speckled with literary references to Yeats, Proust and Homer. There is poise and charm in its young leads: Quentin Dolmaire and Lou Roy-Lecollinet, playing the student lovers Paul and Esther in the late 80s and early 90s, and doing it with eroticism and style. Mathieu Amalric plays the adult Paul, an ethnologist, suddenly and vividly reminded of his past by a strange mixup concerning his passport at the airport when he returns to France after many years abroad. When he was a teenager, he gave away his passport on a school trip to Minsk to help some Jewish dissidents get out of the country; now that dual identity has come to the attention of the authorities. Paul’s passionate affair with the bewitchingly beautiful Esther came later. The “dual identity” part of the story effectively frames the love story in a mysterious and unfinished way, but what of that parallel Paul, that shadowy doppelganger? His story is quibblingly raised and incuriously abandoned. Well, Desplechin’s film-making language is always fluent and rich."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/14/we-still-dont-have-the-technology-to-verify-stephen-hawkings-big-ideas","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T18:50:20Z","webTitle":"'We still don’t have the technology to verify Stephen Hawking's big ideas'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/14/we-still-dont-have-the-technology-to-verify-stephen-hawkings-big-ideas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/14/we-still-dont-have-the-technology-to-verify-stephen-hawkings-big-ideas","fields":{"headline":"'We still don’t have the technology to verify Stephen Hawking's big ideas'","bodyText":"To my mind, Stephen Hawking’s legacy is twofold: he was both a brilliant scientist who came up with some of the most revolutionary ideas of our time and a great communicator who managed to carry the world with him on a remarkable scientific journey. He got people across the world talking and thinking about complex science. Some of his early work was linked to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which takes space and time and squashes them together to make what we call a spacetime. If you look at the universe this way you see all sorts of strange phenomena, including black holes. Before Stephen’s work it was thought that nothing could escape a black hole, but his theoretical work led to the theory of Hawking radiation, which allows some radiation to leak from a black hole, enabling them to slowly decay and eventually evaporate. Stephen also worked on what has been called the Grand Theory of Everything – a single theory that would explain everything in the universe on a small and large scale. In physics, we’ve made great inroads in our understanding our universe. On the very small scale we have quantum mechanics to explain how things work, and on the grand cosmological scale we have general relativity to explain how things operate. But Stephen, with others, was trying to go further to find a theory that linked both these domains. It was a grand challenge, and I cannot think of a better person to take it on. I always had the feeling that Stephen was working on a higher operating system than the rest of us, and in that respect, he was a champion for us all in the understanding of the universe. We didn’t always understand exactly what his research involved, but boy were we glad he was out there, doing it and making the discoveries. Part of his early research was on singularities, the conditions we think occurred at the start of the big bang and also exist at the centre of a black hole. This is mind-warping stuff, even as a physicist, because it’s so alien from the everyday world that we live in. Stephen, however, gave us a conduit to enter that world and see what was happening beyond. He took the most obscure stuff out there in the cosmos and made it accessible. As a scientist and a science communicator, he was a great inspiration to me and many other physicists who wanted to join the quest to understand what’s out there in the universe. I’m so glad Stephen was alive for the first detection of gravitational waves in 2016. These were predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity but it took a century for technology to catch up, enabling us to detect them. Gravitational wave detectors are giving us a better understanding of black holes, which are hard to study as not even light can resist their gravitational pull. Now we might have the means of investigating and understanding in more detail some of the concepts that Stephen came up with. I’m glad he knew we had this new tool in our toolbox. Even now we don’t have the technology to verify some of Stephen’s big ideas. But as with Einstein, and others who are well ahead of their time, I feel we will be referring to his work and legacy for many years to come.

In some ways, it’s a fictional reworking of the real case of Latasha Harlins, an innocent black teenager shot dead by a Korean convenience store owner in Los Angeles about the same time as the Rodney King beating. Chon plays Eli, a young American-Korean guy who runs a shoe store with his brother Daniel (David So). Kamilla (Simone Baker) is an African-American kid who likes hanging out with them, to the rage of her family and particularly her brother, Keith (Curtiss Cook Jr), who is suspicious of the Koreans. A grumpy convenience store owner, Mr Kim, is played by Chon’s father, Sang Chon. When the King jury acquits the cops, the riots and looting commence. It’s a film with loose-limbed energy and passion and nice comic moments and vignettes, leading inexorably to tragedy. I have one caveat, or footnote. Sometimes the dialogue with Mr Kim splits on generational lines into the languages from the old and new countries; Eli might hear something in Korean and answer in English. But Mr Kim’s lines are left unsubtitled, and so is a long, long speech he has about two-thirds of the way through, in which the gestures and body language convey conciliation and wisdom. But shouldn’t the audience be told what this speech meant? Maybe leaving it unsubtitled preserves the importance of the cultural fracture. This is a fierce and forthright film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/19/blood-sweat-and-protests-on-the-rodeo-trail-in-new-zealand","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T00:15:11Z","webTitle":"Blood, sweat and protests: on the rodeo trail in New Zealand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/19/blood-sweat-and-protests-on-the-rodeo-trail-in-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/19/blood-sweat-and-protests-on-the-rodeo-trail-in-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"Blood, sweat and protests: on the rodeo trail in New Zealand","bodyText":"Trigger Happy and Honey Badger are being loaded into the chute as Chad Ormsby slides his feet into a battered pair of leather cowboy boots. Currently leading the table, the rodeo star is eight seconds away from being crowned national bull-riding champion of New Zealand; but first there’s the ride. “The first time I got on – I can still remember it now – it is just like a drug addict taking a hit,” said Ormsby, 28, a horse trainer and former jockey from Lake Karapiro. “Somehow it gets inside your blood and you just want to do it every day if you can. I describe it as being the best drug in the world – and it’s legal.” A few hundred metres away, a dozen protestors from the Animal Justice League are standing outside the entrance to the Wanaka showgrounds, calling for rodeo to be banned in New Zealand. New Zealand’s rodeo is a small circuit, with just 35 events a year and 500 competitors. During the hot summer season though, events can draw crowds in their thousands, as they are often staged around the holiday period. The Wanaka rodeo grounds. Below: Animal rights protestors outside the rodeo. “This isn’t an issue of town versus country, or rural versus urban; this is quite simply between right and wrong,” says Green party MP and animal welfare spokesperson Gareth Hughes. Hughes has never attended a rodeo, but has seen “disturbing” footage from inside. “Rodeo only works because animals are scared, and showing a fear response or in pain – which I think has no place in modern New Zealand.” In the last few years major New Zealand businesses such as Foodstuffs, Meridian Energy and House of Travel have withdrawn their sponsorship from rodeo events over animal welfare concerns. Chad Ormsby preparing his mount at the Wanaka rodeo. Below: Chad relaxes after his ride and is congratulated for his win. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Save Animals From Exploitation (Safe) have issued repeated and strident calls to ban the sport, calling the rural events “a terrifying and cruel experience for animals”, and saying New Zealand should follow the lead of the UK in outlawing them. “Rodeo events are brutal and often disturbing exhibitions of human domination over animals,” says Mandy Carter, head of campaigns for Safe. “It’s dumfounding that some New Zealand farmers are involved in this kind of animal abuse. Any decent farmer would be seeking to minimise stress to their animals, whilst rodeo does the opposite, seeking to rile them up so they ‘perform’.” The rodeo national finalists face the crowd. Overall championship winner John Hughes, bareback rider. Animal rights groups say rodeo places undue stress on the animals, as well as causing a litany of injuries including torn ligaments, broken bones, bruising and internal damage, particularly in the rope and tie and steer wrestling events, which use calves. In the 2017 season Safe recorded bulls and horses trying to climb out of chutes, calves being yanked off their feet by ropes around their necks, and steers wrestled to the ground and tied up. But the new Labour government rejected a ban in March, as has the New Zealand Veterinary Association and the thousands of passionate rodeo participants and spectators around the country, who almost exclusively live and work in rural areas. “May you be safe as we compete in the arena of life,” says the MC, reciting the Cowboy’s Prayer as bull-riders and bareback champions remove their hats, eyes lowered. Circling the edge of the arena is a local vet, on duty all weekend as required by the animal welfare act. She conducts health checks on every animal before and after they enter the arena, monitors their food, water and stress levels, and is on hand to attend accidents or injuries, of which there are none at the national finals. “It’s a hell of a lot better than it was 10 years ago; the intense scrutiny has made everyone sharpen up,” says the vet, turning her eyes up to the shade clothes stretched over the calves, and the padded head gear some of them wear in preparation for the steer wrestling and rope and tie events. Competitors at the 2018 rodeo national finals: Andrew Jamieson, Bert Elstob, Marcus Spencer-Bower and Murray Helliwell. “People don’t realise that rodeos are testing the real-life skills of stockmen. If a calf gets stuck in a barbed wire fence, you have to get it out. I wish I had some of the skills these men do – it would help me in my job,” she says. Rika riding a bull in one of the competitions, and beling released from the gated area. Ormsby holding on as tight as he can. Ernie Rika, 25, has been riding bulls for a decade. He works as a horse trainer for Chad Ormsby, and introduced his boss to rodeo. Both of them hope to turn their passion into a profession by becoming cowboys on the professional rodeo circuit in the US. Rika would like to see rodeos moved closer to towns to encourage more city dwellers to attend. “A lot of them [protestors] haven’t actually been to a show, or spent a lot of time around it,” says Rika. “I don’t know, it would be good if they came and looked for themselves, and had a bit of a talk to us. Rodeo has been around a long time, and I hope it continues even longer.” By the third round of the weekend, cowboys are falling to their knees with pain and exhaustion. Steer roping at Wanaka. “Right?” shouts a fan known as Abo, as a cowboy doubles over, spitting into the dust. “Fuck yeah,” comes the strangled reply. Pupils dilated with adrenaline, Ormsby steps up for his final ride, smothering the kick of fear he says proves how much he wants to win. The sharp tangy smell of one-tonne bulls mixes with the sweat of the cowboys, and the dust, and the hay, and the dry heat of the central Otago bush. “I see our animals like children, they need training, education and respect – then they learn their job and what is expected of them,” says Ormsby. “It is silly to think about hurting the animals or doing harm by them because in this world, we need them, we need to look after them.” Stinky, Blacky, Mongrel and Abo watch on as Orsmby lowers himself on to the bull, snorting in the chute as the crowd prickles with excitement. “It comes down to a short period of time – eight seconds – and you can either really achieve something or really fail at it,” says Ormsby. “But this is what we do. Cyclists get on a bike to go for a ride, we get on bulls.” All photograhy by Paul Roy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/13/steve-smith-made-to-look-mortal-as-south-africa-put-captain-in-spin","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T00:18:50Z","webTitle":"Steve Smith made to look mortal as South Africa put captain in spin | Adam Collins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/13/steve-smith-made-to-look-mortal-as-south-africa-put-captain-in-spin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/13/steve-smith-made-to-look-mortal-as-south-africa-put-captain-in-spin","fields":{"headline":"Steve Smith made to look mortal as South Africa put captain in spin","bodyText":"“He’s just looked in complete control, hasn’t he?” This was Steve Smith, talking about AB de Villiers after his side were comfortably beaten in the second Test in Port Elizabeth. Variations of that sentence are routinely uttered by exasperated opponents of the Australian captain from all over the cricket world. But less often by the South Africans, and certainly not over the last fortnight. Smith has now gone 14 innings without posting three figures against the Proteas, a drought that goes back to the first rubber of this corresponding tour four years ago. Smith’s peerless standard makes this anomalous, as is the fact that he has been out three times to left-arm spin in four innings across these two Tests – by far the mode of bowling he has fared worst against across the last two years, averaging better than 100 against all others. “The more you play, the more people have plans for you to try to keep you quiet,” Smith observed of his form. “It’s just a part of batting, sometimes you have to work really hard for your runs and take a little bit longer, and some days you come out and things happen really quickly for you. It’s just a part of playing and adapting to whatever’s being thrown at you.” The world’s leading batsman is averaging a positively mortal 32 in this series and no other Australian has posted three figures. That David Warner hasn’t dominated either is a reminder that the last time neither of Australia’s big two went big was when South Africa humbled them 16 months ago. As former Test opener Simon Katich put it on SEN radio, there is a sense of over-reliance on the pair. “They can’t always rely on David Warner and Steve Smith to get the hundreds,” he said. “The others have to start scoring them as well.” Another similarity to the last time they faced Faf du Plessis’ side is the regularity with which wickets are falling – one every 51.8 deliveries, compared to every 109.5 balls in the Ashes. In Durban, not losing wickets in clumps made up for their lack of one dominant performance, but at St George’s Park, collapses returned for the Australians in a way they hadn’t since touring Bangladesh last year. In both Tests, wickets fell on the cusp of intervals more often than not. This makes the fitness of Mitch Marsh all the more important; the man in the best nick of the Australian top six. Never since his debut in 2014 has the all-rounder been so vital. In each Test since returning to the side in December, he’s had an innings last at least 100 balls, and he’s now taking wickets with the old ball. But he picked up a groin strain for his efforts. For the tired bowling group, heavily taxed by De Villiers in the second leg of back-to-back Tests, a long mid-series breather is helpfully timed. Despite playing well below their best, Smith’s side were, by his estimation, only 100 runs from a realistic tilt at a 2-0 lead. He was buoyed by the four wickets they claimed in the second innings, finishing the fixture with a fight. “I’m proud of the boys,” Smith told SEN. “It was nice to take a few wickets and nice to get AB out conventionally for the first time this series. Hopefully, we left a few scars on their top order.” Nathan Lyon will leave better for his second shift, as will Usman Khawaja after scrapping 75. Given it was their first loss in a Test Match since September, having won six and drawn once since, don’t expect panic. It won’t hurt that they won’t be forced to face Kagiso Rabada again on the tour, provided the local talisman doesn’t successfully appeal his series-ending ban. For theatre, there could be no better replacement than Dale Steyn given his long and storied history against Australia, but that looks less likely by the hour. It doesn’t change the story for Australia – they just need big runs, and will take them from anywhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/14/saving-the-children-are-the-three-most-dangerous-words-uttered-by-white-people","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T00:08:40Z","webTitle":"'Saving the children' are the three most dangerous words uttered by white people | Amy McQuire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/14/saving-the-children-are-the-three-most-dangerous-words-uttered-by-white-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/14/saving-the-children-are-the-three-most-dangerous-words-uttered-by-white-people","fields":{"headline":"'Saving the children' are the three most dangerous words uttered by white people","bodyText":"On the day of the Abbott-Turnbull leadership spill in 2015, the Channel Seven Sunrise host Samantha Armytage joined the talking heads from the other mainstream television stations outside Parliament House. It was the first parliamentary sitting day of the year and they were broadcasting live – all of them set up next to each other, less than five metres apart. But they could not have anticipated the backdrop. That day various Grandmothers Against Removals groups from around the country had descended on Canberra to protest against the skyrocketing rates of Aboriginal child removal. It had been organised months in advance. About 100 people, many of them grandmothers who had experienced their grannies being taken away, many of whom had been placed in white families, stood behind the cameras waving Aboriginal flags and chanting for justice. The response from “journalists” Armytage and David Koch was worse than silence. In one of the ad breaks, they turned around and admonished those who had assembled behind them. Rather than listen to their stories, rather than hearing about their children, they castigated them for daring to interrupt their broadcast. As Armytage “tsked tsked”, Koch told them to look at the charities he donated to before addressing him. On Tuesday Armytage appeared to have a change of heart. Suddenly she was deeply concerned about the children – the Aboriginal children who in her words, needed to be saved from “rape, assault and neglect”. Three years before, she couldn’t have cared less. They were just a pesky nuisance – a rowdy crowd interrupting her pretty backdrop. It seems only white people are capable of caring for black children, and so Sunrise invited two other white people onto a panel with Armytage today – the commentator Prue MacSween and the radio host Ben Davis, to respond to a story in the Daily Telegraph. The story was splashed across the front page in three bold lines: “Save our children.” It relied on quotes from the federal assistant minister for children and families, David Gillespie, who said now was the time to place Aboriginal children with white families. “Foster care is not ideal but there is a reluctance to put them in a more permanent situation for fear of creating another stolen generation,’’ Gillespie said in the paper. Neither McSween nor Davis nor Armytage have any expertise in this area. None of them have any expertise in Aboriginal affairs. Their credibility rests on just one thing: they are all white. That has always been the most crucial criteria for a media commentator, after all. It’s no surprise then, that all of them were in unison with McSween, who called for another stolen generation, claiming the debate was a “no brainer”. “You know we can’t have another generation of young Indigenous children being abused in this way, and this conspiracy of silence and this fabricated PC outlook that it’s better to leave them in this dangerous environment,” she said. “Just like the first stolen generation who were taken for their wellbeing, we have to do it again, perhaps.” According to Armytage, the arguments against this were not coming from Aboriginal people, but “many bureaucrats, many of them white”, before throwing to Davis, who quoted Warren Mundine and claimed Aboriginal people are “the culture they are growing up and seeing, they are getting abused and hurt and damaged”. Armytage then replied: “Let’s hope some sense prevails here, poor kids.” For a journalist, Armytage is neither objective nor well-researched. There were many mistruths regurgitated in that short segment (and it’s interesting that despite their deep concern, they could only afford a few minutes to discussing it). One, the idea that Aboriginal children are not being placed in white families is a lie. The kinship and Aboriginal child placement principles in many states and territories recognise the need for Aboriginal children to be kept in communities, or in extended families. But often, in practice this principle has fallen far short of its aims. A parliamentary inquiry into out-of-home care in 2015 heard that it can often come down to the whim of an individual child protection worker, and that the idea of placing a child with a non-Indigenous carer is not often a “last resort”. Suellyn Tighe from Grandmother’s Against Removals NSW told the inquiry: We have the Aboriginal placement principle, which states that you must follow this hierarchical system for placement of the children. That is not being adhered to at all – or only in very, very few cases. I do not think that I know anywhere it has been adhered to. I have not met anyone yet. The fact is that that is happening and it is law. The department is continually superseding that. The Department of Family and Community Services supersedes the law of the Aboriginal placement principle with sibling placement policies. That is a departmental policy; it is not legislation.” There was also the issue of child protection agencies not consulting with families about child placements, and children, even those placed in kinship care, being separated from their respective communities and cultures. In Victoria, as reported by the Guardian’s Calla Wahlquist, a third of First Nations children are placed with Aboriginal kin, and 41.6% are placed with non-Indigenous carers. There are horrendous stories I have heard of children being effectively stolen from their families with no consultation – being taken from schools or communities by police. When a child is taken away, it is very hard for families to get them back, even after a parent has done everything the department tells them they have to do. The greater lie is that Aboriginal children are not being taken away and are being kept in dangerous situations for fear of a stolen generation. That does not gel with the statistics: Aboriginal children are being taken away at exponential rates and these rates have grown every year since Kevin Rudd gave his apology to the stolen generations and promised it would “never happen again”. Claiming that the stolen generations were not real, and that the removals were carried out “for their own wellbeing” is overwhelmingly disrespectful to the testimony of so many of our elders, aunties, uncles and grandparents who continue to live with the trauma of forced removals. There are now more than 16,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care. These are rates higher than those taken under the stolen generations – prompting some to say this practice never stopped, it just changed its skin. While non-Indigenous children are more likely to be taken away for physical and emotional abuse, Aboriginal children are largely taken away because of “neglect”, which is often seen as a subjective term based on cultural interpretation. As Aboriginal children and families are being torn apart due to their poverty, there is little investment in the community – there is little focus on what can be done to make community and families safer so that children can remain at home, and grow up with their family. It is not because Aboriginal parents don’t care about their children. As the Aboriginal researcher BJ Newton found in her thesis on how Aboriginal parents view child protection, there was an overwhelming feeling of powerlessness about being able to change their circumstance. “A good example was where there was a mum with a young family,” Newton told me last year. “They had the choice — they could either be homeless, or they could be moved to a place in town, but the public housing was only available in the middle of a drug-fuelled area. “The mother and father had had a lot of problems with [substance abuse] in the past, and they were trying to overcome that. “The mother was very angry with the Department of Housing for placing her in that local area when she was trying to get her older children back. She knew there was no way she would have a chance of getting them back if she was placed there. So she felt powerless.” Of course, you would not hear the testimony of this mother on a show like Sunrise – which is focused on centring white outrage. Taking a child away is not the best option. We already know that children who have been placed in the child protection system are more likely to end up in juvenile detention, and then adult jail. They are also likely to experience traumatic stressors which follow them through their life and impact on their development. These are not simple issues. These are not “no brainers”. These are complex situations that do not deserve the two-minute sermonising from white people who have no understanding and no real interest in Aboriginal children. Of course we are in a situation now where children are sometimes not safe in some homes. This situation is based on a continuing legacy of colonisation that has compounded intergeneration trauma, and resulted in behaviours including alcohol dependency, drug addiction and violence. Trauma is not just a word easily swatted away like a fly – it has real physiological, psychological and biological impacts on a person, regardless of race. The difference is Aboriginal people have had to deal with complex and collective trauma that has compounded throughout the generations. So that means of course there are some children who need to be taken away. But there should be a concerted effort to place children with families – with aunties, uncles or grandparents and, if not, other members of the community. And there should be a concerted effort to support Aboriginal mothers and fathers so they can raise their children in a safe and loving environment. We have seen in so many cases how violent the child protection system can be. Think of young Tiahleigh Palmer, who was murdered while in foster care with a white family. Think of the little 20-month-old Aboriginal baby who died in foster care in central western New South Wales in 2015. If children are taken away from their families they are placed in the care of the minister. Shouldn’t there be accountability? How can we be assured that they are not placed in more danger than what they were in, given the state of the child protection system? That’s not to say there aren’t many great carers out there – Indigenous and non-Indigenous – but the removal of children should always be the last resort. The media favours the opposite – taking away more and more black children under the pretence that they are “saving them”. “Saving the children” are the three most dangerous words uttered by white people. In this debate, Aboriginal children have not only been ripped away from us, there has in the rhetoric of front pages like the Daily Telegraph been an attempt to assimilate them. Suddenly they are owned by Australia, they are “ours”, they are homogenised into a mass where they can be pitied and rescued by white saviours. This is dangerous because Aboriginal Australia does not want or need saving. There are many Aboriginal people working in this very area, all across the country, who are calling for a more nuanced, evidence-based conversation that prioritises the need of children to not only be safe and healthy, but also to be raised in their culture and their communities. If Armytage and her colleagues really cared about black children, they would have taken a few minutes to listen to those strong grandmothers outside Parliament House three years ago, grandmothers who have first-hand experience of the child protection system stealing their children. Instead they turned up their noses, and then turned their backs. • This piece was first published by IndigenousX • Comments on this article have been pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is on the topics that have been written about in the article."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2018/mar/15/birth-water-sweat-and-menstrual-blood-museum-of-waters-australian-donations","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T02:40:02Z","webTitle":"Birth water, sweat and menstrual blood: Museum of Water's Australian donations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/15/birth-water-sweat-and-menstrual-blood-museum-of-waters-australian-donations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/mar/15/birth-water-sweat-and-menstrual-blood-museum-of-waters-australian-donations","fields":{"headline":"Birth water, sweat and menstrual blood: Museum of Water's Australian donations","bodyText":"On a large shelf in the main gallery of Fremantle Arts centre sits a tiny jar containing a tablespoon of liquid: dark, thick and red, not unlike the artisan jam you’d expect in a jar like that. But, according to the handwritten label, it’s filled with something else entirely. “Menstrual blood,” it reads. “Collected Sunday 18.2.18. Created between 9am and 2.15pm.” After that comes the name of the donor (Sarah Thomason), and the item’s catalogue number: “1194.” The blood is the 1194th sample of water to be donated to the Museum of Water, an ongoing project from London-based live artist Amy Sharrocks. Since 2013, the museum has travelled across the UK and the Netherlands, accumulating ever-more items for display – three bottles of 129,000-year-old water here; a jar of birth-water there; a melted snowman; and some holy water. And since last year’s Perth festival, the Australian public has been invited to donate a sample of their own. Dam water. Bath water. Breath, sweat, tears. The project ‘custodians’ set up shop in Fremantle in 2017, but also travelled to remote communities across Western Australia, collecting the stories of the people who brought them water for an audio project that runs alongside the exhibition. And for the next month the full Perth collection – 541 bottles, along with 20 more from the global museum – is on display. The museum is billed as “an invitation to ponder our precious liquid”, but it’s more than that, too: it’s a way to give people a chance to share their story, and a musing on the role of museology itself. “Who curates our collections? Who decides what goes into a museum? Who do we look to for authority?” Sharrocks tells Guardian Australia. “The world is hurtling in a certain direction right now, and it’s time to reconsider who we listen to, and to hear different voices in the world.” The brief – to “choose what water is most precious to you” – is broad, and the way people interpret it speaks volumes. “People amaze me regularly with what they bring,” Sharrocks says. The project has been addictive; she travelled from the UK to Perth four times for the Australian iteration, and spent the rest of it checking her messages every morning to find out what new waters had been added overnight. When you give everyone a voice, she says, “extraordinary things happen”. In Perth, there’s a baby’s bottle filled with water from a bath shared by two infant children, born after “four miscarriages, three unsuccessful IVF implants and countless drugs, scans and hormones”. There’s the melted snow of Kilimanjaro; 19,490-year-old water collected from Berkner Island in Antarctica (the scientist also brought in an ice core); and three jars of water from the three dams that irrigate the first avocado farm in Torbay, WA. With each item comes a handwritten note – and in some cases an audio recording – detailing what the water is, and what it means to the person who brought it. From a child called Tobias comes one of my favourites: “Water that my mum cooked her egg in four times.” Sharrocks has focused on water in much of her work. In 2007, she invited 50 people to swim across London, through its lakes, lidos and private pools; in 2011, she completed her series of public walks tracing the city’s forgotten and long-buried rivers. The element lends itself to art because it exists both within and around all of us: a shared reality that transcends the personal, social and environmental to tell a political story too. “The war in Syria, one of the causes was a drought – it is one of the world’s first water wars,” Sharrocks says. “It’s caused millions of people to leave Syria ... I never expected to see images of people in boats as we’ve seen over the last few years. They are images from history books brought to life, and the most disgusting reality.” One jar in Perth contains bottled water an asylum seeker bought for her son; she and her two infant children spent 21 days on a boat to Christmas Island, packed in with 83 others. “There’s a lot of people on islands not being allowed into Australia,” Sharrocks says. Climate change has also had a profound impact on Perth’s dwindling water supply, and the collection contains hope for a solution: a small bottle of water from the Groundwater Replenishment Scheme, donated by Minister for Water Dave Kelly. The year after the project began in Soho in 2013, it was installed at Somerset House in London. Sharrocks remembers a woman arriving one day, waiting and listening for almost an hour while others told their stories, before simply placing a tiny bottle on the table and leaving the room. Sharrocks picked it up and read the label. “It was a bottle full of tears after the death of her baby. And she walked out. I ran out after her – she never told me much more than what is on the label she attached, we just cried and hugged,” she remembers. “Sometimes stories are unutterable. There were so many tears in that bottle.” Walking through the museum you’re struck by the generosity of the people who donated. Some of the bottles are so personal, so meaningful, it’s almost shocking that they’d let them go. “The woman who gave me her breaking waters and the water her baby was born into – I’ve never met her, but she emailed me saying, ‘I have this bottle, do you want it?’” Sharrocks says. “I was like, ‘What?’” The woman, in the end, thanked Sharrocks for the opportunity. “She said, ‘I never would have thought to keep the water of her birth, and I don’t need to own it, but I’m so glad that it exists ... Now when my daughter is older I can bring her to see it. It’s part of the world.’” “I wish I’d thought of this piece 10 years ago, so I could have brought my own children’s birth water ... There’s this extraordinarily careful sense of give and take in the museum, where everybody gains.” The museum’s Australian iteration features sound art by Rachael Dease, workshops and the audio archives, as well as short documentaries made by school children in WA – one, from kids in Perth, traces the passage of water across the city through pipes under the ground; another, from children in Karratha in the Pilbara, documents a spear-fishing trip and a turtle rescue. In one room of the historic sandstone complex, which was once used as a psychiatric hospital, visitors without a donation are asked what water they would have brought. They have written or drawn their responses, and fixed them to cover the walls. “I would have brought water from the part of the river where it suddenly drops off. The part of the river where I planned to drown,” reads one. “I would have brought the water from the river on the day I chose life, and courage, and everybody who I love.” The Australian collection has ended up slightly different to those in Europe. “In Australia, people seem really happy to get into the grit and dirt of the land, and the rivers, and the bodies of water,” Sharrocks says. “People have bored holes, and dredged up water – there’s this sense of river-in-a-jar.” She brings it back to a connection to country that has been part of Australia’s history for millennia. “I’ve met so many Indigenous elders, so many Noongar people, who talked to me about the community of water. They said actually it’s not just about the water; the waterhole is an epicentre of social cohesion. It’s the water, but it’s the reeds and it’s the dragonflies, it’s the wind that’s in the trees,” she says. “Everything happens in a context. This world is composite, not exclusive.” Of course, by its nature, the exhibition is ephemeral. In most of these jars the water will find a way out, evaporating through the glass, the plastic, through the porosity of the lid. For one woman, who collected her sample five years ago – the day her partner died – the water’s leakage represents an evaporation of grief. “She has associated the lowering levels of her water with a kind of recovery. Her pain wasn’t over, her grief wasn’t gone, but her mourning had changed from desperate pain to a calmer, abiding grief,” Sharrocks says. “It’s absolutely intended, in the museum, that the bottles are evaporating. But if the water is going out of the bottles, where is it going to?” she asks. The answer is that we’re breathing each other’s stories in. “All of us are implicated in this process. This sense of: how are we going to share this world? The bounty of this world? How are we going to save it, and share it amongst these countries, among these little islands? “That’s the question for all of us to answer – I would not want that question answered by a few white Western men. I don’t feel they do well at answering questions like that.” • The Museum of Water is on display at Fremantle Arts Centre until 23 March and can be viewed online"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/13/abused-indigenous-children-need-safe-homes-not-derailed-debate-says-peak-body","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T04:29:26Z","webTitle":"Abused Indigenous children need safe homes, not derailed debate, says peak body","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/13/abused-indigenous-children-need-safe-homes-not-derailed-debate-says-peak-body","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/13/abused-indigenous-children-need-safe-homes-not-derailed-debate-says-peak-body","fields":{"headline":"Abused Indigenous children need safe homes, not derailed debate, says peak body","bodyText":"Revived arguments about the removal of Indigenous children from their families are just the latest instalment of a “narrow debate” bringing Australia closer to another Northern Territory-style intervention, an Indigenous peak body has said. The National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples said it agreed vulnerable children needed to be removed from homes but current discourse – reignited by the alleged sexual assault of a toddler in Tennant Creek last month – threatened to derail real action on issues behind high rates of child endangerment. The statement from congress came after a report by News Corp that the federal assistant minister for children and families, David Gillespie, had called for “white families” to be allowed to adopt abused children. Gillespie said this report was inaccurate and misrepresented his view. Since the 1997 inquiry into stolen generations, Australian jurisdictions have prioritised placement of Indigenous children with Indigenous carers, but it is not mandatory. The congress said children in danger needed to be with healthy families in safe communities. “A narrow debate has centred primarily on whether or not to ‘remove children who have suffered’,” it said. “This dialogue is akin to the ‘crisis talks’ that sparked the Northern Territory emergency response under the Howard government. It essentially stops at the call to protect and punish, or to push more programs and promote more police. “A second broader ongoing debate, seemingly overshadowed somewhat by the former debate, acknowledges individual dysfunction and wrong-doing, but goes further in its attempt to understand how these individual situations are linked to broader policy, systemic failures and inter-generational issues. It essentially strives for a clearer understanding of causation and holistic solutions.” Congress said it was troubled by the prevalence of abuse in out-of-home care settings, and there was a need to know more about where children were being sent. It said responses needed to be community controlled and involve Indigenous organisations which had been working and advocating on child protection, and rejected accusations they and other Indigenous leaders had been silent on child abuse. The organisation also said the suggestion child abuse was linked to Indigenous culture was “highly offensive”. Gillespie rejected the report that he was advocating for “white families” to adopt at-risk Indigenous children. He told Guardian Australia he did not refer to “white families” and his other comments were in response to alarming statistics from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare released last week. His point had been that more open adoption processes should be considered with a greater focus on permanency, he said. “There are a huge number of children around the nation in the child protection system,” he said. “Last year 49,315 were subject to substantiated cases of abuse or neglect. That’s a frightening figure. “We owe the care the safety and wellbeing of children, for them to have some permanent, stable and caring environment to grow up in.” Gillespie said the best outcome for children who are taken into care is to be with “kith and kin” but it “shouldn’t trump the safety and wellbeing of the child”. Asked if he believed kinship placements were trumping the safety of children, Gillespie pointed to comments by commentators Warren Mundine and Jacinta Price. While child protection was run by state and territory governments, the commonwealth was in a position to set policy, he said, and last week’s report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare had raised important questions. Dale Wakefield, the territory families minister, said the NT government also supported giving a sense of permanency for vulnerable children but the most permanent placement was likely to be in kinship care. She said there was a misunderstanding about kinship care, which applied to all at-risk children, and the Aboriginal child placement principle, which prioritised family or Indigenous carers whenever possible. She conceded the department was not implementing either placement principle well enough, but said improvements were being made, including work to identify kinship carers earlier in the child protection process. A Sunrise morning show segment discussing the News Corp article and Gillespie’s comments drew ire on Tuesday morning, in part for having no Indigenous person on the panel. Host Samantha Armytage wrongly said abused Indigenous children “can only be placed with relatives or other Indigenous families”, and described a “huge move to leave Aboriginal children where they are even if they’re being neglected in their own families”. “Just like the first stolen generation where a lot of children were taken because it was for their wellbeing, we need to do it again perhaps,” added commentator Prue MacSween. David Shoebridge, Greens MP in New South Wales, lodged a formal complaint about the Sunrise segment with the Australian Communications and Media Authority, labelling MacSween’s comment as “highly offensive, racist and divisive”. The Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy said this week that the suggestion there was a reluctance to remove children out of fears of a second stolen generation had been “flatly rejected”. She said Indigenous kinship care worked well if supported appropriately, and better housing was key."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/if-business-leaders-want-to-regain-our-trust-they-must-act-upon-climate-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T23:29:12Z","webTitle":"If business leaders want to regain our trust, they must act upon climate risk | Ian Dunlop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/if-business-leaders-want-to-regain-our-trust-they-must-act-upon-climate-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/if-business-leaders-want-to-regain-our-trust-they-must-act-upon-climate-risk","fields":{"headline":"If business leaders want to regain our trust, they must act on climate risk","bodyText":"Business leaders seem astonished that community trust in their activities is at an all-time low, trending toward the bottom of the barrel inhabited by politicians. To the corporate leader dedicated to the capitalist, market economy success story of the last 50 years, that attitude is no doubt incomprehensible and downright ungrateful. But it is hardly surprising given continuing scandals and declining ethics across the corporate and banking worlds, driven by the pernicious impact of short-termism, rising inequality and undue political influence; in large part the outcome of the oxymoron of “pay-for-performance” remuneration. So how is trust regained? The need for stronger leadership, ethics, greater transparency, open communications and improved culture feature prominently in current responses. But a far more fundamental requirement is ignored, namely that business must lead on really critical issues, particularly the point raised long ago by economist Kenneth Boulding: “Anyone who considers economic growth can continue indefinitely in a finite system is either a madman or an economist”. The constraints Boulding anticipated have now arrived, as burgeoning population and economic growth crash into global biophysical limits which cannot be circumvented. Those constraints, encompassing resource shortages, biodiversity loss and pollution in various guises, do not feature in the capitalist economic lexicon, as technology and the market are supposed to overcome all as we march toward the sunlit uplands of the neoliberal nirvana. In the real world, the entire growth model under which Australia and global economies operate, is no longer sustainable; it sowed the seeds of its own destruction some time ago and is rapidly driving itself into the ground as growth rates decline. This is the great “black elephant” of business and politics; a known, knowable fact that no one wants to acknowledge – the unmentionable in the recent Business and Governance Summits around the country, as our leaders strive to compound the problem with self-defeating subterfuges to maximise growth, not least corporate tax cuts and trade agreements. To the community, these constraints are increasingly obvious as the quality of life for the average person deteriorates in myriad ways. The rhetoric of much-vaunted corporate social responsibility no longer holds water when our supposed leaders are not prepared to address the issues that really count for our survival, let alone prosperity. These range from basic considerations such as ensuring food and water availability, to the creation of genuinely sustainable global societies. However, the first priority must be human-induced climate change, manifest as the lack of an atmosphere into which we can continue dumping carbon pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation, without causing catastrophic consequences. Climate change is accelerating far faster than expected, to the point where it now represents an existential threat to humanity, that is a threat posing permanent large negative consequences which will be irreversible, an outcome being locked in today by our insistence on expanding the use of fossil fuels. This should be a major concern in Australia given that we are more exposed than most, but instead our leaders would have us embark on massive fossil fuel expansion. Already one of the world’s largest carbon polluters when exports are included, Australia is complicit in destroying the conditions which make human life possible. There is no greater crime against humanity. The economic and social impacts will be devastating unless that policy is rapidly reversed. The unprecedented hurricane season in the Atlantic, bushfires in the Californian winter, extreme heat in many parts of South Asia and rapid heating of the Arctic with associated instability in the northern hemisphere weather system, are only the most recent portents of what is to come. The worst outcomes can only be avoided now by emergency action, akin to restructuring economies on a war-footing. It finally seems to be dawning on corporate and investor leadership that climate change is a real and present danger which is not going away. Company directors are personally liable for failing to assess and act upon climate risk, but the greenwash continues. Major corporates parade their credentials in support of serious climate action, but none of their scenarios and policies are in line with the Paris objective of constraining global temperature increase “well below 2.0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.50C”. Fortunately, as understanding of the risks improves, regulatory pressure mounts. The recommendations triggered by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, via the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) are gradually being taken up, with companies voluntarily disclosing the impact which a 2C policy framework would have on their organisation, assuming such a framework was ever put in place (by governments?). Progress, but reactive and certainly not leadership. The question that must be answered is: “what are you doing proactively as a company to create a 2C world” – more realistically closer to 1.5C, as it is now patently clear that 2C is far too high? If business genuinely wishes to regain trust, it must proactively face up to the challenge posed by climate change and initiate emergency action. Beyond that, it must open up honest debate on a new economic model to replace conventional growth. It is the only way business will be sustainable in the 21st century with a real social licence to operate.

The island – roughly halfway between Australia and New Zealand – had been governed by its legislative assembly since 1979, until the Australian government’s decision in 2015 to revoke its autonomy. Australian federal and state laws are now enforced and islanders are now entitled to Medicare and other government services. Travelling between the island and Australia no longer requires a passport. The legal challenge lodged with the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights includes a report from an Australian linguistics expert, Prof Peter Mühlhäusler, who found Norfolk Islander’s have a distinct ethnicity, culture and language. “Intermarriages with mainland Australians and Australian assimilation policies have not significantly weakened the distinctiveness of the Norfolk Islanders of Pitcairn descent,” the report found. “The literature surveyed as well as field notes, taken over 21 years, confirm the Norfolk Islanders of Pitcairn ancestry remain a genetic isolate. The Norfolk Islanders are distinct from mainland Australians with regard to all parameters that define ethnicity: homeland, shared ancestry, cultural narrative and cultural core values.” Robertson is representing Albert Fletcher Buffett, an Indigenous inhabitant of Norfolk Island. The complaint states that because of Norfolk Island’s previous anomalous position – neither a part of Australia nor a state in the federal system – there are no remedies for its roughly 1,700 people in constitutional or public law. “The government has commandeered the radio station and closed the maternity wing of the hospital – an insidious step to deter births on the island and force women to give birth in Australia,” the complaint states. “Already, war memorial commemorative events have been instructed to play the doggerel Australian anthem, Advance Australia Fair, in preference to God Save the Queen or the Indigenous anthem. “A particularly cruel result of the recolonisation has been to take away from Norfolk Islanders the long-standing enjoyment of their identity at international and regional political and cultural organisations, and potentially at sporting events.” The minister for territories and local government, John McVeigh, said the Australian government was aware of the complaint but had not seen it and “therefore the Australian Government is not in a position to comment specifically about that matter”. “Norfolk Island has been an integral part of Australia since 1914 and the Coalition government is keen to continue working with the community to deliver services and infrastructure,” he said. “Since June 2015, the government has taken steps to improve services to the Norfolk Island community, strengthen governance arrangements and invest in the local economy. In the year following the introduction of Medicare on Norfolk Island, local GP visits increased by 60%, demonstrating a huge unmet need for GP services. This increased demand is a good sign that people are accessing the services they need.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14937","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T00:00:40Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,937","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14937","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14937","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,937","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/18/trump-trade-tariffs-debate-yanis-varoufakis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-18T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"Trump and trade tariffs: big lies founded on small truths | Yanis Varoufakis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/trump-trade-tariffs-debate-yanis-varoufakis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/trump-trade-tariffs-debate-yanis-varoufakis","fields":{"headline":"Trump and trade tariffs: big lies founded on small truths","bodyText":"Donald Trump is perhaps the US president best equipped to understand that some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall. His personal business plan always involved racking up enormous deficits and debts, before finding a way to unload them on to others – his employees and creditors mostly. Last week the US president imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The notion that he did so because he is concerned about America’s trade deficit collapses into a pool of implausibility when projected upon a businessman so intensely relaxed about being in the red. The fact is, Donald Trump is only pretending to care about the trade deficit. And economic history is on his side. Since the mid-1970s, the United States became the first superpower in history that succeeded in massively boosting its global hegemony on the back of increasing trade … deficits. And how did America pay for these ever-expanding deficits? By maintaining the capacity of Wall Street and certain hi-tech industries to act as a magnet bringing into the country a sizeable portion of foreigners’ rents and profits. Trump claims America is a victim of unfair trade and that his tariffs are necessary to support blue-collar workers. His liberal critics despair, pointing to the dead-weight losses, and the threat of a trade war, that these tariffs foreshadow. Once again, the public debate is dominated, on both sides of US politics, by big lies founded on small truths. The small truths are that, yes, some jobs in the few US foundries that survive may be saved for a while; yes, there will be some losses for American consumers who will now pay more for cars and other metal-based goods; yes, the probability of a broader trade war has risen. But the big lie is that these are the issues to lose sleep over. A closer look at the $375bn that is China’s trade surplus with the United States reveals an awkward fact: more than half of it is due to American corporations (with Apple being one of many) that export US-branded goods from China into America, while channelling their profits through a network of tax havens. And most of the rest of China’s surplus is due to Washington’s own restrictions on the sale of hi-tech equipment to Chinese companies that are dying to get their hands on it. While ‘national security’ is the excuse, the real reason, in most cases, is a penchant for preventing Chinese engineers and technologists from replicating them. Trump is evidently motivated by short-term political gain. However, there is a longer game in progress here: America’s big tech, pharmaceutical giants and, of course, Wall Street would like to see his steel and aluminium tariffs as the first shot in a long campaign to demolish the Chinese walls, within which China’s companies are emerging as genuine competitors in the industries where real profits are made: artificial intelligence, intellectual property rights and financial services. Antagonising the best customer of the federal government’s debt is, however, a dangerous move. Especially if done on behalf of America’s richest corporations at a time when massive tax cuts in their favour necessitate the production of a lot more federal debt.

But here we are, in the upside down. Politico reports that Valerie Huber, a longtime abstinence-only activist turned Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) staffer, will be making decisions about federal family planning funds. Huber, who was suspended from her position at the Ohio Department of Health after a state ethics investigation in 2006, is founder of the National Abstinence Educators Association, which later became Ascend. (The name change was part of a broader move by the abstinence-only movement to seem more credible.) This comes on the heels of a leaked White House memo and HHS guidelines showing the administration plans to teach teenagers “fertility awareness methods” – otherwise known as the rhythm method – in lieu of birth control. Teens can barely get their homework in on time but somehow we’re expected to believe that they’re going to prevent pregnancy by tracking their periods. While there is no lack of outrageous acts generated by the Trump administration these days, the idea that abstinence-only education is making a comeback cannot get lost in the muck. Nearly a decade ago, I wrote a book about abstinence-only education. The lies told by federally funded “educators” to students across the country ranged from inaccurate to astounding. I spoke to young people who were taught they could be arrested for having premarital sex, and others who were warned birth control pills would make them infertile. Students in Montana were told condoms could give them cancer. A widely used textbook taught that Aids is be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact. Another said that a girl who has had sex is no longer “fresh.” These classes didn’t stop at inaccurate health information – they also promoted outdated gender roles, such as telling students that boys are wired for science while girls are “feelings” oriented and claiming that girls don’t like sex as much as boys so they need to be the ones to “put the brakes on” to stop intimacy. (These kinds of lessons were directly mentioned by young rape victims I spoke to while writing my book. They believed if they were assaulted it was because they didn’t do enough to stop it, or that they “tempted” their attacker.) This was a generation of students failed by their country – young people given false and dangerous information about their health who had to un-learn everything they were taught about sex. Under the Obama administration, we started to undo some of that damage. Teen pregnancy rates finally went down, contraceptive use was up. We cannot afford to go backwards. The truth is that a majority of Americans want their children taught accurate and comprehensive information about sex that will make them safer – 93%, in fact, want kids taught about abstinence and contraception. What teenagers learn about sex – or don’t learn – can quite literally impact their health and lives. They cannot afford to be lied to.

That estimate of premature deaths is 10 times larger than in previous studies, and could put deaths from exposure to the heavy metal on a par with smoking. Lead is most widely recognized as a hazard to children, who can suffer intellectual damage from even minimal exposure. However, because lead can contribute to conditions such as high blood pressure and hardening of arteries, it is also believed to contribute to cardiovascular and heart disease. “What this study suggests is there’s no apparent safe level” for adults, said the principal author of the study, Bruce Lanphear of Simon Fraser University, in Canada. Lanphear called the results both “troubling” and “hopeful”. Of environmental lead exposure, he said: “If we took that seriously, without knowing anything more about genetics, without any more expensive drugs, we could much more strategically reduce deaths from heart disease, which is pretty hopeful, actually.” The new Lancet study estimates that deaths from lead exposure approach the levels attributable to smoking, which kills 483,000 Americans each year. People are still far more likely to suffer complications from smoking. But only 20% of Americans now smoke, while lead exposure is more common, affecting 90% of people in the study. Lead was once routinely used in products like gasoline, paint and plumbing and persists in the environment. Lanphear analyzed earlier US government research from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Between 1988 and 1994, US experts gave blood-lead tests to 30,000 randomly selected Americans, from infants to the elderly, then followed up with people in 2011. The study conducted at Simon Fraser looked at 14,000 of those people who were 20 or older when tested, and examined relevant death certificates. People with the highest lead levels had a 37% greater risk than normal of a premature death and a 70% greater risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Lanphear concluded that lead could be responsible for as much as 18% of all mortalities, or 412,000 deaths. Researchers warned outside factors could lead to an “overestimation of the effect of concentrations of lead in blood, particularly from socioeconomic and occupational factors”. For example, people with the highest lead levels were more likely to be men, smokers, and less educated, with poorer diets, high cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes, all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The study attempted to adjust for many of these risk factors, in addition to the presence of the heavy metal cadmium in urine. Researchers said that it was possible these risk factors could confound the research and that scientists were unable to adjust for some other critical factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease, including air pollution.

Those looking to improve the public record can volunteer a few hours at the fifth annual Wikipedia edit-a-thon at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington DC, where one can create, edit and add to Wikipedia pages on women in the arts on 17 March. “It’s for the promotion and establishment of art history,” said Sarah Osborne Bender, the museum’s library director. “We encourage gender equality in the arts and this is one way of doing it.” Since the Wikipedia edit-a-thons started as informal gatherings in 2011, they have grown to 500 events worldwide where more than 7,000 volunteers have helped edit over 11,000 Wikipedia articles. It’s all part of an initiative to improve the gender imbalance on Wikipedia, where reports have suggested less than 20% of contributors are women. “Women haven’t felt as empowered to take the initial step of editing a Wikipedia article,” said Osborne Bender. “We train women, give them the tools and knowledge they need to create and edit articles, and stand by their edits, so it’s a community of support.” The event is co-presented with Art+Feminism, a group founded in 2014 as a grassroots initiative run by artists, activists and programmers. Their goal is to improve the representation of women on Wikipedia and foster the editing community. “We don’t just think about the impact of building awareness about the gender gap on Wikipedia in terms of what’s countable like article edits, but our greatest impact is modeling a form of defiance that kicks back at systems of misogyny and demands that they be dismantled,” said McKensie Mack, an Art+Feminism co-organizer. This year’s theme is female art museum directors, curators and gallerists, helping raise the profile of female leadership roles in the art world and balance the gender gap. Currently, the female art museum directors list on Wikipedia is incomplete. There is also an edit that questions the notability of these women. Edits that are made at these events are not always accepted on Wikipedia and they can spark online arguments. “It can get aggressive,” said Osborne Bender. “I wrote a Wikipedia article about a woman gallerist and the next day, I got a message saying it was deleted because she is not a ‘noteworthy person’, but someone in our community gave me advice on how to edit it to make the page stay.” The Wikimedia Foundation has also taken steps to reduce harassment by creating an anti-harassment team to mediate disagreements and protect people who are being attacked, especially new contributors to the site. Before each session, Osborne Bender briefs volunteers on the ethics of editing. “I think it’s a mistake to see Wikipedia as a PR tool,” she said. “It’s the self-policing of the site, and you have the right to edit an entry to make something sound more neutral.” While a Wikipedia-editing event for Women’s History Month is certainly a celebration, it’s hardly a party scenario. “The day starts chatty with a meet and greet, and as the day goes on, it gets real quiet,” said Osborne Bender. “People put on their headphones and settle in their zone. It’s a tough task writing Wikipedia articles from scratch, making sure you avoid plagiarism and distill large amounts of information into a digestible read.” The vibe is like a university library a week before finals – quiet and tense. “It’s like writing a research paper in the public domain but in a marathon setting,” she said. “We have coffee and snacks.” This Wikipedia edit-a-thon works similarly to the Black Lunch Table, which focuses on editing articles for black artists, as well as Wikiproject Women in Red, which adds articles about notable women who are missing from Wikipedia. The edit-a-thon and its spin-offs have helped raise the proportion of biographies about women on the English language edition of Wikipedia from 15% to 17%. “These events are beautiful because they are simple and effective; they are clear demonstration of the power of a committed collective of women and allies,” said Sehreen NoorAli, the founder of EdTechWomen, a community for women in technology. “Anything that tells a bigger, more accurate story about the contributions of women and minorities is essential at this historical moment because every concerted push is helping to overturn traditional structures of power to make a more equitable society.” The edit-a-thon group has helped edit Wikipedia entries on Dorrit Black, an Australian landscape painter from the 20th century; the New York feminist painter Joan Semmel; the artist Judy Chicago; and the art critic Lucy Lippard, among others. “I love training women to use this public platform and assert their own issues of visibility and imbalance in the arts,” said Osborne Bender. “We get a lot of women attending this event and I love to see that after they spend the day with us, they feel they can do this on their own.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/15/four-days-that-shook-britain-review-stories-of-amazing-bravery-kindness-and-humanity-in-the-wake-of-the-uk-terrorist-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T22:30:35Z","webTitle":"Four Days That Shook Britain review – stories of amazing bravery, kindness and humanity in the wake of the UK terrorist attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/15/four-days-that-shook-britain-review-stories-of-amazing-bravery-kindness-and-humanity-in-the-wake-of-the-uk-terrorist-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/15/four-days-that-shook-britain-review-stories-of-amazing-bravery-kindness-and-humanity-in-the-wake-of-the-uk-terrorist-attacks","fields":{"headline":"Four Days That Shook Britain review – stories of amazing bravery, kindness and humanity in the wake of the UK terrorist attacks","bodyText":"It is a year since the start of a wave of attacks in the UK – Westminster; Manchester Arena; London Bridge; Finsbury Park – when the response became: “There’s been another.” This ITV documentary is about the people for whom it was more than a terrifying news story. Not Khalid Masood, Salman Ramadan Abedi, Khuram Shazad Butt, Rachid Redouane, Youssef Zaghba or Darren Osborne. The attackers barely get a mention. It is about the innocent people caught up, about the stories within the story. Stories of terrible sadness and loss, but also of amazing bravery, kindness and humanity. Dani Singer is a student who was working as a tour guide on an open-top bus, and ran to help 75-year-old retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes who was hit on Westminster Bridge. Leslie died, but Dani was with him and was able to offer some human contact. In Manchester, the parents of eight-year-old Lily thought they had lost her when they found the hole in her leather jacket, felt the blood and saw her lose consciousness as they tried to get her out of the arena. Lily survived and is back at school, but didn’t want to tell her friends too much about it in case it gave them nightmares. Figen Murray somehow knew she had lost her son Martyn, she could feel it. She said goodbye to him in a hospital room, gave him a kiss and a hug. After driving round all the hospitals, Lucy Jarvis’s dad found his daughter, peppered with shrapnel wounds. He told her he loved her very much, just before she went in for surgery. Lucy made it and is OK now. Back to the capital for more grief and heroics. For Ozzie Gandaa, a security supervisor, it was about getting involved at London Bridge, taking on the terrorists, but also remembering he had a son and making sure he got back to him, no matter what. Baker Florin Morariu also fought; growing up in Romania had a way of making you fight for yourself, he says. And then Gerda Lapinskaite, searching for French boyfriend Sebastien for four days after the attack, refusing to accept it even when the police came and asked for his toothbrush, even when she went to see his body. “I imagined I’m going to go in there and I’m going to be like: ‘Well, it’s not him, you did your test but it’s not him’,” she says. “But then I walked into that room and … and it was him, and he was there. I barely could touch him, I had to do one thing, touch his nose …” A tear rolls down Gerda’s cheek. Mine, too. There are lots of teary moments in this powerful, affecting documentary, but there is something about Gerda and Sebastien, a story of young love in London with all but the first couple of chapters so rudely torn out, that is especially poignant. Plus the nose touching. Then came the hate crime and the reprisals and the van attack outside Finsbury Park mosque. And Imam Mohammed Mahmoud’s response, which was to protect the terrorist from the angry crowd. Yes, I remember Mohammed. And Gerda. And Florin, and Lily in Manchester, and some of the other stories, too. Seen all together like this provides something new – not just a reminder of the scale and the awfulness of three months last year, but something of the national response to it all as well. There was hatred and polarisation, the flames of extremism fanned. But there were positives, a glimmer of hope. Solidarity, as well as bravery and kindness. Ozzie admits to fear afterwards, had a panic attack the next time he saw a Muslim in a van. But then, as a black person who had experienced prejudice when growing up in London, he was determined not to become someone who is automatically suspicious. Dani, as a member of the LGBTI community, knows a thing or two about prejudice, too. Their responses, as well as Mohammed’s wisdom and magnanimity, are reassuring and peculiarly British. Between the tears, I felt a little bit of national pride, too, the nicest kind. Understandably, though, not everyone is ready for it yet. London geezer Brett Freeman is already ’avin a larf about it. Brett was stabbed at London Bridge. “It was a bad day all round, lost my money at the races, got the wrong train … terrorist attack, four stab wounds,” he says. “One of the terrorists had an Arsenal shirt, hopefully that weren’t the one that done me.” I don’t know if that means Brett’s a Gooner, or a Spurs fan, maybe? Anyway, he is joking about it; and the guy who stabbed him is dead. I reckon that makes it 1-0 to Brett.

With Russia still promising retaliation to the expulsion of 23 of its diplomats from the UK, Theresa May’s frantic telephone diplomacy in the wake of the attack seemed to have coalesced the UK’s allies into a united response. The joint statement from May, Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel dispensed with any earlier equivocation to say there was “no plausible alternative explanation” for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, other than Russian action. It said the Salisbury attack came amid “a pattern of earlier irresponsible Russian behaviour”. This message was reinforced hours later as the US increased sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 elections, and accused Russia of a cyber-attack against its energy grid and other infrastructure. US officials said malware had been found in the operating systems of several organisations and companies in the US energy, nuclear, water and “critical manufacturing” sectors, with the attacks allegedly traced to Moscow. The statement – described by Downing Street as the first time the leaders of the four nations had spoken together in such a way – marked a toughening of the rhetoric against Moscow, which continued to insist it had nothing to do with the attack. The leaders said they “abhorred” the Salisbury incident, and the involvement of the Russian-made novichok “constitutes the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the second world war”. “It is an assault on UK sovereignty and any such use by a state party is a clear violation of the chemical weapons convention and a breach of international law,” their statement said. The UK had “thoroughly briefed its allies that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack”, the statement said, adding: “We share the UK assessment that there is no plausible alternative explanation, and note that Russia’s failure to address the legitimate request by the UK government further underlines its responsibility.” The joint response followed calls between May and the three other leaders in the days since the attack. They included a talk with Macron on Thursday morning, a day after the French president’s spokesman had warned the UK against what he called “fantasy politics”, prompting concerns in No 10 that Macron might hold back on attributing blame. After the statement was released, Trump told reporters: “It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it. Something that should never, ever happen, and we’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.” May spent some of the Thursday visiting Salisbury, where she met DS Nick Bailey, who became seriously ill after going to the aid of Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.She did not meet the two Russian victims, who remain in a critical condition. May said the four countries were “very clear in attributing this act to Russia”. The statement showed that “allies are standing alongside us and saying this is part of a pattern of activity that we have seen from Russia,” she said. Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, used a speech in Bristol to accuse Russia of “ripping up the international rulebook” through actions aimed at subverting other countries. The Salisbury attack was “atrocious and outrageous,” Williamson said. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, said the evidence against Russia was “overwhelming”. He told the BBC: “There is something in the kind of smug, sarcastic response that we’ve heard that indicates their fundamental guilt. They want to simultaneously deny it, yet at the same time to glory in it.” While Johnson reiterated Britain’s plan to not send any dignitaries to this summer’s World Cup in Russia, he said the England team should take part.Johnson said the UK would provide samples of the nerve agent to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), based at The Hague, for more tests. Johnson also drew a connection between the Salisbury attack and the Syrian civil war, pointing to the way Russia had repeatedly protected the Assad regime from UN punishment over the Syrian government’s alleged use of chemical weapons. Successive UN inquiries found Assad’s troops had deployed chemical weapons, but the findings were vetoed by Russia. Writing in the Washington Post, Johnson said: “The common thread that joins the poisonings in Salisbury with the annexation of Crimea, the cyber-attacks in Ukraine, the hacking of Germany’s parliament and Russian interference in foreign elections is the Kremlin’s reckless defiance of essential international rules.” With Russia expected to expel UK diplomats as part of retaliatory counter-measures, Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, denied that novichok, the nerve agent identified as used in Salisbury, was of Russian origin. Along with the cybersecurity alert, the US treasury announced new sanctions against Russian individuals and entities – including the FSB and GRU intelligence agencies – as well as the Internet Research Agency in St Petersburg. As a result of Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, US officials said that thousands of Russian-planted stories reached millions of people on the internet. The new sanctions represent the broadest set of US punitive measures against Russia since the start of the Trump administration, and many of their targets are the same as those identified by an indictment by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/mar/15/corbyn-defies-critics-calls-for-calm-over-russia-nerve-agent-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T17:41:02Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn defies critics and calls for calm over Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/15/corbyn-defies-critics-calls-for-calm-over-russia-nerve-agent-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/mar/15/corbyn-defies-critics-calls-for-calm-over-russia-nerve-agent-attack","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn defies critics and calls for calm over Russia","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has defied critics in his own party and warned the prime minister against “rushing way ahead of the evidence” over the Salisbury poisoning, in what he called the “fevered” atmosphere of Westminster. The Labour leader used an article in the Guardian to urge the government to take a “calm, measured” approach – and warn against the drift towards a “new cold war” with Russia. Corbyn was criticised by some in his own party on Wednesday for what they regarded as his lacklustre response to Theresa May’s announcement of action against Moscow over the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, with a nerve agent. The Labour leader doubled down on that cautious approach on Thursday night. “This horrific event demands first of all the most thorough and painstaking criminal investigation, conducted by our police and security services,” he said. “To rush way ahead of the evidence being gathered by the police, in a fevered parliamentary atmosphere, serves neither justice nor our national security.” Corbyn warned against a “McCarthyite intolerance of dissent” over Russia. “Labour is of course no supporter of the Putin regime, its conservative authoritarianism, abuse of human rights or political and economic corruption,” he said. “However, that does not mean we should resign ourselves to a ‘new cold war’ of escalating arms spending, proxy conflicts across the globe and a McCarthyite intolerance of dissent.” Corbyn backed May’s decision to expel 23 diplomats, but suggested a financial crackdown on Russian oligarchs would be more effective. “We agree with the government’s action in relation to Russian diplomats, but measures to tackle the oligarchs and their loot would have a far greater impact on Russia’s elite than limited tit-for-tat expulsions,” he said. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, also pledged to “hammer” money-laundering, saying that would be a more effective weapon against Vladimir Putin’s regime than expelling diplomats. He claimed Labour would be tougher on the Putin regime than the government, by starving “gangster politicians” of cash, outlining anti money-laundering measures designed to stop the channelling of stolen money through the City and tax havens under UK jurisdiction. However, despite McDonnell’s tough stance, Corbyn’s remarks are likely to reignite tensions in the parliamentary Labour party over the leadership’s tough response to the Russia crisis. Nineteen Labour MPs have signed an early day motion, tabled by Barrow MP John Woodcock – a longtime Corbyn critic – putting on the record their full backing for May and the measures she announced. Some shadow cabinet members appeared to take a different stance, with Emily Thornberry insisting Russia had a “prima facie case” to answer, to which it had offered no defence. The shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith, publicly questioned the connection drawn by Corbyn’s spokesman, between intelligence in the Salisbury case and the “dodgy dossier” that helped make the case for the Iraq war. “I think the two situations are very different,” she told the BBC’s Today programme. But the Corbyn’s article made that link explicitly: “There can and should be the basis for a common political response to this crime. But in my years in parliament, I have seen clear thinking in an international crisis overwhelmed by emotion and hasty judgments too many times,.” “Flawed intelligence and dodgy dossiers led to the calamity of the Iraq invasion. There was overwhelming bipartisan support for attacking Libya, but it proved to be wrong. A universal repugnance at the 9/11 attacks led to a war on Afghanistan, which continues to this day, while terrorism has spread across the globe.” The Guardian understands neither Griffith nor Thornberry were shown the article in advance. They had been reassured by an interview Corbyn gave earlier on Thursday, in which he said that “evidence points towards Russia”. Corbyn’s allies have leapt to his defence, with the Brighton Kemptown MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle tweeting that the Labour leader’s detractors were “rightwing sods” who want to “beat the drums of war without a clear plan”. Woodcock said: “There is much in this piece which is troubling, not least the strange reference to McCarthyism. Jeremy Corbyn is not a powerless victim, he is a man who seeks to lead our country at a time when it has been shown to be under significant threat.” McDonnell said he had been urging tougher action against money laundering in the City and Britain’s overseas territories but had been repeatedly rebuffed by the government. Six Labour amendments to the sanctions and money laundering bill had been opposed by the Tories in the past two weeks, he added. “I will be tougher on Russian money than the government and clearer about how to do it,” McDonnell said. The shadow chancellor said that would involve tightening the definition of a “politically exposed person” – someone in a public position viewed as being at higher risk of bribery and corruption – to include a wider range of people close to Putin. “You can send diplomats back. You can use all the traditional methods and have virtually no effect whatsoever. The way to hurt them is through their pockets and the way to do that is to stop our financial institutions laundering their money,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/15/us-senate-candidate-proposes-arming-homeless-people-with-shotguns","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T18:59:30Z","webTitle":"US Senate candidate proposes arming homeless people with shotguns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/us-senate-candidate-proposes-arming-homeless-people-with-shotguns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/15/us-senate-candidate-proposes-arming-homeless-people-with-shotguns","fields":{"headline":"US Senate candidate proposes arming homeless people with shotguns","bodyText":"A Michigan candidate for US Senate has proposed arming homeless people with pump-action shotguns in an effort to reduce crime. Brian Ellison, who is running against Democratic incumbent Debbie Stabenow, says homeless people are “constantly victims of violent crime” and providing them with firearms would provide a deterrent. Ellison, a Libertarian who is expected to be the party’s candidate in the November midterm election, said he had settled on pump-action shotguns for practicality purposes. “Frankly I think the ideal weapon would be a pistol,” he told the Guardian, “but due to the licensing requirements in the state we’re going to have a hard enough time getting homeless people shotguns as it is. “Getting them pistols is probably next to impossible. The pistols need to be registered, people have to have addresses.” Carrying a concealed pistol is illegal without a permit, Ellison said, “whereas open-carrying a long gun is completely legal”. “So we thought that pump-action shotguns were a suitable alternative to a pistol.” Ellison, a former soldier who has served in Iraq, said he decided to run for office “just to try and make a difference”. As well as the shotgun plan, he would focus on minority rights and said he would oppose foreign military intervention. Regarding the pump-action shotguns, Ellison said he and his team would aim to “pre-qualify” homeless people who wanted shotguns and were deemed suitable candidates to own them. The homeless people would not be forced to carry pump-action shotguns, Ellison said. “The first thing that we’re gonna do is ask them if they think this is something that would benefit them. We’re certainly not trying to force anything on anybody.” Ammunition would be provided with the shotguns, probably in five- or six-shell magazines, Ellison said. More shells would be provided if the owners legitimately used their guns to defend themselves, however, if people spent their ammunition “shooting cans in somebody’s private property” then they would not be given more shells. Ellison said he did not think the plan was dangerous. “Well, are you worried about the police being armed with military weapons?” he asked. “I am. The world we live in is a scary world, where the police who used to dress in short-sleeved shirts and carry a revolver now have long rifles with scopes and bulletproof vests and armoured vehicles. “And quite frankly that scares me much more than a homeless person trying to defend themselves with a shotgun.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/25/brainstorm-detective-stories-neurology-suzanne-osullivan-unthinkable-brains-helen-thomson-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-25T06:29:45Z","webTitle":"Brainstorm: Detective Stories from the World of Neurology; Unthinkable: The World’s Strangest Brains – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/25/brainstorm-detective-stories-neurology-suzanne-osullivan-unthinkable-brains-helen-thomson-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/25/brainstorm-detective-stories-neurology-suzanne-osullivan-unthinkable-brains-helen-thomson-review","fields":{"headline":"Brainstorm: Detective Stories from the World of Neurology; Unthinkable: The World’s Strangest Brains – review","bodyText":"When I was a boy I had a recurring dream that Lilliputian figures were scurrying under my bed. I can’t recall if they bound my hands and feet like Gulliver, but I certainly found their activities fascinating and made no effort to resist, even when, on occasion, they succeeded in moving my bed slightly to the left or right. Every now and then, however, they would push the bed a little too close to the window. That I did not like, because it put me in range of the clown waiting on the balcony (I have always been terrified by clowns). Now, frozen by fear, I really was immobilised and it was only by screaming that I could snap myself awake and escape their night-time peregrinations. I was reminded of my lucid dream by the story of Donal, one of the patients featured in Brainstorm, Suzanne O’Sullivan’s new book of “detective stories from the world of neurology”. For 30 years Donal led a perfectly ordinary and seemingly contented life as a school janitor. Then one day he was summoned to the headmistress’s office and informed the school was making cuts and his job might be in jeopardy. That’s when he first saw the dwarves – “seven small brightly coloured men”, as Donal put it – scamper across the room and disappear behind the headmistress’s filing cabinet. As you can imagine, at first Donal told no one, but when one night the dwarves appeared beneath his bed and he gripped his wife’s arm in fright, he was forced to come clean and seek medical help. Those of us who have “normal” brains take our waking lives for granted. Levitating beds and cartoon characters are all very well for the dream world, but when we awake we expect to find the bus stop to be in the same place that we left it yesterday and the street to be the same reassuring shade of grey. But unusual spikes in electrical activity can happen to anyone at any time, sparking transient phenomena such as goosebumps or deja vu, which feel all too real at the time. Moreover, whether as a result of genetic abnormalities, hormonal imbalances, or microscopic lesions, some brains are wired or fire differently. Neurons responsible for one function get crossed with another and suddenly pains take on distinctive tastes, we begin to see vivid auras or are able to access long-lost memories or, conversely, can remember nothing at all and are condemned to the purgatory of the perpetual present. As one would expect from a neurologist in the Oliver Sacks tradition, O’Sullivan is a sure guide to these maverick brains and strange auras – a word, she reminds us, that is Greek for “breeze” and was originally used in the context of epilepsy. And like the late Dr Sacks, she is careful not to pass judgment on her patients, studiously parsing their accounts of hallucinations and seizures for clues to the underlying neurological dysfunction. Thus, rather than dismiss Donal as a fantasist or someone with psychiatric problems when an MRI scan of his brain proves normal, O’Sullivan hooks him up to an EEG (electroencephalogram) and has him sleep for several days in her epilepsy clinic to monitor and film his seizures. In this way, she finally captures the sudden telltale increase in electrical impulses that attends the dwarves’ appearance and recognises it as a seizure affecting Donal’s occipital lobe, the brain region that controls visual phenomena. Why dwarves, and precisely what triggers these seizures she cannot say, but by giving Donal medication to control his hallucinations she restores his mental equilibrium. The individuals canvassed in science writer Helen Thomson’s book Unthinkable are not so fortunate. The manifestations of their strange brains cannot be so easily treated, nor, in many cases, would they wish them to be. Take Bob. He can recall a day from 40 years ago as easily as yesterday. Not just who he was with and what the weather was like, but his exact thoughts and sensations. Sometimes, as when the experience was unpleasant, these memories can be a source of pain. But replaying such memories also enables Bob to learn from his mistakes and, in the case of a lost loved one, his extraordinary memory allows him to travel back in time. Indeed, Bob makes a point of memorising relationships that are valuable to him, the better to be able to relive them later. According to Thomson, we can learn a lot from people like Bob. She too takes inspiration from Sacks, but not being a neurologist, she cannot bring us diverting tales from the bedside. Instead, Thomson makes a virtue of her limitations by travelling the world in search of “strange brains” in an effort to understand them as a “friend might”. It is, for the most part, a successful strategy and although I did not fully buy her claims to have entered her subjects’ peculiar sensory universes, by the end of her journey she had certainly persuaded me to see the world differently. Take Reuben. Born with red-green colour blindness, Reuben nonetheless claims to be able to “see” vivid auras enveloping people and objects (someone to whom he is sexually attracted flashes red; those he dislikes are yellow, a colour he associates with sourness). The technical term for Reuben’s condition is synaesthesia (crossed senses) and, in case you think he’s faking, his colour blindness and ability to consistently identify coloured auras has been confirmed by rigorous scientific tests. But knowing that does not capture the mysterious nature of Reuben’s colour spectrum or indeed anyone else’s. In short, though we can both objectively agree that such and such an object is red, I cannot be certain that my subjective experience of redness is the same as yours. But we can both agree that we are alive, otherwise how would we be conversing and exchanging notes about redness? Or can we? Graham can happily talk about redness, but insists he is dead. Specifically, Graham is convinced he is brain dead and finds living so pointless he sometimes forgets to eat – after all, if you’re dead what’s the point? Graham can trace his conviction to the day he tried to commit suicide by getting into a bath with a hairdryer after his wife left him. Afterwards, PET scans of his brain showed almost no metabolic activity in the regions governing his ability to rationalise and reflect on his own existence. The result is that even though Graham has been told he is suffering from a rare syndrome known as Cotard’s, no one can convince him he is alive. It’s as if when he zapped himself in the bath he also zapped his sense of self. Of course, as with Donal and his dwarves, Graham’s abnormally low brain activity may be the physical manifestation of an underlying psychopathology. But that doesn’t detract from the realness of his symptoms to him. Maybe one day doctors will find a way to turn Graham’s brain back on but, until then, Thomson argues that his sense of being a member of the “waking dead” deserves to be taken seriously, offering yet another clue to the mysterious wizard behind the curtain. That is a verdict with which O’Sullivan would concur. For all the advances in neurology – from MRI scans and EEG to the mapping of neurons for particular conditions, to new genetic techniques – she points out that cures for conditions such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s, autism and schizophrenia remain tantalisingly out of reach. That is why when it comes to probing the mysteries of our most complex organ there is no substitute for patients’ subjective accounts of their misbehaving brains. Even the names patients use to encapsulate their experience may contain vital clues. “When I record a patient’s seizures in their notes I always include these names,” she writes. “They are more vivid than any medical terminology.” • Brainstorm by Suzanne O’Sullivan is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (£16.99).

But there was also a glint of steel in Stephen Hawking. All the accounts that try to capture the spirit of Hawking’s work tend to gloss over a grittier ingredient that was harder to convey: a relentless drive and unquenchable zest for life that has allowed him to achieve so much despite his huge physical challenges. As his daughter Lucy would often say, he was “enormously stubborn”. I have met him on and off since the late 80s. Not once did I hear him complain or show any signs of self-pity as he explored the furthest reaches of the universe with his mind, or expanded the cosmic horizons of millions with his bestselling books. Diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 1963 at the age of 21, he was told he’d have only two more years to live. Yet his mind managed to travel light years in the wake of that devastating diagnosis, to help turn cosmology from a fringe subject into perhaps the most compelling of all the sciences, in which he provided profound insights into gravity, space and time few have delivered since Einstein. In the wake of what seemed like a death sentence, it was thought that he might not survive long enough even to finish his PhD at Cambridge. What gave him something to live for was Jane Wilde, a languages student, who he had met through mutual college friends at a party the year before his devastating diagnosis. They married in 1965, and he threw himself into his research, turning from a brilliant but lazy student into a workaholic, who first wowed his peers at the end of that decade with his work with Roger Penrose on black holes – then still something of a novelty – along with new arguments that our universe had expanded from a big bang. He was elected to the Royal Society, the world’s oldest scientific academy, in 1974, aged only 32. Martin Rees, the astronomer royal, described how he would sit hunched and motionless for hours over an abstruse book on quantum theory, too weak to turn the pages without help. Rees wondered what was going through his mind. Was it failing too? But as he could no longer write equations, Hawking had developed a remarkable skill to use geometrical and topological images of mathematics in his head to solve problems. He was following through a “Eureka moment” that he’d had in 1970, a few days after the birth of his daughter Lucy, that would lead to his realisation that black holes are not so black. He discovered they would bleed off what is now called “Hawking radiation” and gradually evaporate, “to my great surprise”. At first, he thought he had made a mistake in his calculations. He was eventually persuaded that the formula was correct. It was so simple and elegant that he wanted it on his tombstone. By the end of the 1970s, Hawking had advanced to hold the Lucasian professorship of mathematics at Cambridge, once held by Newton. I first became aware of him while watching the BBC’s Horizon in 1983, which showed how his speech had become hard to decipher and slurred. Soon after, a tracheotomy left Hawking unable to speak at all: he could only communicate by raising his eyebrows or looking to select letters as they were held up on cards. By that time he had a rough draft of a book, which he’d hoped would describe his ideas to a general readership and earn something for his children. When I first met him, in Berkeley, California, in 1988, he was promoting that book, A Brief History of Time. It was a runaway bestseller and one of the most successful pop science books ever. He was given a rock-star reception as he delivered talks at UC Berkeley using the speech synthesiser that has since given him his trademark American accent, selecting words and commands on a computer using a hand-clicker. Certain words were not so easy to understand when he used his early synthetic voice. When he rang me a year or two later to discuss the thrust of an article I had asked him to write, I was too embarrassed to ask him to repeat what he had said after the second attempt, and what felt like a cosmic delay of aeons each time. I commissioned the piece, ignorant of what it was about, confident that it would be brilliant. His hand became ever weaker, and he began operating his voice by twitching a cheek muscle. There were attempts to help him with eye-tracking, “thought reading” via an electrode cap, using facial expressions and improvements to the way he interacted with his computer. But for Hawking, getting a lot of words down required determined effort for hours. Even when I interviewed him in front of an audience a decade ago, it would take him minutes to give prepared answers. The upside was that he specialised in witty one-liners – for instance on the joy of discovery: “I wouldn’t compare it to sex, but it lasts longer.” The downside was that conversation was impossible, events had to be scripted, the words had to be produced as efficiently as possible, sometimes by judicious recycling and sometimes, as Rees puts it, by the promoters of causes about which Hawking may have been ambivalent. His public persona was a long way from the stereotype of an unworldy nerd in a white coat – he was ready to express forceful political opinions, most recently on the NHS. He showed a lifelong commitment to the disabled, for instance by promoting the viral ice bucket challenge (even volunteering his children). But when he talked about subjects where he had no particular expertise, such as the rise of artificial intelligence, he was perhaps taken more seriously than he deserved. Hawking was not publicity-shy. He adored the limelight, from appearances on Star Trek and The Big Bang Theory to The Simpsons (“Your theory of a doughnut-shaped universe is interesting, Homer. I may have to steal it.”) Need someone to run over Brian Cox in a wheelchair for a Monty Python skit? Hawking was your man. He could easily fill major venues, such as the Albert Hall. He once lectured at Bill Clinton’s White House and then, unusually for a foreigner, returned to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama. When I visited him in his office I spotted a letter from Michelle Obama, photographs of Hawking with three popes (Hawking was a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences), and pictures of a visit to Easter Island. There was also Marilyn Monroe (“an old girlfriend of mine”). One sign of his stubborn nature was that, if he was going to be in a wheelchair, he might as well travel as fast as his technology could manage. I remember going to his 60th birthday celebrations in Cambridge: after a trip in a hot-air balloon, he crashed his electric-powered wheelchair while speeding around a corner, breaking his leg. In recent years he made more frequent visits to Papworth hospital near Cambridge. Sometimes he found it so hard to breathe he ended up on a ventilator. When we opened a 70th birthday exhibition in the Science Museum to celebrate his life, he was too ill to come. That year he had to pull out of all his celebrations in Cambridge too but, as ever, his grit saw him through. We were given a day’s notice of a visit the following month. Hawking would pop into the museum to see the exhibit. A personal highlight was encouraging the huge crowd that gathered around him to sing him a long overdue happy birthday. He did not have to use his voice synthesiser – he responded with a huge grin and demanded to be taken on a tour of “one of my favourite places”. He stayed until 5pm. In 2012 he reached perhaps his largest audience – at the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics. The following year he became $3m richer as one of the first winners of the Breakthrough prize to recognise theoretical work, in his case the discovery of Hawking Radiation from black holes – which would have earned him a Nobel prize if experimentally confirmed in his lifetime – and his deep contributions to quantum gravity and quantum aspects of the early universe. And a second person now mastered Hawking’s voice, that paradoxical blend of machine and personality: the actor Eddie Redmayne underwent an extraordinary transformation in The Theory of Everything, a biopic based on Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen by first wife, Jane. Hawking had conquered Hollywood too. Modern science needs more Stephen and Stephanie Hawkings. Today the spotlight is focused more on invisible realms, from the fringes of the cosmos to the strangeness of the subatomic world. To understand the majesty of the cosmos, or the physics of elementary particles, you need mathematics. But in this maths-shy society, the next best thing is to have a person who is determined enough make the quest to find the mathematical underpinnings of the universe funny, romantic and real. That person was Stephen Hawking. Roger Highfield is a former editor of New Scientist and the director of external affairs, Science Museum The world according to Hawking On motor neurone disease My disabilities have not been a significant handicap in my field, which is theoretical physics. Indeed, they have helped me in a way by shielding me from lecturing and administrative work that I would otherwise have been involved in. To Theresa May on Brexit I deal with tough mathematical questions every day, but please don’t ask me to help with Brexit. On aliens Meeting an advanced civilisation could be like Native Americans encountering Columbus. That didn’t turn out so well. On Jeremy Hunt and the NHS Hunt had cherry-picked research to justify his argument. For a scientist, cherry-picking evidence is unacceptable. On Trump He is a demagogue who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator. On death I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/15/rihanna-snapchat-ad-domestic-violence-chris-brown","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T17:45:48Z","webTitle":"Rihanna wipes $1bn off Snapchat after criticising app for making a 'joke' of domestic violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/15/rihanna-snapchat-ad-domestic-violence-chris-brown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/15/rihanna-snapchat-ad-domestic-violence-chris-brown","fields":{"headline":"Rihanna wipes $1bn off Snapchat after criticising app for making a 'joke' of domestic violence","bodyText":"Rihanna wiped almost $1bn (£720m) off the value of Snapchat’s parent company, Snap Inc, after criticising the social media app for hosting an advert that appeared to make light of domestic violence. The advertisement for a mobile game called “Would You Rather” featured photos of Rihanna and Chris Brown, and asked whether players would rather slap her or punch him. Brown was arrested and sentenced to community service after he attacked Rihanna, his girlfriend at the time, in 2009. Following criticism on Twitter, Snapchat pulled the ad, and issued a brief apology stating that the ad violated its “guidelines”. Rihanna responded in a statement issued via a post on Snapchat rival Instagram’s Stories feature: “I’d love to call it ignorance, but I know you ain’t that dumb! You spent money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to DV victims and made a joke of it!!!” the singer posted on Thursday. The singer continued: “This isn’t about my personal feelings, cause I don’t have much of them...but all the women, children and men that have been victims of DV in the past and especially the ones who haven’t made it out yet...you let us down! Shame on you. Throw the whole app-oligy away.” Shares in the company dropped almost 5% overnight, Reuters reports. After Rihanna’s statement, a Snap spokesperson said in an email: “This advertisement is disgusting and never should have appeared on our service. We are so sorry we made the terrible mistake of allowing it through our review process. We are investigating how that happened so that we can make sure it never happens again.” The game behind the ad was also blocked from the platform. Rihanna has previously spoken about being a domestic violence victim, saying in one interview in 2015 that she resented having to continually discuss it: “It’s not a subject to sweep under the rug, so I can’t just dismiss it like it wasn’t anything, or I don’t take it seriously. But, for me, and anyone who’s been a victim of domestic abuse, nobody wants to even remember it … So to talk about it and say it once, much less 200 times, is like … I have to be punished for it?” The ad sparked a backlash on social media, including from Chelsea Clinton, who tweeted: “Awful that any company would approve this.” The scandal comes at a particularly difficult time for Snap, which has faced anger over a controversial redesign – and experienced a $1.3bn drop in market value after the celebrity Kylie Jenner tweeted that she was no longer using the app."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/15/russia-nerve-agents-and-a-quest-for-the-truth","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T16:41:43Z","webTitle":"Russia, nerve agents and a quest for the truth | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/15/russia-nerve-agents-and-a-quest-for-the-truth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/15/russia-nerve-agents-and-a-quest-for-the-truth","fields":{"headline":"Russia, nerve agents and a quest for the truth","bodyText":"It is not Jeremy Corbyn but your editorial that is dispiriting (15 March). Last month, the PM and defence secretary called on Corbyn to release his nonexistent Stasi file. With your recent campaign against fake news, surely a hint of scepticism when it comes to security matters is perfectly in order. There is a prescribed and, by multilateral organisations’ standard, speedy verification process for chemical weapon attacks in the chemical weapons convention. Why not use it and thereby strengthen your hand against any perpetrators? Or would that let the truth get in the way of a good story? Nick Matthews Rugby, Warwickshire • Jeremy Corbyn’s response to Mrs May was totally inadequate. Novichok agents were never standardised and weaponised for military deployment by the Russians. Any stocks probably exist in only one research institute which is one of the most, perhaps even the most, secure place in Russia. The idea that “rogue” elements got hold of the material is a complete fantasy. This action was done by the Russian state on the direct instructions of Putin. There is absolutely no other remotely credible explanation. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) reference is not correct (Report, 15 March). This is attempted murder using a poison which would have a role as a chemical weapon in warfare but the attack in Salisbury is not a use of chemicals in war. The OPCW reference is a complete red herring created by the Russians for which Corbyn has fallen hook, line and sinker. As for sharing samples with the Russians, that is akin to sharing the evidence of a murder with the murderer. Corbyn’s question about the analysis is also confused. The identification of the agent as a novichok agent means that it is adequately characterised. Since the country that invented and developed these agents is Russia, its source is Russia and since an ex-Russian agent is the target, to claim there is any ambiguity is ludicrous. John Cookson Bournemouth, Dorset • I have been a fierce critic of Jeremy Corbyn over his Brexit stance, but I was shocked to see him shouted down by both political parties when he suggested it would have been better if Britain had waited for definitive evidence that Russia is guilty of the poisoning before rushing in with punishments. This view was expressed very well by the infinitely more knowledgable than I – Dr Tara McCormack at the University of Leicester, spoke of a worrying rush to judgment. Surely we are showing our own standards to be false and setting a bad example to the world in disregarding the belief in evidence of guilt before action, which underlies our justice system. This is not about appeasing Putin but keeping the moral high ground, and Theresa May would surely have lost nothing by letting the Russians have the requested sample and attempting to have a stronger case, then putting in her tough measures. Angela Neustatter London • I don’t remember Theresa May “standing up to” her own MP Rory Stewart last October when he advocated summary executions of British people abroad (in Syria). Personally I’m against either UK or Russian – or any – governments doing this kind of thing, and I think real strength of leadership on a global stage involves consistency in opposing all breaches of international law, regardless of source. Archie Lauchlan Hastings, East Sussex • While we are on the subject of state-sponsored attempted murder, what precisely are those 48 fighter jets being sold to Saudi Arabia – in Theresa May’s squalid deal just the other day – intended to be used for (Report, 10 March)? Sightseeing with aerial views? Only asking. David Rosenberg London • It is truly mind-boggling that when Tory MPs cry “shame” at mention of their party’s £820,000 donations from Russian oligarchs and their associates, they mean it is shameful to mention it (Corbyn under fire from own MPs over response to PM’s Russia statement, 15 March). It is deplorable that the BBC and other media should also seize, not on the scandal of the Tory party receiving money from a corrupt plutocracy accused of mounting an attack on UK soil, but on Corbyn’s “misjudgment” in daring to mention it – and in daring to join President Macron in asking for fuller evidence. British democracy and news media are profoundly impoverished if a political scandal that is in plain sight can so readily hide behind irrational and jingoistic groupthink. Peter McKenna Liverpool • If we were discussing the darker pages of British history – slavery, colonial wars and massacres and so forth – any attempt by me to drag in Shakespeare, the Romantic poets and Constable would be regarded as risibly irrelevant. Yet as soon as the subject of Russian (and previously Soviet) misdeeds comes up, one can guarantee that there will be someone like your correspondent (Letters, 14 March) who reaches for the glories of Russian classical culture and the heroism displayed in the last war (after Stalin’s ally, Hitler, invaded in 1941 that is). Pushkin and the Bolshoi really do not have much to do with nerve gas and radioactive polonium. Peter Roland Bognor Regis, West Sussex • In the light of the lack of actual evidence that the Russian state was responsible for the chemical attack, is it just coincidence that £48m is being spent on a new facility at Porton Down (Report, 15 March). The public has been softened up to accept this expenditure, while austerity still bites at our lives, by the ratcheting up of anti-Russian rhetoric. Only President Macron seems concerned with the lack of hard evidence that Putin’s state committed this crime. Jane Ghosh Bristol • Well, personally I’m just glad that we have all these nuclear weapons that deter Russia from attacking our towns and cities. Bryn Jones Bath • Russian state involvement is certainly a possibility, but as yet it is not an established fact. Russophobia lies deep within the Tory DNA, and on that subject Theresa May’s party will believe whatever they wish to believe and not be bothered by such trivial matters as evidence, much as Tony Blair believed in Saddam Hussein’s non-existent WMD. The very short time limit on the government’s ultimatum to Russia, which it knew beforehand would be rejected, suggests it was provocative and deliberately designed to engineer a crisis in Anglo-Russian relations. The motive perhaps is to divert public attention away from the Brexit mess which the Tories have plunged the country into. One dead-end after another.

Lord Erroll, a crossbench peer who chairs the Digital Policy Alliance (DPA) – a thinktank that has collaborated with the government to draft the rules on age verification (AV), admitted the ultimate sanction intended for sites that fail to implement AV is unlikely to be applied to Twitter. Unlike Instagram and Facebook, Twitter has no rules against the posting of sexually explicit material and hosts many accounts that promote publishers and stars of pornography. “The challenge with that is if you block Twitter, people will just say this is an overreaction, it’s mad, and it would not go down well in public,” Erroll said. The other option would be to tell credit card companies to withdraw payment services. However, Erroll admitted that such a penalty was intended for recalcitrant pornography sites, rather than the likes of Twitter and Snapchat. Rudd Apsey, a DPA director, said Twitter had been “a particular challenge”, although it would be included under the AV rules as an “ancillary service provider”. “We as an industry would like to see more verification in that space,” he said. “But at this stage, they haven’t approached us about it.” Twitter said it had tools to limit the visibility of low-quality content. Adult material is classed by the company as “sensitive”. Apsey and Erroll spoke at a showcase of AV services, which will soon become mandatory for all pornographic websites. The requirement had been due to be enforced in April, but the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport announced this week that it would be pushed back to an unspecified date later this year. All the products demonstrated would abide by a new code of practice (PAS 1296), which has been sponsored by the DPA and is due to be published on Monday. Apsey stressed the privacy aspect of the technologies, which would separate identity providers and websites, to prevent either side from building a database of users’ pornography browsing history. The industry faces a battle to gain the trust of consumers. Polling carried out in January by a broadband comparison site found 56% of web users would not trust their details with third-party AV services. Absent from the showcase was AgeID, the AV solution developed by MindGeek, the world’s biggest pornography publisher. Observers expect AgeID will become the market leader once age checks become mandatory, since MindGeek controls several of the most popular porn sites. The regulatory environment surrounding age checks on pornography is still unclear, with the British Board of Film Classification, appointed to regulate the policy, only now consulting on guidance for the industry. There is no requirement for sites to offer multiple means of AV, or strict rules on anonymity beyond those stipulated by the General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into force in May. Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group said the GDPR would provide only general rules unsuited to the particularly sensitive information involved in the age verification of pornographic websites. Among those opposed to the AV requirements have been small-scale pornogtraphy producers. Erika Lust, a Swedish director of feminist-influenced pornography, said the rules as currently drafted would cement the dominance of MindGeek over the industry, whose output mostly consists of pornography “made by men for men”. “This will only get worse as MindGeek continue to infiltrate the market, and smaller, independent sites are forced to close if they cannot afford age verification software,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/mar/17/the-preston-model-event-review-cities-hope-localism","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T15:27:52Z","webTitle":"The Preston model – event review: ‘Cities are looking to us for hope’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/17/the-preston-model-event-review-cities-hope-localism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/mar/17/the-preston-model-event-review-cities-hope-localism","fields":{"headline":"The Preston model – event review: ‘Cities are looking to us for hope’","bodyText":"In 2002, Preston, Lancashire – a vibrant industrial town in the north of England – attained city status and struck out on its own, adopting a form of guerrilla localism. It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, despite major spending cuts nationally, the amount spent locally has gone up. Where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses. It even creates worker-owned cooperatives. After a wealth of positive feedback in response to senior economics commentator Aditya Chakrabortty’s Alternatives series, looking at how we can make the economy work for everyone, and notably his piece on the Preston model, we decided to host a Guardian Live event in the city to meet some of the people making it happen. Having sold out the first venue for The Preston model: how to fix a city, we relocated to the city’s university campus for our panel discussion of the area’s unique approach – and how it might be used to inspire and create stronger, fairer local economies. More than 400 people turned up for the discussion, hosted by Chakrabortty and including the Preston city councillor Matthew Brown; Lisa Nandy, the Labour MP for Wigan; the 2017 Turner prize winner, Lubaina Himid; and Ruth Heritage, the creative director of arts organisation They Eat Culture. With residents increasingly tired of being handed decisions from Whitehall, several hundred miles away, there was a strong focus on how power could continue to be restored to the city’s residents, and spending reinvested into local growth. Many felt ignored by decision-makers and expressed a desire to be listened to more closely when it came to the future of their industries and professions, while others felt the arts should be considered more. Brown noted that he had received between 20 and 30 messages from people in other towns across the country, asking how they could replicate the model for themselves. I spoke to two attendees after the event to get their reactions. Alice Davies, 26, moved to Preston a few years ago from Dudley and said she thought it was the best place to live in the north of England. “I had considered moving to Manchester, but Preston needs younger people to keep its strong identity alive and to fuel the local economy,” she said. “The quality of life here far exceeds that of other areas around the region, and indeed the country, so it’s a no-brainer, really.” She also mentioned the recent £1m lottery grant awarded to the city towards improvement of its central square, noting that dozens of local businesses had come together to help ensure it was spent as effectively as possible. Fellow attendee Simon Thelwall, 66, an honorary Prestonian since moving here in the late 90s, said the event had reinforced his views of an area he has grown to call home. He told me the benefits of Preston’s strong loyalty to localism were visible throughout the city, and listening to its residents speak so passionately about the project had given him hope. “There is a strong sense of community here which you can’t get in many other places. Walking home after the event, the enthusiastic debate continued among attendees – it was a pleasure to see.” He was struck, too, by the audience member who said he had heard the Preston model being mentioned in discussion at the European council in Brussels. “It just proves cities across the world are looking to us for hope and inspiration.” Afterwards, Chakrabortty was fizzing with ideas and enthusiasm following the lively debate. He said the discussion was “absolutely central to what comes next for Britain”. The comment that had most stuck with him was the suggestion, put forward by an audience member, of Preston creating a “toolkit” for other towns wishing to follow suit. “There’s a palpable appetite for something different. There’s been a shift in public mood and people are grasping for alternatives. Those in power must listen. Local authorities as well as residents want to think beyond austerity and approach their economic challenges more constructively.” He was heartened to hear ideas about how the Preston model could be scaled to fit other towns and other aspects of life, noting the comment from Himid, the much-feted Turner prizewinner and proud Prestonian, that the city’s “cooperative-style” economic model could be replicated to harness artistic talent in the area. As the country navigates its exit from the European Union, it may well be that towns become the next battleground in politics – and fresh, innovative ideas that challenge the status quo are exactly what will be needed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/costume-and-culture/2018/mar/13/stephanie-arditti-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T18:10:03Z","webTitle":"Stephanie Arditti obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/costume-and-culture/2018/mar/13/stephanie-arditti-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/costume-and-culture/2018/mar/13/stephanie-arditti-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Stephanie Arditti obituary","bodyText":"The costume supervisor Stephanie Arditti, who has died aged 61 after a long illness, worked on an extraordinary number of shows at the National Theatre and the RSC, and in the West End of London. She was passionate about theatre, was great fun to work with and got a huge amount of satisfaction from collaborating and leading a costume team to realise the designs for a show. Her work was important to her and she was good at it. Two of her shows won Tony awards for best costume design – Mary Stuart in 2009, designed by Anthony Ward, and the exquisite Wolf Hall/Bring Up the Bodies at the RSC, designed by Christopher Oram, in 2015. Wolf Hall also picked up an Olivier award for best costume design. She worked consistently with Oram and Michael Grandage at the Donmar and in 2009 on their shows at Wyndham’s theatre, including the sumptuous Madame de Sade, creating gorgeous late 18th-century dresses for Judi Dench and Rosamund Pike. Stephanie was also a vital part of their team at the Garrick theatre. Her many shows at the RSC included period productions designed by Stephen Brimson Lewis. Two more that won Olivier awards were All’s Well That Ends Well (2004) for the RSC, designed by Deirdre Clancy, and Power (2003) at the National Theatre, designed by Oram. Oram and I were often competing to bag Stephanie for our shows – she was in high demand and at the top of her profession. She worked with me on the epic The White Guard at the National Theatre in 2010, sourcing unworn genuine Russian uniforms and boots and managing the teams of dressers choreographing the multiple quick changes. Stephanie was also a vital part of the original creative team at the National in 2012 and in the West End making The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time – both Olivier award-winning shows. Our most recent show together was The Red Barn (2016) at the National. She realised my designs, creating a beautiful collection of clothes, not only overseeing the pieces made in the workshops but also looking after details – finding the perfect shoes, the right underwear, a pair of earrings, a wristwatch, the right lining for a jacket, the exact length of a hem. Stephanie could interpret a design no matter how rough or abstract the drawing. She would patiently trawl endless shops to find something that would match the designer’s imagination, something affordable and something that would be met with approval – no mean feat. All of this she did with focus and a huge sense of fun. She was equally good at putting together contemporary shows from the high street, researching the minutiae of military insignia, or supervising exquisite 17th-century tailoring and cutting. She was fascinated by historical detail and original pieces of clothing – delighting in how things were cut, a particular print or a choice of button or trim. She loved building up a look in the fitting room with the designer and actors – sourcing pieces from costume stores or markets, often bringing in beautiful items of jewellery she had collected herself. Stephanie was not interested in glory or attention but only in what was right for the character. “The job of a costume supervisor is to realise the costume designer’s design,” she said. “Getting the designs off the paper, from two-dimensional images to three-dimensional images.” Stephanie was born in Streatham, south London, daughter of Herbert Gillies, a civil servant, and his wife, Betty (nee Emsley). She was taken to see shows from a young age, which inspired her love of costume and textiles. From Dorking grammar school she went to Wimbledon School of Art, after which she almost immediately started working at the Royal Opera House and at Sadler’s Wells in their wardrobe departments, learning cutting and making. Soon she was supervising shows, starting at the Redgrave theatre in Farnham and the Yvonne Arnaud theatre in Guildford. Her first job at the National was Not About Heroes in the Cottesloe in 1986. She also began working on productions in the Lyttleton and the Olivier, including many memorable productions: Antony and Cleopatra (1987) with Dench, Alan Bennett’s Single Spies (1988) and Stephen Sondheim’s Sunday in the Park With George (1990), designed by Tom Cairns. She brought to life Mark Thompson’s incredible costume designs for The Wind in the Willows (1990) and worked with Bill Dudley on the mammoth nine-hour trilogy The Coast of Utopia (2002). Anyone who ever worked with Stephanie knows how hilariously funny she was. Her sense of silliness and the ridiculous were always very close to the surface. She was sharp and clever – a brilliant attribute during long days on big, high-pressure shows. She was loyal and proud of her shows and her designers’ achievements. She was quick to praise and to recognise talent in others, often helping, encouraging and training younger supervisors and wardrobe staff. She was a curious mix of nervous insecurity – often endlessly apologising – and absolute certainty and confidence about how things should be and what would work for a character or scene. She moved around a fitting room quickly, walked really fast and was always neat and chic. The thing that made her really sad was the thought that she was having to leave the party early. She reminded me on many occasions how lucky we were to do a job we love, with people we love, in a business which is all about giving people a great night out, often exclaiming, “What larks, Pip!” Latterly she was surrounded by her family and friends who looked after her with immense kindness. She is survived by her daughter, Lucy, from her second marriage, to Paul Arditti, which ended in divorce in 2012, and by her sister, Mel. • Stephanie Arditti, costume supervisor, born 28 February 1956; died 21 February 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/19/bright-coloured-denim-italiana-high-fashion-and-springtime-lingerie","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T10:00:16Z","webTitle":"Bright coloured denim, Italiana high fashion and springtime lingerie…","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/19/bright-coloured-denim-italiana-high-fashion-and-springtime-lingerie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/19/bright-coloured-denim-italiana-high-fashion-and-springtime-lingerie","fields":{"headline":"Bright coloured denim, Italiana high fashion and springtime lingerie…","bodyText":"Bed head Cult Danish label Ganni is teaming up with Bengt Thornefors and Christoffer Svensson from Magniberg, a Swedish bedlinen company, to produce a capsule denim collection in upbeat colours.

Kapoor said the use of footage of his Cloud Gate sculpture in Chicago’s Millenium Park by the NRA “perverts everything that Cloud Gate – and America – stands for”. The ad featuring the offending clip first aired months ago, but Kapoor told the Guardian on Tuesday that the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month pushed him to comment now. “I felt that a public letter, a public declaration was appropriate and perhaps even necessary,” Kapoor said. Known colloquially in Chicago as “the bean”, Cloud Gate is a three-storey high arcing, metallic-mirrored form that has been the visual centerpiece of the park, and a major tourist attraction, since its dedication in 2006. The NRA showed it for a brief, second-long cut in a provocative video released last August titled the Clinched Fist of Truth, which was widely criticised for directing violent language at media outlets like the New York Times, and generally, anyone perceived as a political opponent of the association. “The only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of [media] lies with the clenched fist of truth,” NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said in the minute-long spot. Kapoor said in his statement that the use of the image by the NRA “plays to the basest and most primal impulses of paranoia, conflict and violence, and uses them in an effort to create a schism to justify its most regressive attitudes”. The ad’s use of Cloud Gate, and other public sculptures, seems to be aimed at making public urban spaces – those situated in liberal cities especially – seem ominous and foreboding. Speaking with the Guardian Kapoor said the interpretive questions about why the NRA used his work the way they did are of interest to him, but added bluntly: “it’s also that, as a matter of fact I hold copyright, this is an advertisement, I disagree with what it’s saying, and they did not ask that my permission.” Kapoor’s statement came as he announced that he was not going to pursue legal action against the NRA for the use of Cloud Gate after weighing his legal options, and the financial and emotional cost of a protracted fight against the “extremely aggressive, legalistic” association. “I decided it wasn’t worth the effort, much to my shame, because one does want to defend the ethical integrity of the work,” Kapoor said in the statement. Kapoor is no stranger to controversy regarding his work, nor to using his platform for politics. Last February he was one of more than 200 artists at the vanguard of a global art coalition promising to stage exhibitions and events confronting the rise of rightwing populism. The same month he donated his entire $1m award for the Genesis prize to assist refugees. As is typical after high-profile mass shootings, the NRA has been under increased scrutiny since a gunman killed 17 at a Florida high school earlier this month. The association has attempted to block all attempts by politicians, including conservative ones like Florida Governor Rick Scott, at introducing or enforcing new gun control legislation. Thousands of students across the US will protest for gun control reform on Wednesday by walking out of class."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/13/salisbury-attack-britain-links-russia-moscow","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T18:49:37Z","webTitle":"Despite the Salisbury attack, Britain can’t cut off all links with Russia | Tony Brenton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/salisbury-attack-britain-links-russia-moscow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/salisbury-attack-britain-links-russia-moscow","fields":{"headline":"Despite the Salisbury attack, Britain can’t cut off all links with Russia","bodyText":"The safety of the people is the highest law, said Cicero. He was right. And it is a core duty of the British government to deal effectively with a nerve gas attack on our streets, which has seriously incapacitated three people and endangered many more. Theresa May has risen to the challenge. The authorities have swiftly identified the poison used in the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal as Russian. We have demanded that Russia explain what has happened, or face consequences. It is already clear that we can expect obfuscation. We will then have to deliver the prime minister’s “vigorous” response. I was British ambassador in 2006 when Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in Moscow. The similarities are striking: almost certain Russian guilt, a nasty poison deployed on British streets, Russian refusal to cooperate. We introduced sanctions – diplomatic expulsions and limits on links with the Russian intelligence agencies – intended to deter any recurrence. With hindsight, those sanctions were not enough. We should be tougher this time. Three baskets of measures are on the table. First, the “diplomatic”. The Russian security agencies almost certainly carried out the Salisbury attack. We should build on the Litvinenko measures to make life for them in the UK as difficult as possible. We should freeze our contacts with them and rigorously curtail their travel from Moscow. A significant proportion of those working in the Russian embassy should be expelled (with sad consequences for my innocent diplomatic colleagues and friends in the British embassy in Moscow who will inevitably bear the brunt of Russian retaliation). Second, economic measures. There is far too much crooked money floating around London. This is not only a Russian problem and we have tough new tools (such as “unexplained wealth orders”) to tackle it. These tools should now be energetically deployed. At the same time the government should accept the “Magnitsky clause”, which would impose sanctions on human rights violators. Third, general contacts. Top of the list is this year’s Russia World Cup. I doubt there is a widespread desire for the England football team to withdraw, and in any case the history of sports boycotts is unimpressive. But plainly we will not want to send senior-level UK representatives, and the same will apply to representation at other major events hosted by the Russians. The UK acting alone will not be enough, however. The apparent brazenness of the Skripal attack, using a poison Russia must have known would be linked to it, suggests it is almost deliberately courting UK hostility. We will need allied support to make an impact. Here the Litvinenko precedent is not encouraging. Our allies (particularly the Europeans) said the correct things but were unwilling to risk their links with Moscow in support of what they saw as a UK/Russia row. The politics this time are very different, of course. Russia could not be more mistrusted. And the fact that what happens in Salisbury today could happen in Avignon or Frankfurt tomorrow will have force. But it is still going to take a big effort to turn supportive words (which are coming in abundance) into real action. Meanwhile, the US, with its deep domestic divisions on Russia policy (as illustrated by Rex Tillerson’s departure as secretary of state today), is almost certainly out of the game. So there is much to be done to assemble measures to deter any future Skripal-type attack. All our energies for now need to go into that. But we must not forget the longer term. When the heat eventually dies down, Russia will still be a major nuclear power crucial to tackling the full spectrum of international problems such as Syria, Iran, arms control, Islamist terrorism and cybersecurity. A big blunder following Russia’s 2014 intervention in Ukraine was to try to isolate Russia. It didn’t work. Key countries (China, India) never participated, and those that did quickly found themselves eating their words as the costs and dangers of being out of touch with Russia became apparent. The UK has been slow to acknowledge this lesson, but it would be a mistake, for example, to withdraw our ambassador from Moscow and cut off other key official links, further narrowing what is already a perilously thin line of communication. More broadly, relations between Russia and the west are now at their most dangerous level for decades. Both Russia and the US are rebuilding their nuclear arsenals, and links between our militaries are almost non-existent even as our planes circle each other over Syria and Iraq. We owe it to the next generation to spare them the shadow of nuclear war that hung over us. As the vastly stronger side in the confrontation, the west must act first. We should be looking for potential areas of cooperation with Russia which could begin to rebuild the shattered relationship. Terrorism and perhaps the governing of cyberspace are good places to start. Who knows where attempts at a thaw may lead? A Russia with a set of fruitful and constructive links with the west is far less likely to be tempted into Litvinenko- or Skripal-type outrages that would inevitably damage those links. Finally, once we have responded forcefully and legitimately to the Salisbury provocation, “the safety of the people” would be better guaranteed through cooperation than confrontation. • Tony Brenton was British ambassador to Russia from 2004 to 2008"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/mar/16/home-supports-women-with-severe-mental-health-issues","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T09:15:54Z","webTitle":"'A stepping stone to moving on': home supports women with severe mental health issues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/16/home-supports-women-with-severe-mental-health-issues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/16/home-supports-women-with-severe-mental-health-issues","fields":{"headline":"'A stepping stone to moving on': home supports women with severe mental health issues","bodyText":"Being able to do her own washing and having responsibility for her personal possessions symbolised the freedom Michelle Stevens* wanted but was denied in institutional care. Stevens’ severe mental health problems meant she was in and out of residential care and mental health wards for a decade. She recalls staff shouting at her and living circumstances that were “very closed up and not nice at all”. Today, however, Stevens says she is “much happier and freer”. She has a bedroom in a large double-fronted Victorian house – and she loves the garden at her supported living home in West Norwood, south London, which is run by social care provider Certitude. “[It] is cleaner than other places I have been, and has nicer facilities,” says Stevens. She enjoys socialising – with the 11 other residents and locally – and for the first time in three years, she does her own washing and is trusted with her belongings. The women-only housing is designed for those with enduring and complex mental health issues who may be stuck in restrictive environments. Certitude provides support while First Priority, a housing association, manages the tenancy agreements. The home opened in September 2016 and residents, who are mostly in their 30s and 40s, benefit from individualised support that is rarely offered in residential or inpatient care. The therapeutic approach involves a focus on fitness – reflecting growing awareness of the link between physical and mental health – and enabling women to connect with the community. Liz Durrant, Certitude’s director of mental health, says the home bridges the gap between where the women have come from, and where they need to be. “The aim is to provide a stepping stone to moving on and living more independently.” The aspiration, she adds, is that “they feel like valued members of society”. The project reflects the need for more community-based mental health support. Nationally, there have long been worries about the lack of local and more independent housing support for people with mental health issues. The Care Quality Commission recently said that a lack of mental health services means more patients are having to be sectioned to get help. Early results at the home, which supports women for up to five years, are promising. Of the 12 women, one has moved into her own flat and two have gone into longer term supported living. Eight residents have started voluntary work and vocational courses since moving in, and one is studying food hygiene and health and safety. The women suggest the home “gives you more freedom and is less restricting”, and that it offers “security and independence”. The scheme is part of the Integrated Personalised Support Alliance (IPSA), an approach in the London borough of Lambeth that aims to reduce long-term mental health inpatient provision. The IPSA has saved almost £2.5m since 2015 [pdf] through cutting down on residential or inpatient provision. The partners – Certitude, Thames Reach, the South London and Maudsley NHS foundation trust, Lambeth clinical commissioning group and Lambeth council – operate under a single contract and performance framework, ensuring that everyone works to the same end: people’s recovery, not organisations’ targets. Durrant says the collaboration is key to the home’s success and helps unite local mental health organisations. The process begins with the alliance identifying a woman in long-term care who might benefit from the new approach. After a fresh needs assessment and asking if she would like to move, staff start visiting the prospective resident. When she is ready, she stays for a night or two; moving in is gradual, tailor-made to each individual. Staff agree a plan of support with each woman to help her feel comfortable and safe – and to get to know staff and the surroundings. An occupational therapist visits two days a week and while all the women have access to NHS mental health services, the aim at the home is to ease social isolation, and support people to get out locally and see friends and family. Rebuilding relationships is crucial. Several of the women say they were too ashamed of their previous surroundings to encourage visitors. For someone who has not been out alone for years, the goal of the plan might be regular shopping trips. One resident is aiming to pass her maths GCSE, another wants to get fit. Facilities and furnishings at the property are of a high standard, the large bedrooms are all ensuite, and communal spaces include shared kitchens and a large garden. Stevens says that “more places like [the home] need to exist”; thanks to this kind of support, she says, “there’s a good road ahead”. * Name has been changed Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

With several of the UK’s biggest tour operators selling holidays for 2019, Which? said customers should be told of the possibility of flight disruption, and what compensation could be paid. No legal framework yet exists to manage flights to Europe once Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, and Ryanair and Lufthansa have cautioned that planes could be temporarily grounded without an aviation deal. Unless a transition deal for aviation is signed, from September 2018 Ryanair will include the warning on its tickets: “This flight is subject to the regulatory environment allowing the flight to take place.” Which? called on the government to clarify consumer rights and strike an aviation deal as soon as possible. It advised anyone booking a holiday after March 2019 to check cancellation and refund policies – particularly for any elements such as car hire or villa rental booked outside of a package. The consumer group said that it asked the UK’s five biggest travel companies, which take 13 million holidaymakers abroad each year, how they were keeping customers informed. It said Tui, Jet2 and On the Beach “failed to provide any reassurance that any information would be communicated upfront”, while Thomas Cook had amended its terms and conditions to class any airspace closure with natural disasters, stating it would not provide compensation or reimburse expenses. Expedia told Which? it believed passengers would be entitled to compensation from airlines, though it is not yet selling post-Brexit holidays. Peter Vicary-Smith, the chief executive of Which?, said: “This uncertainty for holidaymakers is just one of the many issues affecting people’s everyday lives that need to be resolved as we move closer to the date that the UK leaves the EU.” About 75% of the 70m foreign trips made by UK residents each year go to the other 27 EU member states. A spokeswoman for the travel trade organisation Abta said: “Package holidays will continue to be covered by regulations which give holidaymakers the right to an alternative holiday, if available, or a refund in the event of changes caused by extraordinary circumstances.” Huw Evans, the director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: “It’s critical people planning trips abroad after Brexit are given urgent clarity about what happens in the event of ‘no deal’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/13/rex-tillerson-fired-hapless-hopeless-tragic","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T16:14:56Z","webTitle":"Rex Tillerson: hapless, hopeless and tragic.

Now his time is up","bodyText":"Rex Tillerson was a part-time truth-teller. In one national security meeting, he had the piercing insight and honesty to call Donald Trump “a moron” – possibly an Anglo-Saxon kind of moron. Yet, like his boss, he lacked the self-awareness to know that the same critique applied to himself, as the moron’s secretary-of-state. There were clues along the way, many of them spotted by the man he so openly disdained. It was the moron-in-chief who challenged the moron-of-state to an open contest of intellectual power. “I think it’s fake news,” Trump told Forbes magazine, dismissing the moronic comments. “But if he did [say] that, I guess we’ll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.” Genius. At some point, you just have to surrender to this kind of brainpower. But Tillerson did not have the smarts to take his analytical powers all the way to their conclusion, by building a formidable citadel of diplomacy at the state department. Instead of counter-balancing the moronic foreign policy coming out of the White House, he dismantled his own staff and budget at his headquarters in Foggy Bottom. At the same time, he was forced to endure a constant stream of childish taunts from his boss, who used his Twitter thumbs to tell him – and the rest of the world – that his outreach to North Korea was totally useless. “I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful secretary of state, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,” his wonderful boss tweeted in October. “Being nice to Rocket Man hasn’t worked in 25 years, why would it work now? Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won’t fail.” Why ever would it work now? That’s a great question Tillerson should ask Trump if he gets an exit interview. Or maybe that was the cause of the exit interview. That teensy difference of opinion – now rendered moot by Trump’s decision to sit down with Kim Jong-un – led to some more truth-telling about Tillerson and Trump, this time from Bob Corker, the Republican senator who chairs the foreign relations committee. “You cannot publicly castrate your own secretary of state,” Corker told the Washington Post, without undermining your own diplomacy. That naturally led Tillerson to protest that he was fully intact, in terms of his own testicles. Looking back on his career as the nation’s chief diplomat, Tillerson might pinpoint this as the foggiest of bottoms. Tillerson cannot simply blame his obviously inept manager for this misery because he clearly castrated himself. In two successive budgets, he presided over the systematic dismantling of the diplomatic machinery he was supposed to be operating. In year one, he agreed to an astonishing 31% cut to his own budget, followed by a 29% cut the following year. The proposed budgets would have decimated his own staff and operations, as well as international aid, and were mostly ignored by Congress last year. Tillerson didn’t much mind the cuts. In fact he rationalized them by saying he wouldn’t need so much money because he was well on his way to solving the world’s problems. “Part of this bringing the budget numbers back down is reflective of an expectation that we’re going to have success in some of these conflict areas, getting these conflicts resolved and moving to a different place in terms of the kind of support we have to give,” he told a foreign policy crowd late last year. If that doesn’t qualify you for moronic status, it’s not clear what will. Tillerson arrived in his job with all the executive skills you might expect after a very long and triumphant career at the top of one of the biggest corporations in the world: ExxonMobil, where he was CEO for a decade. Sadly all those executive skills did not include the ability to retain or build a senior staff at the state department, where the exodus of experience and talent has been a diplomatic blowout. He refused briefings from senior staff and refused to talk to the press. He hollowed out the senior ranks with no rhyme or reason, leaving critical posts unfilled, while others simply quit or retired. Among them was the leading foreign service official on North Korea, who retired just two weeks ago. Tillerson’s tenure was so bad, it prompted some rare bipartisan agreement. “America’s diplomatic power is being weakened internally as complex global crises are growing externally,” warned John McCain and Jeanne Shaheen, the Republican and Democratic senators, in a letter to Tillerson late last year. And yet even the hapless and hopeless Tillerson could sometimes tell the truth to his even more hapless and hopeless boss. He disagreed on the Iran nuclear deal, which is at least consistent with talking to the North Koreans. He even disagreed on Russia, a little: saying the nerve agent attack in the UK was “clearly” the work of Russia on Monday, even as the White House refused to say Moscow was involved. Just last week Tillerson admitted that the Russians would meddle with this year’s midterm elections, although he somehow couldn’t find a way to spend any money to stop that interference. His successor, Mike Pompeo, was more forceful in recently condemning Russian interference, but as CIA director, it isn’t exactly obvious what he has done to stop it. Where did Tillerson’s confidence and tenacity come from, if it wasn’t his competence in the job? Perhaps his partial truth-telling was the result of his overwhelming financial security. It’s a bit easier to stand up to your boss when you get a $180m retirement package before joining the administration. So farewell then, Rex. There have been only a handful of notable Rexes in our time. There was the exceptional Rex Harrison, the actor who spoke his way through so many great musicals. There were a couple of Rex Hunts, one a former Falklands governor, another a former Australian football player. Tillerson: you are only middling on this short list. You have been tragic, but you are no Oedipus, Rex.

The US president – notorious for making false claims on countless issues – admitted he told Trudeau that America has a trade deficit with its neighbour when he “had no idea” if that was true. The office of the US trade representative states that the American goods and services trade surplus with Canada was $12.5bn in 2016. According to the recording, Trump told guests at a fundraising dinner in Missouri: “Trudeau came to see me. He’s a good guy, Justin. He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please.’ “Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in – ‘Donald we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed … So he’s proud. I said, ‘Wrong Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know … I had no idea. “I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid … And I thought they were smart.” Trump went on: “I said, ‘You’re wrong Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’ I said, ‘Well, in that case I feel differently,’ I said, ‘but I don’t believe it.’ I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, ‘Check because I can’t believe it.’ ‘Well, sir, you’re actually right. We have no deficit but that doesn’t include energy and timber … And when you do, we lose $17bn a year.’ It’s incredible.” The Office of the United States Trade Representative has said the US has a trade surplus with Canada, the Post reported. Trump and Trudeau, 25 years apart in age and polar opposites in temperament, have projected warm relations so far. Last year, in honour of Canada Day, the president used Twitter to praise his “new found friend” north of the border. Trump defied critics in his own Republican party last week to announce stiff import taxes on steel and aluminium, risking a trade war with China and the European Union. His top economic adviser Gary Cohn quit over the tariffs, while secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who also disagreed with them, was fired earlier this week. On Wednesday, the Post report says, the president again lambasted the EU, China, Japan and South Korea, which he claimed were taking advantage of America. He also described the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) as a disaster and appeared to threaten to pull US troops out of South Korea if the country does not come up with a satisfactory trade deal. “We have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,” Trump was quoted as telling donors. “We lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers between North and South Korea. Let’s see what happens.” He added: “Our allies care about themselves. They don’t care about us.” After visiting a Boeing factory in St Louis earlier in the day, Trump was headlining a fundraiser for Republican US Senate candidate Josh Hawley, who is running for the seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill. But as is his wont, the president boasted about his 2016 presidential election victory, derided cable news anchors and mocked his predecessors, George W Bush and Barack Obama, for failing to achieve what he has done by setting up a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. “It’s called appeasement: please don’t do anything,” he reportedly said. Trump made 2,140 false or misleading claims in his first year as president, according to a Washington Post count."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/mar/16/have-we-really-found-amelia-earhart-bones","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T10:34:24Z","webTitle":"Have we really found Amelia Earhart's bones?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/16/have-we-really-found-amelia-earhart-bones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/mar/16/have-we-really-found-amelia-earhart-bones","fields":{"headline":"Have we really found Amelia Earhart's bones?","bodyText":"From the headlines last week, you would think that the Amelia Earhart mystery has finally been solved. A new study published in Forensic Anthropology by Richard Jantz claims that a set of human remains found on Nikumaroro Island are likely the bones of the pioneering aviator. If true, this is an exciting development. As the identification of the remains of Richard III illustrated, solving important historical mysteries is extremely satisfying. But unlike the case of Richard III, not all biological anthropologists are convinced by the evidence identifying this mystery skeleton as Earhart. Earhart, along with her navigator Fred Noonan, disappeared in 1937 in the midst of their famous attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Despite extensive searches, their plane was never recovered. Of the many theories that exist to explain what happened to them, one of the most persistent is the idea that they ended up stranded, and eventually died, on an uninhabited atoll. Skeletal remains discovered on the island in 1940 along with part of a shoe, a Benedictine bottle, and a sextant box are held up as evidence that she was there. An examination and measurement of the thirteen bones was conducted by Dr. D. W. Hoodless of the Central Medical School in Fiji in 1940, who estimated the stature of the individual to have been 165.1cm (5ft 5.5in), male, and between 45-55 years old. He concluded that they represented the remains of a “short, stocky European (male) or even a half-caste”. And then the bones and artifacts vanished. Despite attempts by The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) to find them, they remain missing. Hoodless’ notes and measurements are all that remain. This disappearance has made straightforward approaches to solving the identification mystery (such as DNA analysis) impossible. But it hasn’t stopped research on them from continuing. In 1998, Hoodless’ conclusions were critiqued by Burns et al. (1998) in a report for TIGHAR, who questioned his expertise and analytical approaches. Using different methods than Hoodless, they re-estimated the stature of the deceased individual to be between 5ft 5in and 5ft 9in, the sex as female instead of male, and the ancestry as “white” rather than Polynesian or “other Pacific Islander”. A subsequent study in the Journal of Archaeological Science critiques that critique, arguing that Hoodless was fully competent to evaluate the remains, that his methods were appropriate, and that his conclusion that the bones belonged to a “robust, middle-aged man” were reasonable. This most recent paper by Jantz critiques the critique of the critique, but also presents new analyses of the bones, comparing Hoodless’ measurements and descriptions to bone lengths, weight, and robusticity inferred from photographs of Earhart and from measurements of her clothing. This approach is inventive, but is it reliable? The author admits that he had to make some assumptions, such as whether her trousers were level with certain osteological landmarks on her bones, and inferring weight from photographs seems to me rather imprecise. Nevertheless, he is highly confident in his results, as they relied upon much more rigorous forensic analytical methods than were possible in the early 20th century. He concludes his paper by stating “Until definitive evidence is presented that the remains are not those of Amelia Earhart, the most convincing argument is that they are hers.” But are they? The question of whether or not these bones belonged to Earhart hinges on their biological profile, which includes factors such as age, stature, sex, and ancestry. If the profile doesn’t match Earhart, the bones aren’t hers. If it does, they might be. Aspects of a biological profile can be estimated with varying degrees of accuracy from certain skeletal elements, and a great deal of research has been done in forensic anthropology to improve the accuracy of these estimation methods (for obvious reasons). However, inferring these things from skeletons are not as straightforward as you might think. I’m not a specialist in forensic anthropology, so I reached out to my colleague Dr. Kristina Killgrove for her take. She responded Solving the mystery of Earhart’s disappearance would be a fantastic bit of forensic archaeology -- if it were possible. I think that people are fascinated with her disappearance, as Earhart was a fascinating woman, and who doesn’t love a mystery? But I remain skeptical of the whole endeavor. The new statistical analysis is based on 7 measurements taken in 1941 by Dr. Hoodless. In his new article and in past publications, Dr. Jantz tries to discredit Hoodless’s visual assessment of the bones as male, yet apparently has no problem accepting Hoodless’s measurements without question. In order to buy into Jantz’s new publication, we have to assume that Hoodless in 1941 took accurate, precise measurements of these bones the way a forensic anthropologist would do today and to assume that we can fairly compare those measurements to estimates of bone length from photographs and clothing of Earhart’s. As the search for the missing bones has been ongoing for more than two decades at this point, I don’t think the likelihood of anyone ever finding them is high. Unlike the case of Richard III, the fact that the remains are not available for examination today stands in the way of a ironclad identification of them as Earhart’s. This brings up the next question: what about other sources of DNA? There have been discussions of attempting to verify that certain artifacts and a finger bone recovered from an excavation at Nikumaroro were hers by swabbing them for DNA and comparing it to living relatives or to DNA from envelopes she likely licked. However, I haven’t heard of any progress on that front in recent years. I’d have a few reservations about a positive ID claimed from that approach, but that’s the subject for a completely different blog post. Like Fox Mulder, I want to believe. But until more evidence surfaces, I remain skeptical."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/14/uk-spy-poisoning-russia-tells-un-it-did-not-make-nerve-agent-used-in-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T01:58:25Z","webTitle":"Spy poisoning: allies back UK and blast Russia at UN security council","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/uk-spy-poisoning-russia-tells-un-it-did-not-make-nerve-agent-used-in-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/14/uk-spy-poisoning-russia-tells-un-it-did-not-make-nerve-agent-used-in-attack","fields":{"headline":"Spy poisoning: allies back UK and blast Russia at UN security council","bodyText":"Russia has claimed at the UN security council that it never made or even researched novichok nerve agents, which the UK says were used in the Salisbury attack on a former Russia spy and his daughter. However, the UK received overwhelming support from its allies on the council, including the US, amid heated debate on Wednesday night. Washington’s envoy, Nikki Haley, delivered the most unambiguous statement of support from the Trump administration so far. In her statement on behalf of the US, Haley said: “Let me make one thing clear from the very beginning: the United States stands in absolute solidarity with Great Britain. The United States believes that Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent.” Presenting the UK case to the UN security council on Wednesday, Britain’s deputy permanent representative, Jonathan Allen, said Russia was “in serious breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention through its failure to declare the novichok programme”. “This fact alone means you should discount any arguments you hear about the possibility of other countries having inherited this technology,” he said. “This was no common crime. It was an unlawful use of force, a violation of ... the United Nations charter, the basis of the international legal order,” Allen said. Amid heated debate, the Russian envoy, Vissaly Nebenzia, rejected UK accusations of responsibility and suggested that the British government might have carried out the attack itself in an effort to “tarnish” Russia ahead of the football World Cup this summer. “No scientific research or development under the title novichok were carried out,” he said. He alleged the Salisbury attack was a false-flag attack, possibly by the UK itself, intended to harm Russia’s reputation. “Most probable source of this agent are the countries who have carried out research on these weapons, including Britain,” Nebenzia said. But Haley, the US ambassador, said: “This is a defining moment. Time and time again, member states say they oppose the use of chemical weapons under any circumstance. Now, one member stands accused of using chemical weapons on the sovereign soil of another member. The credibility of this council will not survive if we fail to hold Russia accountable.” The Russian ambassador sought to turn the tables on the UK, claiming that Theresa May’s letter to the UN, outlining UK grounds for accusing Russia, was itself a “threat to a sovereign state”. “The letter contains completely irresponsible statements which are even difficult for me to comment on using diplomatic vocabulary,” the Russian envoy said. He later told reporters that the case belonged at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague. “We are ready to cooperate,” he said. Allen pointed out that the UK had already called in the OPCW to take part in the investigation. He described extensive evidence that novichok nerve agents had been developed by the Soviet Union and bequeathed to Russia. The French ambassador, François Delattre, made a similar declaration backing the UK position, offering “the full support and complete solidarity of France for the UK”. “We have reached a new stage: the use of a substance never declared to the OPCW used in a public area in the territory of a European country,” DeLattre said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/mar/15/the-breakdown-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T11:49:00Z","webTitle":"The stats don’t lie – the breakdown has cost England the Six Nations | Paul Rees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/15/the-breakdown-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/mar/15/the-breakdown-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"The stats don’t lie – the breakdown has cost England the Six Nations","bodyText":"One statistic highlights why Ireland have taken over from England as the Six Nations champions and explains why Eddie Jones invited the South African referee Marius van der Westhuizen to training this week before the match against their successors on Saturday. No team have created more rucks in this year’s Six Nations than Ireland but no side has conceded fewer penalties at the breakdown. By contrast, England have given away more than anyone and account for nearly one quarter of the total penalties awarded in the tackle area this year compared to 16 % in 2017. With one round to go England have conceded almost double the number of penalties at the breakdown as they did in five matches last year, 30 compared to 16. It may not bode well that the referee on Saturday, Australia’s Angus Gardner, spoke to Dylan Hartley 20 minutes into the 2017 opener against France at Twickenham to recommend that the captain remind his players about the laws after Tom Wood twice went off his feet. England are not the only team to have been penalised more at the breakdown this year, but only Italy have been blown proportionately more. Unless there is an amnesty in the final weekend every one of the six teams will see an increase in their penalty count from 2017: England, Scotland, Italy and Ireland have already passed last year’s total while France and Wales have equalled their tally. The 28% increase in the number of penalties conceded at the breakdown is largely explained by more being awarded against the attacking team as the emphasis turns from continuity to generating a contest for possession, with turnover ball providing the best means for attack. It was only last year that the Wales and Lions’ captain, Sam Warburton, reflected on how much harder it was to secure turnovers after a tackle because of the emphasis referees were placing on defenders not placing their arms beyond the ball. England were penalised only once in the 2017 Six Nations for not releasing after a tackle. They exceeded that number in the first half in Paris last weekend and a reason they invited Van der Westhuizen to training rather than an English referee is that the way the breakdown is being controlled at Test level is out of kilter with the Premiership. This is not the case in the Pro 14, where the entertainment factor is strong as it looks to grow commercially, or the Top 14. “Referees in the Premiership lean to the attack so much that it is a waste of time competing in the first 10 minutes,” said one former English club coach this week. “When did you see the first breakdown penalty in a league game go to the defence? It’s a reason why you do not get genuine open-side flankers in England. Rugby union is all about contesting for the ball, or it should be.” England’s problems at the breakdown were exposed by Samoa in November at Twickenham. They were turned over 20 times during a comfortable victory that afternoon: the ball-carrier was often isolated and the home side found themselves regularly outnumbered as they focused on what to do with the ball in the next phase of play rather than secure it. That trend has continued in the Six Nations. The sight of the France centre Mathieu Bastareaud making a tackle should have acted as a red flag in Paris but three minutes into the second half, after players had digested advice from their coaches, he tackled Mako Vunipola in the home 22, quickly got back on to his feet, forced the prop to hold on and won a penalty. No one arrived to clear out Bastareaud. Contrast that with Ireland at home to Wales in the previous round when they took the ball into 141 rucks and failed to secure it only once. Every time Josh Navidi, who had forced turnovers from Scotland, got over the ball he was smashed out of the way by a support player before the carrier could be done for holding on. “You could argue that English rugby can take this as an opportunity to learn,” said the Bath director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, a former New Zealand flanker who coached Richie McCaw, “and a lot of good may come out of it for the game here. One of Richie’s great qualities was that he adjusted and adapted to the way the breakdown was refereed so that changes in the law made no difference to his effectiveness. “There is no question that teams are targeting England at the breakdown. Ireland are successful because their clearers do a really good job and allow them to win quick ball. Giving penalties away kills you, but there are certainly top-quality open-side flankers in England. Things just need to be thought about in a different way.” One of Eddie Jones’s problems is that arguably the best wing-forward turnover specialists in the Premiership are not English, Bath’s Francois Louw and Wasps’ Thomas Young, but that is not an issue on defence rather than when England take the ball into contact. Dan Cole and Joe Launchbury used to be effective in the clear-out but serious neck injuries have reduced their impact. Jones said it was not his job to try to influence the way the breakdown is refereed in the Premiership. He has throughout his time in England had a policy of non-interference with the clubs, exerting his control only when it is his time to have the players.But is it coincidence that the struggle in the Six Nations followed a low-key European Champions Cup group stage by Premiership clubs? Exeter are the Premiership masters at taking the ball into contact and recycling it, keeping hold of possession in the manner of Ireland. It was a reason Don Armand was called into the squad this week, but Exeter were outplayed at the breakdown in both matches against Leinster in December. The Irish province created 164 rucks at Sandy Park and got the ball back every time. That is what England will be up against on Saturday when it will not just be a matter of slowing down or filching Ireland’s ball but getting the clear-out right and securing their own ball to put their backs on the front foot. • This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

They had reason to curse profligacy, and the absence of a ruthless streak which saw the Premier League team strike the woodwork four times over the two legs but succeed in scoring only once. They could always point, too, to Lionel Messi’s brilliance. Antonio Conte described the tie’s decisive performer as “not a top player, but a super, super, super top player”, the kind who crops up once or twice a century. He was the difference. Yet, over that short flight back to London, a grimmer reality will surely have set in. Chelsea, a team who have failed to build domestically on a title success for the second time in three seasons, had actually endured a painful reminder of just how far they have slipped down the pecking order in a European context. They have won only two games in the knockout stage of this competition – against Galatasaray and Paris Saint‑Germain – since hoisting the trophy in 2012 and Barça, in truth, had not needed all in their number to be at their best to jettison the English club from the last 16. Luis Suárez had barely stirred in either game, his contribution as peripheral as it was forgettable. Andrés Iniesta, hamstrung of late, was only semi‑fit at the Camp Nou. The defensive vulnerability which might cost the Catalan club in the quarter‑finals and beyond went relatively unpunished. Messi’s flashes of quality alone were enough to set Ernesto Valverde’s team apart and that, in itself, will nag among those in the London club’s hierarchy. Where does this leave Chelsea? And what are their true ambitions at this level? A club crammed with talented young players, and others who should be coming into their prime in the first team, have choices to make in the months ahead if they want to be challenging more persuasively among the continent’s elite in the years to come. There are issues eating away disconcertingly at the setup: Eden Hazard has yet to agree a new long‑term contract; Thibaut Courtois, beaten by Messi twice through his legs much to his own exasperation, will be entering the final year of his deal at the club in the summer. The same applies for three of the older guard – David Luiz, Cesc Fàbregas and Pedro – with the potential for yet another overhaul very clear. Previous revamps, and there were eight significant additions in the past two windows, do not appear to have raised overall standards at senior level. Yet would Roman Abramovich, an owner with designs to redevelop Stamford Bridge at vast expense, be willing to spend even more lavishly in order to restore Chelsea to the pinnacle, not least in a division warped yet further by Manchester City’s bottomless pockets? Recent history, as Conte has pointed out in public too often for comfort over the course of this campaign, suggests this club’s policy has changed and is unlikely to shift dramatically again. To that end, their elimination at the Camp Nou should really have surprised few. Conte had warned in the build-up that his charges lacked the kind of streetwise experience, the type built up over regular excursions into the latter stages of elite competition, to blunt and beat Barcelona. They were not really capable of emulating Juventus, for example, who had mercilessly exploited the three minutes of indecision and weakness offered up by Tottenham Hotspur in last week’s return leg at Wembley. The Italians, like Barça, had taken their opportunities ruthlessly to secure their passage into the last eight. Chelsea created half-chances aplenty on Wednesday night, running riot at times down either flank, but mustered a solitary shot on target from inside the penalty area all night. Admittedly, Gerard Piqué might have conceded a penalty, and those attempts against the woodwork – from Alonso and Antonio Rüdiger – were only inches away from yielding reward. But Messi, when presented with similar opportunities, made them pay. All four of the Catalans’ goals over the two legs stemmed from unnecessary errors, whether offered up by Andreas Christiansen or César Azpilicueta, Courtois or Fàbregas. Against this calibre of opposition, such generosity was always likely to be accepted. Chelsea, of course, have to requalify for the Champions League before they can prove they deserve to be considered contenders to win it once again. Conte is unlikely even to be on the payroll when this situation comes to a head in the summer. But, having offered glimpses of quality over the two legs, this elimination will have hurt those in charge. This club has difficult choices to make as to what should happen next."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/15/dont-need-pennies-government-u-turn-coppers","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T10:57:57Z","webTitle":"When will the penny drop?

So, too, is the high-stakes Christmas card game where we would bet with piles of 1p coins taken from my father’s Bell’s whisky bottle. And of course we should never have stuffed ourselves silly with 1p pink shrimp and 2p spongy banana sweets made from nothing known to nature. The idea that 1p and 2p coins could go the way of the farthing prompted an orgy of nostalgia – and a swift government U-turn. Maybe some people have never recovered from the withdrawal of the half-pence coin in December 1984. The entire shove ha’penny industry must have collapsed overnight. The serious point about ditching the 1p and 2p, though, is inflation. A pint of semi-skimmed milk is 49p in Aldi and Lidl. A pack of six tomatoes in Tesco is 69p. Heinz baked beans are 74p in Iceland. Waitrose’s own-brand basic wine range is entirely priced at £4.99. Supermarkets, surely, would seize on the opportunity to round up prices? So said the Daily Mail, raging that the change should set alarm bells jangling. Those who “count every penny will not thank you when traders round up those 99p prices. Is this a PR disaster in the making?” it asked. Downing Street took note and swiftly backtracked. May’s response to the coin crisis lacked mettle. What shoppers don’t thank you for is a pile of shrapnel in change. Supermarkets realise this and have mostly abandoned 99p pricing (the examples above were hard to find). Indeed, Marks &amp; Spencer abolished the 99p price point years ago. Today’s kids don’t go into Primark or Tiger with piles of 1p and 2p coins. Everything in those stores is already rounded. Our nearest neighbour, Ireland, has abandoned the 1c piece without any of the blue-passport-style rage here. Prices in Irish supermarkets may still be stickered on the shelves in individual cents, such as 49c or 99c, but at the tills, the final bill is rounded up or down. Take the items above. Add up the 49p milk, 69p tomatoes and 74p baked beans, and you get £1.92. If we moved to a system such as Ireland’s, we would round prices to the nearest 5p. In this example, the supermarket would charge £1.90. So rather than being inflationary, shoppers would save 2p. The majority of Irish households now regard 1c, 2c and even 5c pieces as a nuisance. So should we. Let’s give the Royal Mint’s presses – still knocking out 500m of the pieces a year – a rest. Ah, but what about piggy banks? Charity donation boxes? Church collections? The homeless? If all you are giving is 1p or 2p coins, shame on you.

Heimbach, whose Traditionalist Worker party group’s slogan is “Fighting for faith, family and folk”, was released from a county jail in Indiana on a $1,000 bond on Tuesday. He had been arrested after a fracas where, according to a police report obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), he attacked his wife and also choked into unconsciousness his group’s co-founder – who happens also to be the husband of Heimbach’s mistress. The incident occurred just days after images appeared of Heimbach, teeth gritted, grappling with an anti-Nazi protester on the campus of Michigan State University, where chaos ensued over an appearance by the white nationalist leader Richard Spencer. And after Heimbach’s arrest in the early hours of Tuesday, the Traditionalist Workers party (TWP) spokesman and co-founder, Matt Parrott, whom Heimbach is accused of choking, told the SPLC he was leaving the group, and pulled the TWP website. The incident followed a series of developments among the self-styled “alt-right” in the US, a euphemism for a new breed of white supremacists who shocked the world when a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer, featured Nazi-style salutes and chanting and turned extremely violent, leading to the death of an anti-racism activist, Heather Heyer. Spencer announced on Monday that he may suspend his current speaking tour around US colleges because fierce protests were dangerous and the rallies “aren’t fun” any more. Earlier in March Spencer’s lawyer, Kyle Bristow, said he was quitting the white nationalist movement because of his harsh portrayal by the media. And the SPLC reported that its team monitoring far-right hate groups had seen recent signs on extremist chat boards that members of the racist US group Identity Evropa have been leaving in significant numbers. This could not be immediately verified. “It’s remarkable that in the last week, three of the primary intellectual leaders of the alt-right have either left the movement or radically altered their path,” Ryan Lenz, a spokesman for the SPLC told the Guardian on Wednesday. “What we are seeing is a sort of falling apart, or a fraying, of the movement, which really began with Charlottesville, where the so-called Unite the Right rally put them under the harsh light of public scrutiny,” he said. Lenz said it was not yet clear exactly why the movement appeared to be in turmoil. Heimbach, 26, was taken in handcuffs to the Orange County jail in the tiny town of Paoli, Indiana, early on Tuesday, before later being released. He is married to a stepdaughter of Parrott but had been having an affair with Parrott’s wife, according to an account given to Paoli police. On Tuesday night, Parrott had confronted Heimbach over the affair and poked him in the chest, whereupon Heimbach “grabbed and injured my hand … then choked me out with his arm,” Parrott said in a statement to police. Heimbach then reportedly chased Parrott and again choked him until he passed out. The police went to Heimbach’s home where an officer witnessed him having a verbal confrontation and scuffle with his wife while she was putting their young children to bed, during which he “grabbed her face”, causing bleeding, and threw her on the bed. Heimbach was charged on Tuesday with battery and domestic battery committed in the presence of a child under age 16. He was already subject to a suspended sentence of 90 days in jail after he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct last July for repeatedly shoving a young protester at an election rally for Donald Trump. “Matthew Heimbach is now the thuggish face of white nationalism,” said SPLC’s Lenz.

The Stansted 15 were subsequently charged with a terrorism-related offence and their trial starts on Monday. If found guilty, they could serve many years in prison. Secret deportation flights take thousands of people from our communities every year. Parents, friends and neighbours are targeted on the basis of their perceived nationality and snatched to fill a flight that the Home Office has chartered. Many critics have argued that like Trump’s “Muslim ban”, these deportations are unjust and racist. Violence and abuse from security contractors have been documented on these flights. Most people would be horrified if they were aware of the nature of this process. The Stansted action was the first time a deportation flight has been grounded in the UK by people protesting against the immigration system. People who would have been forced on to the flight were able to stay in the UK because of the action, as it gave them time to have their applications heard. People across the UK are standing together to stop the Home Office breaking up families and tearing communities apart. We call for all charges against the Stansted 15 to be dropped and for the Home Office to immediately cease chartering flights for deportation.

The challenge comes after it emerged last week that the equalities committee of Labour’s ruling body proposed clarifying that all-women shortlists and women’s reserved places were open to self-defining women. In a legal letter seen by the Guardian a group of Labour women, including community coordinator and campaigner Pilgrim Tucker and activist Jennifer James, have written to the party to demand clarification on its policy to establish whether it was in breach of the Equality and Gender Recognition acts. Last year the government said it would consult on reforming the Gender Recognition Act, to allow transgender people to self-declare their gender. Under current law, anyone wishing to transition must demonstrate they have lived as that gender for two years. James has raised £26,000 to bankroll a potential legal challenge; she was suspended from the Labour party in January after accusations of transphobia following online comments. After her suspension James tweeted: “I’ve been suspended from the Labour Party for saying women don’t have dicks.” Tucker said debate around the issue of self-identification had become very polarised, with reasonable debate stifled. “This [legal action] is about abiding by current equalities legislation, not getting ahead of the law,” she said. “But this is a part of a much wider issue. There are risks and there are important discussions to be had before any changes to the Equalities Act and the Gender Recognition Act. This has to be an educated, informed decision, not one that has been taken out of heightened emotion or an unwillingness to hurt people’s feelings.” Opposition to the proposed changes gathered momentum this week, with two meetings held by groups who oppose changes to the Gender Recognition Act which would allow transpeople to change legal gender without a medical assessment. But some campaigners were accused of transphobia, after speakers at a meeting in the houses of parliament were accused of using derogatory language and consistently misgendering trans women. Trans rights charities and campaigners were fiercely critical of comments reportedly made at a meeting on the issue of self-identification on Wednesday, which was hosted in the houses of parliament by rightwing MP David Davies after Millwall football club pulled out of hosting the event, following pressure from transrights campaigners. Pink News reported that at the event, organised by We Need To Talk, speaker Sheila Jeffreys, an Australian academic, said: “When men claim to be women…and parasitically occupy the bodies of the oppressed, they speak for the oppressed.” It also reported that trans women were repeatedly referred to as men, with male pronouns used. Attendees tweeted about the event using the hashtag War On Women. A separate speaker Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull, has been questioned by police about tweets sent to the chief executive of Mermaids, a charity supporting transgender children. Tucker said that if the report was accurate, the comments were “not helpful” and said the women launching the legal challenge insisted on a “comradely, respectful level of debate”. Jamie Pallas, of trans rights organisation Gendered Intelligence said the language used at the meeting was harassment and discrimination under the Equality Act, adding that accusations that trans activists were silencing debate was unfounded. “Giving a platform for hate speech is not OK. I don’t see how it is encouraging a calm reasoned debate,” he said. “I think it is actually about shutting down trans voices. “There should be room for education and learning, but that is a different thing than allowing destructive and undermining panels like this to take place.” Community organiser Lucy McDonagh, who attended the event, said she had been labelled a bigot for asking questions about proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act. “Literally just asking a question if these changes could potentially affect women’s safe spaces is deemed as being transphobic. So lots of women, especially working class women, are scared to ask,” she said. “We have had to access this particular space because no one else has allowed us to speak about it. We are trying to find out about law, and we are trying to find out why women have been cut out of the conversation that statistically most affects them.” A second meeting, in Birmingham, was organised on Thursday by Woman’s Place UK , which is hosting a series of events around the country and describes itself as enabling “proper debate and discussion on sex, gender and the GRA”. Writer and artist Shon Faye said the meetings disproved the accusation that women were being silenced. She said groups opposed to changes around self-identification often resorted to inaccurate information and demands for debate often descended into transphobic abuse. Spaces that are currently segregated by sex, including women’s prisons and refuges, would still be able to make risk assessments and exclude potentially dangerous individuals, she argued. “If there is evidence that a person is a potential risk it is appropriate to exclude them,” she said. “What it is not appropriate to do is exclude someone for identifying as trans.” She added that she agreed there was a need to protect vulnerable women, but that should also include vulnerable trans women who suffered “disproportionate transphobic violence and misogynistic violence at the hands of men.” A Labour spokeswoman said all-women shortlists had always been open to all women, including self-identifying trans women. “At the NEC’s last meeting it was agreed that the party would consult with stakeholders about the wording of a statement which clearly sets out and explains this policy,” she said. “This consultation is ongoing. The statement will be brought to the NEC once the consultation has concluded.” Labour said it was committed to updating the Gender Recognition Act in line with the principles of self-declaration “to ensure it provides proper protection for trans people from discrimination”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/mar/19/poem-our-old-lady-of-the-rain-by-jane-commane","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-19T10:25:38Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: Our Old Lady of the Rain by Jane Commane","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/19/poem-our-old-lady-of-the-rain-by-jane-commane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/19/poem-our-old-lady-of-the-rain-by-jane-commane","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: Our Old Lady of the Rain by Jane Commane","bodyText":"Our Old Lady of the Rain by Jane Commane She was older, iron-tasting tang, the smell of damp girders about her. She’d had blueprints once, hundreds of them, kept in a plan chest, maplewood drawers as wide as a kitchen table, and as deep. Knew where to fall from one day to the next, kept her chancels swept clean and free of ghosts but filled roofless factories with rust and the lathes coked up with the ruddy mould. She couldn’t help it and was sad to be a Midas inside-out. I loved her, though I didn’t know if I should. Coventry-born poet Jane Commane writes in various moods about de-industrialisation in her first collection, Assembly Lines (Bloodaxe). Alongside poems of outrage, like The Shop-floor Gospel, are those which take more obliquely elegiac angles and Our Old Lady of the Rain is one of them. It suggests the chronicling of a myth, by someone who witnessed its making, and became temporarily a worshipper of the goddess evoked. That the speaker, and the reader, should feel uneasy with the power accorded this presence is part of the poem’s intention. Although Our Old Lady of the Rain is not paired with it, another poem in the collection, Fabrikgeist operates similarly, and you may like to read it here. The “factory spirit” in that poem is male, “Sometimes referred to affectionately as Old-Jack-of-Trades”, who manifests himself by reactivating old, defunct machinery. But the ghost in Fabrikgeist has run out of steam, succumbed to time and weather, his sense of humour “broken by three decades of rain/ rust, and under-investment…” Our Old Lady of the Rain is one of the agents of his diminishment, one who cleansed but ultimately corroded the factory ruins. Commane is not the first poet to be attracted to post-industrial symbolism: there’s WH Auden, and his passion for disused mine-workings. His New Year Letter of 1940 looks back on a moment of vocational self-discovery: “In Rookhope I was first aware/ Of Self and Not-self, Death and Dread./There I dropped pebbles, heard/ The reservoir of darkness stirred.” Commane may feel a similar epiphany, but wisely leaves those heavy stones (Self and Not-self) un-mined. As a child, even in England’s south-east, I felt ghosts occupied certain buildings, the small factories and warehouses in yet-to-be gentrified docklands, angrily derelict behind their Danger Keep Out signs. A frustrated presence lingers soundlessly and without threat in Our Old Lady of the Rain, and, as the poem begins by noticing, registers itself through the sharp sense of smell which, perhaps especially in a child’s perception, is deeply mixed up with the sense of taste. This “Old Lady of the Rain” has several aspects. She is partly engineer, partly cleaning-woman: she has a back-room or office, grand with its Maplewood “plan chest”, indicating the all-important possession of blueprints, riches she has in common with the spirit in Fabrikgeist. But her factory is more than a place of manufacture; with its “chancels” it resembles a church, perhaps a cathedral. She is “Our” lady (Notre-Dame?), the possessive, plural pronoun implying she belongs to the people.Once upon a time, she “knew where to fall”, kept things clean and, significantly, ghost-free. Old Jack-of-Trades would not have been allowed to rampage. Even the blue of the blueprints connects her with the Virgin Mary, Our Lady. “She was older…” the poem tells us, an iron smell older than the factory, one of the first elements it used and reshaped. As a goddess, she might date farther back, to pagan origins and the growing of crops. Commane grounds her in the powerful details of her surroundings, the chest-drawers which have the depth of a dining-table (and so imply that the factory and its economic and social workings involved layers of family activity) and, on the shop-floor, that vivid image of “the lathes/coked up with the ruddy mould.” As an allegorical figure, the Old Lady of the Rain represents the process of industrial decline and ruin, but she is characterised mildly, “sad to be a Midas inside-out.” Did she bring about kindlier, more feminised times? The poem is not so politically obvious as that, yet the Old Lady’s appeal is strongly conveyed. Her destructive power has been unintentional and inevitable, her rule ended. The poem seems to sigh – a regretful, evocative and uncomfortable reminder of the temptations of nostalgia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/16/frc-inquiry-big-four-accountancy-kpmg-deloitte-pwc-ey","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T14:05:57Z","webTitle":"Regulator urges inquiry into breaking up big four accountancy firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/16/frc-inquiry-big-four-accountancy-kpmg-deloitte-pwc-ey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/16/frc-inquiry-big-four-accountancy-kpmg-deloitte-pwc-ey","fields":{"headline":"Regulator urges inquiry into breaking up big four accountancy firms","bodyText":"A break-up of Britain’s big four accountancy firms could end their dominance in auditing the accounts of large companies and address a crisis of confidence facing the sector after a series of scandals, a UK regulator has suggested. Stephen Haddrill, the chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, which regulates the sector, called for an investigation into whether KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY should have to spin off their UK audit arms into separate businesses. The aim would be to increase competition and eliminate conflicts of interest arising from the dominance of the four firms. It follows a series of corporate accounting scandals, including UK construction firm Carillion, whose books were signed off by KPMG and which collapsed under a pile of debt in January. Deloitte is under review by regulators in South Africa after the firm flagged irregularities in the accounts of its client, the furniture group Steinhoff, which owns Poundland, Benson for Beds and Harveys in the UK. “There is a loss of confidence in audit and I think that the industry needs to address that urgently,” Haddrill told the Financial Times. “In some circles, there is a crisis of confidence.” Haddrill has held discussions with the Competition and Markets Authority about opening an investigation into the UK audit market, and is planning to hold future meetings on the issue. The big four accountants audited all but nine of the companies listed on the FTSE 350 at the end of their financial years, according to Manifest, a research firm that provides investors with information on corporate governance. A previous inquiry into the dominance of the big four by the UK Competition Commission – now replaced by the CMA – resulted in tougher rules for the accountancy sector being introduced in 2013. Measures included a requirement that FTSE 350 companies put their audit business out to tender at least every 10 years. However, the market share of the four firms subsequently increased, rather than fell. Haddrill said: “The Competition Commission introduced some remedies to try and encourage more competition. But there is no more competition. So it seems to me that we ought to have another look at [the audit market].” The CMA told the FT: “We are actively monitoring the remedies put in place following the Competition Commission’s inquiry … This monitoring is ongoing and the [authority] remains open to looking further at this sector in the future.” Critics of the big four’s dominance have pointed to potential conflicts of interest arising from the rapid growth of their consulting divisions. They argue that an accountancy firm might have a biased approach to a client’s audit if it also has a lucrative consultancy contract with the company, advising it in areas such as tax. “If you’re in the senior leadership of the firm, I think you need to be focusing heavily on your public interest responsibility, which is the audit bit,” Haddrill said. “[But] so much of your attention is bound to be drawn to the most profitable and the fastest-growing part of your business, which is not the public interest part.” Audits on Carillion were criticised last month as “a colossal waste of time” by Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP and chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee. Following a BEIS committee evidence session, Reeves suggested the auditors had a role to play in the collapse of the company. She said: “We heard from auditors who don’t attend audit meetings, fail to visit projects which they themselves say are at risk, and who provide clarity only about what is not included in an audit rather than what is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/mar/23/ear-hustle-vivid-view-of-life-behind-bars-in-san-quentin-podcasts-of-the-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-23T06:00:50Z","webTitle":"Ear Hustle: vivid view of life behind bars in San Quentin – podcasts of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/23/ear-hustle-vivid-view-of-life-behind-bars-in-san-quentin-podcasts-of-the-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/23/ear-hustle-vivid-view-of-life-behind-bars-in-san-quentin-podcasts-of-the-week","fields":{"headline":"Ear Hustle: vivid view of life behind bars in San Quentin – podcasts of the week","bodyText":"Picks of the week: Ear Hustle and The Thread with Ozy Podcast Ear Hustle Podcast Incarcerated podcast host Earlonne Woods is currently serving 31 years in San Quentin state prison for attempted second-degree robbery, and he’s keen to tell the world what life is really like on the inside.

He boldly announced recently - once again - that his previous one was definitely – unquestionably – his last. This time, when Claire Armitstead was interviewing him, she mentions that while reading The Melody, she had pictured work by an obscure painter of the early 20th century in her mind’s eye. Amazed, Crace admitted that although he never once mentions the painter in the novel, he did indeed have a painting by said Fauvian artist above his desk while writing it. This prompted the books podcast team to ask: how on earth did she pick that up? What is our subconscious doing while we’re reading? We all read, but do we all read differently? We get under and between the covers (as it were) and a typically fun and enlightening discussion between Claire, Sian and Richard ensues.

Imagine you have a credit card with a $5,000 limit, says Karen Cox from the Financial Rights Legal Centre. You have not paid it off in a while but you are meeting the monthly minimum repayments, so the bank offers to raise the limit. You accept the offer but now the debt is $8,000, and you cannot pay it off. You accept a credit transfer from another financial institution on the promise of 18 months interest-free, thinking to use that time to pay down the debt. You never get around to cancelling the original card but keep it “for emergencies”. An emergency happens, and you reach for the original credit card. Now you have two credit card debts, and you can’t pay off either one. “What was meant to be a refinance to get them out of trouble just gets them deeper and deeper into trouble,” she says. It gets worse. In an effort to gain control, you consolidate your credit card debt into your home loan. The interest rates are lower, but it takes much longer to repay. In some cases, Cox says, the size of the consolidated debt makes mortgage repayments unmanageable. “We spoke to a father in the last month who had refinanced $100,000 in credit card debt into his home loan,” she says. The new loan balance pushed repayments up by almost $1,000 a month. “The family is very likely to lose their home, because they can’t afford it,” she says. Credit card debt is the impetus behind the overwhelming majority of calls to the legal centre, which manages the New South Wales branch of the national debt hotline. It’s also one of the focus areas for the first hearing of the royal commission, which began in Melbourne on Tuesday. Decades of debt The amount of credit card debt is staggering, Cox says. Assessments about whether a person can afford a particular credit card are based on their ability to meet the minimum monthly repayments, not pay the total within a reasonable timeframe. It is unsustainable. “We spoke to an elderly woman who said she had been paying off the same $1,000 since the 1990s,” she says. “If I go to purchase a pair of jeans after this hearing, I don’t want to be carrying that debt for 10 years or more. And yet we are seeing people who are carrying debt for more than 10 years.” The royal commission in the next two weeks will focus on consumer credit lending products: home loans, car loans, credit cards, credit offers such as pre-approved overdrafts, and add-ons such as loan insurance. Twelve case studies have been pulled out of the 1,894 submissions the commission has received so far for in-depth analysis. Almost nine in 10 of the submissions “described conduct that is alleged to be misconduct or conduct falling below community standards or expectations”, says Rowena Orr QC, senior council assisting commissioner Kenneth Hayne QC. The case studies will focus on examples of alleged misconduct, or conduct falling below community standards and expectations, from six financial institutions: ANZ, Aussie Home Loans (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank), Citibank, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac. All six institutions received letters from Hayne requesting they detail events where their institution may have committed such conduct. The level of detail in their responses “differed”, Orr says, but all agreed to certain events of misconduct or conduct falling below community standards. The response from Aussie Home Loans, a mortgage broker that is alleged to have had some fraudulent broker arrangements, was eight paragraphs long, contained within a submission from parent company Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank’s submission, Orr says, adopted a “high-level and general approach” that “did not disclose the totality” of its conduct. Its second submission contained an abundance of spreadsheets, presenting information that was “not in a form which made it possible to understand the type and scale of [the bank’s] misconduct events”. Orr’s comments, delivered in a flat tone that underlined the commission’s displeasure at receiving such a response, drew angry mutters in the overflow courtroom, where most of the media and many members of the public had come to watch. It is a level of obfuscation expected by those in the public gallery, many of whom have made their own submissions to have their case heard by the royal commission. Some are not convinced that the rows of lawyers and lever-arch files in the principle courtroom are capable – or even interested – in bringing the banks into line. In the long, snaking queue to get into the courtroom before the hearing, a failed Melbourne property developer, who requested anonymity of both Guardian Australia and the commission to which he made a submission about a multimillion loss when MFS Investment Management went into administration in 2007, said he believed the commission would be a “whitewash”. “It’s not going to change the banks. It can’t,” he said. “They’ll just ignore the recommendations.” The Melbourne hearings will run until 23 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/17/charlie-raynor-i-know-they-have-come-away-from-situations-of-trauma","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T21:12:52Z","webTitle":"Charlie Raynor: 'I know they have come away from situations of trauma'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/17/charlie-raynor-i-know-they-have-come-away-from-situations-of-trauma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/17/charlie-raynor-i-know-they-have-come-away-from-situations-of-trauma","fields":{"headline":"Charlie Raynor: 'I know they have come away from situations of trauma'","bodyText":"Turn up to the Inveresk Tavern most days of the week, and you can order standard pub fare: the place prides itself on serving burgers, fish and chips, a seafood platter and steak – timeless, no-nonsense classics at good value prices, served with very cold beers or a glass of local wine. Nothing fancy or exotic. Yet on some Sundays, it’s a different story. Historically a working class suburb on the fringe of Launceston, where rail yards, factories and industrial workshops once predominated, today Inveresk attracts young families in search of affordable housing and a laid-back lifestyle, away from the now premium hub of Hobart – where mainlanders have snapped up their little bit of Georgian heritage architecture and waterfront views, with price tags to match. But don’t say the word “gentrification” to tavern owner Charles Rayner. It makes him bristle. Averse to all forms of pretension, Rayner bought the tavern in 2015 and wants to keep it as authentically true to the suburb’s working class roots as possible despite the changing demographics. The son of two Hobart librarians, Rayner is a veteran of the hospitality industry. After attending Hutchins, a well-regarded private school, he failed to graduate from a commerce and law degree. Never one to call on the old boy network , he fell into the restaurant trade, enjoying the camaraderie of the kitchen despite the punishing hours. But he didn’t like the ethos of the investor-owned businesses that employed him. “I’m not a social justice warrior, but I just got sick of the arseholes who earned money at the expense of everyone else. I didn’t like their dog-in-the-manger attitude and the way they never contributed to anything. I don’t fit in with corporate structures or values.” When the opportunity came to buy the tavern, he leapt at the chance. “It was struggling, which meant I could afford it,” he says. Right from the start, Rayner was clear about his aims. “I knew I wanted to be a good employer, where staff received all their entitlements, decent wages and had time off with their families. I employed two people in the kitchen for four days a week each (there wasn’t demand for more back then) so they had reasonable hours. I did it by the book.” “Then I asked myself what I could do with the three days a week that the pub was closed. I decided that I would offer the Sunday lunch trade to any charity that might want to use the kitchen. I put out an expression of interest to see who would apply. At about the same time I met Ella Dixon, the CEO of the Migrant Resource Centre. After talking to her, I offered the pub to specific cultural communities to prepare their traditional food as a way to fundraise.” The response was overwhelming. Over the last 10 years, Launceston has become home to several refugee communities from the Congo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal and the Sudan. More than 3,000 humanitarian entrants and refugees have settled in and around the city’s northern suburbs: the place’s small scale makes resettlement less traumatic. Word soon got around and within weeks the tavern kitchen was being booked – one week it was Korean students, the next it was Filipino women. And the public embraced it: 100 locals made a beeline for the pub, keen to taste unfamiliar national dishes. “It went off with a bang, completely troppo”, says Rayner, who has a laconic manner that is not prone to exaggeration. “It was always home cooking, nothing was ever too hot or spicy or strange, although I do remember one pepper soup that had quite a kick to it,” he says, adding that the Sundays got so popular, he had to lend a hand washing dishes when demand was at its peak. It reminded him of his early days. “When I started working in kitchens and spending time with the guys who chopped veggies and washed the floors, I got to know them and understood they were not there to steal our jobs. I know that they have come away from situations of trauma and on top of that, suffered a lot of stigma.” Still, he was not confident that local residents would share his views from the start. “There was the risk of pushback from customers that come to drink there. I can’t pretend that some of them are not casual racists. But I’m pleased to report that we have not received one complaint and there has been no rudeness or hostility towards anyone in the community kitchen.” All the money raised goes directly back to the community that cooks on Sundays. This year, two new communities will join the tavern roster, bringing the total to eight. Rayner is surprised that others have not copied the idea. “I ask myself why not, but it’s probably just due to a failure of imagination or a fear of risks.” He admits that the venture has taken up a lot of his supposedly free time. “It does depend on my being there,” he says, adding wryly that the tavern cost him one relationship but that he has a new partner who has nothing to do with it. The couple have no children, but two dogs. “We haven’t had a holiday for a bit,” he concedes. The attention the community kitchen scheme has attracted from outside, including stories in national media, makes Rayner uncomfortable. “Last year I got nominated for the Tassie of the Year award,” he says and you can almost hear him squirm with embarrassment. “I was so relieved not to win. If I had been picked, I would have felt ashamed compared to people who have spent years making a real difference. All I’ve done is put a few bums on seats.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/13/richard-flanagans-the-narrow-road-to-the-deep-north-to-be-adapted-for-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T05:04:08Z","webTitle":"Richard Flanagan's The Narrow Road to the Deep North to be adapted for TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/13/richard-flanagans-the-narrow-road-to-the-deep-north-to-be-adapted-for-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/13/richard-flanagans-the-narrow-road-to-the-deep-north-to-be-adapted-for-tv","fields":{"headline":"Richard Flanagan's The Narrow Road to the Deep North to be adapted for TV","bodyText":"Three years after taking out the Man Booker prize, Richard Flanagan’s epic The Narrow Road to the Deep North is to be adapted for television. The bestselling Australian author has signed a deal with FremantleMedia Australia for his novel to be made into a high-end drama series about the horrific ordeals of the prisoners on the death railway between Thailand and Burma during the second world war. Flanagan, 57, was inspired to write the novel by his father’s experience as a prisoner of war, forced by the Japanese to work on the railway. He was “delighted” that the book would be made into a series “in this age of great television drama, promising the quality, the depth and the occasional brilliance of which the form is now capable”. FremantleMedia’s director of drama, Jo Porter, said the Deep North was a compelling universal story made for television. “Rich with insights on the human condition, it is ripe for screen adaptation with huge visual potential and scale,” Porter said. “At its core is an achingly powerful examination of the many forms of love, forged through the crucible of war.” FremantleMedia’s production of Picnic at Hanging Rock for Foxtel and Amazon Prime will have its world television premiere on 6 May on Foxtel. No broadcaster is yet attached to this project, a spokesman for FremantleMedia said. First published in 2013, Deep North sold more than a million copies in 42 countries, and is a bestseller in the UK, Australia and the US. Winning the Booker changed Flanagan’s life as he had run out of money and was going to work in the mines to make a living. “A year and a half ago, when I finished this book, I was contemplating going to get what work I could in the mines in far northern Australia because things had come to such a pass with my writing,” Flanagan said when he won. “I had spent so long on this book.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/14/child-sex-abuse-survivors-given-unrealistic-deadline-for-compensation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T17:00:00Z","webTitle":"Child sex abuse survivors given 'unrealistic' deadline for  compensation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/14/child-sex-abuse-survivors-given-unrealistic-deadline-for-compensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/14/child-sex-abuse-survivors-given-unrealistic-deadline-for-compensation","fields":{"headline":"Child sex abuse survivors given 'unrealistic' deadline for  compensation","bodyText":"Survivors of child abuse will face an “especially unrealistic” deadline to decide whether to accept offers of compensation under the government’s redress scheme, lawyers and child protection advocates have warned. The redress scheme legislation before parliament gives survivors 90 days to decide on a compensation offer once it is made by a church or institution. The deadline is far less than the 12 months recommended by the royal commission, which set the time limit to give survivors enough time to carefully consider their options. Taking an offer of redress “releases and forever discharges” the institution responsible for the abuse, meaning they cannot be sued. Choosing between the two options requires expert legal advice on complex issues, such as the prospects of success in court, limitation periods, the survivor’s ability to afford a civil case, and an institution’s capacity to pay. The Law Council of Australia said 90 days was “inadequate” and “especially unrealistic” for such advice to be obtained. “Given the legal implications of accepting an offer, it is essential that survivors have the opportunity to seek and receive independent legal advice as to whether they should accept an offer or pursue a civil claim,” the council said. The founder of the child protection group Bravehearts, Hetty Johnston, said the government should mirror the recommendations of the royal commission closely. “If the royal commission recommended 12 months, then 12 months it needs to be,” she told Guardian Australia. “Why would you pay millions of dollars for a royal commission and then ignore it? “The only time royal commissions are a waste of money is when the government ignores the findings.” The council is warning that free legal service providers helping survivors will be swamped once the scheme is established. The leading service, Knowmore, has helped about 8,000 survivors in four years. The federal government expects about 60,000 people to seek redress once its scheme is established and if all states, territories and major institutions and charities opt in. Survivors can get more time to consider an offer, but only in exceptional circumstances. Otherwise, failing to respond within 90 days is taken to mean the survivor has declined the offer. The royal commission said keeping offers open for 12 months struck a fair balance. It also said survivors should have three months to decide whether to ask for a review of their offer. “These recommended time limits strike a balance between providing applicants with sufficient time to consider an offer and providing the redress scheme and institutions with certainty as to outcome of the application,” it said. The government’s model for the national redress scheme differs from the royal commission’s recommendations in key respects. It has capped payments at $150,000, rather than the recommended $200,000. A Senate inquiry has spent recent months scrutinising the bill, and is due to release its findings later this month. Fairfax reported on Tuesday that the Coalition had restricted the power of the Senate to make changes to the scheme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/13/labor-unveils-tax-write-offs-for-businesses-investing-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T04:58:35Z","webTitle":"Paul Keating backs Labor's plan to axe cash refunds for wealthy investors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/13/labor-unveils-tax-write-offs-for-businesses-investing-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/13/labor-unveils-tax-write-offs-for-businesses-investing-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Paul Keating backs Labor's plan to axe cash refunds for wealthy investors","bodyText":"Paul Keating has backed Bill Shorten’s overhaul of dividend imputation, saying the system the Labor leader proposes mirrors the original framework he set down in the late 1980s. The former Labor prime minister, who was consulted before Tuesday’s public announcement, told Guardian Australia the new scheme outlined by Shorten ensured company income was not taxed twice. Shorten has committed to axe cash refunds for excess imputation credits paid to individuals and superannuation funds. “The Labor party is returning the imputation system to the framework I designed in 1987,” Keating said. “This did not include cashbacks for people whose average tax rate was below the corporation tax rate of 30%.” “The key thing is to make certain that company income is not taxed twice. That’s the key thing, and the key to that is keeping the imputation system. “The Labor party is committed to keeping the imputation system.” On Tuesday Shorten also unveiled a new tax write-off for businesses investing locally in machinery, plant and equipment, or in intangibles such as patents or copyright. The new depreciation arrangements will reward businesses prepared to invest in Australia with generous write-off provisions, allowing an immediate 20% deduction of any new eligible asset worth more than $20,000. The overhaul of dividend imputation – which will stop cash refunds for excess imputation credits for individuals and superannuation funds – will save $11.4bn over the forward estimates. The new proposal from Labor reverses a change made to Keating’s policy by John Howard and Peter Costello allowing individuals and super funds to claim cash refunds for any excess imputation credits not used to offset their tax liabilities. After unveiling the two measures, Shorten said Labor was creating fiscal room to offer voters tax relief as well as funding a range of social services. But the government went to war immediately, declaring that the ALP was intent on “stealing” the tax refunds of pensioners and retirees. “That’s what they are doing today,” the treasurer, Scott Morrison, told reporters, referring to the proposal to end refunds for excess imputation credits. “They can dress it up anyway they choose, but that is the brutal reality of what the Labor party have decided to do today.” Morrison said Labor was chasing revenue because it had lost control of spending, and the dividend imputation measure was not about fairness. It was instead “a brutal tax grab”. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia was also critical, arguing that the removal of refunds for dividend imputation credits would hit low-income retirees inside and outside the superannuation system. “If there is a concern about individuals with large retirement savings receiving the benefit of refundable imputation credits then this would be better addressed by measures more closely linked to retirement balance,” said the association’s chief executive, Martin Fahy. “At face value, it appears that this proposal would impact mum and dad investors both through their superannuation and through the shares they own outside of super, and compromise the longstanding investment neutrality principle.” The government said far from Labor’s policy being a hit on wealthy retirees, 97% of people who received franking credit refunds had a taxable income below $87,000, and more than half of them had a taxable income below the tax-free threshold. It said the Shorten proposal would hit the incomes of a million Australians, most of whom were over 65. The government said the change would affect one in three self-managed super funds, affecting 370,000 member accounts and the retirement savings held in about 3.5m super fund accounts. Shorten told reporters after his speech he had anticipated the vigorous pushback from both the government and self-managed super funds, but he said the two measures were building blocks in the opposition’s economic platform. The opposition leader said ending cash refunds in the dividend imputation system was about making the tax system more equitable as well as creating fiscal room for a tax cut for working people – with the measure saving the budget more than $11bn in two years, and $59bn over the medium term. The enhanced depreciation arrangements for businesses investing locally was a measure to boost economic growth, he said. “We’re choosing to invest in Australian business so that they invest in growth,” Shorten told reporters. Asked whether ending the cash refunds amounted to stealing from pensioners, he said: “That’s just complete rubbish. What we’re doing is reforming the tax system. “I think all fair-minded observers of Australia’s tax system know that the current tax system has advantages in it which are weighted to the very wealthy and to large corporations. What we want to do is put the weight back in the economy and government to looking after middle- and working-class Australians.” The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the change would affect less than 1% of people on the pension, and 8% of taxpayers overall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/mar/12/serena-venus-williams-indian-wells-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-13T04:00:05Z","webTitle":"Venus Williams beats Serena Williams in Indian Wells – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/mar/12/serena-venus-williams-indian-wells-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/mar/12/serena-venus-williams-indian-wells-live","fields":{"headline":"Venus Williams beats Serena Williams in Indian Wells – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check out the match report. Second set: Venus 6-3, 6-4 Serena Venus double-faults to open this crucial game, but Serena mixes in a pair of unforced errors. Then an electric rally breaks out ending when Venus pushes a short ball from the forehand side into the net for 30-all, maybe the first short ball she’s missed all night. Now Venus puts another forehand into the net for 30-40, giving Serena yet another break-point chance as the crowd swells. She saves it with an ace out wide. And a service winner on the next point gives Venus her second match point of the night. This time she closes it out and Venus has beaten Serena in straight sets for the first time since the 2008 Wimbledon final. A vintage performance in one hour and 25 minutes. Second set: *Venus 6-3, 5-4 Serena (*denotes next server) Venus hitting that forehand with abandon. She strokes a winner on the first point then just misses on the second for 15-all. But Serena takes control from 30-all and closes out the hold with a backhand passing shot down the line. Outstanding stuff. Venus will have a second chance to serve out the match. Second set: Venus 6-3, 5-3 Serena* (*denotes next server) Venus hits a forehand winner then watches Serena miss from the baseline and now she’s two points from the finish line. Serena pulls a point back, then Venus double-faults. Uh-oh. 30-all. Venus faults again and Serena steps into the court to pounce on the second serve, but she overhits the return past the baseline and Venus will have match point. Serena saves it with a passing shot at the net for deuce, then watches as Venus fails to hit an overhead winner into an open court. Now Serena has a break-point chance ... and Venus mixes in another double fault! Serena will now serve to stay in the tournament. Second set: *Venus 6-3, 5-2 Serena (*denotes next server) At 15-all, Serena sprays a backhand from the baseline wide for 15-30 and the crowds buzzes, knowing that a break here would likely be fatal. Now Venus hits another forehand winner and she will have two looks at a break point at 15-40. Serena saves the first with a well-constructed point ending with an overhead smash, but Venus crushes a forehand winner from the baseline for her third break of the set. Now she will serve for the match after the changeover. Second set: Venus 6-3, 4-2 Serena* (*denotes next server) A titanic rally on the opening point ends with Venus attemps a lob winner that sails just past the baseline. A Serena unforced error makes it 15-all, but she then crushes a stunning cross-court forehand winner for 15-30. Venus hits a pair of service winners for 40-30, but an unforced error from the baseline brings it to deuce. From there a pair of winners gives Venus the desperately needed hold. Just two games from the finish line now. Second set: *Venus 6-3, 3-2 Serena (*denotes next server) Oh boy. Serena rattles off three quick points before just missing a backhand on the run. Then another unforced error makes it 40-30, but a Venus error gives her the hold and Serena has backed up the break. Huge service game awaiting Venus after the changeover. Second set: Venus 6-3, 3-1 Serena* (*denotes next server) Venus giving her sister no quarter here. She continues to crack the forehand and win points with superior movement. Serena manages to push what looks to be an elementary hold to deuce. That’s where the longest rally of the match breaks out and Serena manages to chase down a drop shot for a volley winner and her first break-point chance in ages. Now Venus faults ... and Serena pounces on the second serve for a devastating forehand return winner. Can she back it up? Second set: *Venus 6-3, 3-0 Serena (*denotes next server) What looks like it’s shaping up to be a rare easy service game for Serena quickly turns as Venus wins three straight points from 40-15 down. Then facing a break point, Serena double-faults and now she’s down a set and a double break – placing Venus within touching distance of only her second victory over her sister since 2009. Second set: Venus 6-3, 2-0 Serena* (*denotes next server) At 15-all, Serena steps into the court and sprays wide an attemped at a backhand winner down the line. Serena misses again for 40-15, but then wins a rally on a lob winner set up by a beautiful drop shot. Alas, it’s not enough as another unforced error on the next point allows Venus to back up the break. Second set: *Venus 6-3, 1-0 Serena (*denotes next server) How about this? Serena was off to a fine start before coming apart toward the end of the game in a blur of unforced errors and gifting her older sister the early break. Venus in the driver’s seat early in the second stanza. First set: Venus 6-3 Serena And Venus punctuates a gorgeously played first set with back-to-back aces. Current mood: First set: *Venus 5-3 Serena (*denotes next server) Great hitting from both players here as the rallies are starting to pick up. An easy hold for Serena but now Venus will serve for the first set at 5-3. First set: Venus 5-2 Serena* (*denotes next server) Venus falls behind 15-30, but then Serena misses from the baseline for 30-all. Serena then misfires on a pair of shots from the baseline and suddenly Venus has consolidated the break and is just one game away from taking the first set. First set: *Venus 4-2 Serena (*denotes next server) Serena makes an error on her serve then Venus pounds a gorgeous winner for love-30. Now Serena nets a shot from the baseline – seven points in a row for Venus – and the elder sister will have three looks at a break point. She needs only one, breaking first for a 4-2 lead. First set: Venus 3-2 Serena* (*denotes next server) Venus holds at love, the first comfortable service game for either sister tonight. First set: *Venus 2-2 Serena (*denotes next server) From 30-all, Serena crushes an ace then watches as Venus makes an error for the baseline. They’ve won 20 points each. First set: Venus 2-1 Serena* (*denotes next server) Venus again falls behind love-30, but digs back with a pair of quick points for 30-all. She then double-faults and faces a break point for the second time in two service games. She saves it with a backhand winner from the baseline for deuce, then watches as Serena mixes in a pair of errors. Another hold for Venus from love-30 down. First set: *Venus 1-1 Serena (*denotes next server) Serena opens with a service winner, but Venus rattles off three quick points and suddently the older sister will have two chances at a break point. Serena saves the first with an ace then the second when Venus makes an error from the baseline. Deuce. They trade points back and forth: a second deuce, then a third and a fourth. But eventually Serena crushes a two-handed forehand winner from the baseline followed by a second-serve service winner to finally nail down the hold after a lengthy opening service game. And it appears the world No1 is in the building ... as a fan. First set: Venus 1-0 Serena* (*denotes next server) Venus falls behind love-30 on her serve and very quickly it’s Serena with a half-chance for an early break. Serena frames a return for 15-30, then Venus booms an ace for 30-all. Another Serena error makes it 40-30, but Venus sends a backhand from the baseline wide for deuce. Then a nice baseline rally breaks out ending when Venus strokes a nifty forehand winner on the approach, but she follows it with a double fault for deuce. Now Venus makes another unforced error from the baseline and Serena has her first break-point chance of the match ... but it’s wiped away quickly as Venus crushes another ace. Now Venus hits another winner and follows it with another vicious cross-court forehand winner from the baseline for the hard-won hold. One minute. Tonight’s winner will advance to face Latvia’s Anastasija Sevastova, who was a straight-sets winner over Julia Görges earlier today. The players are on court and meet at the net for the coin flip. Venus calls heads. It’s heads and Venus elects to serve. They’re going through the warm-up now and we should be under way in the next few minutes. Hello and welcome to tonight’s match between Venus and Serena Williams in the third round at Indian Wells. It marks the 29th tour meeting between the sisters; Serena holds a 17-11 advantage in the all-time head-to-head with victories in eight of the last nine and four straight on hard courts.

It had been lowered in acknowledgement of the death of the internationally renowned scientist, who was also one of the college’s most beloved figures. “Stephen’s loss is a great one for the college,” said its former master, Prof Sir Alan Fersht, who first met Hawking in 1965 as a student. “Caius is Stephen – they have been intertwined for over 50 years.” On Wednesday, at the college Hawking had called a “constant thread running through my life”, groups of students and tourists wandered in and out, some leaving flowers while others went to the college chapel to leave a note in a book of condolences. “I was shocked when I heard about his death this morning,” said Russ Holmes, the college’s head porter who has been on staff for 15 years. “You think he [Stephen Hawking] will go on forever. I know he was poorly in the last few months but it was a shock.” Holmes said he had been busy all morning, with press arriving, as well as students and tourists who wanted to pay their respects. Bouquets of flowers had started building up against the college gates. The head porter said that in recent years Hawking came to the college for large events and dinners. “He was an iconic chap and we used to have a picture of him with a teddy bear that we sell in the gift shop. As soon as we did that, sales of the teddy shot up. Everyone wanted a piece of Stephen Hawking.” Another Caius fellow, the British mathematician Prof Tim Pedley, who knew Hawking from his youth, said his death was “very sad and we will miss him”. He remembered Hawking’s enduring sense of humour, even under the most difficult circumstances. When, in 1985, Hawking was flown home to undergo an urgent tracheotomy in a hospital in Cambridge, colleagues from Caius and the mathematics department visited him and took turns to read to him. “I read the Pickwick Papers,” said Pedley. “Stephen had a lovely sense of humour and you could tell in those days he was laughing. But he was in a pretty bad way.” Pedley said Hawking would “always let you know if he disagreed with you” and he showed the world that people could be resilient in the most “daunting circumstances”. “He loved being a celebrity ... and the centre of attention and he did it very well,” Pedley added. Students at Cambridge said Hawking’s celebrity status as well as academic achievements made him a role model. “He stood out for his scientific contribution but also because he was loved by the public and had a great sense of humour. He appeared in shows like the Big Bang Theory,” said Kelly Marchisio, 27, a computer science student. She said one of the reasons she came to Cambridge was because of scientists like Hawking: “My goal while I was here was to try and see him speak. I didn’t manage that but that’s why I came here today. I am going to sign the condolences book. I will thank him for being an inspiration for future scientists and engineers.” • This article was amended on 2 April 2018.

He has 20 days to appeal. He was summoned by judicial authorities last week in connection with an interview he gave to Deutsche Welle’s Persian service earlier this year. In that interview, he said internal public discontent was the main driving factor behind a wave of unrest that shook the country in January, which the authorities blamed on Iran’s external enemies. Mizan, a news agency affiliated to the judiciary, said that prior to his sentencing he was facing accusations of “spreading propaganda against the state through giving interviews to foreign websites and trying to discredit the Islamic Republic’s ruling system”. Iran has a history of going after those who speak to exiled Persian language services, such as BBC Persian. “In that interview I said that the root cause of the unrest is internal issues and it’s because of the youth’s discontent with political, social and economic policies, and I predicted that just like the 2009 protests, the authorities will blame outsiders,” Zibakalam told the Guardian. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said around that time that the country’s enemies were to blame for the nationwide unrest, accusing them of “deploying every means at their disposal including money, arms and political and intelligence support to coordinate making trouble for the Islamic establishment”. Zibakalam’s trial was presided over by the infamous Judge Salavati. “I decided not to nominate any lawyers, because accusations against me, in essence, are political. In my defence, I asked the judge if in this country we’re allowed to have an opinion which is different from that of the establishment.” Zibakalam said he was not an opponent of the Islamic Republic, because he dedicated months touring the country and encouraging people to participate in the recent presidential elections. In 2014, he was ordered to pay a fine of 40m rials (£590) for questioning – in a public letter – how beneficial Iran’s nuclear programme has been to the country. This resulted in the current judge sentencing him to 18 months, more than the maximum one year prescribed by Iranian law for the crime of “spreading propaganda against the state”. Zibakalam added: “This is also the first time the judiciary has sentenced someone to be completely banned from activities on social media for two years. They have a grudge against me because I voiced opinions against those held by the ruling system.” Zibakalam’s fame in Iran is unusual even for a professor of political science who teaches at the country’s most well-known academic institution. The professor, who is sympathetic to the reformists and has over 370,000 followers on Facebook, became popular for his daring and passionate debates with hardliners on national television, radio or at roundtables hosted by various institutions. He has publicly challenged the state line on many sensitive topics, such as saying in 2014 that he recognised Israel because the UN recognises it as a state. Iran does not recognise Israel and authorities often refer to it as “the Zionist regime”; those who defy bans on travel to Israel can be put in prison for as long as five years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/mar/15/foreign-office-fco-warns-on-local-laws-and-customs","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T11:47:05Z","webTitle":"Don't end up in a far-flung jail: Foreign Office warns on local laws and customs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/mar/15/foreign-office-fco-warns-on-local-laws-and-customs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/mar/15/foreign-office-fco-warns-on-local-laws-and-customs","fields":{"headline":"Don't end up in a far-flung jail: Foreign Office warns on local laws and customs","bodyText":"With a growing number of British holidaymakers travelling to far-flung destinations, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is warning travellers to brush up on lesser-known local laws and customs, as those who flout them could be fined, jailed or deported. Cases that made the news last year include two US tourists that were detained in jail for over a week then deported after posing for a nude photo in front of a Buddhist temple in Thailand; a British man who narrowly escaped three months in jail in Dubai for touching a man’s hip; and a British woman deported from Sri Lanka for having a tattoo of Buddha on her arm. Last year the FCO dealt with over 23,000 cases of Britons falling foul of local laws, and between 2016 and 2017 there was a 7.1% increase in overall arrests and detentions, and an 8.7% increase in drug arrests. With the Easter holiday on the horizon, the FCO reminds tourists to check its country-by-country travel advice to avoid. Behaviour that could result in serious trouble in some countries includes swearing in public, wearing camouflage clothing, and entering the country with vaping equipment or e-cigarettes. According to the Office for National Statistics, travel to Sri Lanka was up by 22% and to the UAE by 17% in 2016 (2017 data is still incomplete), with increases also seen to Thailand and the Caribbean. In Sri Lanka, it is important that tourists understand how to be respectful of Buddhist images and artefacts. Visitors should be careful to follow instructions at sacred sites, particularly when taking photographs of Buddha statues. British nationals have been refused entry to the country, or faced deportation, for having visible tattoos of Buddha. In the UAE, swearing and making rude gestures are considered obscene acts and can lead to visitors being jailed or deported. This includes remarks made online. Tourists should also be aware that items that are legal in the UK may be banned elsewhere. In Thailand, it is illegal to take vaping supplies, e-cigarettes and refills into the country, with punishments ranging from confiscation to up to 10 years in prison. Similarly, in Japan, medicines such as Vicks inhalers or painkillers containing codeine are banned, and possession can result in detention or deportation. Julia Longbottom, FCO consular director, said: “It’s great to see British people being inspired to travel to new and exciting places. This makes it all the more important to follow our travel advice and respect local laws and customs in order to avoid unnecessary trouble.” She added: “Even closer to home, disrespecting local laws can have serious consequences. In Greece, indecent behaviour, such as mooning, can be punishable with a fine or even a prison sentence. We see many cases each year of people breaking local laws and customs. It is important that our travellers understand that the UK government can’t give legal advice or get them out of prison. Instead, we want to do all we can to help British people stay safe when they are travelling, and avoid ending up in these difficult situations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/14/google-bans-bitcoin-adverts-cryptocurrency-crackdown","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T11:29:04Z","webTitle":"Google bans bitcoin adverts in cryptocurrency crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/14/google-bans-bitcoin-adverts-cryptocurrency-crackdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/14/google-bans-bitcoin-adverts-cryptocurrency-crackdown","fields":{"headline":"Google bans bitcoin adverts in cryptocurrency crackdown","bodyText":"Google will ban all adverts for cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and initial coin offerings (ICOs), as it seeks to “tackle emerging threats”. The ad ban will come into force from June as part of a clampdown on unregulated financial products. Google’s director of sustainable ads, Scott Spencer, said in a blogpost: “We updated several policies to address ads in unregulated or speculative financial products like binary options, cryptocurrency, foreign exchange markets and contracts for difference (or CFDs).” Google said its ban includes cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. The company will also begin blocking some gambling ads, such as those for services using virtual items worth real-world money, known as skins betting, as it seeks to “combat new threats and improve the ads experience online”. The move follows similar bans made by advertising rival Facebook, which banned all cryptocurrency and ICO adverts in January after finding that many were being used to scam potential investors. “As consumer trends evolve, as our methods to protect the open web get better, so do online scams,” said Scott. “Improving the ads experience across the web, whether that’s removing harmful ads or intrusive ads, will continue to be a top priority for us.” Bitcoin and its cryptocurrency siblings such as ethereum have exploded in popularity over the last couple of years, fuelling a rapid growth in value peaking at just under $20,000 per bitcoin in 2017. Bitcoin was trading at around $8,800 at the time of publishing, according to data from Bitstamp. Cryptocurrency trading has attracted scam artists as it it is unregulated, with ICOs being used to generate millions of dollars that can simply disappear along with their operators, leaving investors out of pocket. Google said it removed more than 3.2bn ads that violated its policies in 2017, blocking what it described as the “majority of bad ad experiences”, including malvertising and phishing scams. Google’s parent company Alphabet makes roughly 85% of its revenue from advertising. It is estimated to bring in more than $40bn in ad revenues over the course of 2018, almost half the entire global $94bn market, beating Facebook, which earns $22bn, into second place. Meanwhile, UK-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase became the first to link up with a major bank, gaining an e-money licence from the Financial Conduct Authority and opening a bank account with Barclays to facilitate Faster Payments. The move will give users the “comfort of knowing transactions are subject to more stringent legal requirements around financial crime and the segregation of customer’s money, which can only be good news,” said Bradley Rice, senior regulation lawyer at law firm Ashurst.

After the race Fitzpatrick said: “It felt absolutely amazing, you can really feel the acceleration from your skis and your bodies driving you forward. It just doesn’t sink in. When we get to celebrate we’ll have a chance to realise what we’ve done, our families have done all the celebrating for us so far.” The silver was their third medal of the Games, adding to their super combined silver and super-G bronze. Team GB’s Kelly Gallagher and her guide, Gary Smith, narrowly missed out on a medal, finishing fifth. A disappointed Gallagher, a gold medal winner at Sochi 2014, said: “I think there is more in us but I definitely set out with the intentions to work really hard, which I did, and overall it went quite well. It’s hard to want something and for it then not to work out for you but I suppose having that resilience is really what these Games are about.” Brian McKeever, Canada’s most successful Winter Paralympian, added a 12th medal to his haul, winning the men’s visually impaired 1.5km sprint. The USA’s Oksana Masters took gold in the women’s sitting skiing 1.1km sprint. It marked a comeback for her, after she had been forced to pull out halfway through Tuesday’s biathlon event. “I feel like I’m on cloud nine right now,” she told paralympic.org. “This is the most amazing medal of my career. I cannot wait to put it around my mum’s neck. I told her the first gold, it’s hers.” Masters moved to the United States after being adopted from a Ukrainian orphanage. A photo finish was required in both the men’s 1.1km sitting race – with the USA’s Andy Soule edging out Dzmitry Loban of Belarus for gold – and the men’s 1.5km sprint standing. Canada’s Mark Arendz and Finland’s Ilkka Tuomisto could not be split in the latter, and so tied for third place. That race was won by Alexandr Kolyadin to claim Kazakhstan’s first ever Winter Paralympics gold. The ice hockey semi-finals will feature Canada taking on the hosts, South Korea, with the USA facing Italy after the last round of group matches were concluded. In the wheelchair curling, with most nations having played eight of their 11 matches, China, Canada, South Korea and Great Britain are in the top four places, which would see them progress to the semi-finals. The USA lead the Winter Paralympics medal table, with 21 medals including eight golds. The Neutral Paralympic Athletes from Russia are second, with 17 medals including six golds. Slovakia are in third place, also with six golds. Great Britain’s four silvers and one bronze medal places the team 17th in the table. In Australia there has been criticism of the television network Channel Seven for its approach to covering the Games, with former Paralympians complaining at the scheduling. Louise Sauvage, who won two gold medals in Sydney’s Paralympics in 2000 said: “My main problem is that it’s on so late at night, and they show the day before’s coverage. We have come such a long way in terms of public awareness and education about sport for athletes with disabilities. Why are we taking a step back with this very woeful coverage?” Seven has defended its coverage, a nightly one-hour highlights show, which sometimes features events up to 36 hours after they have taken place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/14/football-transfer-rumours-jack-wilshere-and-phil-jones-to-everton","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-14T10:48:56Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Jack Wilshere and Phil Jones to Everton?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/14/football-transfer-rumours-jack-wilshere-and-phil-jones-to-everton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/14/football-transfer-rumours-jack-wilshere-and-phil-jones-to-everton","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Jack Wilshere and Phil Jones to Everton?","bodyText":"Everton are hoping to give Jack Wilshere a pair of tracksuit bottoms with huge pockets so that he can trouser a better weekly wage than he is being offered at Arsenal to come and join the second coming of the Toffees’ revamp next season. And the word is that he’ll be joined by Manchester United’s human wrecking ball, Phil Jones, a player so prone to injuring himself and others that he’ll be sure to wipe out Wilshere in their first training session. But any move for Jones would probably be dependent on Sam Allardyce staying at the club, as the man who gave Jones his professional debut at Blackburn is keen to make the centre-back his key summer signing in a rebuilt spine featuring Jamie Vardy in attack. Manchester United are keen to do what they always do when the chips are down and lavish huge amounts of cash on whichever transfer target is on-trend. So step forward Fred, who Shakhtar Donetsk appear to be touting around like a stolen Rolex. The 25-year-old playmaker was being talked up as a probable summer signing for Manchester City but Shakhtar’s chief executive has encouraged a Benny Hill-style chase for the player by talking up United’s chances of luring Fred to Old Trafford. “Fred will leave in July,” Sergei Palkin told Corriere dello Sport. “If he does not go to Manchester City, he will go to Manchester United. Fred is ready to play in the strongest league. He is not only a very good player, but also a very good professional.” But can he excel at playing backwards and sideways passes? If Mike Ashley lets Newcastle spend any money this summer they will do so on Tolgay Arslan of Besiktas. The crafty midfield string-puller helped guide the Turkish champions into the Champions League knockout stages. Chelsea, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund are also keeping tabs on him. Jürgen Klopp has realised that if Roberto Firmino gets injured then Liverpool are in big trouble. Which is why he’s fluttering his lashes in the direction of RB Leipzig’s goal-guzzling striker Timo Werner. Klopp’s been trying to woo him for some time with no success but news that the club would let him go for the right price has got the Liverpool manager hot and bothered again. Tottenham are facing up to the prospect of losing cult hero Son Heung-min to … the South Korean Army. The 26-year-old is required to do two years’ national service before the age of 28.

So, I know that the microbial environment of the gut is crucial to good health and longevity. And that fermentation is vital to the gut, though I didn’t realise how vital until I spoke to Tim Spector, professor of genetics and author of The Diet Myth. It’s part of a suite of things that are good for you, along with “low-salt” and “very green”. “The complexity of adding fermentation to any food, as well as adding 10 times more flavour, releases more chemicals into the food; and the more chemicals there are, the more likely they are to be helpful to the body.” The process works differently depending on the food type, but there are a few key principles; you can’t just pickle, you have to pickle in brine, not vinegar, because acid kills everything. The English were left behind by fermentation, having prematurely fallen in love with vinegar, which is why we’re not as hardy as the Hungarians. Problematically, if you like your health awareness with a side order of self-flagellation, fermentation is quite delicious. Flat Three is a Swedish/Japanese fusion restaurant in London where they ferment in-house and pair their pickles with fermented juices, though you can have wine, if you like, because that’s also fermented. Miso looms large, but the flavour bomb is meju, a fermented bean paste to which you can add brine to turn it into doenjang, or fermentation squared. Something incredible happens to celery and cabbage pickled in brine: the intensity of flavour is like a dream, or the beginning of a stroke. Kombucha, the black tea, is brewed from a live culture called a scoby; Merlin (of course the restaurant guy’s called Merlin) has a culture at home that was his grandmother’s (though we may have been talking about a yoghurt by then; something in the ineffable proliferation of the microbes makes it hard to track which superfood you’re on). “Did you get the scoby?” Spector asks. “I bought a kombucha in Hackney at the weekend [of course it was in Hackney], and it had this little blob of microbes and fungi, all living together, at the bottom.” That living community will react with your own microbes to produce something new. But they’ve recently found that the microbes don’t even have to be alive: chocolate and sourdough both undergo fermentation, which is long dead by the time you eat it, but they’re still good for you, because the process has started breaking down the food before you try to digest it. “We can’t prove it yet,” Spector says, “but there’s a theory that even dead microbes can have a signalling effect, that makes your own microbes want to copy them.” I started to think of my gut as like a 1990s rave, the mad vivacity of partially intelligent life forms all mimicking each other. It’s a strangely hedonic health kick. What I learned A British Gut survey of 3,000 people found there is not much to choose between vegetarians and non-vegetarians, but there is a clear difference between people who eat a varied diet and those who don’t Zoe wears jacket from mygymwardrobe.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/22/perpetrators-of-domestic-abuse-more-likely-to-go-to-jail","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T00:01:02Z","webTitle":"Perpetrators of domestic abuse more likely to go to jail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/22/perpetrators-of-domestic-abuse-more-likely-to-go-to-jail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/22/perpetrators-of-domestic-abuse-more-likely-to-go-to-jail","fields":{"headline":"Perpetrators of domestic abuse more likely to go to jail","bodyText":"Perpetrators of domestic abuse are more likely to be sent to prison – even if they inflict emotional or psychological rather than physical harm alone – under new guidelines being published by the Sentencing Council. Existing rules recommend that convicted offenders whose actions result in serious violence “will warrant a custodial sentence in the majority of cases”. The fresh advice for judges released on Thursday extends that principle to include cases where “the emotional/psychological harm caused is severe”. The Sentencing Council for England and Wales promotes greater consistency in sentencing across the courts by issuing and updating guidelines for judges while aiming to increase public understanding of the decision judges make. Its new guidelines also say that domestic violence and threats should be subject to greater punishments than if the offence occurred outside of a relationship. “The domestic context … makes the offending more serious because it represents a violation of the trust and security that normally exists between people in an intimate or family relationship,” the six-page document states. It also suggests that pleas for clemency by the victim should generally be disregarded because there is a risk these may have been induced by threats or volunteered through fear. “Domestic abuse comes in many forms such as harassment, assault and sex offences,” said Jill Gramann, a magistrate and member of the Sentencing Council. “The increasing use of technology in offending has meant that it has also evolved in its scope and impact. The guideline also emphasises that abuse can take place in a wide range of domestic settings and relationships, and that abuse can be psychological, sexual, financial or emotional as well as physical.” There is no specific crime of domestic abuse, but it can be a feature of many offences and the new guidelines cover a wide variety of crimes, including so-called “honour” killings, female genital mutilation and forced marriage. Abuse is not limited to physical contact but may also be delivered through threatening telephone calls, text messages, email, social media or via GPS tracking devices. The Sentencing Council says the guideline changes are likely to lead to an increase in sentence severity. It cautions, however, that judges and magistrates should also consider the most appropriate sentence. “Where the custody threshold is only just crossed,” the guideline says, “the court will wish to consider whether the better option is instead to impose a community order, including a requirement to attend an accredited domestic abuse programme or domestic abuse specific intervention.” Women’s Aid supported the updated guidelines. Its chief executive, Katie Ghose, said: “We have long been calling for the sentencing for domestic abuse offences to reflect the severity of this crime. “Only by putting a stop to lenient sentencing for domestic abuse offences, can we send out the clear message that domestic abuse is unacceptable and that perpetrators will be held accountable for the abuse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/shortcuts/2018/feb/21/meet-elon-musk-family","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T14:54:54Z","webTitle":"Meet the Musks: who's who in Elon’s extended family?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/feb/21/meet-elon-musk-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/shortcuts/2018/feb/21/meet-elon-musk-family","fields":{"headline":"Meet the Musks: who's who in Elon’s extended family?","bodyText":"We know plenty about Elon Musk, the South African-born erstwhile teen mega-nerd, PayPal co-founder and Tesla boss turned tunneller, space coloniser and battery tycoon. But what about all the other Musks? Because while Elon revels in the success of his recent rocket launch, and a car-based publicity stunt that made Richard Branson look like Derek Trotter, little brother Kimbal is now making news, too. Time for a quick climb up the Musk family tree. Maye Musk Mother Musk was born in Canada to Johsua and Wyn Haldeman, who in 1952 flew the family around the world in a propeller plane. They settled in Pretoria, South Africa, where Maye became a model and met Errol Musk, an engineer. The couple had three Musks, starting with Elon, while Maye trained as a dietician. After a divorce, she and the kids ended up back in Canada, where Maye continued to model, featuring on Special K boxes and in the 2013 video for Beyoncé’s single Haunted. Kimbal Musk Not so little Kimbal (he is 6ft 4in) is a self-styled “social entrepreneur” and a player in the US’s burgeoning “farm to table” food movement. His Big Green scheme has planted hundreds of gardens in school playgrounds, starting in Colorado. He also has a chain of restaurants and an “urban farming accelerator” in Brooklyn, whereby young farmers grow expensive salad in shipping containers. He is also auctioning off the sixth Tesla Model 3 ever built to raise money for Big Green. Tosca Musk The youngest Musk, born in 1974, went west and studied film at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. She produced and directed some small-time films before getting into web TV with Tiki Bar TV, an ad-libbed comedy series that went to the top of the iTunes chart in 2005 after an endorsement from Steve Jobs. Late last year she raised millions of dollars in funding for Passionflix, a streaming service for romantic films. Talulah Riley Elon first married Canadian fantasy and YA author Justine Wilson in 2000 while studying in Ontario. They had twins in 2004, then triplets in 2006 (all five via IVF), before separating in 2008. Musk first married Riley, the British St Trinian’s star, in 2010, before separating in 2012, remarrying in 2013, and divorcing again in 2016, when the actor Amber Heard made a brief appearance in Musk’s romantic orbit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/21/thousands-of-gazans-rush-to-border-as-egypt-opens-crossing","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T17:08:12Z","webTitle":"Thousands of Gazans rush to border as Egypt opens crossing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/21/thousands-of-gazans-rush-to-border-as-egypt-opens-crossing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/21/thousands-of-gazans-rush-to-border-as-egypt-opens-crossing","fields":{"headline":"Thousands of Gazans rush to border as Egypt opens crossing","bodyText":"Egypt opened its border with Gaza on Wednesday, providing rare passage for thousands stuck in the coastal enclave who have lived under blockade for more than a decade. Thousands of Palestinians – some sitting since dawn next to suitcases packed in the hope that Egypt will allow them in – gathered at a stadium before being sorted on to buses. They raised their identification papers as their names were called out from a list. Khalil Qeshta, 45, said medical treatment in Gaza had not helped his son, who has been suffering for months from a debilitating stomach condition causing him to vomit blood. “I’ll go to Egypt at my own expense,” he said. “My son is five-years-old and he’s been sick for more than two years. We tried all the ways and means in Gaza, but there is no treatment. This is the third time I have tried to travel. I hope to be one of the lucky ones today.” One student said he had been accepted to study engineering in Turkey but missed the course start date in September. He hopes to make it for the second term, which has already started. The Rafah crossing point will be open for four days on a humanitarian basis. Egypt has kept it largely sealed since 2013, citing security reasons. Egyptian authorities have accused Hamas of aiding groups involved in the Sinai insurgency. Last year, Egypt only allowed passage on 36 days, according to the United Nations. Some 30,000 Gazans including medical patients, students and businesspeople are on a waiting list to travel through Rafah. But not all are guaranteed. Siham al-Zaq, 37, said she lives in Algeria and entered Gaza almost a year ago to visit her sick mother but has not been able to leave. “I registered to travel several times, and each time Egypt opened the crossing I lived in the hope that I would return with my children to my husband but every time the attempt failed,” the mother of three said.

Colum Eastwood, the leader of the nationalist SDLP party, said recent remarks by Hoey and other Brexit supporters about the Good Friday agreement not being sustainable were “very, very destabilising” for local communities. “I, for one, will not have the Good Friday agreement torn up just to facilitate a very awkward negotiation that’s going on between the United Kingdom and the European commission,” Eastwood told her. Hoey, who is from Northern Ireland, sits on the Northern Ireland affairs committee, which was taking evidence from witnesses from the region on devolution and democracy on Wednesday. The committee was sitting the day after Ireland’s deputy prime minister criticised Hoey for making “reckless” and irresponsible remarks after she declared that the Good Friday agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland 20 years ago was unsustainable. A tense exchange ensued after she asked Eastwood if it would be possible to tinker with the Good Friday agreement in a bid to restore the regional assembly, which collapsed 13 months ago. “Getting rid of mandatory coalition, as you call it, is not tinkering,” said Eastwood in a reference to power-sharing between Sinn Féin and the DUP in Stormont. “That’s a fundamental change in what the Good Friday agreement represents, and what the Good Friday agreement, at its very core, represents is peace,” he said. “I noted your comments, and I noted other people’s comments who seem to be more focused on ensuring we get out of the customs union and single market and we have a Brexit no matter what.” Hoey, who supports the UK’s exit from the EU, hit back, saying her comments were “nothing to do with Brexit”. Eastwood replied saying he thought her comments, along with similar remarks by Brexiter Daniel Hannan and the Conservative MP Owen Paterson “seemed fairly co-ordinated to me”. Hoey said she had never suggested “tearing up” the Good Friday agreement and was supported by the committee chairman, who warned that such accusations did not do anyone any good. Earlier, the loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson, a representative of Unionist Voice Policy Studies, accused Hoey’s critics of exaggerating the threat to peace in Northern Ireland. He agreed with Hoey it was possible to support peace and be against violence and still be critical of the political process. He said equating debate about the Good Friday agreement with a support for violence was “a moral blackmail at the heart of the GFA”. “Who’s going to engage in violence?” he asked rhetorically. “It’s an easy way to shut down debate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/21/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-finally-but-feebly-tackles-may-on-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T13:15:29Z","webTitle":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn finally, but feebly, tackles May on Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/21/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-finally-but-feebly-tackles-may-on-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/21/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-finally-but-feebly-tackles-may-on-brexit","fields":{"headline":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn finally, but feebly, tackles May on Brexit","bodyText":"Key points A more than usually noisy PMQs saw Jeremy Corbyn focus his questions on Brexit and the detail – or lack of it – of the government’s plan for it. He started by saying David Davis promised in his Brexit speech on Tuesday that Britain would not turn into a “Mad Max-style dystopia”, before asking whether Theresa May couldn’t set the bar a bit higher than that? May says the only fiction around is from Labour, which cannot decide on its own Brexit policy. Corbyn pressed on with the Davis speech – pointing out that the Brexit secretary said he did not want to deregulate. So why did his own department say there could be opportunities from deregulation on issues such as the environment? May rattles through a list of what she wants from Brexit but does not answer the question. Corbyn said Boris Johnson briefed in December that the working-time directive would be scrapped. He added that May used to say she wanted tariff-free access to the EU. Now it is access “as tariff-free as possible”. May said she wanted to enhance workers’ rights, not just protect them, listing as Conservative achievements the Matthew Taylor report into working practices, action on zero-hours contracts and workers’ voices on company boards. But Corbyn said if May had read Wednesday’s Telegraph, she would see that 62 Tories wanted to deregulate. Corbyn moved on to fears of a hard border in Northern Ireland, asking how May hoped to avoid this. May said the government explained that in a paper published last year. Corbyn said Johnson’s speech mentioned stag parties, carrots and a plague of boils but not Ireland. He added that we didn’t know from the government’s “road to Brexit” speeches where it was going, suggesting ministers were actually on a road to nowhere. May pointed out that Corbyn was meant to ask a question. She said she set out in a speech last week that she was unconditionally committed to the security of Europe. Somewhat incongruously she added: “He normally asks me to sign a blank cheque – and I know he likes Czechs ...” [whatever came next was obscured by the cheers/groans]. Verdict Corbyn receives a lot of criticism for his habit of avoiding Brexit at PMQs, but today’s exchanges illustrated vividly why he is so reluctant to attack May on this topic. He devoted all six of his questions to the subject but made no real headway. Worse, he achieved the rare feat of allowing May to sound half-authoritative on an issue on which her party is deeply split. There wasn’t anything particularly wrong with Corbyn’s questions. They were nicely phrased (one of them sounded a bit like a lift from my blog intro yesterday) and made good points. But Brexit is an issue where the detail is crucial, and today Corbyn’s unwillingness to ask forensic follow-up questions was a serious weakness. (Can you imagine what the late Robin Cook would have been like, tearing apart the government’s Brexit stategy from the dispatch box? After 15 minutes, it would have been in tatters.) More tellingly, Corbyn just did not sound very engaged by any of this. When he talks about housing, or the NHS, or social justice, his passion is evident. But today he came across as someone merely going through the motions, not just uninterested (a bit bored by it all), but disinterested (neutral on the key soft/hard divide) too. Memorable lines He normally asks me to sign a blank cheque – and I know he likes Czechs … May shoehorning in a dig about recent claims Corbyn met a Czechoslovakian spy in London. This government is not on the road to Brexit, it is on the road to nowhere.

She’s the prettier, straight-As, high-flying one; I dropped out of school and never found a job I was good at. She has an exceptionally successful career, but no children; I’ve been a full-time mum since having my children, who are now teenagers. But I never felt competitive towards her, there was no need as she was so lovely to me, always inviting me to things and making me feel included in her exciting, glamorous life. I’ve always looked up to her and been in awe of her – I idolised her. Some time ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had treatment and recovered remarkably quickly. But, from the moment she told me about her illness, I felt like I was talking to a different person. It felt like she was livid with me about something, often the smallest thing. She kept this side of herself hidden from everyone else; it was only when we were alone that she spoke to me in this new, furious voice. She sent me photos of the parties she’d had that I wasn’t invited to, and tried to undermine me to my husband. I couldn’t understand why she was being so mean, it felt so unlike her. Because I knew her so well, and because she was so different from before, I could tell she was trying to upset me. I still feel in shock because she has gone from being the one person I thought I could always turn to and rely on, to someone I don’t trust. I tried to talk to her about this, but she implied that I was just being oversensitive and imagining it. I’ve also tried talking to other family members, but they don’t believe me because they only ever see her being really nice to me. I’m glad your sister has made a full recovery. It’s interesting you say you never felt competitive towards her because “there was no need” – but I wonder if she felt competitive towards you, or if you do now that she’s not being so nice to you? I spoke to a cancer nursing specialist to ask if this was usual behaviour after cancer diagnosis and treatment, and he said it wasn’t, in his experience, and sounded quite extreme. So I also took this to a family psychotherapist, Sharon Bond (aft.org.uk), who is skilled at understanding family dynamics. “An event such as this,” said Bond, “can change the way you see the world and the way people relate to you. Before this happened, your sister had seen herself as lucky, and in control, so she could afford to be generous. She may now be looking at the things she doesn’t have, or can’t have. Maybe she could handle the adoration from you, but finds sympathy harder. “Your sister may also be in fear of the cancer coming back, she may not be sure how long she has to enjoy things, so she’s living her life.” This could explain the partying, although the way she is going about it is very excluding. Bond thought the photos were potentially her way of saying “this is my club”, and that maybe you have been in your own club (the mother club?) that she felt excluded from in the past. Despite the way you portray the relationship, there probably were areas of natural friction between the two of you that you did not see – or chose not to. At the moment, your sister seems to be focusing only on the differences between you, and you are in mourning for what once was. So what to do next? “At the moment,” suggested Bond, “you and your sister are not in the same place. You need to leave her to find her own way and to get there in her own time. Leave the door open for her, and recognise when she may want to come back to you.” I would not underestimate her feelings of anger and fear. They may or may not be about you, but they are focused on you for the moment – that’s not fair, but she probably feels that life hasn’t been very fair lately. I got the sense you very much needed her to explain why she is being like this. And while that’s understandable, I think you need to stop chasing round for an answer because, for whatever reason, she can’t, or won’t, give you one at the moment. Be kind, but protect yourself and seek solace in your family. I know it’s not easy, but I think, beneath it all, your sister is the same person, though one who has undergone a life-changing experience during which she felt – and maybe still feels – very out of control. What she can control is the space between you. • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com. Annalisa regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence.

The chances are that every facility is home to someone who identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT), but as the subject is still taboo among many older people, care staff are not always aware. “There’s a great deal of silence because LGBT folk tend to go back into the closet when they are in need of care,” says Lister. “They grew up in an era when to be LGBT was either criminal or sinful. If any staff have particular [anti-LGBT] faith or cultural beliefs that might impinge upon their care, they don’t want to risk that – or saying anything to their peers. It’s as if they’re wearing a paper bag over their head that masks their true identity … and it’s oppressive because they’re not being treated as a whole human being.” To address the lack of diversity awareness in care, Lister and three colleagues have taken a training play into homes and conferences since 2015. In Free to Be Me, Lister and her partner, Ann Murray, Kevin Sell (a gay man in his 50s) and Lisa Kelly (a trans woman in her 40s) explain why a care home must be LGBT-friendly, share their experiences and answer questions from staff. The training ends with staff being asked how they will put what they’ve learned into practice. Simple changes often make all the difference, says Roger Jones, executive director of older people’s services at Age Concern Central Lancashire. “Instead of asking a male resident ‘What’s your wife’s name?’, we should ask ‘Who’s the most important person in your life?’ or ‘Do you have a partner?’” Most people’s care is found by their children or family, but as an estimated 90% of LGBT people do not have children, it is crucial that social care staff can act as their advocates, says Kirsty Woodard, founder of Ageing Without Children. “If you’re in hospital and a decision is made that you need to go [into residential care], who looks for the care home?,” she says. “Who makes sure the stuff from your own house is brought along? Who explains to the manager about who you are? For LGBT people, because they’re less likely to have children, that’s a huge gap.” Age UK’s Safe to be me guide details the many things health and social care professionals can do to support older LGBT people: nominating equality champions, working with local LGBT groups, using inclusive wording and images of same-sex couples in publications, taking LGBT residents to Pride, and displaying a rainbow flag at the front door. Through its Big Lottery-funded Older and Out project, Age Concern Central Lancashire has delivered free training for those who work with older people, focusing on policies and procedures, the language people use, and the history of LGBT rights and legislation. “The training went into detail about how difficult it was for the LGBT community and why it might be hard for someone coming into the care setting,” says Gemma Willetts, experience coordinator and Older and Out champion at Belong Atherton residential village. She is one of around 1,000 care staff across Lancashire to have received the training between 2014 and 2017. “It shows how we can be much more open and proud to be who we are today, but [how] it wasn’t like that for many of the people we look after,” she says. “You understand how they may be feeling, and how we can make sure they feel safe and that we meet their needs.” After the training, staff are given a rainbow “older LGBT champion” badge, which has helped to broach the subject of diversity with residents. “We didn’t want the impact of the training to be just for the staff,” says Jones. “Of the generation we’re talking about, there’s a lot of discrimination purely because of the history. We thought that if the staff wear it around the care setting, the people who live there might say ‘Oh, I like your badge’, and then there’d be a conversation around LGBT and awareness.” The badges have proved popular with the Care Quality Commission. “When they came to inspect the care setting, the inspector would ask ‘What’s that badge about?’ and the staff would explain about the training,” says Jones. “On a few occasions, it was highlighted as good practice in the CQC’s report.” Jones is in talks with Blackpool-based organisation Horizon to replicate Manchester’s plans for an LGBT retirement home, and Lister hopes to create a DVD of Free to Be Me. The group delivers the training nationwide but many care homes can’t afford to cover its expenses and fee. “If we do a DVD and online training, it will be available to whoever wants it,” says Lister. Meanwhile, Jones’s plans to extend the Over and Out training across the country have stalled; his bid for a funding extension was turned down in January. But he hopes the success of the project will attract backers. “We can see that it’s had a massive impact on the people who live in those care settings, and on the staff who work there,” he says. “The more you talk about things, the less there is discrimination and the more there is acceptance of everybody.” Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Hundreds of KFC outlets remain closed as the fast food chain tries to recover from a disastrous start to a new delivery contract. On Tuesday night KFC said delivery drivers had been working around the clock in an effort to ensure that all the affected stores could reopen by the end of the week. DHL, the firm that took over KFC deliveries last week, has been storing all KFC chicken at a single unregistered cold storage warehouse in Rugby, the local council confirmed on Wednesday. KFC said some poultry at the depot would have to be destroyed. A spokeswoman for Rugby borough council, which is responsible for food and environmental health standards in the area, said the council had not known the building was being used to store fresh chicken until reading about it in the media. She said the council could have closed the warehouse because it companies were legally required to register cold-storage facilities. “Council inspectors visited the depot on Tuesday because they were not aware it was operating as a cold storage depot,” she said. “We could have served a remedial action notice to stop them operating until the conditional approval had been obtained, but we did not consider that this would have been in the public interest.” In a statement, the council added: “There is no requirement for the DHL cold-storage facility to be licensed, but it does need to be registered. We have now received the relevant documentation and expect to be able to approve the registration in the next few days.” A KFC spokeswoman said it was trying to minimise waste at the depot but “nothing will leave for delivery or be served at our restaurants that doesn’t meet our incredibly high standards. At this stage, we don’t know [how much chicken will be destroyed], but we are doing everything we can to avoid wastage.” Rugby council’s statement said inspectors were satisfied with DHL’s food safety processes, including temperature control, date coding, food handling and associated record-keeping. “They didn’t observe any out-of-date chicken or other foods.” The GMB union warned KFC last October that it would face supply problems when it decided to switch its deliveries from Bidvest Logistics to DHL. Mick Rix, the GMB’s national officer, said he told KFC that it could face a repeat of supply problems that had hit Burger King when it dropped Bidvest Logistics in favour of DHL six years ago. At the height of the current crisis, more than 640 KFC outlets were closed because of the shortage of chicken. The latest update showed 272 stores across the UK and Ireland remained closed on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, KFC said: “Our teams continue to work flat out all hours to clear the backlog caused by the breakdown in the DHL distribution system. “We still expect the disruption to some restaurants to continue over the remainder of the week which means some will not be open and others will operate with a reduced menu or shortened hours.” The consumer backlash against KFC prompted police to urge people in Tower Hamlets, east London, and Whitefield, Greater Manchester, not to waste officers’ time complaining about the closures. Bidvest distanced itself from the crisis, saying all the problems had occurred since DHL took over deliveries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/21/citymapper-launches-bus-taxi-hybrid-smart-ride-london-transit-app","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T11:43:51Z","webTitle":"Citymapper launches bus-taxi hybrid Smart Ride in London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/21/citymapper-launches-bus-taxi-hybrid-smart-ride-london-transit-app","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/21/citymapper-launches-bus-taxi-hybrid-smart-ride-london-transit-app","fields":{"headline":"Citymapper launches bus-taxi hybrid Smart Ride in London","bodyText":"London-based transit app Citymapper is today launching Smart Ride, a hybrid bus and taxi service that will take riders around a fixed network in the capital. The company is operating the service under a private hire licence from Transport for London, following a pair of trial “smart bus” routes in the capital. The new licence limits the firm to operating vehicles that can carry eight or fewer people, but frees it to run future routes that can change dynamically as demand shifts, rather than being legally mandated to stick to specific timetables and stopping patterns. “We believe in the future of shared transportation in cities, there is no way we’re going to solve for congestion and pollution otherwise,” Omid Ashtari, Citymapper’s president and head of business, told the Guardian. “But the regulations we see are not stacked in the favour of the bus industry to make sure that works. “We decided to take on a different service, and launch something else. So we’re launching Smart Ride. It’s a shared-first service, the only one in London.” The Smart Ride service will run eight-seater people-carriers driven by licensed private hire drivers, operating in a fixed network that spans the city. Ashtari said: “It’s a bit like a bus because it has stops, it’s a bit like a cab because you book it and it has guaranteed seats, and it’s a bit like a metro because it has a network of roads.” Citymapper had hoped to be able to offer similar flexibility with larger buses, the company said, but was ultimately stymied by London regulations that restrict the size of vehicles licensed as private hire vehicles. “Carry nine-plus people in London and you’re a bus and have to follow strict regulations on fixed routes, schedules and service frequency,” Citymapper wrote in a blogpost published on Tuesday. “Carry eight people or fewer, and you’re a private hire vehicle that can go wherever you want, however you want, how often you want.” The company clashed with London regulators over its desires taking nine months to obtain the private hire license. In the blogpost, Citmapper attributed some of TfL’s hesitation to the organisation’s previous bad experiences with Uber. It said: “The first generation of transport tech has often given cities a headache. This makes it hard for other players to engage in a meaningful manner.” Other would be transport firms with more traditional taxi models, such as Taxify and Via, have also struggled to obtain licenses from TfL. Uber is currently fighting in the courts against TfL’s decision to suspend its license on the grounds that the San Francisco-based firm was not a “fit and proper” operator. If Citymapper didn’t have the regulatory constraints imposed by TfL, Ashtari said, the company’s offering would be substantially the same – just using the previously trialled larger, more efficient vehicles that proved “flexible enough to get down small streets, unlike a larger bus”. Despite principally operating as a free transit planning app in 39 cities worldwide, Citymapper has been experimenting with being a transit provider. In May 2017, the company launched its first bus service, a free circular route in central London that ran for two days. That was followed in July by a longer-term trial route in northeast London, which Citymapper said served a need it had discovered through analysing data harvested from its app users. In September, the company launched its third “bus” trial partnering with black cab app Gett. It saw London taxis, branded as “Black Buses”, running on a semi-fixed route between north and south central London, carrying commuters between any two spots on the route for a fixed £3 fare. Taxis, Citymapper said at the time, “have spare capacity (ie multiple free seats) that could be better utilised. The hard part is matching people together. Running fixed routes is one way to solve this.” The Smart Ride launch comes as leading policymakers said cities should prepare to embrace “demand responsive transport” such as Citymapper’s into their public transport systems. Lilli Matson, strategy director at Transport for London, said TfL should be “setting the framework for companies like Ford and Citymapper to come to London: we will be confident in welcoming newcomers but they have to be ready to contribute to our objectives.” But significant legislative barriers remain, according to a report published by Arup in collaboration with the London Transport Museum which urged authorities to be open to sharing data with private firms. “Ultimately we recognise public and private entities must work together to maintain the mobility upon which our cities depend,” said Sam Mullins, director for London Transport Museum.

Conte masterminded an impressive display in the Champions League last‑16 draw against Barcelona on Tuesday, when Chelsea were the more threatening side despite the visitors’ monopoly on possession. The Chelsea manager has seemed calmer over recent weeks after months of stuttering results and (largely recruitment-based) disputes behind the scenes, and he was back to his firebrand best on the touchline. He described the performance as “almost the perfect game” but talk quickly drifted back to his future when he was interviewed by the Italian media. “In 14 years, Chelsea have changed coach 10 times, so they do have a tendency to chop and change here,” the 48‑year‑old told Mediaset Premium. “The media plays on this when the results are negative and they were already talking about me getting sacked after we lost the first game of the season to Burnley. But it’s no problem for me. In fact, I really like pressure. I just hope it doesn’t affect the players. In our line of work, we always have a bag packed. My intention is to remain here but if something were to change there would be several different scenarios opening up. “It’s no problem for me. I have said very clearly I have a contract to 2019 and I intend to respect it but anything can happen in football. I’m happy here but, to move forward with the marriage, everyone needs to be in agreement. All parties must be happy.” The Italian Football Federation has expressed an interest in reappointing Conte as Italy’s manager, though he is more likely to remain in the club game if as expected, given his tempestuous relationship with the board, he leaves Stamford Bridge early. There could be openings in the summer at Paris Saint‑Germain, Real Madrid and both Milan clubs, positions he would surely find tempting. Conte had asked Eden Hazard to play as a false No 9 against Barcelona, a role in which the Belgian has impressed at times but found difficult against top sides, before switching Hazard to the left upon the introduction of Álvaro Morata late on. “To be honest, I like the role as a false No 9 but, in games like this against a quality opposition, it’s difficult,” Hazard said. “You don’t get a lot of the ball. I think I might have touched 25 balls and 15 of them were flying towards my head. That’s not really playing to my qualities. “I’ve won some aerial duels, against [Gerard] Piqué, so I think it’s not bad. But if I had to choose, I’d prefer to play like I did in the last 10 minutes. It’s the manager who has the final word. On the wing I feel more comfortable; that’s my place. “We’re going to see how we will play in Barcelona.

The $23bn (£16.5bn) company that has one job – to sell us fried chicken – is unable to fulfil its culinary duties, citing issues in its outsourced distribution … wings. This has resulted in the temporary closure of more than two-thirds of its branches (that’s 646 of its 900 stores), while outlets that have remained open have struggled to keep up with demand. It’s left many customers feeling peckish. A business fail (fine, I’ll say it, a cock-up) of this size is more than a little unusual, especially for such an established and beloved brand. KFC has chicken in its name; this should be its area of expertise (suggested name changes include: Kentucky Fried Confusion and Kentucky Fried Could eat a horse – oh no wait, that was a different food industry scandal). Fans took to Twitter to playfully riff off the events using the #KFCCrisis hashtag, asking with tongues firmly in cheeks if there really was nothing left we could rely on. Meanwhile, some turned to MPs for intervention and even the police to report these crimes against deliciousness. KFC responded in a similar tone, saying that the Colonel was looking into the matter and that the “chicken may have crossed the road … just not into [their] stores”. On the surface, it’s a lighthearted story to pass the time and showcase our nation’s sense of humour. But here’s the zinger: KFC says the issues are caused by its new distributor, DHL (“teething problems”, the Colonel called it). The contract for this job was previously held by Bidvest, an established food distributor that had worked with the fried chicken brand for some years. GMB, the union representing Bidvest workers, said DHL won the contract because it had “undercut” the firm and was trying to fulfil the contract on the cheap. It says it even warned KFC that it risked distribution problems because of the new contract. The result: 255 job losses at Bidvest, the closure of a distribution warehouse and no chicken for anyone. This looks like just another example of the “race to the bottom” outsourcing culture that lines the pockets of corporations and does nothing for workers or consumers. And while the outsourcing ineptitude of a private company is perhaps a paltry (poultry?) comparison in light of our public services – railways, Carillion – it does make you wonder when this broken model might be revised. Why did the chicken cross the road? It didn’t. Road crossing has been outsourced to these pigeons who, we are very sorry to say, have shat on your car. • Coco Khan is a Guardian journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/28/music-patrons-proteges-kurt-cobain-kanye-west","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"I'm with the band: meet the pitiful proteges of pop music patrons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/28/music-patrons-proteges-kurt-cobain-kanye-west","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/28/music-patrons-proteges-kurt-cobain-kanye-west","fields":{"headline":"I'm with the band: meet the pitiful proteges of pop music patrons","bodyText":"Last week saw the release of the painfully bland new album by Vance Joy, one of the many proteges of Taylor Swift, who took him out as a support act on her 1989 world tour (though apparently they don’t talk any more). Swift has form for bigging up other musicians: she has championed not just Vance Joy, but Haim and Ed Sheeran (who in turn has championed Foy Vance, another singer-songwriter confusingly close in name to Vance Joy, but no relation). However, Swift’s proteges have tended to be artists already on an upward curve, already with major label deals and some success. She has not yet mastered the art of picking up on an artist no one has displayed any interest in and incessantly shouting about them, until all her fans have gone to the gigs, bought the T-shirt and discovered for themselves how dubious their hero’s judgment is. Unlike this lot… Kurt Cobain The Nirvana frontman was the patron saint of music’s lost causes. He was a man dedicated to promoting his friends, his heroes and anyone who had once released a 12” single that had sold seven copies. And those people reaped the rewards of his patronage. The fearsome noise band the Melvins got a major-label deal, with Atlantic, thanks to Cobain’s support. “You could make up a band, [and] make up a quote about them [that] Kurt Cobain said. The Melvins were the greatest example. Kurt liked the Melvins, so everybody had to go sign the Melvins,” as Janet Billig Rich of Nirvana’s management firm told NPR earlier this year. The Melvins’ three major label albums for Atlantic left the US album chart entirely untroubled, they were dropped, and it took until 2010’s The Bride Screamed Murder for them to score a chart placing – at No 200. Mind you, that label was obviously a sucker for Cobain’s taste. Eugene Kelly had been half of the enjoyably perverse Scottish indiepop also-rans the Vaselines, whom Cobain adored (and whose Jesus Doesn’t Want Me for a Sunbeam featured on Nirvana’s Unplugged album). So, naturally, he took to getting Kelly’s later band Captain America (later renamed Eugenius for blindingly obvious copyright reasons) on to his bills. And duly, Atlantic came calling for Kelly. Eugenius’s two albums for the label, Oomalama and Mary Queen of Scots were precisely as successful as you might expect from a middling indie band promoted above their abilities, and they soon split. Morrissey Being a Smiths fan in the 80s was perilous. Not because Morrissey might at any moment open his mouth and reveal himself to be a terrible human being, but because he might at any moment open his mouth and inveigle you into buying a record by a terrible band. Some were more awful than others. The Primitives were a cheerily fuzzy post-Mary Chain pop band whose chart success owed everything to cleaning themselves up with 1988 single Crash, and nothing to Morrissey banging on about them. But dear God, you got to see a certain pattern emerging in the groups he championed. For a start, they might sound not unlike the Smiths, only not as good, because they didn’t have the melodic genius of Johnny Marr (see Raymonde, fronted by Morrissey’s old friend James Maker, who sounded uncannily like his mentor). Or they might sound not unlike the Smiths and be prone to saying the unsayable, in true Moz fashion (see hard-left janglepoppers Easterhouse, who found that expressing sympathy for Soviet communism was not the surest route to chart success). You could create a fairly sizeable festival out of forgotten bands championed by Morrissey; the only question would be where on the bill to put Blackburn indie no-hopers Bradford. Michael Stipe REM fans were often more disappointed than Smiths fans after investigating the groups mentored by their favourite singer. Occasionally Stipe struck gold – he championed 10,000 Maniacs, who truly merited championing, and the Indigo Girls. He stuck up for cult acts, too, giving unstinting support to Vic Chesnutt. However, it’s entirely possible that no one would ever have heard of Hetch Hetchy had they not featured Stipe’s sister, Linda, and been produced by him. And it’s absolutely certain no one would have heard about Chickasaw Mud Puppies without Stipe’s intervention. On the one hand, REM fans were left with an awful lot of records they were unlikely to return to. On the other, much of Stipe’s support was devoted to local bands from Athens, Georgia, and it’s hard to quibble with someone making the effort to support the music scene in the town that nurtured them. Just don’t listen to the records too often. Kanye West Hip-hop has a long and rich tradition of its stars nurturing other MCs, who they help propel to commercial success (so rich is that tradition that the proteges have their own specific name: weed carriers). Kanye West exemplifies the process, having begun as a protege of Jay-Z’s, before generating his own family tree of rappers, singers and producers: John Legend, Hit-Boy, Travis Scott, Big Sean, Kid Cudi and so on. But let us recall instead the least likely of the Western endorsements. In the mid-2000s, Ben Hudson was the frontman of Mr Hudson and the Library, a wholly unremarkable band whose principal points of interest were that they employed steel pans and did a tour of libraries. This did not result in incredible commercial success, despite a major label deal: at one point you could have caught them playing a gig outside my house (which was nothing to do with me, though it did leave me with a continuing aversion to his music). And then Kanye West heard him, and signed him to his GOOD Music imprint. Suddenly Mr Hudson went from touring the UK’s libraries to composing on 808s and Heartbreak, working with Jay-Z, and Future and Miley Cyrus, and becoming a successful songwriter for hire. His solo career continues, too, yet the world remains stubbornly uninterested. Paul Weller Simply talking up his favourite artists wasn’t enough for Paul Weller. Instead, he fancied himself a new Berry Gordy, and as the Jam drew to a close, he set up his own imprint for his preferred soul/mod sound, Respond Records. Weller offered his services as songwriter, producer and guitarist (under the pseudonym Jake Fluckery). There were some minor hits along the way, including Tracie, signed after responding to an ad in Smash Hits seeking a singer for the Questions. She sang backing vocals on the Jam’s final single, Beat Surrender, and then with the Style Council before her solo debut, The House That Jack Built, reached the Top 10. Julie Hadwen and Tony Burke responded to the same ad, were introduced by Weller – and then duly left Respond to have a hit with This House (Is Where Our Love Stands). As for the rest of the Respond roster – whither ND Moffatt? Or A Craze? Or Meff? More than any other set of proteges, the story of Respond proves that someone’s fans will buy on a recommendation once, but their loyalty stretches only so far.

We hear it played in celebration, when new life begins and vows are made, and also at the end, in requiem for the dead. Little wonder, then, that gothic composers such as Sweden’s Anna von Hausswolff find themselves drawn to its power. The Gothenburg-born musician has made the organ her primary tool in recent years, yoking its eerie timbre to a thrilling weave of drone and metal-inspired “funeral pop”. She’s been tight-lipped around the circumstances that have shaped her fourth album (and the first with the producer and SunO))) collaborator Randall Dunn). But given the brutally bleak poem by the late Swedish writer Walter Ljungquist she has cited in press materials, it’s safe to say this artist’s preoccupation with mortality is undisturbed, writ large across this ambitious five-song opus. If 2015’s The Miraculous had tunes, Dead Magic has dirges – cosmic, proggish epics recorded on a 20th-century pipe organ at Marmorkirken, Copenhagen’s marble rococo church. There’s a twinkling sensuality on opener The Truth, the Glow, the Fall, with its suspended crescendo of dancing strings and hopeful, fraying vocals. But all that warmth is quick to dissipate come the bitter high-noon drag of The Mysterious Vanishing of Electra and the wild, malevolent incantation of the album’s tectonic centrepiece, the 17-minute Ugly and Vengeful. A supernatural soprano has earned Von Hausswolff frequent (and not unjust) comparisons to Kate Bush. Dead Magic sees her shaking off those parallels, stretching from honeyed laments to hex-breaking wails and alien ululations that feel entirely her own. There’s growth in these songs of death. Dead Magic is Von Hausswolff’s darkest, most ambitious record to date, a cycle that begins in warmth and ends heavy with grief via Källans återuppståndelse, a weightless song of quiet devastation set with strings and unmoored from percussion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/22/poorer-britons-income-stagnation-resolution-foundation-report","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T06:01:09Z","webTitle":"Poorer Britons face three years of income stagnation, says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/22/poorer-britons-income-stagnation-resolution-foundation-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/22/poorer-britons-income-stagnation-resolution-foundation-report","fields":{"headline":"Poorer Britons face three years of income stagnation, says report","bodyText":"Britain is at risk of the first sustained rise in inequality since the late 1980s as poorer families face three years of stagnating incomes, according to the Resolution Foundation. The thinktank warned that government cuts to working-age benefits were damaging prospects for 8 million low and middle-income households, as the rollout of £14bn of welfare reductions offsets the gains from policies such as the “national living wage”. The foundation’s latest annual report on the outlook for living standards said although higher-income households were likely to experience an increase, income growth would be weak, partly because interest rate rises over the next few years are expected to dampen disposable income growth for homeowners. Torsten Bell, the thinktank’s director, said: “This parliament risks seeing the first sustained rise in income inequality since the 1980s. “But the story this time around is less about the rich soaring further away, and more about poorer families falling further behind as they bear the brunt of £14bn of welfare cuts. “Lots of factors lie behind projections of a parliament of weak income growth, many of which are beyond the government’s immediate control. But it is policy decisions, not capitalism, which look set to drive living standards of low and middle-income families down and inequality up in the years ahead.” The foundation has forecast that following a fall in real incomes in the current financial year, as inflation outpaces wage growth, median incomes will start to rise again next year as inflationary pressures ease and pay growth picks up. However, increases are expected to be weak, peaking at 1.3% by the end of this parliament, well below the 2.1% average rate of household income growth before the financial crisis. Adam Corlett, a senior economic analyst at the foundation, said: “2017 was a disastrous year for living standards, as high inflation caused pay packets to shrink and made the cash freeze in working-age benefits bite harder. “The good news is that living standards are set to start rising again next year. The disappointing news is that the recovery is set to be slow. And the really worrying news is that low and middle-income households could miss out altogether, with three years of stagnating incomes running right through to 2020.” The financial crisis took a heavy toll on UK living standards, as prices roses faster than wages in the six years from 2008. After brief respite in 2015 and 2016, falling real pay returned in 2017 as the sharp drop in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote drove up the cost of imported goods and fed through to higher inflation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/22/quincy-jones-greatest-ever-moments-ranked","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T11:45:21Z","webTitle":"Quincy Jones's greatest ever moments – ranked!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/22/quincy-jones-greatest-ever-moments-ranked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/feb/22/quincy-jones-greatest-ever-moments-ranked","fields":{"headline":"Quincy Jones's greatest ever moments – ranked!","bodyText":"10. Quincy Jones Has a Story About That (2018) Chris Heath’s 10,000-word profile of Jones is as extraordinary an interview as you’re likely to read this year. At 84, clearly too old to give a damn what anyone thinks, Jones dishes on everyone from the Pope to Marilyn Monroe, from a childhood that involved eating rats to Ray Charles shooting heroin into his own testicles. 9. Miles and Quincy Live at Montreux (1993) Taped three months before his death, Miles Davis’s final live recording isn’t his greatest – although there’s something eerie and haunting about the fragility of his playing – but it’s testament to Jones’s apparently limitless powers of persuasion: only he could convince the ornery Davis to revisit his mid-60s material one last time. 8. The Quintessence (1962) The sound of Jones operating in pure jazz mode, fronting a modern big band in December 1961. Concise and fat-free, The Quintessence throws up eight tracks in half an hour: Jones’s originals are coolly sophisticated, but the best thing here might be a frantic, dexterous charge at Thelonious Monk’s Straight No Chaser, over in 180 seconds. 7. Lesley Gore – It’s My Party (1963) If you’re looking for the roots of Thriller’s vast crossover success, perhaps you should start with Jones’s first US No 1 as a producer. A white teen pop single a world away from his previous work as a jazz man and big-band arranger for Ray Charles, its success was fuelled by a certain killer instinct: Phil Spector had also recorded the song with the Crystals, but Jones found out and beat him to the draw. 6. ‘The Beatles were the worst musicians in the world’ (2018) As if to prove Heath’s profile was no fluke, days later another interview with Jones appeared, this time on the website Vulture. Cue more astonishing gossip, not least about Marlon Brando’s sex life, fruity opinions about the Beatles and Michael Jackson, and ample evidence that in addition to his other achievements, Jones may be music’s greatest raconteur. 5. In Cold Blood (1967) Jones had to face down the racism of In Cold Blood’s author, Truman Capote, who lobbied to have him removed from the film because he was black. Capote’s bid failed, and Jones delivered his most extreme soundtrack work: dark, mournful, harrowing and frequently atonal. It garnered Jones one of two Oscar nominations in 1967: the first African-American to be nominated twice in one year. 4. Smackwater Jack (1971) 1973’s You’ve Got It Bad Girl has his sublime take on the Lovin’ Spoonful’s Summer in the City, but Smackwater Jack is the pick of Jones’s early 70s albums, a daring, purist-enraging, oft-sampled melding of jazz, funk and soundtrack work, where blues guitar epics sit alongside TV themes and a gorgeous 10-minute version of Marvin Gaye’s What’s Goin’ On. 3. Frank Sinatra – Sinatra at the Sands (1966) The greatest of Jones’s collaborations with Sinatra and the apotheosis of the latter’s Vegas years. Jones conducts and arranges the Count Basie Orchestra; Sinatra offers definitive readings of his signature songs and the mind boggles at what the pair got up to afterwards. “Seven double Jack Daniel’s in an hour … [Sinatra] invented partying,” Jones recently recalled. 2. The Dude (1981) Jones’s polymath skills in full effect: effortlessly slick production, arrangements that straddle R&amp;B and pop while still haunted by jazz; restless music taste evident in its nods to rap and new wave (Ai No Corrida was written by former Blockhead Chaz Jankel); and his remarkable address book – the supporting cast features Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Herbie Hancock. 1. Michael Jackson – Off the Wall/Thriller/Bad (1979-1987) Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad are indisputably Michael Jackson albums, not Quincy Jones albums with Michael Jackson performing on them. But no one other than Quincy Jones was capable of empowering Jackson’s astonishing talent to soar so high. One apocryphal rumour has Jones coaching Jackson’s vocals by kicking him and shouting “No squeaks, motherfucker!” Certainly, his fingerprints are all over these albums, from the mournful jazz brass line on Billie Jean to the presence of organist Jimmy Smith on Bad. Moreover, he had the team – including songwriter Rod Temperton – and the experience to bring Jackson’s dream of vast, genre-defying success to reality. It was Jones who suggested Thriller needed “a black version of a strong rock’n’roll thing”, hence Beat It. Collectively, they changed pop music for ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/feb/22/table-tennis-trickery-bobby-moore-on-street-football-and-showboating","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T10:15:14Z","webTitle":"Table tennis trickery, Bobby Moore on street football and showboating | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/22/table-tennis-trickery-bobby-moore-on-street-football-and-showboating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/22/table-tennis-trickery-bobby-moore-on-street-football-and-showboating","fields":{"headline":"Table tennis trickery, Bobby Moore on street football and showboating","bodyText":"1) It is the League Cup final on Sunday.

The incidents, including an attack on one of the leaders of the far-right group Forza Nuova in Palermo on Wednesday morning, are reminiscent of a far more violent era in Italy – the so-called Years of Lead that began in the late 1960s when the country suffered a wave of domestic terrorism by forces on the extreme left and right. The mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, condemned the attack on Massimo Ursino, who was bound with tape and beaten by a gang of leftwing extremists in the Sicilian capital. Orlando said the attack, which occurred as Forza Nuova’s national head was preparing a visit to Palermo this weekend, was a sign of the “shameful and disgraceful” state of politics in Italy. He also condemned the violence perpetrated by extreme right groups, but said: “We can’t beat fascism with violence. We can’t beat fascism with fascist behaviour.’’ The leftwing attackers - who wore balaclavas, filmed their attack and sent it to media outlets – defended the violence. In a statement, they accused men such as Ursino of spreading hate and racism across Italy. “We tied him up and beat him to show that Palermo is antifascist and there is no place for men like him here,’’ they said. Ursino was taken to hospital with injuries to his head and face, but was released on Thursday. Raffaele Marchetti, a national security expert at Luiss University in Rome, said such beatings and fights were common in the 1970s but had largely disappeared. Now, however, they seem to be making a comeback. He pointed to a recent assessment presented to the Italian parliament by the country’s intelligence services, which said the rise in extremism, especially on the right, was a threat to national security. “Clearly, ahead of the election, there is a situation of tension and people feel more confident to go to one extreme or another,” he said. The attack on Ursino followed a high-profile attack against six migrants in the town of Macerata, who were shot and injured by a far-right extremist with an Italian flag draped around his neck. The election campaign has also been marked by ugly acts of harassment and racism. More than a dozen activists were reported to police after Giorgia Meloni, a candidate with the far-right Brothers of Italy party, was verbally insulted and spat at during a campaign rally in Livorno. Another incident in January involving a doctor in the city of Cantù made headlines after a patient refused to be examined by him because he was black. Dr Andi Nganso, who was born in Cameroon and has lived in Italy for 12 years, wrote on his Facebook page that a patient refused to be treated “by a negro”. He joked about the episode, but also acknowledged that it had “knocked me back”. In the Umbrian town of Soleto, a priest who has often spoken out against racism and in defence of migrants was believed to have been the target of intimidation by far-right activists after his rectory and home were ransacked. Father Gianfranco Formenton, a parish priest at Sant’Angelo in Mercole, had strongly condemned the Macerata shooting. “I live alone and in quite an isolated area,” he told the newspaper Il Messaggero. “But I will continue to live here as well as carry out my mission without stepping back.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/21/carillion-was-in-trouble-by-mid-2016-says-whistleblower","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T00:09:09Z","webTitle":"Carillion was in trouble by mid-2016, says whistleblower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/21/carillion-was-in-trouble-by-mid-2016-says-whistleblower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/21/carillion-was-in-trouble-by-mid-2016-says-whistleblower","fields":{"headline":"Carillion was in trouble by mid-2016, says whistleblower","bodyText":"Carillion was in serious financial difficulty by the middle of 2016 but directors were “placating the City” by failing to disclose major problems, according to a former executive at the collapsed government contractor. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an executive who spent more than 20 years with the company lifted the lid on a corporate culture in which “nobody wanted to give bad news”. “Anyone in the business knew there were major problems, even middle managers,” the former Carillion executive told the Guardian. “The supply chain wasn’t being paid, money was getting transferred [between different parts of the group] to pay salaries, loans were coming in from the UK to the whole of the Middle East. By mid-2016 we were already seeing these problems.” He added: “The philosophy was that it would be all right on the night and it got to a point where people wouldn’t listen to you if you weren’t on message.” The latest revelations came on the eve of a parliamentary evidence session at which MPs conducting an inquiry into Carillion will question representatives of the firm’s auditor, KPMG, about why the accountancy group did not spot the company’s financial problems sooner. In testimony before MPs on two select committees this month, former Carillion chief executive Richard Howson has said Carillion’s problems crystallised after KPMG reviewed its contracts in spring 2017, leading to writedowns of £845m and a profit warning that began the company’s death spiral. But the former Carillion executive, who has spent most of his career with the company, said major problems were apparent long before that but were kept “on the back burner”. “For them [directors] to say it all happened in April and May 2017 when the world changed … it’s absolute nonsense.” “[The writedowns] were all lurking and developing, they had even crystallised, but nobody was accepting it. There was no cash.” The Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, is investigating the “timeliness and content” of Carillion’s stock market announcements between 7 December 2016 and 10 July 2017, a period that includes its annual results for 2016. The former Carillion executive said he believed that these results painted an unrealistic picture of the company’s financial health. “All we were doing was placating the City all the time, saying it was all OK, keeping the share price up.” “The hedge funds didn’t believe it, they were all over it,” he added, a reference to major bets taken by investment firms that were short-selling Carillion, effectively placing bets that its share price would fall. He said he considered becoming a whistleblower by flagging up his concerns with a non-executive member of the board but was concerned at what result this might have. The source also disputed Howson’s argument that a major factor in Carillion’s demise was its inability to collect a £200m debt owed by Qatari client Msheireb for work redeveloping the country’s capital, Doha, ahead of the World Cup 2022. Howson has previously said he “felt like a bailiff” when trying to collect the debt. “The reality is that there was a big dispute and these things happen,” said the source. “Just because you fly out and ask for money, doesn’t mean you’re entitled to it. You can only be a bailiff if the money is owed, not if you feel it’s owed.” Msheireb, a property company which has already denied allegations by former Carillion directors, said Howson’s claims were “misleading and inaccurate”, adding that they had provided supporting evidence to the business select committee. “Msheireb Properties is deeply saddened that Carillion collapsed affecting so many employees, pensioners, subcontractors and projects in the United Kingdom and around the world,” it said. “However, the attempt by current and former executives of Carillion to pass the blame to others, including Msheireb Properties, was deeply troubling and inaccurate.” The company added that it was “currently exploring all legal options”. Fresh revelations about Carillion’s collapse came as MPs released evidence showing that problems with the Royal Liverpool University Hospital were discovered nine months before the company took a writedown related to the project. Frank Field, the work and pension committee chair, said the discovery of cracked beams, which delayed the project, were “a perfect parable for the whole company: the cracks were visible long before the directors or auditors admit”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/23/troll-steven-poole-word-of-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"What's the difference between a troll and a sockpuppet?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/23/troll-steven-poole-word-of-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/23/troll-steven-poole-word-of-week","fields":{"headline":"What's the difference between a troll and a sockpuppet?","bodyText":"The latest in the story of Russian meddling in last year’s US election is that the Russians ran a “troll factory”, which is not a manufacturing centre gearing up to produce heartwarmingly ugly dolls for children’s Christmas presents.

Trolling is a method of fishing, the “troll” being the lure, and so from the 1990s online “trolls” were people who antagonised others in the hope of getting an angry reaction. This usage is possibly also influenced, the OED notes, by the troll in Scandinavian mythology, a small creature that lives underground, in its parents’ basement for example. Social media is troll paradise, of course, but is “troll” quite the right word for our Russian friends? The more accurate term would be “sockpuppet”, a fictional identity created to bolster some point of view. Trolls, on the other hand, are often happy to use their real names, eg Donald Trump.

The actor, whose undignified exit from Breaking Bad had left a world jonesing for her, is quite the performer; not an ounce of sentimentality or shop-bought softness. In her role as superhero Jones, she is the private detective with all the flaws one should have: broken office door-glass; a whisky habit conceived by someone with absolutely no experience of trying to drink throughout the working day; a crummy, shoestring lifestyle despite constantly being handed fists of money; and a deadly enemy in the shape of malevolent mind controller Kilgrave (David Tennant). Jones has superpowers; quite poorly defined ones that mainly involve throwing people, although she often falls, in a Buzz Lightyear fashion (“That wasn’t flying, that was falling with style”). Emotionally, she is held in suspended animation by her PTSD, which was triggered by a series of harrowing events contributing to her traumatic backstory. She is caught in the eye of a three-way storm: the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Kilgrave; the car crash that killed her entire family; and the institutional violence that somehow bestowed superpowers upon her while she was in a coma (“horrific” experiments took place on Jones, the nature of which are still opaque, but hospital doors give her the most awful flashbacks). Kilgrave’s abuse (she was his sex slave) left her with more than ambient trauma; it hollowed out her belief in her own power as a force for good. In Jessica Jones, the past never passes, just crashes back into the present, in flashbacks, in parallel cases she undertakes to investigate, and now – in the second series – in the queasy expectation of the victim, that she be the town crier of her own experience, for the prevention of future crimes. The second season also arrives post #MeToo, like an answer to questions that were unvoiced when it first came out. What does sexual assault mean, and what does it do? Why does it leave the wrong person ashamed and everybody silent? A bit of quickfire dialogue – “I don’t take ‘no’ for an answer,” says a new villain who wants to take over her business; “How rapey,” Jones replies – marks out the new terrain, where the things that have always been said crash headlong into the things that are never said. Yet – never mind even the chronology of the filming – this is no opportunistic female-empowerment yarn. “It’s a coincidence, that it comes out just as we’re all talking about abuse,” Ritter tells me over the phone. “Me Too was only a couple of months ago, we were already done shooting by then. I think what the movement has done, it’s made women so reactive and so emotional. You read the stories and you do an inventory of your own life. So everyone has been triggered or poked at. Which I think is awesome. It’s a crazy coincidence because that’s what our show does as well.” The show is ensconced in a noir atmosphere – a feeling prompted by the sense Jessica Jones is so close to the hero that nearly but never was: she is the female Humphrey Bogart. The hard-boiled subgenre of noir was getting very near gender parity, with Nick and Nora Charles in The Thin Man, a man and a woman as wise-cracking and hard-drinking as one another. But then the 1950s happened and the moment passed. Scroll forward 65 years and, even post-Wonder Woman, female physical strength and mental verve have the vividness of the unfamiliar. Yet there is one trope more unusual still: the strong victim. As a dramatic construct, the victim functions as a frame and counterpoint to the hero. But in the case of Jessica Jones she is both victim and hero. Despite the fact we repeatedly see examples of Jones’s weakness against Kilgrave and a backstory that reveals rape and forced murder, she is not the damsel in distress but the knight. It is well-known Jessica Jones lore that the production team is predominantly female. One exec, Liz Friedman, wrote A Feminist and Class-Based Analysis of Slasher Films for her graduate thesis. “It is a very supportive environment,” says Ritter. “There’s no ego, there’s no infighting, which is important, because I can go into darker places if I feel safe to be vulnerable.” In this environment the show remodels the victim narrative, and asks the question: how do we define what rape is? Last season, in a psychedelic amplification of a courtroom cross-questioning (“Yet the complainant had previously had dinner with the accused, your honour …”), Kilgrave and Jones had a showdown over what mind-control meant. “We used to do a lot more than just touch hands,” he says. “Yeah. It’s called rape,” she replies. “Which part of staying in five-star hotels, eating at all the best places, doing whatever the hell you wanted, is rape?” he persists. “The part where I didn’t want to do any of it! Not only did you physically rape me, but you violated every cell in my body and every thought in my goddamn head.” A realm where mind control exists can crack open a conversation about violation in terms where the subtle doesn’t undermine the literal, where the spirit is as real as the flesh. Even at the level of the premise, the show made a statement about rape that is fundamental, seldom made and hard to render more boldly than with a superhero. Serious voices on the subject often cite the muting effect that violation has on women, stretching past the event so that their power is quelled for years afterwards. Nobody violent needs an academic to tell them this, which is why rape is such a timeless and prevalent war crime. But the world at large probably needs to be told, and what could be plainer than a woman with superpowers literally eschewing their full potential and going freelance to get away from her trauma? “Real women on the street came up to me in tears because this was the first time they felt represented by the lead; it made them feel so much better about their own traumas,” Ritter says. “Even hearing women saying they were excited to see a badass female character was great: people responded to her in such a huge way.” Having covered so much ground, in its second season the show winkles into the knottier areas of the feminist dilemma. Jessica Jones always had a scratchy relationship with her sometime employer Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Anne Moss) and in the second season, Hogarth has gone full Sheryl Sandberg but distills no feminist ideal. Her feminism stretches no further than the coincidence of wanting what she wants, while simultaneously being female. Indeed, without wanting to give anything away, she is the opposite of sisterly, operating to a rule book that more or less demands she make an enemy of anyone whom she cannot use instrumentally. It is another interesting route, into a conversation that is so murky it’s generally easier not to have: is the cooperative more feminist than the competitive? To Jessica Jones, those external struggles are ancillary to the question of her PTSD – whether or not she has a responsibility to open the door further to the traumas of her past, or whether doing so will make concrete what she suspects: that she has been brutalised by her past and become a monster that only wilful ignorance will contain. It is a rarely discussed element of the trauma story: part of silence is that to say anything makes you inherently implausible, yet once you are believed you have a responsibility to yourself and the world to delve as deeply as possible, speak as much as possible. It’s the Rose McGowan bind: an ounce of bravery is never enough. You have to have all the bravery in the world, and then it turns out that you’ve said too much. Here the Humphrey Bogart reticence works beautifully, catching all her avoidance in a caustic self-awareness, while underscoring the harsh truth that post-traumatic stress, like depression, is subject to endless scrutiny about its legitimacy, yet costs the sufferer so much more to explore than it does the casual observer who demands its exploration. There are so many capital-I issues here that it’s amazing it still functions as drama, but it does. You know … Krysten Ritter … being able to throw people, and also kind-of fly.

The strands are thought to have been given to the book’s owner by the son of Alexander Hamilton, the first US secretary of the Treasury immortalised in the hit musical that bears his name. Archivist Daniel Michelson found the copy of Gaines Universal Register or American and British Kalendar for the year 1793 while digging through the oldest books held in the Schaffer Library, part of Union College in Schenectady, New York. Within the covers of the book, which is believed to have belonged to Philip Schuyler, son of one of Union College’s founders, General Philip Schuyler, he discovered a series of Philip Schuyler’s handwritten notes on topics including how to “preserve beef for summer’s use”. But when librarian John Myers examined the almanac further, he discovered what the college described as a “slender yellowed envelope”, containing “several strands of grey or whitening hair, neatly tied together by a single thread”. Written on the envelope were the lines: “Washington’s hair, L.S.S. &amp; (scratched out) GBS from James A. Hamilton given him by his mother, Aug. 10, 1871.” James Alexander Hamilton was the third son of Alexander and Eliza Schuyler Hamilton – the general’s daughter – who themselves were close to George and Martha Washington. Washington died in 1799. “In an era when people frequently exchanged hair as a keepsake, it’s quite probable that Martha had given Eliza some of George’s hair, which in turn was given to their son, James, who later distributed it, strand by strand, as a precious memento to close friends and family members,” said the scholar Susan Holloway Scott, author of the historical novel I, Eliza Hamilton. Although the hair has not been DNA tested, the manuscripts dealer John Reznikoff, who has a Guinness world record for the “largest collection of hair from historical figures”, told the college: “Without DNA, you’re never positive, but I believe it’s 100% authentic.” He speculated that the strands might be worth “maybe $2,000 to $3,000” (£1,400-£2,100). The library’s head of special collections and archives, India Spartz, called the find “a very significant treasure” and “a tremendous testament to history”. “As an archivist, we come across interesting material all of the time,” she said. “But this is such a treasure for the campus.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/21/brexit-transition-period-open-ended-uk-eu-position-paper","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T16:52:13Z","webTitle":"No 10 says Brexit transition period will not be open-ended","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/21/brexit-transition-period-open-ended-uk-eu-position-paper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/21/brexit-transition-period-open-ended-uk-eu-position-paper","fields":{"headline":"No 10 says Brexit transition period will not be open-ended","bodyText":"Downing Street has insisted there will be a firm end-date to the Brexit transition period, after a leaked document revealed the British government is challenging the EU’s 21-month limit and proposing that the UK stays in the single market and customs union as long as is necessary. The government moved to avoid inflaming tensions with its pro-Brexit backbenchers, by dismissing the idea that a transition deal, which the government hopes to strike within the next few weeks, would be open-ended. “There will be an end-date included in the agreement,” a Downing Street spokesman said. A cabinet minister told the Guardian any suggestion otherwise was “just paranoid or wishful thinking”. The intervention came after a Whitehall position paper shared with EU member states on Wednesday appeared to leave open the possibility of an open-ended transition. “The UK believes the period’s duration should be determined simply by how long it will take to prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin the future relationship,” the draft paper said.“The UK agrees this points to a period of around two years, but wishes to discuss with the EU the assessment that supports its proposed end date”. The EU had said that the transition period should end 21 months after Brexit day on 29 March 2019. During that period the UK will effectively remain a member of the single market and the customs union under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, but without any say in the EU’s rules. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has claimed that 31 December 2020 is the most practical end date for the transition as it would dovetail with the end of the bloc’s seven-year budget and avoid the opening up of discussions on payments in addition to the UK’s £35-£39bn divorce settlement. UK officials are insisting, however, that further talks are needed. They expect to finalise a non-extendable end date by the time of a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels at the end of March. Earlier this month, Barnier told MEPs in Strasbourg that he believed the UK did not want to formally request a longer transition period because it was too politically toxic for the prime minister to open up debate at home on how much more Britain would need to pay. The government is under pressure to give UK businesses as much time as possible to prepare for Brexit. When the the prime minister suggested in her Florence house speech that the transition between Brexit and a the future trading relationship would last “about two years”, the CBI lobbied Downing Street to keep the door open to a longer period of adaptation. The UK position document, leaked in Brussels ahead of it being formally presented to the House of Commons, nevertheless suggests that on the terms of the transition period the positions of the UK and the EU are broadly in line. Beyond the end date, there remain substantive differences, however. The paper demands a right during the transition period for the UK to rewrite the fishing quotas that apply to its fleet under the common fisheries policy, a move that will face resistance in Brussels. Rather than include a “punishment clause” in any agreement, through which the UK could be sanctioned for infringing the terms of the transition, the UK’s document says a joint committee should be established to ensure problems that arise are dealt with “in good faith” by both sides. The UK is concerned about new laws that could do economic harm and wish to have a legal mechanism to resist such a scenario. Downing Street also wants the right to opt in to future justice and home affairs policies and is questioning the EU’s insistence that sensitive information will not be shared with the UK as it is today. The document does not make any demands over the rights of citizens who arrive during the transition period. However, speaking after prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the prime minister’s spokesman reiterated that the government would not cave in to demands from the European commission, that EU citizens arriving during the transition period be granted the same rights as those already here. “The people arriving after March 2019 arrive in different circumstances to people arriving before and can expect their rights to be different,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/feb/22/reading-progress-halts-when-students-reach-secondary-school","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T00:00:02Z","webTitle":"Progress in reading stalls at secondary school.

It should be a priority","bodyText":"In his first major interview since being appointed education secretary, Damian Hinds set out his vision for the future schools. Raising school standards, teacher retention and school budgets are rightly top of his to-do list. But a new report has uncovered another challenge brewing in our classrooms. We have a persistent problem encouraging secondary school pupils to read challenging and age-appropriate books. The tenth annual What Kids Are Reading Report, which analysed the reading habits of almost one million school pupils from 4,364 schools that use the Accelerated Reader assessment programme, found that this is true across Britain and Ireland. The report revealed that progress made by pupils in primary school halts when they transfer to secondary school and, from then on, the gap between students’ reading ability and their age grows wider each year. Worryingly, by the later years of secondary school many students are reading books that are no harder than those in primary school. Sociological and biological factors will no doubt play a part, and many young book lovers will find their attention wandering elsewhere once they hit puberty. But there is also a more obvious factor with a more straightforward solution: reading time. The majority of primary schools place an emphasis on developing pupils’ literacy skills, but this is rarely continued into secondary school. Reading, like any skill, needs to be practised or it will slip. With this in mind, all secondary school students would benefit from having 15 to 30 minutes of dedicated reading time built into the school day. Of course, teachers are already under immense pressure to ensure the curriculum meets a range of competing demands. But good literacy is the single most important educational building block from which all other learning follows. We need to recognise that literacy is not just important for the English teacher but matters for geography, science and maths. Once we realise this, it perhaps seems less of a challenge to fit more dedicated reading time into a week. Advances in technology and increasingly sophisticated and responsive “edtech” programmes may also help. However, finding the time to read is only part of the solution. The report also found that secondary school students read fewer books than those in primary school. This would be expected if the books were more difficult, but this is not the case. By pushing themselves to read more challenging books, pupils develop the brain and improve their literacy. Schools should therefore be steering children towards reading a greater number of suitable books for their age. Of course, balancing challenge with enjoyment can be difficult and it is important to be realistic about what teenagers will read. Indeed, The National Literacy Trust’s Read On Get On report identified the lack of reading enjoyment as a fundamental hurdle to advancing literacy skills nationwide. But finding books of interest does not need to mean dumbing down. This year, Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai’s book I Am Malala proved a surprising success among 11- and 12-year-olds. While it has an important message, the text is also suitably challenging and age appropriate. The new education secretary has a number of competing tasks in his in-tray, but few can be as important as the scale of the literacy challenge faced in our secondary schools. A small amount of time for reading suitably challenging books would make a real difference, but we need the will to make it happen.

But that is the problem with great tactical plans: they always rely, ultimately, on that most fallible of species: humans. Lionel Messi’s equaliser has tipped the tie Barcelona’s way, but Chelsea can draw great encouragement from the first leg and, having operated like the away side, can play the second in much the same way (another reason, incidentally, why the away goals rules should be scrapped: the way a team set up these days is far more conditioned by resources than where the match is played). This is not the fluent, relentless Barcelona of the Pep Guardiola years. It is not the outstanding improvisational forward line of the Luis Enrique period. It is something far less expansive – Barça have conceded only 11 goals in 24 league games this season – and a little slow. The jibes about an over-dependence on Messi may even, in a creative sense, be halfway to being true now. Jordi Alba has been hugely important to Barça this season, pounding up the left flank to offer width as Iniesta plays narrow in the asymmetric 4-4-2 Ernesto Valverde has come to favour. The full-back is sixth in the list of top assist-makers in La Liga, his link-up with Messi a regular feature. But against Chelsea Alba did not make a single key pass and put in only three crosses. Although he was on the ball regularly he did not have it in dangerous areas. Chelsea stifled him. He had 110 touches, roughly as many as Sergi Roberto and Iniesta, significantly fewer than only Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic and twice as many as any Chelsea player other than Victor Moses, who had 58. In part that was a result of Chelsea sitting deep after a frenetic early press and denying the full-back space to run into behind their backline but that is hardly a situation Barça are unused to facing. More specifically it was to do with Moses. It is no coincidence he touched the ball more than any other Chelsea player, driving Alba back not just through diligent closing but also with the threat of his partnership with Pedro. Conte’s biggest selection decision was to select Eden Hazard as a false nine, rather than using Olivier Giroud or Álvaro Morata as a more orthodox centre-forward. That did, perhaps, deny Chelsea an easy outlet and there were times, in the first half especially, when it seemed they could not get out of their half and might be overwhelmed. But the positive was it gave them pace and flexibility when they broke. That is a major concern for Barcelona who at times were made to look flatfooted and pedestrian. Busquets has enjoyed something of a return to form this season but the weaknesses exposed against Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus a year ago were on show again. He was never quick – his great strengths are his reading of the game and his capacity to play within himself – but his lack of mobility must be a major worry. Willian’s switch on to his right foot before his first shot against the post is perhaps, like Arjen Robben cutting on to his left, one of those moves that is both predictable and almost impossible to stop, yet the amount of room Willian generated with one step inside was startling. Busquets might argue, with some justification, that before the second shot against the post he had reason to expect Barça not to squander possession in the right-back area but there was something symbolic, poignant even, about his vain scrambled attempt to get back. Wherever the fault lay in that instance, or for the goal as Willian was left untended at the edge of the box, the basic fact is no opposing player should be allowed time to line up a shot on goal from a central position 25 yards out, never mind three times in the space of about half an hour. Equally concerning for Valverde must be the times Chelsea broke in the centre with one player, usually Willian, surging with the ball behind the midfield line at an exposed defence. What is a little baffling is the switch to 4-4-2 should, in theory, have added an extra player into just that zone. Something in the relationship between Busquets and Rakitic, perhaps, is a little awry. Chelsea had 27% possession, one percentage point less than they had in the first leg against Barcelona in the 2012 semi-final, yet the games were very different. Back then, Chelsea were under siege for the majority of the game, clinging on, resisting, grateful for any release of pressure. On Tuesday they were probably the better side and certainly had more clear-cut opportunities to score. They go to the second leg as outsiders but in the knowledge this Barcelona are not to be feared in the way past iterations were and that, impressive as their defensive record is, there were times when they looked distinctly vulnerable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/21/sade-new-music-film-wrinkle-in-time-ava-duvernay","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T11:43:06Z","webTitle":"Sade to release first new music in eight years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/21/sade-new-music-film-wrinkle-in-time-ava-duvernay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/21/sade-new-music-film-wrinkle-in-time-ava-duvernay","fields":{"headline":"Sade to release first new music in eight years","bodyText":"Sade has recorded a new original song for the upcoming film adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time.

It has become a disappointing season for the zippy seven-year-old, who hasn’t finished a race with his jockey aboard since November, and he’s 16-1 for the Arkle at next month’s Cheltenham Festival, but his trainer is keeping the faith. “Nothing’s gone right,” Henderson said, with particular reference to the Henry VIIIth at Sandown in December, when Brain Power’s pace set the race up for Sceau Royal while he eventually unseated David Mullins at the last. “We did not want to make the running at Sandown and that was a bit of a disaster, to be honest with you.” Mullins used to be the regular jockey on Michael Buckley’s horses with Henderson but those riding duties have since passed to Nico de Boinville and I don’t imagine that’s a coincidence.

Henderson blames that on the emergence of a breathing problem as the horse turned out of Swinley Bottom. Brain Power’s palate has since been cauterised. On a better surface at Cheltenham, he could easily be a force once more. Henderson praised him as “seriously talented”, while conceding that he can be “fragile” and blew any chance in the last Champion Hurdle by being too keen in the early stages. “You’ve got to drop him in, go to sleep. Paul Carberry would have been a good man for him.” If De Boinville can get him to settle in the early stages of the Arkle, Brain Power has it in him to get in the argument. It’s a hot Arkle, thanks to Footpad and Petit Mouchoir, but I remember how the time experts were cooing over Brain Power after he bolted up in Ascot’s big handicap hurdle 14 months ago under a big weight. I imagine the 16-1 will not last for the next fortnight. Apparently, there was some early 25-1 about today’s nap, Work Du Breteau (2.50) but that was a mistake by whoever offered it and it has long gone. Still, 9-1 looks big to me about this horse, making his debut for Dan Skelton after a wind operation. He hasn’t had many tries at three miles but won twice at that trip for Tim Reed last year, one of those efforts suggesting he might be nicely treated on his current mark. Admittedly, that was his chasing debut, whereas he returns to hurdles here. There is less twang in the 7-2 about Band Of Blood (3.20) in the veterans’ chase but I still like him, carrying a penalty for his easy success at Exeter. The concern would be that that was on desperate ground and he must run to a similar level just 10 days after his first run for two years, so bouncing is a possibility. But Dr Newland’s horses seem in fine form just now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/21/unsane-review-steven-soderbergh-claire-foy-mental-health-thriller-slides-into-silliness","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T21:30:14Z","webTitle":"Unsane review – Steven Soderbergh's brash mental-health thriller slides into silliness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/21/unsane-review-steven-soderbergh-claire-foy-mental-health-thriller-slides-into-silliness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/21/unsane-review-steven-soderbergh-claire-foy-mental-health-thriller-slides-into-silliness","fields":{"headline":"Unsane review – Steven Soderbergh's brash mental-health thriller slides into silliness","bodyText":"Steven Soderbergh has ventured into the world of psychiatric grand guignol before, with his excellent 2013 thriller Side Effects. But this movie, from screenwriters Jonathan Bernstein and James Greer – known for comedy – is ultimately ridiculous in all the wrong ways. It’s a crazily broad, brash exploitation horror-thriller shot on an iPhone, with creeped-out distorted cinematography, menacingly low lighting, and pastiche midnight-movie design effects. The film has a ragbag of themes including stalking, mental illness and the private medical insurance racket; these competing ideas cancel each other out and aren’t scary. And yet it has to be said that before things escalate into anarchic silliness, Unsane does pack a punch. Claire Foy brings a fierce commitment to the role of Sawyer Valentini, a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown – in fact, well over the verge. She has moved to a new city with a new identity to escape a stalker. Matt Damon has a cameo as the cop advising her on security: locks, bars, deleting her social media accounts etc. But she is a complete wreck – unable to form friendships or relationships – and to her hospital-based psychotherapist she one day ill-advisedly appears to confess to having suicidal thoughts. This therapist coolly asks her to sign a document, which she thinks is just committing her to more sessions. But suddenly big white-coated men lead her to a locked room. And in that secure facility, she becomes convinced that the attendant nurse is actually her stalker. There is of course hardly anything more worrying than the idea of unjustly being incarcerated in this way and that your increasingly frantic and enraged complaints will be taken as proof of madness. It is moreover not necessarily a problem that mental health issues are treated here with absolute lack of taste; it is the prerogative of satires or black comedies or scary movies to offend, to lead us down the shock corridor of provocation. But the absurdity and the galaxy of plot holes in the farcical final act just undermine everything. Foy keeps things watchable – up to a point. But the commitment of her performance from the outset encourages us to invest wrongly in a believable drama and a plausible situation, and she can’t make up for the film’s descent into pantomime. The is-she-or-isn’t-she-crazy theme, as summarised by that quibbling title, is not a very tense or interesting dilemma – at least, not as it is finally hammed up here – and is solved perfunctorily by means of another character: Sawyer’s mother, played by Amy Irving, who is drawn into this grisly circle of hell. In fact, Unsane is at its most effective when it is satirising the duplicitous world of the private medical facilities, the insurers, and the short-term incarceration industry. The icily self-serving corporatespeak of the hospital’s director is thoughtfully achieved and Polly McKie’s performance as the Ratched-like Nurse Boles is very intimidating. She is actually a rather potent character, but crowded out of the drama by the nurse played by Joshua Leonard. Juno Temple is landed with the role of a malign wild-child patient, another part of the film that succeeds in being unsubtle and a little bit feeble. It’s a shame: Foy shows that she’s more than just the queen – she could be great in a Soderbergh comedy such as Logan Lucky. But Unsane delivers only unsuccess. Unsane is showing at the Berlin film festival and will be released in cinemas on 23 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/21/these-people-forget-48-voted-remain-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T11:15:42Z","webTitle":"'These people forget 48% voted remain': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/21/these-people-forget-48-voted-remain-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/21/these-people-forget-48-voted-remain-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'These people forget 48% voted remain': your best comments today","bodyText":"Brexit demands referred to as “ransom note-like” have dominated discussion on the site today. We also look at your reactions to an article on burnout at work and a community looking after its lonely. To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. Tory MPs’ hard Brexit letter to May described as ransom note Discussion on Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog this morning has spun around a set of demands laid out in a letter to Theresa May by a group of 62 Tory backbenchers. ‘Do these people not understand that free-trade by necessity requires a legislative framework?’ Their ransom letter is nothing more than an attempt to have their cognitive dissonance made manifest in legislation. Do these people not understand that free-trade by necessity requires a legislative framework (or as that’s known to them “the evil bondage of red tape that isn’t administered by nanny). Their letter shows their ignorance and what’s more lays clear their goal. It is nothing less than an attempt to demand dairy ice cream whilst at the same time insisting all cows and other milk producing ungulates from donkeys to rhinos be banned. This is their folly. They want free trade without the frameworks that make free trade possible. They want to trade with the world without asking firstly if we have anything that the world isn’t already buying from us. They’re touting the mythical beast of burdenless commerce as a panacea for all our ills but have neglected to ask if there is anyone out there willing to swap our baubles of Bank accounts and bombs for their advanced pharmaceutical research or rare earth supplies. Tintenfische ‘These people may have noticed that 48% voted to Remain’ I have not researched the ERG membership but my guess is that the members are mostly English. These people may not have noticed that 48% voted to Remain in the EU and many people are very angry at the course of events that have led us to Brexit. These people are the far right of Brexit, they are fanatics, they are out of kilter with the mood of the nation, the majority of leave voters and their party. They should be the English Radical Group not the European Research Group. These people are the real ‘enemies of the people’ and the ‘’saboteurs’. Do they think their proposal is likely to bring any sort of consensus? Heliopower How burnout became a sinister and insidious epidemic Moya Sarner has been speaking to people – including readers who shared their stories via a callout – about burnout in the workplace. Stories of both suffering and successful recoveries are explored, and you’ve been adding to the debate in the comments. ‘I’d been taking myself too seriously’ I suffered from something like this years ago. I’d worked successfully for a company in sales and product management for years, but decided I wanted something different and quit to follow a new path. A few years later, I was asked to return to my old company and, like a fool, agreed. After a few months, I started finding it more and more difficult just to get to work, I lost interest in the other stuff I used to enjoy, and ended up feeling like death warmed up. The thing that put me back together was a TV comedy – The Office – which let me see that I’d been taking too many things, including myself, far too seriously, and putting everything into something that, in the scale of things, really wasn’t that important. I learnt to laugh at myself and, once I could do that, I could laugh at life. For doctors, carers and others involved in critical functions, it’s different, as it can be a matter of life or death, and that must take its toll in stress but, for the rest of us mere mortals, it helps if we learn not to take what we do quite so seriously. MissingInActon The town that’s found a potent cure for illness – community Frome in Somerset, writes George Monbiot, has seen a dramatic fall in emergency hospital admissions since starting a project fighting isolation and loneliness. ‘The consequences of early intervention with socialising strategies removes a cost from the system’ My instinctive understanding of the problems around looking after people when they get old or ill was that the cost of that care was merely a consequence of the getting old or ill. To the system as a whole it is essentially a cost of doing business, and the job of policy is to determine the distribution of that cost, with the current preference being increasingly to starve formal social and health care structures of resources in order to compel charity and personal suffering to pay the bill. And that while personal suffering of the otherwise inactive might be an efficient allocation, the unmeasured ministrations inspired either by good will or by being lumbered is not. What I’m now beginning to grasp is that this is only part of how I should look at this. Because the consequences of early intervention with socialising strategies removes a cost from the system. There is no fixed cost to getting ill or old. This is a sort of “social” network effect. And your description of patients as people regaining their agency is key: being a passive recipient of care defines you as a debit in the accounts before you even start. Agency goes in the credit column. Thanks George – you’ve changed the way I think about social care. Wuss Comments have been edited for length.

She evidently got a taste for it. Bayón commissioned him to create a new work for her and the result is an offbeat, impishly naughty 90 minutes that is quite unlike anything else at London’s annual Flamenco festival. The show sets out its stall with a white tinsel Christmas tree, a keyboard player in a white bathrobe, a singer in a white suit and a guitarist – Bayón’s husband, Jesús Torres – kitted out as, well, Jesus Christ. Into this kitsch world, Bayón arrives in a flaming red dress, brandishing a broomstick, her grotesquely platformed feet beating out a pagan pulse. She pops off her clogs and loosens her long hair, staggering about in stop-motion like a ghost from a Japanese horror film. She wails a parody of a flamenco song while a tassled shawl appears to be pulled out from her innards. Torres recites a litany of her superstitions; Bayón crosses herself, or shoos off bad spirits even as she’s wilfully stomping on glass. The music veers from eerie lullabies to full church-organ portentousness, while odd-couple backing dancers Alicia Márquez (towering, in blue) and Nieves Casablanca (tiny, in pink) bring a surreal, doll-like presence. For all its transgressions, Dju-Dju works ultimately because it draws on qualities close to flamenco’s heart: wayward rhythms, unresolved dissonances, irrational passions, the summoning of hidden forces. Bayón may not have the madcap, elemental energy of Rocío Molina, for example, but she’s looked into the shadows and is discovering her own juju. The Flamenco festival is at Sadler’s Wells, London, until 25 February.

Tara Newbold, a 29-year-old mother to two sons and a daughter, was lying dead under a black duvet on the sofa of the home Ballin sometimes shared with her, beaten from head to toe, with 37 visible injuries. Between 1.30am and 2am, Ballin or Newbold searched the internet for symptoms of dying and signs of death. At 4am he took their three children to his sister’s home. At the station, a tense and anxious Ballin was let into the building and immediately arrested by Nottinghamshire police on suspicion of murder. But after a postmortem report concluded she had died of cocaine toxicity the police dropped the murder inquiry and charged Ballin, 36, with grievous bodily harm with intent. He was convicted of the lesser charge at Nottingham crown court on Thursday, leaving her anguished family with many questions. Newbold’s mother and stepfather, Julie and Peter Dury, recall the distressing moment they received a phone call from a relative telling them something was wrong and they rushed to her semi-detached home in West Bridgford. “We arrived at the house and it was all taped off,” Julie says, from the lounge of their home in Gamston, where she is surrounded by photos of her daughter. “I approached a guy in a suit - I presumed he was a detective. ‘I’m Tara Newbold’s mum,’ I said. ‘What’s happened?’ He just said, ‘She’s dead.’” The couple were sent home distraught. They felt sick. In some ways, they had been expecting this day to come, but the events that unfolded after her death were beyond what they had ever imagined. Newbold and Ballin met when she was just 15 and he was 19. Her family had never liked him. “He was self-centred; always did what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it,” Peter says. The relationship was on and off for years, even as they had children together. The family noticed Newbold was never her usual bubbly self when she was with him and failed to live up to her potential. She had aspired to be a midwife and during one period when they were apart, she started a BTec in social care. But when Ballin came back on the scene, she gave it up. In 2012, Newbold declared to her family that she wanted to do things “properly” and Ballin moved into her three-bedroom home in West Bridgford. It became clear to the Durys, especially Julie, who had witnessed domestic violence before, that Newbold was being abused herself. They tried to stage interventions on numerous occasions with their daughter and her partner, directly confronting him over alleged abuse, but the relationship continued. “I knew it had happened in the past,” Julie says, full of weariness. “Just by Tara’s body language when I was with her. She was on edge all the time.” But Julie felt helpless. “I said to her, ‘You can’t live like this. You deserve better.’ In the end, we just didn’t talk about it.” The couple had hoped that a trip with them to Menorca in June – without Ballin and with her children – would give Newbold a chance to reflect on her situation and at first it had appeared to work. “It was like Tara was back to her old self,” Julie says. “Happy-go-lucky, caring, bubbly. She was very relaxed. Bouncy.” But after the trip she virtually vanished, seeing them on just four more occasions before her death four months later. The last time they saw Newbold was in the nearby Willow Tree pub in late July. She was there alone with Ballin when they arrived. The conversation between Newbold and her family was strained and they sat apart. At one point, Julie and her daughter passed near the toilets, at which point Newbold put her arm around her mother and said: “Love you Mum”. That was the last time they saw her alive. An interim postmortem report in November 2016 by Dr Michael Biggs – a Home Office forensic pathologist whose professional opinion would come to have a significant bearing on the case – made for grim reading. The range and volume of injuries suffered by Newbold were vast; she had marks to her forehead, cheek, eyes, nose, ear, jawline, lip, breast, abdomen, thighs, buttock, shin, calf, ankle, toes, knees, arms, hands, fingers, shoulder, wrists, back and hips. She had seven broken ribs, her left lung was partially collapsed and her frenulum - the flap of skin between the inside upper lip and teeth - had been torn. But it was not until the following February that the full, final postmortem from Biggs came back and its conclusion shocked the Durys to the core. The coroner concluded that the multiple injuries had not contributed to her death. The final report relisted the horrific injuries sustained by Tara, noting that she sustained “blunt force trauma assault prior to her death, including multiple impacts with a rod or bar-shaped object”. But the “most likely” cause of death, Biggs wrote, was cocaine toxicity. A level of the class-A drug suggesting “high recreational use” was found in her system. The police immediately dropped the murder investigation and charged Ballin with the lesser charge of grievous bodily harm. “We were distraught,” said Julie. “Tara was against drugs.” Julie and Peter decided to challenge the result of the postmortem. They were put in touch with Dr Stephen Leadbetter, Home Office pathologist and director of medicine at Cardiff University, who provided an independent review of Biggs’s examination. Leadbetter’s report was critical, alleging a number of oversights and concluding: “I am not convinced from the reports that injury can be excluded from having played a part in this death.” The Durys thought they had what was needed to convince the police to pursue a murder or manslaughter charge. The police forwarded the comments to Biggs, who said he did not accept Leadbetter’s criticism or conclusion and stood by his own analysis. The force drew a line under it. The family attempted to fight the decision, complaining to Nottinghamshire police, who conducted an internal review of their investigation, which concluded it had made the right decision. The Durys have also written many times to the Crown Prosecution Service questioning the decision. The Guardian can reveal that Ballin had contact with the police over his abuse against Newbold many times before her death but was never charged. Nottinghamshire police made five referrals to social services over incidents involving the couple. Furthermore, he was arrested in connection to alleged violence against other women but was never convicted. As Ballin’s trial date drew closer, the Durys found more evidence of his abuse. Photographs taken of Newbold by her young daughter in the months after she returned from the family holiday showed bruises and marks on her throat and face. Ballin had cleared out her bank account while she was away, leaving her financially dependent. His control had become so excessive that he would not allow Tara’s two eldest children downstairs - and would not allow her upstairs. Buckets of urine were found in the kitchen. The Durys believe this aggressive control offers an explanation as to why cocaine was found in Newbold’s system. They believe Ballin either physically forced her to take it or bullied her into doing so. They say there is evidence to support their view, which the police have ignored. First, there was the ripped frenulum, which the pathologist said could have been damaged by something being forced into the mouth. Then Megan Turner, Julie’s cousin, and another woman, one of a number of women Ballin was seeing while he was with Newbold, both gave statements to the police to the effect that he had aggressively encouraged them to take drugs. But the police would not pursue this line of questioning – again deferring to the view of the pathologist, Biggs, who said he could not comment on whether the cocaine had been consumed by force. But a test that could have been performed – using strands of hair that reveals the extent of the frequency of drug use – was not completed. Ballin stood trial and was convicted on Thursday of grievous bodily harm with intent and now faces time in jail. But Peter and Julie say they are the ones left facing a life sentence. They have been left to raise their three grandchildren, at a time in their lives when they were looking forward to retirement and the joys of grandparenthood. A domestic homicide review by Rushcliffe borough council will take place, which they hope will provide further answers as to why police did not do more to help Newbold before she died and why the force and CPS did not pursue more severe charges against Ballin after her death. He will be sentenced on 26 March. A CPS spokesman said: “We considered all of the evidence provided by the police and made a charging decision in accordance with the evidential test contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. “The defendant was charged with an offence where the CPS was satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction.” Nottinghamshire police said: “Tackling domestic abuse is one of our top priorities. To ensure that our actions are appropriate we are able to launch formal reviews into our processes, which we have done in this case. We follow where the evidence takes us to ensure offenders are brought to justice. All lines of enquiry were conducted in this case. They said the pathology report was “subject to peer review. It is inappropriate for us to comment further on this”. Sifting through piles of paperwork, as if it might provide a clue or an answer as to how they found themselves in this position, Peter and Julie ponder why their daughter never left Ballin. “She wanted that family unit at any cost, and in the end it was the cost of losing her life,” Julie says. “He just took over her mind.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/21/syrian-death-toll-rises-as-bombing-of-rebel-enclave-continues","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T09:30:42Z","webTitle":"Aid agencies call for urgent ceasefire in besieged Syrian enclave","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/21/syrian-death-toll-rises-as-bombing-of-rebel-enclave-continues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/21/syrian-death-toll-rises-as-bombing-of-rebel-enclave-continues","fields":{"headline":"Aid agencies call for urgent ceasefire in besieged Syrian enclave","bodyText":"Aid agencies, including the Red Cross and World Food Programme, are calling for an urgent ceasefire to allow them to reach the besieged Syrian enclave of eastern Ghouta, as rockets and barrel bombs dropped by pro-regime forces killed dozens more people on the fourth day of an intense assault. The calls were echoed by the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, who demanded an immediate suspension of “all war activities” in the rebel-held Damascus suburb, which he described as a “hell on earth”. The UN’s high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, also called for an immediate halt to hostilities, warning that “civilians were being slaughtered in droves”. The UN Security Council is expected to vote, probably on Thursday, on a draft resolution demanding a 30-day ceasefire to allow deliveries of aid and medical evacuations. Terrified residents in the area, where 400,000 people are trapped on the outskirts of Damascus, were sheltering in caves, dugouts and basements, as a hail of explosives hit homes, roads and hospitals amid what aid officials warned was an unfolding “humanitarian catastrophe”. The attacks have killed over 335 civilians since Sunday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday. More than 1,200 others have been injured, a toll people on the ground say has been exacerbated by attacks on hospitals, clinics and ambulances. In its statement, the International Committee of the Red Cross said medical personnel in eastern Ghouta were unable to cope with the high number of wounded, adding that “wounded victims are dying only because they cannot be treated in time”. The call for a pause in the fighting to allow food and medical aid to reach eastern Ghouta came as some international agencies, who work with local partners in the densely populated agricultural area on the outskirts of Damascus, announced they were suspending their programmes because of the risk. The halting of aid efforts in an area that has seen one small convoy of aid enter since November comes as acute malnutrition levels among children in the enclave have quadrupled in less than a year to the highest levels seen in Syria’s seven-year war. “Just a cup of water or a piece of bread may cost a man his life because he is under attack from missiles,” said Dr Fayez Orabi, one of the doctors in eastern Ghouta. “They cannot get out of their shelters.” There has been widespread condemnation from the United Nations and politicians around the world, but without any action to halt or lessen the bombardment. “It is a miserable situation, the whole world just watching us,” said Orabi. Photographs and videos sent from inside the enclave showed bloody, fractured bodies and the aftermath of the strikes. In one a weeping father seizes his son’s tiny body from the bed of a truck taking it to burial, for one last embrace. The surge in killing in Ghouta came amid reports of an impending regime incursion into the area, as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad look to regain control of a a rebel stronghold that was once the capital’s breadbasket. “The offensive has not started yet. This is preliminary bombing,” a commander in the coalition fighting on behalf of Assad’s government told Reuters. Aid officials interviewed by the Guardian in Damascus and elsewhere described the situation in eastern Ghouta as a “hell on earth” in particular for the estimated 200,000 children trapped in an area, with some 67 children reportedly among the fatalities recorded in the last few days. Even before the current intensification of the government’s bombardment, experts were warning that food prices in the besieged area had made it impossible for many residents to afford a meal with a basic portion of bread costing a staggering 85 times as much as in Damascus 10 miles away, and with a cylinder of cooking gas – available for $44 (£31) in the capital – selling for up to $300 in eastern Ghouta. Among agencies announcing that the violence had made continued work impossible was Care, whose Syria country director, Wouter Schaap, warned of a “humanitarian catastrophe” if a ceasefire was not agreed. “The situation in eastern Ghouta is more critical than ever. Despite their resilience for years, people are giving up hope for survival. “Unlike previous airstrikes, destruction has reached every area this time. There is no place for people to go – no shelter, no safety,” said ‘Hanaa’, who works in eastern Ghouta with a local organisation supported by Care. The UNRWA, the UN agency that supports Palestinian refugees in Syria, said it was also suspending food aid and schooling after two of its students were killed in a mortar attack in a move it said would affect 27,000 children. Juliette Touma of Unicef also painted a bleak picture. “What we know that is that needs are dire in eastern Ghouta. It is impossible to compare suffering with suffering [in Syria] but it is truly horrific. It is a hell hole. A killing field for children.” Jakob Kern, the World Food Programmes’s chief in Damascus, added: “Since it intensified it is no longer a question for civilians of basic needs. It is about survival. It’s a question of, do I live through this day. “Two two weeks ago we managed to deliver enough food for 7,000 people in the first convoy in three months. Less than 2% of the people who needed it got aid. We have asked and asked just about everyone for a pause but realistically we need a month’s halt in the fighting to deliver a month of rations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/21/aa-shares-fall-by-nearly-a-quarter-after-profits-and-dividends-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T12:07:23Z","webTitle":"AA shares fall by nearly a quarter after profits and dividends warning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/21/aa-shares-fall-by-nearly-a-quarter-after-profits-and-dividends-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/21/aa-shares-fall-by-nearly-a-quarter-after-profits-and-dividends-warning","fields":{"headline":"AA shares fall by nearly a quarter after profits and dividends warning","bodyText":"Shares in the AA plunged by almost a quarter after the firm warned profits would be lower than expected and slashed dividend payouts to shareholders.

These investments, while reducing our short term profitability, are vital to our long term success.” The AA said it was now marketing to younger customers, as well as its traditional 50-year plus core demographic, and working on plans to offer a simple and easy breakdown service through new digital products. Targets for 2021 include a return to membership growth, half of all members to be registered on the AA’s app, and a 20% reduction in breakdowns reported through its call centres. The company is also hoping to persuade more of its 3.3m customers to take out AA insurance policies. Currently, just 9% have motor insurance policies with the firm and it is aiming for a total of 2m motor and home policies by 2023, up from 1.4m currently. The AA is in dispute with its former chairman, Bob Mackenzie, who is taking the company to an employment tribunal after being sacked last year following a “sustained and violent assault” on a colleague at a five-star hotel, which was captured on hotel CCTV. Mackenzie’s lawyers are understood to be claiming that he was wrongfully dismissed, having been under extreme pressure, and should be entitled to damages. He had been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in the stock market flotation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/feb/22/blame-eric-pickles-councillors-no-scrutiny-hospitality","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T07:27:11Z","webTitle":"Blame Eric Pickles for councillors guzzling high on the hog | David Walker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2018/feb/22/blame-eric-pickles-councillors-no-scrutiny-hospitality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2018/feb/22/blame-eric-pickles-councillors-no-scrutiny-hospitality","fields":{"headline":"Blame Eric Pickles for councillors guzzling high on the hog","bodyText":"Behold the hand of Eric Pickles. The former Tory communities secretary may have left parliament last year but his legacy lives on, in Northamptonshire, where the bankrupt council is struggling to set a legal budget, and in Westminster, where a senior councillor has been guzzling high on the hog at the expense of property companies – Robert Davis ate 296 meals over three years, which by anyone’s standards is heroic consumption. Both of these councils are Tory controlled, which is ironic given that Pickles was brutal in his partisanship (he later became Tory party chair) and couched his policies as ways of repulsing municipal socialism. It’s now possible that, exploiting the ruling group’s severe embarrassment, Labour could even unseat the Tories in Westminster in the borough elections in May. Pickles was himself once briefly leader of Bradford before departing for the greener pastures of Essex. But, like other ex councillors who end up in the House of Commons, he proved an ardent centralist, instructing councils how often they should empty the bins and interfering in how they communicated with the public. He did however like to pose as a liberator, freeing the shires from (as he put it) the bureaucracy accreted during Labour’s years in power. Even though it was a Tory creation, he went for the Audit Commission. You can trace a direct line from its abolition to the mess that counties such as Northants and Surrey now find themselves in. Pickles also abolished the Standards Board. This was, admittedly, a cumbersome and unnecessarily expensive set up for monitoring the ethics of elected councillors in England. They, naturally enough, weren’t enamoured of its inquiries and codes of conduct. The Local Government Association whooped when it and the Audit Commission were despatched in the Cameron government’s quango cull. Pickles, ever the grandstander, could just have slimmed down these bodies; he certainly should have thought through the consequences of abolition. No need for ethics, he seemed to think. Leave them to the obscure function inside councils that has existed since 1989 called the monitoring officer, who is supposed to oversee the “constitution”, check maladministration and be responsible for the conduct of councillors and officers. It’s to the monitoring officer that Robert Davis, the deputy leader and former planning chief has now referred himself – the monitoring officer in Westminster apparently not being proactive when it comes to the conduct of councillors. While the Standards Board was an external body, with inspectorial powers, the monitoring officer is a Westminster employee. Westminster is a council with an unfortunate record of employees being bullied and bruised by political leaders. Just ask any who came into contact with Shirley Porter. We have been hearing quite a bit lately about localities taking control of their destinies and, money permitting, wresting back service responsibilities from the centre. At time when, thanks to Brexit, the centre is so decrepit, that’s understandable. In parts of local government there’s impressive spirit and capacity. But not everywhere. Electors don’t or at least don’t in any coherent way police the conduct of councillors; voter turnout remains disappointingly sparse. In councils with solid party majorities, internal checks and balances may be weak. Councillors think they can get away with ideological projects, excessive partisanship, financial risk … and fine dining at Le Caprice and the Ritz.
