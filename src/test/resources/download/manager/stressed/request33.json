Ardern, who was sworn in to office in October, said in a Facebook post that she and her partner, Clarke Gayford, are expecting in June. “Clarke and I are really excited that in June our team will expand from two to three, and that we’ll be joining the many parents out there who wear two hats,” the 37-year-old wrote. “I’ll be prime minister and a mum, and Clarke will be ‘first man of fishing’ and stay at home dad. I think it’s fair to say that this will be a wee one that a village will raise, but we couldn’t be more excited.” In 1990, Pakistan’s then prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, gave birth to a daughter, in what was said to be a first for an elected world leader. The deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, will take over to allow Ardern to take six weeks of maternity leave after the baby is born. In a statement Ardern said she intended to be “fully contactable” during her period of maternity leave. At the end of her leave she intended to resume “all prime ministerial duties”, she said. The Green party leader, James Shaw, congratulated the prime minister and Gayford. “That a woman can be the prime minister of New Zealand and choose to have a family while in office says a lot about the kind of country we are and that we can be – modern, progressive, inclusive, and equal,” Shaw said. “For that reason I know this announcement will be significant for many women, in particular, and that all New Zealanders will share in the prime minister’s joy today.” Ardern said her pregnancy had been confirmed on 13 October, meaning her child would have been conceived during one of the closest election campaigns New Zealand has seen, with Ardern finding out the news six days before being confirmed as prime minister. The former New Zealand prime minister Jenny Shipley said it was “brilliant” news. “It’s a wonderful choice of our outstanding young woman leader who is also going to choose to be a parent,” Shipley told RNZ. “It will bring special insight I suspect in her work and joy to her family.” Another former prime minister, Helen Clark, tweeted her best wishes. Ardern spoke to Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull on Friday morning to share the news, as well as holding a phone conference with her ministers and other key government figures. Ardern said she and her partner knew the sex of the baby but would be keeping the secret to themselves. Asked by a reporter how she managed to set up a government at the same time as having morning sickness, Ardern replied “It’s what ladies do,” revealing that no-one involved in the coalition talks picked up on her state. Gayford, a television presenter on a TV fishing show, would become a stay-at-home father, and accompany Ardern “as much as possible” with the new baby when she went back to work to allow the prime minister to spend time with her child. “We’re going to make this work and New Zealand is going to help us raise our first child,” Ardern said. She told her partner Gayford about the pregnancy using Facebook messenger while he was away filming. The news came as “complete surprise” to both, as they had been told they would need help conceiving a baby. Ardern said before being elected Labour leader in August last year she and Gayford had started taking steps to have a family but those efforts stopped once she was promoted to leader. Morning sickness had made keeping the secret “a little tricky”, but otherwise so far the pregnancy symptoms had not been “too bad” and she did not predict her government having to adapt too much to her baby – except for the cabinet cars installing baby seats. Ardern noted that the Speaker, Trevor Mallard, had already encouraged a family-friendly environment in parliament, and had repeatedly been photographed holding MP’s babies while they were engaged in debate. “Lots of people juggle a lot of things in their personal and private lives, and I’m not unusual in that. Plenty of women have multitasked before me, and I want to acknowledge that.” Gayford said he was looking forward to diving into “the great unknown” of being a dad, and was getting lots of advice from his female friends and sisters. “Initially it will be really important that Jacinda gets as much time as possible [with the baby] so I am going to try and be as flexible as possible, and close, so she’s across everything as much as possible.” A reporter at Ardern’s media conference asked if the couple planned on getting married, to which Gayford responded, “Wow, I like the idea that we’re doing everything in reverse.” In early August, six hours after being elected to lead the Labour party, Ardern was grilled about her baby plans repeatedly by New Zealand media. In scenes that quickly went viral, Ardern fought back, defending women’s rights to privacy about their baby plans. She said it was “unacceptable” for any employer to ask a woman whether or not she intended to have children. “I decided to talk about it, it was my choice, so that means I am happy to keep responding to those questions,” said Ardern, who had in the past expressed the desire to have a family. “But, you,” she said, turning her chair to face the TV host Mark Richardson, and pointing her finger directly at him, “it is totally unacceptable in 2017 to say that women should have to answer that question in the workplace. It is unacceptable, it is unacceptable.” The AM co-host, Amanda Gillies, applauded as Ardern went on: “It is a women’s decision about when they choose to have children, and it should not predetermine whether or not they are given a job or have job opportunities.” The exchange and repeated questioning of Ardern over her plans for children sparked debate within New Zealand and accusations of sexism. Throughout her two-month election battle and since becoming PM, Ardern has repeatedly been asked about whether she intended to have children, and how she would be able to juggle being an effective prime minister with raising a family. Ardern said she had waited till now to share the news with New Zealanders to ensure the baby was healthy and well. “From a personal perspective, I am so looking forward to my new role as a parent. But I am equally focused on my job and responsibilities as prime minister. “While 2018 will be the year I become a mum, it will also be a year that the government finishes our 100-day plan, and starts pursuing all of the priorities that will build a better New Zealand. I look forward to leading that work, and having a slightly expanded family join me on that journey.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/19/stormy-daniels-trump-stephanie-clifford-sharks","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T13:58:05Z","webTitle":"Stormy Daniels on Trump: pajamas, unprotected sex and … scary sharks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/19/stormy-daniels-trump-stephanie-clifford-sharks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/19/stormy-daniels-trump-stephanie-clifford-sharks","fields":{"headline":"Stormy Daniels on Trump: pajamas, unprotected sex and … scary sharks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The magazine InTouch published on Friday its full interview with a pornographic actor who claims she had an extramarital affair with Donald Trump, years before his presidential campaign and ascendance to the White House. Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, said in a 2011 interview with the magazine, first published on Friday, that she had an affair with Trump a few years earlier. Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that a Trump Organization attorney, Michael Cohen, oversaw a $130,000 payment to Clifford so that she would not discuss the encounter. Cohen later produced an email in which Clifford apparently denied a “sexual and/or romantic affair” and receipt of “hush money”. A White House official has denied allegations of infidelity, saying: “These are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election.” While the magazine had previously released excerpts of the interview, in the full version Clifford details at length her 2006 relationship with the businessman, including encounters with his entourage, his teetotaling lifestyle and his phobia of sharks. According to Clifford, Trump invited her to his hotel room at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada in 2006. When she arrived there, she said, he was wearing “pajama pants” and watching the Discovery Channel’s yearly Shark Week on television. “The strangest thing about that night – this was the best thing ever,” Clifford said, describing the businessman’s fascination with a special about a shipwreck. “It was like the worst shark attack in history. He is obsessed with sharks. Terrified of sharks. “He was like, “I donate to all these charities and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks. I hope all the sharks die.’ He was like riveted. He was like obsessed. It’s so strange, I know.” According to the interview, Clifford met with a bodyguard named Keith and spoke with a secretary named Rhona – apparent allusions to Keith Schiller, Trump’s longtime bodyguard and briefly director of Oval Office operations, and Rhona Graff, his longtime secretary and the aide eventually blamed for plagiarizing a speech. She also describes Trump’s steadfast refusal to drink alcohol, and his fascination with magazine covers, saying “he just kept talking about this magazine that he was on the cover of, like, ‘Look at this magazine, don’t I look great on the cover?’” Clifford also described her sexual encounters with the businessman, saying she did not use protection: “It was kind of in the moment. And I was really kind of upset about it because I am so, like, careful.” She added: “the sex was nothing crazy”, “textbook generic” and “I can definitely describe his junk perfectly, if I ever have to.” Clifford told the magazine, “he definitely seemed smitten after that. He was like, ‘I wanna see you again, when can I see you again?’” Throughout the encounters, Clifford said, Trump did not mention his wife, Melania, whom he had married in 2005 and who gave birth to their son Barron in 2006. “At the time, I didn’t think that much about it,” Clifford said. “But now that I have a baby that’s the same age that his was at the time, I’m like, ‘Wow, what a dick.’” Asked whether she had a message for Trump, she said: “I don’t know. Karma will always bite you in the ass.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/19/neymar-psg-waste-of-talent-dijon","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T14:15:00Z","webTitle":"The PSG-Neymar show rolls on – but is it more celebrity than sport? | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/19/neymar-psg-waste-of-talent-dijon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/19/neymar-psg-waste-of-talent-dijon","fields":{"headline":"The PSG-Neymar show rolls on – but is it more celebrity than sport?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An hour into Paris Saint-Germain versus Dijon at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday there was a scramble in the Dijon penalty area, the thrilling spectacle of three world-class players tussling over the ball in the tightest of spaces. Not that this was entirely straightforward. Some might point to the slight oddity that all three players were wearing PSG shirts. Ángel Di María, Edinson Cavani and Neymar tangling furiously with one another in their eagerness to pick up another loose ball and shoot. It is tempting at this point to describe the Dijon goal as “beleaguered”. But this would assume, incorrectly, it was ever actually leaguered in the first place. PSG were 5-0 up, the white shirts of Dijon glimpsed only briefly, like Victorian garden ghosts, extras in someone else’s show. Half an hour later PSG were awarded a penalty to close the game out. The crowd had been lulled into an after-party vibe by then, drunk on its own gurgles of pleasure. Some chanted for “Eddie” to take the kick, a nod to a previous penalty shemozzle and to the fact Cavani was on the verge of breaking Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s PSG goal record. There were even mischievous boos as Neymar stepped up instead, although these were transformed into cheers 10 times as loud as he tickled the ball into the corner of the net to make the final score 8-0. The next day this would be reported as “crowd boo Neymar during wonder-show”. But these people weren’t really booing. They were amusing themselves, finding something to do at the end of a victory that left football’s most annihilating superstar vehicle 11 points clear at the top of the French league; and which provided the most extreme example to date of the disorienting ease with which Neymar is gliding his way through the domestic season. Yes: I went to Paris and watched PSG win 8-0 against the 10th-placed team in the league. This is a shared problem now. Mismatches are common everywhere. Manchester City are 12 points clear in the Premier League. Barcelona may have lost their unbeaten record but they are still gambolling away with La Liga. There is a question of degree, though, and this was an astonishing night as Dijon, who have yet to spend more than £2m on a player, performed with sub-zero intensity against PSG’s £450m attack. Shortly after kick-off Neymar was allowed to take the ball, stop for a bit, think about it and play a return pass, all the while adjusting his socks. By the end this was a spectacle so lacking in tension or uncertainty it seemed to stray beyond the definition of sport into something else: a choreographed performance, a display, 90 minutes of beaming celebrity triumphalism. There was at least a star turn. Even on a room-temperature night the next-best player in the world, that delightful little cartoon skill-sprite in the No 10 shirt, was jaw-droppingly good. Neymar scored four times, set up two more and produced constant throwaway moments of sublime skill. The next day he would become only the eighth player to be awarded 10 out of 10 by L’Équipe in its famed player ratings, despite having spent parts of the night strolling around, choosing his moments to snap out of standby mode. This is an oddly static kind of brilliance. Neymar may end up fulfilling his own much-trailed destiny by becoming the world’s best player. But he is already football’s most post-modern entity, a star player who seems to spend most of his time being a star player, being Neymar, willing figurehead for the Qatari global domination project, cloudless branding receptacle, playing out his own oddly airless domestic dominance. The highlight of the game arrived midway through the second half. Neymar picked up the ball inside his own half, facing the crowd. In one movement he turned, wriggled clear and surged forward with that gliding style, like a pond-skater on ice, beating five Dijon players without breaking stride and easing the ball into the far corner to complete a mind-boggling hat-trick. It was an outrageous moment, one of the most breathtaking individual goals you’re likely to see, albeit against demoralised and brutally outgunned opponents. Watching it, you thought, hmm, yes. Sensational. But what, exactly, is it for? There is, of course, an obvious answer to this. In the most basic sense Neymar is there to shift product at a club that has always fed on star power. The PSG megastore on the Champs Élysées is rammed with Neymarilia, from the wall of Neymar mannequins flanking the entrance like a headless security detail, to the Neymar couture shirts, the Warhol-style Neymar mug stack and the Neymar dolls available in three models: Neymar home kit, Neymar away kit and – a personal favourite – Neymar backwards cap home kit. Although on reflection the absence of Neymar away kit backward cap does look like a missed gap in the market. This is all fair enough. Commercial revenues are a major dividing point at the elite level. PSG don’t want to trade for ever as a state-funded entity, drunk on its own endless petro-dope. They want the same kind of un-level playing field as all the other mega-clubs. Neymar is the current point of leverage. For all that, this is still a strictly localised mania. Paris is too aloof, too in love with its own shadow to swoon for an athlete. This will never be a football city like Manchester or Munich, tied indissolubly to its teams. Even in the shadow of the Parc des Princes, there isn’t that fevered proximity-glamour that swirls up around other major grounds. The crowds are orderly in the hour before kick-off. Police with machine guns yawn on every corner. For the Dijon game the stadium is a third empty but the PSG ultras fill the 90 minutes with a range of songs and chants that sound to the English ear a bit too jolly, too festive, like the kind of football noise you get in TV movies. This is not the old agony and rage. This is a party. With 20 minutes gone it’s 3-0. PSG are doing back-flicks and rabonas in their own half. Just before half-time Neymar produces his first otherworldly moment, beating four players before being tripped; then lifting the most beautiful little nudged free-kick into the top corner. Before the crowd can recover he’s striding off for the break pursued, as ever, by men with cameras and spotlights, an image that feels oddly apt right now. “If Paris doesn’t win the Champions League, he’s gone. One season is all he has, he is waiting here. It’s business. There is no championnat now, nothing, it is just rest time for him. Why would you come here really? It is a different level everywhere else. I feel like he is just sleeping.” Manolo works in a bistro just around the corner and has been a PSG fan since he was a kid. His view reflects a natural wariness among some supporters about the basking star in their midst, that gloriously well-remunerated ambassador for the 21st Emirati arrondissement. Others shrug and enjoy it. “He is beautiful and he is ours,” says a man called Bruno draped in a PSG flag. “In England, of course, you are jealous. The Premier League has lots of money but why shouldn’t he be here? We win the Champions League and you will stop asking this.” French journalists close to PSG are also sceptical about the idea Paris is just a bridging move to get Neymar from Catalonia to Madrid. The feeling is he will stay for two, perhaps three, years if only because Qatar don’t want to sell. Take the money by all means. But it comes with strings. Just ask Marco Verratti, who seems to have been trying to leave for two years now. With Neymar there is a fear something is being lost, that without the necessary desperation, the need to constantly stretch and fret, a genuinely grand talent will fail to find those last few vital percentage points. Ronaldo has spoken recently on the subject of Neymar-drift, describing the decision to go to Paris as “a step back”. Even Unai Emery made no secret of the fact the Dijon game was basically a trial to see who gets to play left-back against Real Madrid next month, a Champions League tie that could yet define PSG’s season, perhaps even Neymar’s time at the club. There is above all an absence of tension here, just as there is an existential pointlessness to the idea of buying success. Sport is defined by tension. It exists where systems and personalities measure themselves against one another and find their limits. Towards the end PSG brought on a £178m centre-forward. “Stop,” you felt like shouting. “You can’t kill them any more. They’re already dead.” Kylian Mbappé duly smashed in the sixth. And for a moment the lights flashed. The PA boomed. The deeply sensual spectacle of all this glorious, entirely one-sided talent took over and it was easy to get lost in it all, to gorge yourself on the moment, a vision of football’s own frictionless future that is already upon us. • Sign up to our weekly email, The Recap, here, showcasing a selection of our sport features from the past seven days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/19/nick-kyrgios-overcomes-jo-wilfried-tsonga-to-reach-australian-open-last-16","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T12:01:18Z","webTitle":"Nick Kyrgios overcomes Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to reach Australian Open last 16","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/19/nick-kyrgios-overcomes-jo-wilfried-tsonga-to-reach-australian-open-last-16","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/19/nick-kyrgios-overcomes-jo-wilfried-tsonga-to-reach-australian-open-last-16","fields":{"headline":"Nick Kyrgios overcomes Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to reach Australian Open last 16","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Focused and fired up, Nick Kyrgios came through his stiffest test yet at the Australian Open on Friday, beating the former runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 (5), 4-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5) to reach the fourth round. Both men bashed 28 aces in Rod Laver Arena but the No 17 seed, the lone Australian remaining in the men’s draw, played his best when he needed to and he will now face Grigor Dimitrov for a quarter-final spot. Tsonga had a set point in the third set and led 5-2 in the fourth-set tiebreak but Kyrgios held firm. There has not been an Australian men’s champion here since Mark Edmondson in 1976, and though there are many obstacles in his path the 22-year-old is in the mix. “It was amazing,” Kyrgios said. “Playing Jo, obviously I was very nervous. He was a guy I looked up to as a kid, I still do, he’s a champion, I’m just happy to get through. [Being] 5-2 down in the fourth-set breaker, I was kind of getting ready for a fifth set mentally. I somehow just hung in and got a couple of looks. It was surreal out there today, that win.” When Kyrgios was given a code violation for not being ready to start in the allotted time, tempers could have frayed but the Australian kept his cool and smiled. Both men began serving bullets and though Kyrgios struck first, breaking in the third game, the Frenchman hit back to level at 3-3 with the help of a dead net-cord. A couple of aces helped Kyrgios get out of trouble at 4-5, 15-30. Kyrgios led 6-4 in the tiebreak and a Tsonga double-fault gave it to him 7-5. Kyrgios dropped his intensity at the start of the second set and the 32-year-old Tsonga, who reached his only grand slam final here 10 years ago, hit back. The Frenchman had needed five sets to get past Denis Shapovalov in the previous round but showed no sign of fatigue as he broke for 3-2, serving beautifully and producing some soft touches at the net. Instead it was Kyrgios who was losing concentration. “Why the fuck did I play doubles?” he said, at the change of ends, referring to his effort in searing temperatures the previous day. Tsonga maintained the advantage to level the match. “My legs felt a little bit heavy,” Kyrgios said. “Yesterday was hot. I played a two-hour doubles match. It took a lot out of me. I think the adrenaline kicked in the third and fourth sets. I had a couple of bananas, started to feel better, got a bit of a second wind.” The third set was an exhibition of serving from both men. A brilliant backhand pass down the line gave Kyrgios the mini-break in the tiebreak for a 4-2 lead but a mis-hit forehand handed the break back for 4-4. Tsonga had a set point at 6-5 but Kyrgios saved it with a big forehand winner. A huge serve and easy forehand created set point and an angled backhand return sealed the set. An angry Tsonga exchanged words with a fan who had been commenting between first and second serves on set point but he regained his focus as the fourth set again headed to another tiebreak. This time it was Tsonga who got the early mini-break, a Kyrgios double-fault helping him on the way to a 4-1 lead as he moved forward at every opportunity. Tsonga extended his lead to 5-2 but Kyrgios reeled off five straight points, finally clinching victory when Tsonga netted a forehand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/18/john-barton-royal-shakespeare-company-co-founder-dies-aged-89","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T21:32:16Z","webTitle":"John Barton, Royal Shakespeare Company co-founder, dies aged 89","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/18/john-barton-royal-shakespeare-company-co-founder-dies-aged-89","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/18/john-barton-royal-shakespeare-company-co-founder-dies-aged-89","fields":{"headline":"John Barton, Royal Shakespeare Company co-founder, dies aged 89","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Royal Shakespeare Company co-founder John Barton has died aged 89. Alongside Peter Hall, who died last year, Barton founded the RSC in 1960, working for the company for most of his life. In a statement, the current RSC artistic director Gregory Doran paid tribute to Barton, describing him as “both a great director and teacher, and simply one of the greatest influences in the acting of Shakespeare of the last century”. The RSC said Barton had recently been moved to a care home in west London, and died on 18 January. His wife Anne passed away aged 80 in 2013, and he is survived by his sister Jennifer. Among his celebrated productions were The War of the Roses in 1963, which helped launch the RSC, and Twelfth Night in 1969, in which Judi Dench played Viola. Alongside his productions, generations of actors have been influenced by Barton’s “Playing Shakespeare” series, which were recorded by London Weekend Television and first shown in 1982, and featured actors including Roger Rees, Ian McKellen, Ben Kingsley, Lisa Harrow, and Peggy Ashcroft.Doran wrote that Barton had in his final years “continued to conduct sonnet classes, hold master classes and one-to-one sessions in his New Cavendish Street flat, intriguing young actors, by his constant chewing of odd yellowy green nicotine gum (it used to be razor blades apparently), and getting tangled in his big woolly cardigans. Although frail in body at the last, he was always mentally alert and retained his sense of curiosity until the end.” Tributes to Barton have poured in across the acting world. Sir Patrick Stewart, who played Shylock in Barton’s 1978 production of The Merchant of Venice, tweeted: Robert Icke, associate director of the Almeida theatre, wrote: “Sad to hear of John Barton’s death. He was a visionary: pragmatic and wry, but fierce in striving for theatre that was genuinely intelligent and alive. His legacy, especially in classics, in verse, is inestimable. We don’t make them like him anymore.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/18/charles-i-whipping-boy-for-the-civil-war","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T19:01:40Z","webTitle":"Charles I: whipping boy for the civil war | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/18/charles-i-whipping-boy-for-the-civil-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/18/charles-i-whipping-boy-for-the-civil-war","fields":{"headline":"Charles I: whipping boy for the civil war","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rebecca Rideal’s excellent article on historical myths (G2, 18 January) draws attention to the myth of the whipping boy, which I unravelled in my new biography of Charles I, White King (reviewed very generously in last weekend’s Observer). What might interest people, however, is not simply that the tale of boys being beaten in place of naughty royal princes is untrue, but also why the lie was invented, and why it has survived. The answer is that its origin lies in a play written shortly after the English publication of James I’s tracts on divine-right kingship – in which James argued that no subject had the right to raise his hand against God’s anointed. In short, it’s a joke. The reason the joke has survived and become straight-faced “fact” is that it fits so neatly with our prejudices – in particular our belief that Charles I alone was to blame for the suffering of his subjects in the civil war, which was supposedly a consequence of him clinging like a spoilt child to his belief in divine-right kingship. It is time to question not only the whipping boy myth, but also the false narrative that has sustained it. Leanda de Lisle Osbaston, Warwickshire • I agree with Cormac Shine that an understanding of history can improve public policy (Our world is changing. It’s time for historians to explain why, 18 January). However, his call to arms is unnecessary. History frequently permeates contemporary ideas and debates. Indeed, some of the most interesting recent scholarship, including Emily Jones’s study, Edmund Burke and the Invention of Modern Conservatism, 1830-1914, and Robert Gordon’s Taming the Past, examines exactly how history has been used to advance the aims of those living in the present – the first in the case of British Conservatism, and the latter the development of American legal argument. We should also remember that history is a powerful rhetorical device and, in the wrong hands, can form the justification for unprecedented death and destruction – caveat emptor.

In June 2016, after all, many Londoners were obliged to conclude that there was a whole other country out there. The event itself is only briefly touched on in Morris’s book, whose billing as a “history” is a bit rich: it’s more a collection of dreamy and finely written essays. An essay on the Humber notes the “Hanseatic heart” and “oceanic outlook” of Hull, which in the 19th century was “England’s main point of immigration from the continent”. It concludes: “On 24 June 2016 two-thirds of Hull’s people voted to leave the European Union.” It is not Morris’s style to comment further: he is allusive rather than emphatic. And perhaps Brexit is a mere pinprick to Morris who, being the emeritus professor of archaeology at Huddersfield University (and the author of Time’s Anvil: England, Archaeology and the Imagination), takes the long view. His introduction is entirely geological: “When Yorkshire’s oldest rocks were formed nearly 500m years ago they were over 3,000 miles south of the equator”, which will come as an eye-opener to those proud regionalists who thought Yorkshire had always been in the north of England. Morris is constantly delving underground – only right, given how Yorkshire has been “aerated” by mining for 4,000 years. His mother grew up in Carlin How, an ironstone mining village on the Cleveland coast. She moved to the Midlands, where Morris was born, but he recalls a childhood visit to Carlin How in the early 1950s. He stepped off the bus and looked up: “An unending procession of gently nodding buckets floated past on an aerial ropeway that carried limestone up from the mine.” Morris was one of the two archaeologists who discovered a Roman culvert under York in 1972: “As a child I had read about secret passages. Here was a real one.” The find helped kill an inner ring-road scheme. The fight over traffic in towns was, like those earlier battles of Stamford Bridge and Marston Moor, one of “so many key battles that had been fought in Yorkshire”. But we don’t get too much of that grandiose “God’s own country” stuff. Morris does not regard Yorkshire as a glorious monolith. An essay on William Scoresby, the Whitby whaler and scientist, mentions that Scoresby attended Edinburgh University. But then the seagoing Whitby folk had a “stronger sense of companionship” with Edinburgh or London than with York, the moor behind them being hard to traverse. And while the Yorkshire countryside became venerated, promoted in late 19th-century journals for those who “heed the call of the greenwood”, this was in reaction to the horribleness of the towns, especially industrial Bradford. Then again, Morris quotes JB Priestley to the effect that the green hills were really in Bradford, given that they were always visible from its streets. This is a restless, poetic, strange book, and the territory it describes deserves nothing less. The same is true of The Debatable Land. Graham Robb has achieved bestselling status with scholarly nonfiction written with novelistic flair. First came what we might call his “indoor” books, reflecting his francophile tastes: biographies of Balzac, Victor Hugo and Rimbaud. But since The Discovery of France, his work has had a more topographical bent. For that book, Robb cycled 14,000 miles: he does not drive. Nonetheless in 2010 he and his wife moved from Oxford to “a lonely house on the very edge of England”. The reader becomes powerfully intrigued by this grand-sounding house in the Borders (“We walked the 300 yards to the gate”), formerly owned by the Conservative politician Nicholas Ridley. The house is almost surrounded by a river – the Liddel – that once marked the southern boundary of the Debatable Land, 50 square miles of desolate moor running east from Solway Firth. “It is possible to spend a long day walking across it without seeing another human being, even in the distance.” The Debatable Land was neither English nor Scottish but a law unto itself, and it became notorious as the centre of reiver violence. (The reivers being those “satanic night-riders of the border lands”.) But Robb, like a conjuror, gradually shows us the Debatable Land as something else. His exploration of its history is punctuated by some terrific nature writing. Sheep “covered the distant hillsides like giant daisies”. “I had often seen the light passing over that hillside like a hand stroking soft deer hide.” He begins by presenting the Debatable Land as unfairly maligned. Yes, the reivers gave us the word “bereaved”, but a bereavement was probably a theft rather than a murder, and the goods were often returned (for money) and the whole inconvenience could be avoided by payment of protection. In any case, the worst depredations of the Debatable Land reivers were committed in late Tudor times. Before then, it had been deserted. Custom prohibited building there, and the custom was observed. “Debatable” was not a genteel euphemism for “war-torn”, but a long form of “batable”, denoting that here was land on which (from dawn to dusk) cattle could be “battened” or fattened up. It becomes apparent that Robb is not alone in focusing on the border. The Scottish independence vote looms. Most Borderers are in the “No” camp. “Yes” might bring an iron curtain clanging down in their midst. That nightmare is dispelled, but maybe not for long, because the Brexit vote begins to loom. Meanwhile, Robb is groping toward a cartographic breakthrough. The demise of the Debatable Land is familiar history: after the Union of the Crowns in 1603 it was divided between England and Scotland, and its troublesome populace was slaughtered or deported. But what of its origins? Robb turns to Ptolemy’s famous map of Britain, assembled in Alexandria in the second century AD, and he corrects its grid in light of his knowledge of, and respect for, the surveying skills of the Celts. (As the possessor of an E grade in A-level geography I will not risk a more detailed precis.) The early Debatable Land comes into focus. With the same dimensions as those recorded in the early 16th century, it is revealed holding apart the settlements of two Celtic tribes like a boxing referee. Then, as later, it was the calm eye of the storm facilitating coexistence by interposing its neutrality and leaving open a route to the Solway Firth. But what of coexistence in the modern day? In the wet month of June 2016, the Liddel is rising “and the amphitheatre of woodland was once again a stadium of noise. On the evening of the 23rd we went to sleep with a feeling of relief. The pound was rising; the markets were confident”.

This was due to his fame as the Zapata-moustached, womanising author and sleuth Jason King in the ITV series Department S (1969-70) and the spin-off series Jason King (1971-72). Wyngarde played King in the manner of a cat walking on tiptoe, with an air of self-satisfaction. By 1971 it was reported that “more babies [had been] christened Jason during the last 12 months than ever before”. After Department S, Lew Grade informed him that, while his own idea of a hero was Roger Moore, “my wife likes you so we’re going to do another series”. In that series, Wyngarde’s acting become increasingly mannered. A reputable actor, whose television roles had brought an intriguing hint of decadence, had come to believe his own publicity. Cyril Frankel, director of numerous episodes of Department S and Jason King, recalled: “It got to a point where he wouldn’t accept direction.” In 1975, he was found guilty of gross indecency in a bus station toilet. Newspapers reported that he was summoned under his real name of Cyril Louis Goldbert. It was doubtless true that this incident damaged his career, but his ego also played a part. Five years later a tabloid newspaper reported that he was out of work, and “the mop of hair – thinning now – was covered with a flat cap … and he used a tie to hold up his trousers”. Interviewed by Ray Connolly in 1973, he said: “As a child it was difficult to differentiate sometimes between fact and fantasy.” He insisted that he had been born Peter Paul Wyngarde in 1933. However, JG Ballard, who had endured the Japanese internment camp Lunghua with him, stated in his 2008 memoir Miracles of Life that “Cyril Goldbert, the future Peter Wyngarde, … was four years older than me”; Ballard had been born in 1930. Ballard recalled him writing on a wall “what he said would be his stage name… Laurence Templeton. A name wonderfully of its time, and far grander than Peter Wyngarde.” But the name that determined Wyngarde’s career was Jason King. And, in the journalist Andrew Billen’s words, “Jason King went from national idol to national joke the day the first narrow lapel was sold in Carnaby Street in 1977.” Wyngarde claimed he had been born in Marseille – though despite evidence pointing to Singapore – and that his French mother, who appears to have been called Marcheritta (nee Ahin), was a racing driver. His father, who may have been Henry Goldbert, though Peter claimed he was a British diplomat named Wyngarde, divorced her and took custody of him; he was staying with friends in China when the Japanese invaded in 1941. Ballard remembered that he was “very popular with the ladies, distributing the most gallant flattery”. After liberation, Wyngarde claimed to have read law at Oxford, but there is no record of him having studied there in the postwar years. His first acting credit was as a policeman at the Buxton Playhouse in May 1946, making nonsense of the 1933 birth date he claimed. He supported Alec Guinness’s Hamlet at the New theatre in London in 1951, then played the soldier Dunois to Siobhán McKenna’s Saint Joan at the Arts in 1954. He appeared opposite Vivien Leigh in Duel of Angels at the Apollo in 1958, and said that the highlight of his career, at the Bristol Old Vic in 1959, had been playing Cyrano de Bergerac. His burgeoning TV career brought him lead roles as Sydney Carton in A Tale of Two Cities (1957), Long John Silver in The Adventures of Ben Gunn (1958) and the title role in Rupert of Hentzau (1964). His appearance in The Avengers (1966), inducting Diana Rigg into the Hellfire Club, is well remembered. In The Innocents (1961), he did not have a single word of dialogue; his only film lead was as a psychology professor in a horror film, Night of the Eagle (1962). Connolly felt there was “an element of mystery about the marriage [to the actor Dorinda Stevens] he says took place when he was 22”; Wyngarde claimed it ended in divorce. In 2007, Donald Spoto’s biography of Alan Bates, Otherwise Engaged, noted that Bates and Wyngarde had been partners for a decade from 1956. After Wyngarde had filmed Flash Gordon (1980) behind the gold mask of the chief of the secret police, Klytus, his agent, Dennis Selinger, admitted the actor was out of work. “It would be very easy for me to cry in my Campari and say the court case was the reason that TV work has not been flooding in but I don’t think it is true,” Wyngarde reasoned in 1980. To Billen, he averred, “It was the lack of imagination of producers. And if you’re a perfectionist ... producers don’t like it, because they are so mediocre.” In 1982, a bankruptcy hearing found that he was living on social security. Wyngarde had spoken dismissively to Connolly of “all that naturalistic stuff”. His performance in an episode of the gritty thriller series Bulman (1985) confirmed that the “naturalistic stuff” had rendered his style archaic. He had no known surviving family. • Peter Wyngarde (Cyril Louis Goldbert), actor, born c. 1926 or 1927; died 15 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/19/step-sisters-review-hits-and-misses-in-netflixs-cultural-appropriation-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T16:57:16Z","webTitle":"Step Sisters review – hits and misses in Netflix's cultural appropriation comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/19/step-sisters-review-hits-and-misses-in-netflixs-cultural-appropriation-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/19/step-sisters-review-hits-and-misses-in-netflixs-cultural-appropriation-comedy","fields":{"headline":"Step Sisters review – hits and misses in Netflix's cultural appropriation comedy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Before it was even released, there was swift pushback to the Netflix acquisition Step Sisters. Despite a formidable production team behind it that includes Dear White People writer Chuck Hayward and Master of None’s Lena Waithe, the premise struck the Twitter commentariat as trite and conservative: Jamilah, a college senior hoping to gain admission to Harvard Law School, is asked by a professor to rehabilitate a group of disgraced white sorority sisters by teaching them how to step, a style of percussive dance that has its roots in African foot dancing and black sorority life. If she can pull it off, and impart upon them lessons of unity and sisterhood, the sorority will be readmitted to campus (they were punished because a sister was caught having sex on school grounds) and Jamilah will get a coveted recommendation letter to Harvard. The movie was accused of being regressive, in that it made its black protagonist “the help” and supposedly encouraging cultural appropriation. One Twitter user, Nia Malika, wrote to Netflix: “We can’t have anything at all. None of us black sororities and fraternities are going to watch this foolishness. It’s African … Can we just have it please?” Those involved with Step Sisters advised skeptics not to judge the movie before they see it – not exactly an argument one wants to be making before release. And Step Sisters, which comes out on Netflix today, is indeed more than its trailer lets on; the film is self-aware, honest about its racial politics, even vaguely self-referential at certain points, like when Jamilah, played by the 34-year-old actor Megalyn Echikunwoke, invokes the very phrase – “the help” – critics pre-emptively leveraged against the movie. But for all its topicality, Step Sisters is a bit underwhelming, although it makes for entertaining lite fare in the vein of Pitch Perfect or Bring It On, and the choreography is first-rate. Hayward wrote three episodes of Netflix’s Dear White People, the first season of which was searing, funny and smart. Adapted from Justin Simien’s 2014 film of the same name, the show was, like Get Out, American Vandal and parts of Master of None, an acutely perceptive take on the zeitgeist, or at least a millennial slice of it. It wasn’t just a “woke” show, but a show about the difference between people who are woke and people who see wokeness as a sort of self-enhancing accessory, a box to be checked. This brand of hoity-toity progressivism is at its apex on liberal college campuses. Step Sisters tries to straddle a similar line, and it has a lot to say about race, sorority life, and sisterhood, but its characters are not so much real people as mere vessels for different viewpoints, most of which the film avoids either celebrating or admonishing. There’s Jamilah, of course, an overachiever who pretty much ditches her sorority/step-team at Westcott University to teach the sub-rhythmic white girls how to dance; there’s her boyfriend Dane, played by Matt McGorry, as a performatively woke version of himself; plus Danielle (Lyndon Smith), the tyrannical chapter head of Sigma Beta Beta and Saundra (Nia Jervier) as the only person of color in SBB; Marque Richardson from Dear White People also appears, and Robert Curtis Brown, last seen in a minor role on The Handmaid’s Tale, plays an openly gay dean who discloses far too much about his sex life to Jamilah. I’m not sure that the ending will sufficiently address the doubts of the movie’s many naysayers. It is, after all, a pat, feelgood story, not designed to ruffle feathers. But given that its subject is no less than the campus politics of cultural appropriation, which looms large in the age of Rachel Dolezal, the hearty conclusions Step Sisters draws feel like one big cop-out, the same way you want a parent to pick a side when you’re fighting with a sibling, not tell you both to kiss and make up. This is surprising, given that the production team on Step Sisters consists of folks who contributed to more daring projects. But to enjoy the movie one would have to approach it looking for fun, a traditional underdog narrative, as opposed to, say, trenchant sociological critique. In that way, Step Sisters is, well, not so egregious a misstep.

After the postwar Attlee government and before Margaret Thatcher’s long reign in British politics, decisions about the relationship between the public and private sectors were often practical compromises, not ideological fixations. Government’s role was always and necessarily central, but it could be flexible about forms of ownership and systems of regulation and governance. At first, even Mrs Thatcher only argued that it was reasonable for private companies to compete to provide public services. Since the Thatcher era, habits, assumptions and arguments have relentlessly ossified. Part of this is political – the post-Thatcher generation of politicians faced publics that could prefer private to public (in housing, notably), lower taxes to higher ones, and disliked overmighty trade unions. Part of it is economic – the decline of the industrially based, sometimes publicly owned, economy with strong collective bargaining and the growth, in its place, of a globalised and financially led service sector, often offshore, driven by shareholder value and characterised by hyper-rewards for management and low pay and insecurity for many employees. The upshot, nearly 40 years on, is that governments have behaved as though they are historically powerless to control the terms on which public goods are provided. In fact, only government is powerful enough to set those terms. The collapse of Carillion has exemplified the historic failure of many of these increasingly embedded assumptions. This week’s report from the National Audit Office on “the rationale, costs and benefits” of the private finance initiative offers further and eloquent evidence that this is an arena of public policy in which the imbalance of power and interest have become unsustainable. Major change is now needed. It is a historic political economic necessity for this country. Whatever the initial claims, PFI schemes as they have evolved have simply not worked. The NAO report shows, with great clarity, how future generations have been landed in some PFI cases with billions in extra costs for little clear public benefit. Part of this can be explained by government’s poor record in contract negotiations, which should caution against any assumption that publicly owned bodies will inevitably do things better. Yet, where once the argument for private capital’s role was that competition would help to provide better public services for less cost, now the reality is that competition can often provide worse for more. What was once trumpeted as a more efficient process for building the roads, railways, hospitals, schools, prisons and public offices that Britain needs, has in many cases become its opposite, bad value for public money. “Our vision is to help the nation spend wisely,” says the NAO. Its report says the nation is spending a lot without knowing if it is good value. Jeremy Corbyn increasingly speaks for the many who understand that Britain has reached a crossroads in the financing of public services. In his Guardian interview today, the Labour leader trenchantly attacks the “outsourcing racket” and the “dogma of privatisation” and advocates a “public preferred” approach in which outsourcing is restricted to failing services, with all existing PFI contracts reviewed. Mr Corbyn grasps the seriousness of the issue and the new public mood. This gives him a huge advantage over opponents who remain in denial. It is right to review the distortions that current systems of outsourcing and bidding have created; right also to think again. It is also vital to remake a case for taxation and borrowing that make necessary projects possible without squeezing modest incomes and plunging the public realm into excessive debt. Yet the public sector is likely to always buy things from private firms; it will often use them to build houses, schools and railways. Detailed work is still needed here before Mr Corbyn’s solutions, which risk being dogmatic in their own way, manage to persuade a public that is rightly restless for change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/19/nuclear-weapons-uk-defence-review-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T10:00:20Z","webTitle":"Forget Britain’s nuclear deterrent – here’s what Russia is really afraid of | Mark Galeotti","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/19/nuclear-weapons-uk-defence-review-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/19/nuclear-weapons-uk-defence-review-russia","fields":{"headline":"Forget Britain’s nuclear deterrent – here’s what Russia is really afraid of","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"British defence spending and capabilities are in the middle of a bitter review in which the potential threat from Russia is frequently invoked, whether that means cutting ocean-bottom internet cables, flying bombers into our airspace, or invading Nato territory. Russia is – to use a word of the day – being weaponised in the name of particular service interests and justifying big-ticket new systems. Nonetheless, given that Russia is the most serious aggressor the UK might have to face, it is striking how little discussion there has been about what kind of British military capabilities genuinely concern Russian soldiers and planners. Insofar as one can glean lessons from their military writings, and courtesy of my own conversations with Russian officers, both serving and retired, I can see three definite concerns of theirs and one glaring omission. The suggestion that the UK merges and shrinks its special and intervention forces would no doubt be roundly cheered in the Russian general staff’s massive building on Znamenka Street, Moscow. As a recently retired officer from its planning directorate once said to me, with more enthusiasm than originality: “Britain has always had the best light infantry in the world, and the bastards get places faster than we would like.” Tanks are great for fighting other tanks, but there is little serious likelihood of a full-scale land war between Russia and Nato. For everything else, from flag-flying and humanitarian intervention, to heading off Crimea-style landgrabs, where what matters is getting to the battlefield when it counts, rather than too late, the special forces, Royal Marines and paras are hard to beat. These forces also suit post-Brexit geopolitics. They allow the UK to achieve its usual aim of “punching above its weight” and, blasphemy though it may be, make the French happy. On a recent trip to the French defence ministry, I repeatedly heard concerns that Brexit leaves France as the last EU country with the will and the forces to mount serious out-of-area operations. If we are still potential partners, that gives us credibility – and leverage. In a way, the Russians have a similar perspective on the Royal Navy. What bothers them is not our massive new aircraft carrier, which one naval officer said would make a great “missile magnet” in time of war. Rather, the concern is about smaller, lighter forces. Submarines that can contest the northern waters. Frigates able to both protect our coastlines and project power abroad. Simply having the number of ships to keep enough deployed at any one time. As the officer continued: “If your navy is essentially one carrier battle group, you can do one thing well, but nothing else.” Thirdly, it is not just specific forces and units that the Russians believe gives the UK its edge, but training and morale. Russian successes in Crimea and Syria partly represent an unfamiliar new emphasis on the human side of their military. Britain’s problems of having to scrimp on training and overstretch its forces have not gone unnoticed. One Russian noted that “these days, the Europeans have armies but no soldiers, while the British have always had soldiers” – he actually used the word boets, which really means something closer to “warriors” – “so why would they want to lose that?” Why indeed? Of course there are many other facets essential to the UK’s defence capability. What doesn’t seem to worry the Russians? Not once have I heard any taking our “independent nuclear deterrent” seriously. For all kinds of reasons, this is currently not under serious debate – though taking its cost out of the defence budget would make a massive difference – but let us not pretend it is because Moscow thinks it matters. The defence review must consider British interests in the round, of course. But if deterring the Russians is a major concern, then it is worth paying attention to what might really deter them: a flexible, fast-moving and versatile force of true professionals. Not necessarily with the heaviest kit, the biggest ships or the priciest aircraft, but able to get where they are needed, when they are needed. • Dr Mark Galeotti is a senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague and head of its Centre for European Security"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/18/larry-nassar-abuse-usa-gymnastics-judge-letter","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T18:37:12Z","webTitle":"'You are pure evil': Larry Nassar says it’s too hard to listen to victim statements","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/18/larry-nassar-abuse-usa-gymnastics-judge-letter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/18/larry-nassar-abuse-usa-gymnastics-judge-letter","fields":{"headline":"'You are pure evil': Larry Nassar says it’s too hard to listen to victim statements","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor accused of sexually abusing more than 140 girls and women, was rebuked for a half hour during his sentencing hearing on Thursday after telling a judge that it was too difficult for him to listen to the victim impact statements. Judge Rosemarie Aquilina read the six-page, single-spaced letter aloud in court on Thursday, in which Nassar stated he feared for his mental health amid the parade of victims speaking out against him and accused the judge of grandstanding and turning the hearing into a “media circus” by placing him in the witness box to face his victims in view of the cameras. “I have to say this isn’t worth the paper it’s written on,” Aquilina said on Thursday. “You may find it harsh that you are here listening, but nothing is as harsh as what your victims endured for thousands of hours at your hands.” The judge dismissed the letter as “mumbo jumbo” on the third day of statements from the more than 100 of Nassar’s victims who signed up to appear in the courtroom and tell their stories or have their words read into the court record. “Spending four or five days listening to them is minor, considering the hours of pleasure you’ve had at their expense, ruining their lives,” Aquilina said. Nassar, who last month was sentenced to 60 years in federal prison in a separate case regarding child abuse images, faces an additional minimum sentence of 25 to 40 years after admitting to molesting girls at Michigan State University and his home under the guise of medical treatment. Jamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympic bronze medalist who was one of the first women to publicly accuse the longtime team doctor, described her struggles with “anorexia, bulimia, and depression so severe that I was hospitalized for attempting suicide”, saying she never understood why she was struggling but realized after speaking with a friend that Nassar’s “treatments” constituted abuse. “I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me,” Dantzscher said. “Why I was struggling so much. Why I didn’t feel proud of my accomplishments. I had zero self confidence.” She added: “You are pure evil.” McKayla Maroney, who helped the US gymnastics team known as the Fierce Five to a gold medal at the London Olympics and added an individual silver in the vault, said Nassar “left scars on my psyche that may never go away” in a statement read by a prosecutor. “It is my hope that law enforcement agencies will not close the book on this once Nassar is sentenced,” she said. “USA Gymnastics, Michigan State and the US Olympic Committee must be held accountable for enabling him.” Maroney is one of several Olympic champions, including Simone Biles, who say they were abused by Nassar. Lindsey Lemke, a former Michigan State gymnast, addressed Nassar directly but also levelled criticism on those she believed were complicit in the disgraced physician’s crimes. She called former USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny a “coward” and attacked club coach John Geddert as a “disgrace” since many instance of the abuse were alleged to have taken place at his Twistars Gym. Lemke also criticized Kathie Klages, Michigan State’s former women’s gymnastics coach, who allegedly was told of abuse in 1997 and remained silent for years, saying the Lansing university “created an environment where victims were afraid to speak up”. The statements from Dantzscher, Maroney and Lemke were the only victims to be heard before lunch recess was called after an onlooker vomited in the courtroom during testimony. Later Thursday, USA Gymnastics announced it had terminated its agreement with the Karolyi Ranch, which has served as the national team training center since 2001 and where many of Nassar’s crimes were alleged to have taken places. “It has been my intent to terminate this agreement since I began as president and CEO in December,” Kerry Perry, president and CEO of the governing body said. “Our most important priority is our athletes, and their training environment must reflect this. We are committed to a culture that empowers and supports our athletes. “We have cancelled next week’s training camp for the US women’s national team. We are exploring alternative sites to host training activities and camps until a permanent location is determined. We thank all those in the gymnastics community assisting in these efforts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/19/europe-wake-up-drastic-financial-consequences-hard-brexit-netherlands-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"Europe must wake up to the drastic consequences of a hard Brexit | Joris Luyendijk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/19/europe-wake-up-drastic-financial-consequences-hard-brexit-netherlands-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/19/europe-wake-up-drastic-financial-consequences-hard-brexit-netherlands-uk","fields":{"headline":"Europe must wake up to the drastic consequences of a hard Brexit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Because it is such a riveting clown show with new crazy episodes almost every day, Europeans can be forgiven for ignoring the fact that Brexit is going to hurt them too. But as the date of Britain’s departure comes closer and Theresa May’s government continues its kamikaze policy of demanding the politically unthinkable from the EU, it is time for Europeans to wake and begin preparing for the worst. On Thursday the Dutch government published a report drawn up by the consultancy firm KPMG analysing the consequences of a “no-deal” Brexit in which the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March 2019. Here are the practical implications and cold numbers behind the hot-headed rhetoric about no deal with the EU being “better than a bad deal” for Britain: should the UK “crash” out of the EU by late March 2019 the Dutch companies trading with the UK will have to secure a total of no less than 4.2m exporting and 750,000 importing licences. If by this time both states have a functioning customs system in place – a big if for this consistently incompetent UK government – costs for companies are between €80 and €130. That is per licence. The price tag for all this new red tape is €600m for the Dutch side alone. This excludes the costs of new export and import tariffs, VAT and other new “sector-specific” barriers for trading with the UK. The 35,000 small and medium-sized businesses unused to trading with non-EU countries also face an estimated cost of €20,000-€50,000 to adapt their IT systems. Added to this, warns the report, must be the likely effects of the inevitable economic slowdown, or worse, in Britain. When the country leaves without a deal it must “fall back” on the minimal World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules for trade. But financial services and aviation fall outside the WTO regime, meaning that after a British no-deal departure both sectors must stop trading with the EU overnight. Between Amsterdam Schiphol airport and London alone there are currently 60 flights a day – one every 15 minutes. Much like Donald Trump, the Brexiteers have proven themselves immune to information or insight that does not meet their emotional needs. This must be why they continue to hope and insist that in order to avoid this proliferation of new barriers to trade, the EU will relent and allow Britain to have its cake and eat it – to forget about the obligations of EU membership while continuing to enjoy its many advantages. This simply will not happen. Even the ardently pro-British Dutch government has made clear again that the choice for Britain is simple. It can buckle and accept the EU’s conditions for continued “frictionless trade”, or it becomes a “third country” on the periphery of Europe – like Morocco or Turkey, except that Turkey will have more privileges because of its customs union with the EU. About 200,000 Dutch jobs are involved in trade with the UK and, according to calculations by the prestigious government agency CPB, a hard Brexit could make every Dutch person poorer by an average of €1,000. And yet, the Dutch government did not use the report to make the case for concessions to Britain. Instead economics minister Mona Keijzer simply said that “it is up to businesses to start preparing”. It also called on government agencies to get ready. The logic is simple: while the economic shock of a British crash out of the EU will hurt the Dutch economy, blowing up the EU from within by giving Britain a sweet special deal is even more damaging. Because that will encourage each of the 27 remaining member states to seek its own exceptions. Over time this will make the unravelling of the EU single market a near-certainty. So next time you hear a Brexiteer proudly declare that “no deal is better than a bad deal”, remember that for once this Brexiteer is correct. Not as far as Britain is concerned of course because “no deal” for the UK means the severe disruption of not just one trade flow – as it is for the Netherlands – but of 27. However, for EU member states the negative economic fallout of a British crash departure is far more preferable than the utter catastrophe of the single market imploding. Painful as it will be, no deal with Britain is indeed better for the EU than a bad deal. • Joris Luyendijk is a Dutch journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/19/government-major-environmental-assessment-uk-seas-defra-post-brexit-fisheries-plan-coldwater-reefs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T12:08:43Z","webTitle":"Government to carry out major environmental assessment of UK seas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/19/government-major-environmental-assessment-uk-seas-defra-post-brexit-fisheries-plan-coldwater-reefs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/19/government-major-environmental-assessment-uk-seas-defra-post-brexit-fisheries-plan-coldwater-reefs","fields":{"headline":"Government to carry out major environmental assessment of UK seas","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An assessment of the seas around the UK will carried out by the government and made available online, the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has promised, with a view to cleaning up and improving the inshore environment. Thérèse Coffey, a Defra minister, said that by the end of this year “a major assessment of how our seas have moved towards good environmental status” would be completed. This assessment, which would be accompanied by an online tool that the general public could use to examine progress on the marine environment and the pressures it is under, is expected to inform future marine policy. Licensing and planning systems for coastal and marine areas will also be overhauled. This could affect coastal developments, including those of potential offshore wind sites. She also said a full series of marine plans covering the whole of the UK’s coast would be completed by 2021, and said that the UK’s often-overlooked coldwater coral reefs would take precedence this year, which has been designated international year of the reef. With Brexit looming and little detail so far on what fishing policies might replace the EU’s common fisheries policy in UK waters, Coffey promised that long term sustainability would be paramount. However, she admitted that only 30% of the fisheries exploited by the UK were currently within sustainability limits. She gave no indication of what level of exploitation a post-Brexit fisheries plan would allow, and concentrated her comments instead on species that are not generally used for food. Coffey said: “The proportion of large fish in the North Sea has climbed steadily since 2010 to levels not seen since the 1980s. We must still seek to ease the impact of human activity, however, particularly on seabed habitats and fish populations. An ecosystems approach to fisheries management will account for, and seek to minimise, impacts on non-commercial species and the marine environment generally, including through technical conservation measures.” The minister also repeated plans, set out by the Commonwealth secretary general Patricia Scotland last year, for a “blue charter” for Commonwealth nations, to be adopted at their meeting in April. This will involve commitments on the reduction of plastic waste entering the seas from Commonwealth countries. Coffey was speaking at the Coastal Futures conference in London, a long-running annual event focusing on marine management."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/18/battersea-power-station-to-be-sold-for-16bn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T19:24:26Z","webTitle":"Battersea Power Station to be sold for £1.6bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/battersea-power-station-to-be-sold-for-16bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/18/battersea-power-station-to-be-sold-for-16bn","fields":{"headline":"Battersea Power Station to be sold for £1.6bn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Battersea Power Station is to be sold for £1.6bn in one of Britain’s largest ever property deals. Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), alongside Employees Provident Fund of Malaysia, have announced their intention to purchase the Grade II listed building, Battersea Power Station Development Company said in a statement on Thursday. The £1.6bn sale will transfer ownership of Battersea Power Station, but not the 42 acre site around the building, overtaking the £1.28bn paid by Chinese investors for the Walkie Talkie building in London last year. Development is continuing at the mixed use regeneration project, which will include retail and leisure units, commercial space, and 250 apartments, which have already been sold. A company source insisted that the deal with the Malaysian investors is not linked to reported financial difficulties on the project, but rather a benefit of Apple’s decision to base their UK headquarters in the former coal-fired power station’s central boiler house from 2021, which has guaranteed a future income stream. The project’s current affordable housing provision would be unaffected by the proposed deal, the source added, which was slashed from 636 homes to just 386 last year, amounting to 9% of the planned homes in the Battersea Power Station redevelopment project. Building projects across London have faced rising constructions costs as a result of the drop in the value of sterling after the Brexit vote, and increased difficulties in attracting skilled labourers. After the proposed deal was announced on the Malaysian stock exchange, a BPSDC spokesperson said: “The Battersea Power Station building would provide both investors with a unique investment opportunity to own an iconic development in the heart of London. “With the conclusion of the proposed transaction, BPSDC will remain the active manager of the development. This creates a solid platform that will ensure the protection, active management and control of the historically important building are maintained.” Battersea Power Station opened in 1933, but the generator was not completed until 1953 after construction was delayed by the second world war. The power station generated 20% of London’s electricity supply at its peak, until it stopped producing power in 1983. “The Malaysian shareholders purchased the site in September 2012 and have since made significant progress including the successful completion of the first phase of the development which is now home to over 1,000 residents and a collection of independent retailers and restaurateurs,” a BPSDC spokesperson added. “The proposed new [financial] structure will not affect the shareholdings of Sime Darby Property, S P Setia and EPF in the Battersea Project Holding Company (the joint venture company which is the holding company of the Battersea project).” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/18/peter-preston-the-wordsmith-magician","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T19:03:59Z","webTitle":"Peter Preston, the wordsmith magician | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/18/peter-preston-the-wordsmith-magician","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/18/peter-preston-the-wordsmith-magician","fields":{"headline":"Peter Preston, the wordsmith magician","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I was pleased to note Alan Travis’s reference to Peter Preston’s membership of the Magic Circle (A colleague, an editor and a friend.

The NHS received the money from the sustainability and transformation fund in 2016-17. It was meant to set up structures in order to survive on less money from 2017-18 onwards, the National Audit Office said. The cash was instead spent by NHS England to keep the service afloat, auditors said, prompting questions about the government’s preparedness for future financial crises. Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said the findings were shocking for those people affected this winter by overcrowded hospitals and cancelled operations. “The committee has called for a long-term plan for the NHS – the recent winter crisis hammers home why this is so vital,” she said. “The Department of Health’s recent cash injections have been spent on patching up the problems, not preparing it for the future.” Since the NHS was formed in 1948, health spending in real terms has increased by 3.7% a year on average. This rate of increase has slowed since 2010, the report said, and the NHS England budget will increase by an average of 1.9% a year between 2014-15 and 2020-21. The NHS was given the additional £1.8bn in preparation for the service having to survive on significantly less, the report said. It was also intended to give it stability to improve performance and transform services, in order to achieve a sustainable health system. The money helped the NHS improve its financial position, auditors said. The combined trust deficit reduced from £2.4bn in 2015-16 to £791m in 2016-17, they said. Despite its overall financial position improving, the report said the health service was struggling to manage increased activity and demand within its budget and had failed to meet NHS access targets. Programmes meant to rebalance its finances have restricted money available for longer-term transformation, the NAO said, which is essential for the NHS to meet demand, drive efficiencies and improve the service. One example given in the report said the Department of Health had transferred £1.2bn of its £5.8bn budget for capital projects towards funding the day-to-day activities of NHS bodies. Some trusts are receiving in-year cash injections, most of which are loans from the department, which have worsened rather than improved their financial performance, the report found. Extra cash support increased from £2.4bn in 2015-16 to £3.1bn in 2016-17. Auditors warned that “repeated short-term funding boosts could turn into the new normal”, even though funding with a long-term plan would be more effective."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/19/corbyn-lead-momentum-labour-ladder-leftwing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T06:10:15Z","webTitle":"This is not a Corbynite coup, it’s a mandate for his radical agenda | Gary Younge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/19/corbyn-lead-momentum-labour-ladder-leftwing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/19/corbyn-lead-momentum-labour-ladder-leftwing","fields":{"headline":"This is not a Corbynite coup, it’s a mandate for his radical agenda","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Kings were put to death long before 21 January 1793,” wrote Albert Camus, referring to Louis XVI’s execution after the French revolution. “But regicides of earlier times and their followers were interested in attacking the person, not the principle, of the king. They wanted another king, and that was all.” One of the biggest mistakes the critics of Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, made from the outset – and there are many to choose from – was that his victory was about him. They refer to “Corbynites” and “Corbynistas” as though there were some undying and uncritical devotion to a man and his singular philosophy, rather than broad support for an agenda and a trajectory. If they could get rid of the king, went the logic, they would reinherit the kingdom. With a new leader normal service could resume. Labour could resuscitate its programme of milquetoast managerialism, whereby it was indifferent to its members, ambivalent about austerity at home, and hawkish about wars abroad. This week’s resounding victory of a slate of leftwing candidates to Labour’s national executive committee, the party’s ruling body, has put that assumption to rest for the moment. There is now a reliable majority on the NEC who back both democratising the party, to give members more control, and pursuing policies against austerity and war and for wealth redistribution. That this should have happened in the week of Carillion’s collapse has a certain symmetry. Carillion took billions in public funds for public projects, paid its executives and shareholders handsomely, and has now left taxpayers to pick up the pieces in a system of private finance initiatives introduced by Conservatives but championed and vastly expanded by New Labour. It was anger at this kind of rank unfairness, the inequalities it both illustrated and imposed after the economic crash, that explains not just Corbyn’s victory but the rise of the hard left across Europe and in the US. The contradictions inherent in Corbyn’s rise are finally ironing themselves out. In 2015 he won not the leadership but the title of leader. Unlike Podemos in Spain or Syriza in Greece, his ascent was not the product of a movement that could sustain his challenge from the margins; instead he emerged from a wider, inchoate sense of frustration and alienation that propelled him to the top within the mainstream. Without the consent of MPs he lacked the authority that would endow that title with power and meaning in parliament. Outside parliament he lacked the kind of organised support that could buttress his position against this hostility. This left him embattled, isolated and, to some extent, ineffective, since his primary task was not to exercise leadership but to cling on to it. Last year’s general election changed all that. Labour’s gains, with its highest vote-share since 2001 leaving the Tories without a majority, proved that there was a broad electoral constituency for his redistributive, anti-austerity agenda. In so doing it showed that the membership was far more in touch with the needs and aspirations of the electorate than the parliamentarians. Now, with the shadow cabinet no longer in open revolt, the parliamentary party quiescent, if not onside, and the party machine no longer obstructive, at almost every tier the party has either come around or made its peace with him. Meanwhile, outside parliament, Momentum – the leftwing caucus within the party that supports Corbyn’s agenda – has become more organised and less fractious, providing a more coherent plank of support beyond Westminster. Finally, Corbyn can do what he was elected to do – lead on the agenda he has laid out. Leftwing control of the NEC was one of the last pieces to fall into place. Since the three candidates who won this week were backed by Momentum, and one – Jon Lansman – is its founder, this latest shift will inevitably provoke some bedwetting. Those who have got everything wrong about Labour over the past two years will, of course, get this wrong too. We must once again brace ourselves for rhetorical hyperbole. Corbyn has been accused of tightening his grip on the party so that he may purge critics and promote cronies. The logic is perverse. The Stalinists, in the minds of his most feverish critics, are the ones who keep winning internal elections hands down; the democrats are those who launched a coup against the popular choice. The obsession, among parliamentarians and their courtiers, is that this latest development will lead to a wave of deselections (or purges) in which MPs hostile to this new orientation will be forced out. There is some irony in the notion that those who tried to depose an elected leader with a huge mandate might bristle at the prospect of being removed by an election. For now, that fear seems unfounded. While Momentum certainly believes MPs should be more accountable to their local parties, there is little evidence that this is a strategic priority (which doesn’t mean some local chapters might not pursue it). Corbyn’s team is not keen either, believing the pain rarely justifies the gain. This is a relief. Another election could be upon us at any moment. The party does not need more trauma. Moreover, the gains are likely to be minimal. Corbyn is not king; his word is not law. The moment has tipped in his favour, not swung to him completely. And while the party may have made its peace with him, Momentum still sits outside its comfort zone. According to the website Labourlist, of the 24 key marginals to be contested so far, Momentum candidates have won in just five, while a further six have gone to candidates from the “wider Labour left”. The rest have been taken by “trade unionists, longstanding local campaigners and former [candidates]”. Momentum’s focus is instead on funding organisers to transform the party into a social movement by connecting it with local campaigns – be they over caretakers’ pay, or cuts to schools and hospitals. For those whose understanding of politics and power is limited to elections and parliament, this will seem at best a waste of time. But anything that engages members, be they new or longstanding, in activities that make Labour more dynamic and receptive to the outside world should be welcomed. This would fulfil one of three central challenges for Momentum in the foreseeable future. The second is to deploy all its resources – digital, human, organisational – to help Labour win at the next election. The third is to establish some independence from the Labour leadership, so that it can continue to advocate for a left agenda, should the party come to power. However confused the left might be about where power resides, the right understands that a range of vested interests, from big business to hot money, can force parliament’s hand and thwart the popular will. Like most radical governments, Labour will have to negotiate between the powers that be and the forces that made them possible. Corbyn is not king. It was pressure from below that made him possible. It will be pressure from below that keeps him viable. • Gary Younge is editor-at-large for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/27/voices-by-nick-coleman-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T07:30:44Z","webTitle":"Voices by Nick Coleman review – an enthusiastic history of the best pop singers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/27/voices-by-nick-coleman-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/27/voices-by-nick-coleman-review","fields":{"headline":"Voices by Nick Coleman review – an enthusiastic history of the best pop singers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nick Coleman loves voices, in particular those of the singers who rose above the babble of life in the second half of the 20th century to create the great outpouring of pop music that evolved, as he points out, from the unreflecting entertainment of the Beatles’ first album to the poetic soul searching of Van Morrison’s Astral Weeks in barely five years. Those examples are the brackets chosen by Coleman, a journalist and critic, to define the sheer velocity of pop’s evolution in the 1960s. Its gathering sense of seriousness is illustrated, in his account of the voices he most loves, by a pair of records from a single source, Bob Dylan. The first, performed in a Greenwich Village folk club in 1962, is a version of “No More Auction Block”, an 18th-century spiritual; the second, recorded 20 years later, is a Dylan original called “Blind Willie McTell”, a panoramic survey of a nation that began with the near extermination of its indigenous people and fed itself on the proceeds of slavery. Works such as these exemplify a phenomenon: “It was as if beneath pop’s brightly coloured, ever-busy materialist surface, something slower and graver was taking hold,” he writes. Coleman thinks hard about such matters, and in recent times his thoughts have been focused and intensified by misfortune. Ten years ago, he went deaf, permanently in one ear, intermittently in the other. An earlier book, The Train in the Night, dealt thoroughly with his experience, which is mentioned only in the epilogue of Voices. This new set of thoughts took shape during a brief period when the illness receded sufficiently to allow him to binge, albeit through one ear, on the stuff that had once supplied his life with, in his own words, a psychological mainstay. What came out of that binge was a desire to enumerate the voices that had been important to him since he first encountered music as a boy chorister and a pop fan born at the start of the 1960s, and to make sense of their effect. He gives a central role to the British singers rooted in a love of R&amp;B and soul music, all of them deeply serious about their calling, whether “sonorous, raw-knuckled urchins” such as Eric Burdon and Chris Farlowe, or those who, including Morrison and Steve Winwood, were “like muezzins calling the faithful to prayer from a remote place”. “These were voices – no longer confined to the stage of the Royal Court – suggesting that struggle, anxiety, lust, self-absorption, resentment, low mood, high spirits, bad faith and recalcitrance were living manifestly among us in this very place.” They belonged to “the emotional curriculum of our own era, doing service in the front line of British life alongside the stiff upper lip and the deferential simper”. But this is not really a book held together by a unified theory of pop history. It’s more a series of portraits of his favourite singers, who include some choices with an air of inevitability about them – Little Richard, Joni Mitchell, Aretha Franklin – and some less obvious candidates, such as Mary Margaret O’Hara, George Jones, Winston Rodney and – hallelujah! – Gladys Knight. Sometimes his descriptions of the sound and the effect hit the target perfectly. The Shangri-Las’ hits displayed the Bronx teenagers’ “apparent lack of concern with anything remotely resembling elegance or maturity or sophistication or empathy”. The Ramones were “the sound of bullying from the point of view of the bullied”. The songs of Roy Orbison “were like strange 3D sonic sculptures you might walk around and poke. You could enter them, as you might enter a ghost ride at a fairground.” Donald Fagen’s voice “splashed human corruptibility over the polished surfaces of Steely Dan’s music”. Expanding the definition of “voice”, there’s also a chapter on jazz instrumentalists. This gives him an excuse to suggest that jazz musicians work so hard to perfect their skills in order that “they can never be caught out with nothing to say” – which is amusing, if not really profound. Much sharper is his observation that “rock music, as constructed by the Rolling Stones for the British audience and then a wider international one in the 1960s, was never a music of intimate connection but an animated description of life as it is lived on the edge of its own times … an account of an experience, not an appeal to the heart.” In the circumstances, you can hardly blame Coleman for occasionally letting his ideas and enthusiasm run wild. Many of his readers will find their enjoyment of the book extended by the need to keep getting up and finding the record he’s writing about, or perhaps locating it via Spotify – but that’s not really the same thing, is it?

She cannot phone the council to complain because she is renting from one of the town’s many private landlords, who have taken advantage of the right-to-buy policy to hoover up social housing and turn them into highly profitable rental investments. “I would love a place I could call home – this is just a house to me. When we first moved in we put a lot of effort into making it nice but my landlord could give us a section 21 notice and we would be out in a couple of months,” she says, curled up on a small couch in her sitting room to keep warm. She longs for security and an affordable rent. But when the town is unable to find council homes for homeless families, it is simply not an option. Instead Elina – a volunteer youth worker, who cannot work full-time due to a serious neurological condition – has to fork out £800 a month in rent, which is nearly double what her neighbouring council tenants pay. This eats into her meagre benefits, leaving her with little to spend on anything else. “We have to plan if the kids need an extra pair of shoes or if we want a day out together,” the 32-year-old says with an embarrassed laugh. “We’ve never had a holiday here. A day at the sea in the summer and a tenner in the arcade is our holiday.” Elina is far from unusual in renting an ex-council house from a buy-to-let landlord. Last month a freedom of information request by Inside Housing magazine found that 70.9% of the council homes in Milton Keynes sold under right to buy are now being rented out privately. This is considerably more than average rate of 40.2% and higher than anywhere else in the country, leading the town to be dubbed the “right-to-buy-to-let” capital of England. This is very far from Margaret Thatcher’s dream of a property-owning democracy. Nearly 1.8m council homes have been sold off since the 1980s, and Theresa May is moving ahead with plans to fund an extension of the right to housing association tenants. In Milton Keynes council’s low-rise brick HQ, the Labour leader, Peter Marland, attributes the town’s dubious honour to the large numbers of relatively cheap and sizable houses on estates in the town centre. “Many of these estates are in prime locations but people don’t want to live there because they have picked up bad reputations,” he says. “So, when people, who had brought their properties, moved, their homes were then often sold to buy-to-let landlords.” Estate agents are currently selling four-bedroom ex-council properties for £180,000 in Netherfield and cards in the estate’s off-licence window suggest landlords charge £400 for each room, potentially bringing in £1,600 a month. That is nearly four times the average council rent for a four-bedroom house in Milton Keynes, about £450 a month. Since 2001 more than 2,400 Milton Keynes council houses have been sold under right to buy, and Marland claims private landlords are abusing a system intended to give council tenants the option to purchase their own home, rather than a lucrative investment for landlords. “It is an abuse of the right-to-buy system,” he says. “To me it is fundamentally wrong.” Ongoing sales have led to a desperate shortage of the most affordable and secure type of homes in the town. “If you are having stock removed and demand is going up then it is going to be harder to house people,” says Marland. The number of families placed in short-term accommodation has ballooned by more than 710% since 2010. There are currently 681 households in temporary accommodation in Milton Keynes, including private lets, B&amp;Bs and hotels. The cost to taxpayers is spiralling, with Milton Keynes now facing a bill of about £7m a year, compared with the £200,000 the council spent in 2010. It has also made it harder to offer rough sleepers – who bed down in ramshackle encampments in the new town’s pedestrian underpasses. The yearly count of rough sleepers in the town, which is thought to underestimate the scale of the problem, reveals an eight-fold increase, with 48 people recorded in November – up from six in 2010. “If you can’t even meet your statutory responsibilities, which is generally to families with children, then you can’t give a council house to a single man,’ says Marland. But it’s not just people on the breadline who are being hit by the town’s housing crisis. Near the entrance to Milton Keynes’ sprawling university hospital sits NHS complaints administrator and mother of three, Dawn Jones. She and her husband have reasonably well-paid jobs, but when their landlord decided to sell the house they had been renting for seven years they couldn’t find anywhere they could afford. “My husband and I have worked all our lives. We don’t fit the usual stereotype. But it’s a very common story,” she says, taking a break from answering calls from upset patients. “We got into debt and couldn’t pass credit checks.” The end of private tenancies, rather than family breakup, is now the single biggest cause of homelessness in the town. Many of the people who come to the council for help are working. Dawn’s family have been staying in a property leased by the council on the fringes of the town since March. Although they feel fortunate to have a roof over their heads, living in the limbo of temporary accommodation has been hard, especially for the children. “The kids are in a downward spiral. My daughter has started self-harming. My son feels suicidal,’ she says. “Mentally, it’s a damaging place to be because nobody wants to feel like they have failed.” On Milton Keynes’ Netherfield estate, the couple running the local residents’ association, Janette and Eamonn Bobey, accuse buy-to-let landlords of ruining the estate by shoddily converting family houses into bedsits, often without informing the council. “There are about seven registered houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) on the estate but there about 80 to 100 in reality,” says Janette, who has lived in the estate for 25 years. Driveways on almost every street are littered with used, rotting mattresses and overflowing bins – a tell-tale sign that buy-to-let speculators have moved in. “The estate is more transient now. Nobody seems to know anyone any more because there is such a high turnover,” adds Janette. The same has happened to other town centre estates, where at least 300 large homes have been turned into bedsits. “Estates like Netherfield, Conniburrow and Fishermead are good for landlords turning houses into multiple occupation because of the size of the properties,” says Janette. “Many have garages that can be turned into a bedroom.” Theresa May has repeatedly claimed that council homes sold under the increased right-to-buy discount should be replaced. But English councils have lost 57,520 council homes since 2012 and only started 13,623 affordable homes. The government likes to exclude those council homes it judges would have been sold anyway – but even taking this into account the National Audit Office estimates there would need to be a fivefold increase in council house building by the end of 2018 to replace all those lost. Council leader Peter Marland scoffs at May’s claim that councils are replacing homes. Milton Keynes has only managed to build 22 replacement homes since 2012. “Every council wants to build houses because there is a need there. We are not doing it because we can’t afford to do it,” he says. Given Milton Keynes’ history as a new town, the worsening crisis makes Marland angry: “It is an outrage in 2018 that we cannot house people in a town that was built on a utilitarian vision to give everybody a good home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/18/vince-cable-disgusted-with-fca-over-rbs-mistreatment-of-small-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T18:52:55Z","webTitle":"Vince Cable 'disgusted' with FCA over RBS mistreatment of small firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/vince-cable-disgusted-with-fca-over-rbs-mistreatment-of-small-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/18/vince-cable-disgusted-with-fca-over-rbs-mistreatment-of-small-firms","fields":{"headline":"Vince Cable 'disgusted' with FCA over RBS mistreatment of small firms","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vince Cable has attacked the City watchdog for failing to publish a full report into the mistreatment of small businesses by the Royal Bank of Scotland, as MPs lined up to condemn the bank in parliament. The leader of the Liberal Democrats expressed “disgust” that passages of a damning report by the Financial Conduct Authority had not been released, four-and-a-half years after he first referred the case to the regulator during his time in the coalition government. The FCA published most of its report into RBS’s global restructuring group (GRG), which is alleged to have driven small firms to the wall in pursuit of profit, but left out a section about the bank’s management team. Cable used parliamentary privilege to name former RBS employee Nathan Bostock – who is now chief executive of Santander UK – as one of the bankers “responsible” for a policy that unpublished passages of the report allege management would, or should, have known would lead to the mistreatment of customers. “If the reported passage from the full report is correct, then questions have to be raised over the management who were responsible for GRG. The FCA must also then disclose who they think is responsible,” he added. Labour MP Clive Lewis called for the public debate in parliament on Thursday over the issues at the bank, which first arose several years ago. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called “Just Hit Budget!” sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies – many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis – as “basket cases”, while staff were told in a section of the memo headed “Rope” that: “Sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.” Treasury minister John Glen said he would “stop at nothing” to help small businesses “failed” by RBS and other banks, while Nicky Morgan, the chairman of the Treasury select committee, warned information had to be “dragged out of” the bank. Lewis said the practices at GRG were perhaps the “largest theft anywhere, ever”, while MPs also heard that the unit was “more like an abattoir” where firms were taken apart. A spokeswoman for RBS said the City watchdog confirmed that the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The FCA said it was supported in its decision not to release the passages of the report by an independent reviewer, Andrew Green QC. A spokesman for the GRG business action group, which represents 500 firms put into financial distress by the bank, said: “[The] debate reveals the widespread and justified anger amongst politicians at the conduct of RBS’s rogue bankers. It’s time the government – the majority shareholder in the bank – sat up and listened.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/20/the-changing-public-perception-of-nick-kyrgios-still-no-angel-but-nor-a-lost-cause","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T21:00:33Z","webTitle":"The changing public perception of Nick Kyrgios: still no angel but nor a lost cause | Linda Pearce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/20/the-changing-public-perception-of-nick-kyrgios-still-no-angel-but-nor-a-lost-cause","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/20/the-changing-public-perception-of-nick-kyrgios-still-no-angel-but-nor-a-lost-cause","fields":{"headline":"The changing public perception of Nick Kyrgios: still no angel but nor a lost cause","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is far too early to hail the arrival of the new and improved Nick Kyrgios in school-prefect guise, but not premature to suggest that image-rehabilitation signs are positive. One of the favourite whipping boys of Australian sport is still nobody’s Pat Rafter, but there is a sense, perhaps, that nor is the 22-year-old a lost cause. Not just because he’s winning: specifically, his first title on home Plexicushion at the Brisbane International and his opening three matches here at the Australian Open, including Friday night’s headline act against a childhood idol, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. After all, when Lleyton Hewitt was the world No1, there was a loathe/admire divide that, well, in the interests of diplomatic relations with the now Davis Cup captain may be best not to revisit. An example of how Kyrgios is making some ground in the public relations battle is hearing him speak of his 12-year-old self waiting for autographs while watching every Tsonga practice session during the Frenchman’s exhilarating, unseeded run to the 2008 final at Melbourne Park. Not that he told the story for that reason, but it helps to humanise the combustible Canberran whose head can be as hot as his remarkable serving arm. Indeed, given his well-recognised distrust of the media, Kyrgios has preferred to tell his story via an alternative route in recent months: as a first-person columnist for the Players Voice website (disclaimer: this reporter has contributed to the site but has not collaborated with Kyrgios). He signed up last year as a founding contributor and has used the platform to cover subjects as diverse as his plans to launch the NK Foundation, which will fund a facility for disadvantaged children and has become his “purpose” in life, and a wise public-distancing from Bernard Tomic, while also tackling darker subjects such as his resentment towards tennis for the time it it cost him with his late grandmother in her final years. Most recently, there was an light-hearted critique of the members of his close-knit team and the roles they play in his life and career. Like the fact his Mum, Norlaila, monitors his email inbox, and recently discovered a message from the Queensland police. Have you been in trouble, Nick? Yes, Mum, a traffic fine. ‘Fessed up. No point denying it. The columns reveal a more appealing character than his sometimes irritable public persona, and one who has often done himself no favours in the post-match interview environment. After the 2016 Shanghai tanking debacle, for example, his belligerent, combative answers only made the situation worse. Yet it must also be said that, for better or (often) worse, he is unfailingly honest and authentic; one of the most admirable Kyrgios traits is that he is who and what he is and has never tried or pretended to be anything else. When he claims to be a reluctant tennis player, whose true passion is basketball, he seems to believe what he is saying, even as the amateur psychologists are rushing to diagnose a textbook self-defence mechanism. One that allows him to distance himself from failure or disappointment on the basis that, well, he didn’t really care anyway. Hey, how about those Boston Celtics? Tennis? No big deal, is the message, for someone who’d rather be out shooting hoops. Perhaps the witless Bernard Tomic has unwittingly done his erstwhile Davis Cup team-mate a great favour by trashing his own once-promising career, for, by comparison, Kyrgios is almost a model of commitment and dedication. The Greek-Malaysian-Australian could also count his millions, should he so desire (US$5 million-plus in official prize money, and perhaps double that from endorsements, already), but there is no talk of them. Mercifully. Another plus is his powerfully flamboyant, sometimes ridiculously-brilliant game, which, on a night like Friday, is something to behold. It’s the bad days that still make the 17th seed a work-in-progress. Or just the challenging moments. There are definite and welcome signs of greater calmness and composure, and his recovery from 2-5 down in the fourth set tiebreak against Tsonga was hugely significant. Two days earlier against Viktor Troicki, noisy helicopter/dodgy microphone/fan disruptions had threatened to tip Kyrgios over the precipice, before he managed to pull himself back. The obvious comparison is with the Andreas Seppi unravelling 12 months ago, when, also up two-sets-to-love, he then plunged straight over the cliff. Still, on the edge is the natural Kyrgios habitat, which is part of the deal, and the appeal. Not everyone can be a prefect, and nor do they want to be. The national No1 has never claimed to be a scholar, and popularity is not a test, but his marks are improving. It’s a start. A good one. Let’s leave it at that, for now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/19/the-nfl-playoffs-show-you-dont-need-a-great-quarterback-to-succeed","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T10:00:20Z","webTitle":"The NFL playoffs show you don't need a great quarterback to succeed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/19/the-nfl-playoffs-show-you-dont-need-a-great-quarterback-to-succeed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/19/the-nfl-playoffs-show-you-dont-need-a-great-quarterback-to-succeed","fields":{"headline":"The NFL playoffs show you don't need a great quarterback to succeed","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Each April at the top of the NFL draft, teams grab at quarterbacks they envision leading them to glory. But none of the four quarterbacks remaining in the NFL playoffs took that textbook path to the conference title game. The Eagles, Vikings, Patriots and Jaguars each made it to the championship round without an early pick, “franchise QB” leading the way, not the way in which it’s supposed to be done. Jacksonville’s Blake Bortles was a first-round pick, sure. But in the four seasons from the time he was taken with the No3 overall pick in the 2014 draft to today, he lost the franchise QB luster with inconsistent and occasionally comically awful play. Benched just this preseason, he regained the starting job over Chad Henne by week one, but didn’t exactly light up the scoreboard until the Jaguars put 45 on the Steelers in the divisional round. His two games before that were a 12-for-23, 87-yard effort in a 10-7 win over the Bills and a 15-for-34, two-interception games in a 15-10 loss to the Titans. It was Jacksonville’s defense that got the Jags to Pittsburgh, with Bortles seen as little more than a caretaker along the way, if we’re being generous; or, according to less kind appraisals, Bortles was – and remains – Jacksonville’s one glaring weakness. Remember that Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone, when asked last spring how many of Bortles’ passes his ideal game plan would feature in 2017, replied: “Zero”. There’s not a person outside of Duval County, Florida, who would argue Bortles is even a Top 15 NFL quarterback or that he has lived up to his No3 overall pick pedigree. The Philadelphia Eagles, however, did have a top quarterback – and one taken No2 overall in 2016 – leading the way most of the season. Carson Wentz had become what every NFL team wants from a top pick: superstar play that transforms his team into a Super Bowl contender. But then Wentz made a headlong plunge into the end zone in Week 14 and his ACL put an end to his season. Not the Eagles’ season, though. With Wentz gone, veteran journeyman Nick Foles entered, made some plays to help the Eagles hold off the Rams that week in Los Angeles, and has since gone 3-0 in the three full games he has played, including last week’s playoff win over the Falcons in which he went 23-for-30 for 246 yards. The offense isn’t as explosive as it was under pre-Foles, but we’ve all now seen that the Eagles are far more than just Wentz. Case Keenum’s route to the NFC title game is even more circuitous than that of Foles. Team-mates with Foles on Jeff Fisher’s 2015 Rams, he signed a one-year contract with the Vikings in the offseason as a backup. But when Sam Bradford went down to injury in week two – and with former first-round pick Teddy Bridgewater still not healthy enough to return - Keenum was forced into action. The Vikings went 13-3 in his 16 games, including last Sunday night’s miracle victory over the Saints that will give Keenum a place in Minnesota sports lore forever regardless of what happens from here. And while it is likely a crime punishable by death in the New England states to mention the name Tom Brady in the same sentence as Bortles, Foles and Keenum, I’ll avoid those states for a while to say the following: the Patriot legend’s origin story is the same as that of Foles and Keenum. It’s a tale we all know well: Brady, a sixth-round pick, had to play for an injured Drew Bledsoe and managed to do well enough to help the Patriots win the Super Bowl in 2001 ... and subsequently many more since. He is now the franchise quarterback of franchise quarterbacks, but was never predicted to be so when his pro career began. (Patriots fans may tell you Bill Belichick knew Brady would be great; if so, it was the height of stupidity to risk losing a future Hall of Famer by waiting to draft him until the sixth-round.) So as the Patriots, Jaguars, Vikings and Eagles all prepare to play for a bid to the Super Bowl, the other 28 teams have all turned their attentions to the draft. Mock drafts are already filling the pages of sports sites, and for the every-th year in a row, quarterbacks are expected to go in the first few picks. But this postseason may just prove that taking a quarterback early is a foolish endeavor. Teams want their quarterbacks to be superheroes, but it’s clear it’s possible to win with yeoman QBs. Competent plug-and-play guys who simply don’t detract from all of the good team-mates assembled around them. Instead of looking for A Franchise Quarterback, maybe it makes more sense to assemble the Franchise first and then look for A Quarterback. Same words, different order, oftentimes better result. The league will likely never again see a player of Brady’s caliber come out of the sixth- or seventh-round. Denver’s Trevor Siemian hasn’t quite followed in his path. But plenty of winning quarterbacks have been found outside the first-round in recent years, including Russell Wilson, Dak Prescott, Kirk Cousins, Andy Dalton, Tyrod Taylor and Jimmy Garoppolo – with Keenum likely set to join that group as an entrenched, full-time starter next season. That’s a quarter of the NFL’s starting quarterbacks, including some of the best in the sport, unearthed later in the draft weekend. The Browns attempted to “Moneyball” the position last year when they took DeShone Kizer in the second round, bypassing DeShaun Watson and others earlier on. That looks like the wrong move now, but no draft strategies are foolproof (and the Browns just so happen to be the exception to every NFL rule). Cleveland has also missed on plenty of first-round QBs, all of which set their franchise back in a way that a whiff on Kizer would not. Even if Kizer doesn’t work out, Cleveland still landed Myles Garrett in round one. Fanbases rarely get excited about early, first-round picks being spent on guards, inside linebackers or tight ends. They want to lockdown a superstar, franchise quarterback. But the Vikings, Jaguars and Eagles built enough talent at all the positions not called quarterback that almost anyone could be dropped in at that position to keep the machine humming — same as the Patriots had around their raw, unproven QB in 2001. Every team in action on Sunday is a great team. But they don’t all have great quarterbacks. It turns out those two things are not mutually exclusive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/19/new-orleans-visit-new-york-times-happy","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T15:00:26Z","webTitle":"New Orleans was voted the No 1 place to visit.

Are we happy about it?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"These days, after more than a decade of flux and change, New Orleans is again being recognized positively in the media. The latest of these citations came when the New York Times named New Orleans as its top place to visit in 2018. The Times wrote: “In a year that seemed particularly traumatic for many around the world, we look to a place where centuries of trauma have yielded something magical. New Orleans is unlike any other city in the world, largely thanks to its ability to synthesize that history – and the myriad populations that participated in it – into a place full of joy and wonder.” (Colombia – the whole country – was number two.) “Joy and wonder.” It’s a great compliment: we have been down a long, hard road since settling behind mud levees three centuries ago. Great input for the tourist industry, great to inspire visitors. When I asked about the effect of such fawning press, Kristian Sonnier of the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau emphasized the positive: “Most New Orleanians recognize how important tourism is to our city,” he said. “But even those who don’t are fiercely proud of New Orleans and are eager to share it with visitors.” Still, this sort of free advertising is occasionally not so convenient for residents. Since Coop’s Bar and Central Grocery on Decatur Street hit the top listings in national guidebooks and websites, I, like most locals, haven’t been able to get in the doors. I am afraid the same will happen to Compere Lapin and Marjie’s Grill, both named in the Times story. (Granted, that is a selfish concern – I can make my own muffalettas, I suppose.) Either way, these sorts of lists often work in a circle of self-reinforcement, actually magnifying a phenomenon already occurring. For instance, New Orleans was recently ranked as home to the most single people per capita in the country, according to an analysis by City Lab. The information was initially reported by the US Census Bureau back in 2013. The reporting of the “number one” ranking of single young people resulted in an immediate burst of construction in the Central Business and Warehouse Districts of New Orleans, targeted at this demographic. The building surge has continued through 2017 into 2018 – which has of course inspired the arrival of yet more single people. But besides the lure of more of their own sort, there was opportunity. According to a Forbes study, in 2014 New Orleans was becoming a “brain power” center, not “just drawing tourists, but transplants wanting to put down roots”. And that culture and creativity are important, making it a top asset for the city. “Forget New York or Los Angeles. Working artists should move to New Orleans if they want to see their careers flourish. That’s according to a new Smartasset ranking that names New Orleans the top US city for creative professionals, from painters to musicians, choreographers to architects,” according to Nola. Funny that this new raucous population of working creative singles is paired with the phenomenon of child-rearing: New Orleans has more private schools for kids than any other US city. Now, I know what you’re thinking: the draw could also have to do with this many-faceted reputation as a party city. We have more bars per capita than any other municipality in the US, and simultaneously have more liver transplants than any other place in country. Either way, we live in a world where rankings matter, and where a listing in a numerical sequence can cause the rise and fall of fortunes among the many mom-and-pop businesses that make up this unique habitat. I feel bad recommending places these days, knowing that popularity can ruin the more obscure places that I frequent. But I remain quite happy that someone has complimented my hometown, which once again has reasserted its worth and quality. I just wish the lines were shorter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/18/trump-nra-fbi-alexander-torshin-russia-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T20:42:48Z","webTitle":"FBI investigates whether Russia banker used NRA to fund Trump campaign – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/trump-nra-fbi-alexander-torshin-russia-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/trump-nra-fbi-alexander-torshin-russia-investigation","fields":{"headline":"FBI investigates whether Russia banker used NRA to fund Trump campaign – report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The FBI is investigating whether a Russian banker with close ties to Vladimir Putin funneled money through the National Rifle Association to support Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, it was reported on Thursday. Foreign contributions to American political campaigns are illegal. The NRA spent at least $30m to back Trump’s 2016 campaign for president, according to an analysis of public campaign finance records – more than any other outside group, and more than double what it spent to back Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign. News outlets have been examining ties and meetings between NRA leaders and Russia for months, including a 2015 NRA delegation to Moscow that included meetings with influential Putin allies. Thursday’s McClatchy article, which names Alexander Torshin as the banker and NRA ally under scrutiny, is the first to report that links between Russia and the NRA have drawn the attention of federal investigators examining Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election. The report cited two unnamed sources, noting that the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference is confidential and often focused on classified information. A spokesman for the NRA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Mueller spokesperson declined to comment. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Federal Election Commission regulations not only bar financial contributions from foreign nationals, they also prohibit foreign nationals from “directing, dictating, controlling, or directly or indirectly participating in the decision-making process” of any person or group “with regard to any election-related activities.” Torshin, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank and a former member of the Russian parliament, tried in May 2016 to arrange a meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin, the New York Times reported in late 2017. The overture was rejected by Jared Kushner, the Times reported. That month, Torshin, Trump, and Donald Trump Jr all attended events at the NRA’s annual meeting in Louisville, the Times reported, where Trump addressed NRA members and the gun rights group formally endorsed him. A lawyer for Trump Jr said his client and Torshin spoke briefly when they were introduced during a meal at the NRA’s annual meeting. “It was all gun-related small talk,” the lawyer, Alan Futerfas, told McClatchy. Congressional investigators reportedly asked Trump Jr about that interaction at a hearing in December. On Thursday, Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group that opposes the NRA’s influence in American politics, called on the NRA to “come clean” about its connections to Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/18/government-shutdown-congress-trump-deadline","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T00:44:39Z","webTitle":"Republicans clear first hurdle to avoid government shutdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/government-shutdown-congress-trump-deadline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/government-shutdown-congress-trump-deadline","fields":{"headline":"Republicans clear first hurdle to avoid government shutdown","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Republicans cleared the first hurdle in avoiding a government shutdown on Thursday night. The House of Representatives seemed poised to pass a bill to keep the government open until 16 February, after promising conservatives a vote on a major increase in defense spending, a hard-line immigration bill as well as other unnamed concessions that the conservative House Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows called “subplots” on Thursday night. However, this legislation would likely be dead on arrival in the Senate, where Democrats have said they have enough votes to block the legislation. But, by passing the House, it would allow Republicans to attempt to shift the blame for a potential government shutdown to Democrats. An impasse would result in Donald Trump marking his first anniversary in office with the first government shutdown in four years, even though his party controls Congress. In the event of a shutdown, most government services would freeze and most federal workers would go unpaid. Negotiations over the budget stalled in recent days, amid a dispute over spending priorities and immigration. The breakdown of talks kicked off a pre-emptive blame game in Washington, with Trump and Republicans pointing a finger at Democrats for insisting that any compromise include protections for nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. “We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters during a visit to the Pentagon on Thursday. “It’s up to the Democrats.” The president’s decision to stop by the US Department of Defense, as Republican leaders in Congress crafted a contingency plan in the event of a shutdown, underscored the political urgency. There has never been a government shutdown, which would cost the US an estimated $6.5bn a week and stifle economic progress, when one party has controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House. At the Pentagon, Trump sought to pit Democrats against the military by claiming a shutdown would have the worst impact on the defense department. While most government services are frozen during a shutdown, national security work that is deemed “essential” continues to operate. The majority of federal employees placed on unpaid furlough are non-defense employees. Active duty military personnel are not furloughed. Earlier Friday, the president unexpectedly undermined a short-term plan offered by House Republicans. The stopgap measure would push the funding deadline to 16 February and, in an attempt to sway Democrats, reauthorize a popular children’s health insurance program for six years. But as the House prepared to vote on the measure on Thursday, Trump criticized the bill, tweeting: “CHIP [the Children’s Health Insurance Program] should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!” Hours later, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, downplayed divisions between Republican leaders and the White House. “I spoke with the president. He fully supports passing what we’re bringing to the floor today,” Ryan said. Fiscal conservatives had expressed frustration that the bill would represent the fourth short-term extension since October, when funding for the government was first due to expire. Congress has since passed a series of stopgap measures to keep the government running in the absence of a longer-term deal. However, the concessions made to conservatives on Friday night were sufficient to get enough wavering right wingers to back another short-term bill. Democrats in the lower chamber were largely unified in their opposition to the Republican bill, with the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, likening it to “a bowl of doggy doo” in a Thursday press conference on Capitol Hill. The bill’s fate looked similarly uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans hold a slim 51-seat majority and would need at least nine Democrats to support the plan. A handful of swing state Senate Democrats announced their opposition to the House bill, citing its failure to address a number of funding priorities. Democrats said a short-term fix would delay critical funding for the opioid crisis, as well as emergency relief for areas in Florida, California and Puerto Rico left devastated by storms and wildfires last year. Democrats remain primarily concerned with extending protections to the young, undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, who were left in limbo when Trump rescinded Barack Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (Daca) policy in September. The Daca program protected hundreds of thousands of Dreamers from deportation with temporary legal status. Trump gave Congress until 5 March to enact a replacement, but Democrats have argued legislation on the controversial issue of immigration is unlikely to pass unless tied to a must-pass bill such as funding for the government. Bipartisan discussions on immigration were also severely undermined last week when the president made derogatory comments in a private meeting, about immigrants from countries such as Haiti and El Salvador. According to lawmakers in attendance, Trump questioned the need for the US to accept immigrants from “shithole countries”. On Thursday, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said Trump “doesn’t give a hoot if the government shuts down”. “The White House has done nothing but sow chaos and confusion, division and disarray,” Schumer said in a Senate floor speech. “And it may just lead us to a government shutdown that nobody wants; that all of us here have been striving to avoid.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/18/adhd-young-women-medication-ritalin","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T21:34:55Z","webTitle":"Young women's ADHD prescriptions have soared since 2003, CDC finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/adhd-young-women-medication-ritalin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/adhd-young-women-medication-ritalin","fields":{"headline":"Young women's ADHD prescriptions have soared since 2003, CDC finds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Prescriptions for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medications have increased 700% among US women in their late 20s since 2003, according to new research by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers raised alarms about the increase because “little information is available about the safety of taking ADHD medication during pregnancy”. The second largest increase, of 560%, was among women between 30 and 34 years old. The most common medications prescribed for ADHD are stimulants, such as methylphenidate, a medication known best by its brand name, Ritalin. Increases among women of childbearing age represent the latest data on the fivefold increase in stimulant prescriptions that has taken place since the early 2000s. While there are non-stimulant medications to treat ADHD, use of those medications has remained level over the last decade, as amphetamine-based prescriptions increased dramatically. While the largest increases in ADHD prescriptions were among women in their 20s, prescriptions among all women between 15 and 44 rose 344%. The large increase among women in their 20s and 30s, considered the optimal age for having children, raised concern among physicians. “Half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, and women may be taking prescription medicine early in pregnancy before they know they are pregnant,” said Coleen Boyle, director of the CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. “Early pregnancy is a critical time for the developing baby. We need to better understand the safest ways to treat ADHD before and during pregnancy.” The new research examined private insurance claims between 2003 and 2015 of up to 6.8 million women. About 68% of women in the United States get insurance through a private company, according to health policy experts at Kaiser Family Foundation. The dramatic increases mean that the proportion of all women in this age group who took ADHD medication rose from 1% in 2003 to 4% in 2015. Studies suggest about 4% of adults have ADHD, but those numbers have increased over time, as awareness of the diagnosis has grown. “If a woman is pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, she should talk to her healthcare provider about all medicines she is taking,” Boyle said. “Pregnant women should also talk to their doctor before stopping or starting any medicine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/18/philosophical-failing-in-denial-of-pakistani-humanists-asylum-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T18:53:16Z","webTitle":"Philosophical failing in denial of Pakistani humanist’s asylum claim | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/18/philosophical-failing-in-denial-of-pakistani-humanists-asylum-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/18/philosophical-failing-in-denial-of-pakistani-humanists-asylum-claim","fields":{"headline":"Philosophical failing in denial of Pakistani humanist’s asylum claim","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"You report that “A Pakistani man who renounced his Muslim faith and became a humanist has had his application for asylum in the UK rejected after failing to correctly answer questions about ancient Greek philosophers” (Pakistani denied asylum after he failed to answer Plato question, 18 January).

He does not have players practise set moves they can perform almost unconsciously that can be deployed at great pace when the situation demands. He organises his defence and leaves his forwards to improvise. That has been taken by some as evidence that Mourinho is no longer at the forefront of coaching – and perhaps it is – but it is also a detail that explains his entire methodology. While studying at the Instituto Superior de Educação Física in Lisbon Mourinho came under the influence of Prof Manuel Sérgio, who believed that football knowledge was not enough for a coach, that he also had to be a psychologist, a public speaker and have a grasp of the sciences. Specifically he gave lectures on emotions and how they could be manipulated. Mourinho followed them with a rapacious curiosity. “He looked,” Manuel Sérgio said, “like a cat catching birds.” His studies in psychology drew Mourinho to many of the conclusions reached by the Portuguese neurologist António Damásio, who has since written the introduction to a study about Mourinho’s methods by four Portuguese researchers. In his 1994 book, Descartes’s Error, Damásio argues that emotions are more rational than is commonly believed and that decisions are more influenced by emotional factors. “For us to say that this or that player is in great physical shape is a mistake,” Mourinho said during his time at Porto. “The player is either fit or not. And what do we mean by being fit? It is to be physically well and to be part of a game plan which a player knows inside out. With regard to the psychological side, which is essential to play at the highest level, a fit player feels confident, cooperates with and believes in his team-mates, and shows solidarity towards them. All of this put together means a player is fit and it is reflected in playing well.” This is the basis of the theory of periodisation, as preached by Vítor Frade, the Portuguese academic who has been a huge influence over a generation of Portuguese coaches and worked as Mourinho’s director of methodology at Porto. It means no drills to improve stamina or discrete skills; it means no gym work unless a player is recovering from injury; and it means no automisations. “When he started as a head coach there were very few people coaching like he was coaching,” said the former Wolves midfielder Silas, who played under Mourinho at União de Leiria, “but now we see a lot of coaches doing the same. It’s a kind of training that’s completely focused on game situations, all game situations, all really specific.” Mourinho’s approach is “guided discovery”. Players are not taught moves by rote which, for him, offers a false sense of virtuosity that unravels against a better organised or more aggressive opponent. They are essentially persuaded by example of the efficacy of the Mourinho model until they instinctively reach for a Mourinho solution. “It is not easy to put this theory into practice, especially with top players who are not prepared to accept everything they are told just because it comes from you, the authority …” Mourinho said. “I will arrange the training sessions to lead along a certain path, they will begin feeling it … all together, we reach a conclusion.” The players are made to feel they own the conclusions Mourinho wants them to reach. It is a form of brainwashing, which perhaps explains the air of cultishness that so often characterises his relationship with his squad – and, indeed, with fans and certain journalists. It is an emotional as well as a technical process, one rooted in his “charismatic authority”, to use the term employed by the sociologist Max Weber in his 1919 lecture “Politics as a Vocation”, which addresses the issue of personality cults. The identification of both an external enemy – the football authorities, referees, pundits, whoever – and “rats”, club figures who for offences real or imagined find themselves outside the inner circle, helps strengthen those bonds. Mourinho’s mastery of psychology allows him to secure a buy-in that, for instance, can persuade Samuel Eto’o to operate as an auxiliary full-back or Xabi Alonso to turn against some of his Spain team-mates – as he did when Madrid played Barcelona four times in 18 days in 2011. But there is a problem. Weber argued that instances of charismatic authority “cannot remain stable; they will become either traditionalised or rationalised, or a combination of both”. It is that, perhaps, that best explains why Mourinho has only ever been successful in short bursts; in time the impact of his charisma wears off and players kick against an authority that has become habitual. In the past that is when third-season syndrome has set in, which is what makes reports of a new five-year contract so extraordinary. There have been signs this season at Old Trafford that the process has been accelerated. Mourinho’s problem may be less that his rejection of automisation is old hat than that the methodology to which it is integral is undermined by a familiarity with his techniques that erodes the charismatic authority on which they are based. • Sign up to our weekly email, The Recap, here, showcasing a selection of our sport features from the past seven days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/19/derry-girls-channel-4-the-funniest-thing-on-tv-lisa-mcgee","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T08:00:17Z","webTitle":"Daft, profane and absolutely brilliant: Derry Girls is the funniest thing on TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/19/derry-girls-channel-4-the-funniest-thing-on-tv-lisa-mcgee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/19/derry-girls-channel-4-the-funniest-thing-on-tv-lisa-mcgee","fields":{"headline":"Daft, profane and absolutely brilliant: Derry Girls is the funniest thing on TV","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There are few spectacles more ripe for comedy than teenagers causing havoc, but Derry Girls has got it down to a fine art. Channel 4’s new sitcom is set in “a place called Derry, or Londonderry, depending on your persuasion – a troubled little corner in the north-west of Ireland,” the melodramatic diarist Erin declares in the opening episode. Or rather, her cousin Orla declares it, by reading aloud excerpts from Erin’s diary. (She’s doing it for her book report.) The action, and there is plenty of it, takes place in the 90s, a time when teenagers could aspire to be famous like the Corrs, and against a backdrop of the Troubles, which, for our heroines, means a bomb scare on the bridge delaying their school bus because it has to go the long way around. The Derry Girls – and “the wee English fella” James – are a brilliant ensemble, each bringing their own comedic flare together to form a very funny collective. As the closest thing to a straight man in a very wonky bunch, the writerly Erin steers the ship, and Saoirse-Monica Jackson’s rubbery-jawed expressions of confusion and horror are a sight to behold. There’s the high-energy, well-meaning Clare, who fasts for Ethiopia and is in a constant state of panic, and the pathologically dopey Orla: who makes Phoebe from Friends look grounded. But it’s Jamie Lee O’Donnell who steals every scene she’s in as the foul-mouthed Michelle. She loves a Pernod, has a brief phase of saying “motherfucker” after she watches a knockoff Pulp Fiction VHS, and cuts through the chaos she’s responsible for causing with an air of unmistakeable cool-girl nonchalance. Despite all the references ripped straight from any 90s bedroom wall – there’s a Macaulay Culkin-based misunderstanding, and a sweet Reservoir Dogs recreation in the second episode – its nostalgia is affectionate, but not cloying or sentimental. There’s not much in the way of sentimentality anywhere, in fact, and it’s all the better for it. The family scenes are deliciously tart, and any concern that it might collapse under the weight of its historical and political setting is swept away with a deft hand, as the girls put their minds to more pressing matters, such as wondering whether they would consider a British soldier to be shaggable. Derry Girls is reckless, joyful and celebratory, whether they’re explaining why they almost burned down a chip shop, or why they definitely did not kill a nun. Partly, that’s because its jokes come thick and fast. Each episode unspools into madness by the time we get to the ad break; the second half is an attempt to somehow put the toothpaste back into the tube. Writer and creator Lisa McGee, who divided opinion with her 2013 comedy London Irish, manages to make almost every line a gag. Early in the first episode, Erin’s mother forbids her from asserting her independence by wearing a denim jacket to school. When she turns up in a blazer, Clare, also sporting a denim jacket, is quick to get the hump: “I’m not being an individual on me own,” she huffs. It’s as silly as it is quick-witted, but the balance of the two is perfect. The programme is a delight, too, because there is a particular kind of energy to be harnessed by teenagers who are simultaneously self-conscious to the point of pain, and yet totally unwilling to bend to any form of decorum or propriety. The gang here remind me of the tearaways on a school trip in Alan Warner’s wonderful and under-loved 1997 novel The Sopranos, which has recently been turned into a musical (Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour) by Lee Hall. More accidentally rebellious than deliberately so, these girls are all a nightmare, and you can’t help but be entertained by them. Soon after the first episode of Derry Girls aired, Channel 4 announced that it had already commissioned a second series. If you aren’t already watching, then catch yourself on.

For 18 years, the Race Equality Foundation’s Strengthening Families, Strengthening Communities programme has been supporting poorly served parents to help their children develop high self-esteem, social competence and self-discipline. Evidence shows that children and young people who possess these qualities are better able to identify risky situations, as well as take action that is going to make them safe. These are fundamental behaviours and strategies if children and young people are going to decide that carrying knives, joining gangs or using violence does not make them safer, but puts them at greater risk. However, we regularly echo the World Health Organisation when we argue that this type of support to families has to be accompanied by homes that are warm and secure, schools that provide high-quality education, law enforcement that protects all, a social security system that provides a strong safety net, and meaningful jobs. If we are serious about tackling the carrying of knives, we have to be serious about investing in the environment that will help children and young people. Jabeer Butt Acting chief executive, Race Equality Foundation • Surely the most likely outcome of teaching five-year-olds about knife crime would be simply to increase the children’s fear that other people are carrying knives. Their most obvious course of action? To carry knives themselves. Just a thought… Ed Barrett Bebington, Wirral • The police are wise to treat knife crime involving schoolchildren as a public health issue. Experience over time, eg in Ireland, has shown that jailing more adolescents does not prevent offending later on in life. Dev Maitra (Does the answer to Britain’s rise in teenage killings lie in Hong Kong?, theguardian.com, 17 January) is also right that “gun and knife crime are not inevitable”, although it is leaving it a bit late, attempting to intervene with gang members at age 17. More than one risk factor for teenagers to carry weapons has been identified. The most powerful predictor is experience of bullying or victimisation around the age of eight or nine. Bullying can make a child feel unsafe at all times and subsequently, as a teenager, carrying a knife makes them feel more safe. Safer primary schools, with effective anti-bullying policies and cultures that do not breed hate and victimisation, are the best investment to prevent stabbings by frightened, angry youths.

The death of her teenage stepson soon after her own mother’s death also meant she was forced to suspend her studies for a year. Now in her final year, Eunson has rolled with the punches, juggling family life with a demanding career as a litigation executive at a law firm. She admits the pressure to squeeze her study into an already jam-packed day was a shock at first. So how can e-learners stay on task? Schedule Start by sitting down with a planner and carve out study time. Make a weekly schedule and stick to it. It could mean squeezing in a couple of hours of reading before work or knuckling down in the evening. Leave the house You don’t have to be chained to the desk at home to study. Many online courses include multimedia elements, so even a spare 15 minutes could be an opportunity to watch a short video assigned by your tutor, for example. Build a routine For Phil Barker, listening to audiobooks on his hour commute to work has been a huge help. The IT engineer, who is studying a masters in philosophy and religious thought at the University of Gloucestershire, says the course has been a steep learning curve as he slogs through heavy academic texts. “It is very much more accessible to have a plummy Shakespearean actor read out something that’s very technical,” he explains. Get your family and friends on side Often studying an online course means sacrificing time usually spent with family and friends. It helps to have their support and understanding. Georgina Blakely, a director of teaching at the Open University, says: “Students need that moral support. Otherwise it’s very hard to find the timedoing the chores to free you up.” Talk to your employer Talk to your employer about flexible working options. Since 2014, all employees with 26 weeks or more service are allowed to request flexible working. Both Eunson and Barker have found working compressed hours – working their total contracted hours over four days instead of five – has freed up Friday to study. On this day Barker sets targets for the next week, be it writing so many words of an essay or finishing a book. Socialise Socialising with other students is a part of university life that distance learners can find difficult to access, but should take the time for. Academic success depends on taking part in the online community, says Chris Coffey, course leader of the online MSc in construction project management at Nottingham Trent University. Make full use of any online space the university gives students to collaborate on. Classmates can teach you the most, he says. “It can be isolating otherwise. It creates the sense that you’re not sitting at the computer on your own.” Set targets You’ve missed a deadline, work commitments have drained all your free time, and the cat deleted your final year dissertation – whatever you do, don’t panic or beat yourself up. Blakely says students tend to be too hard on themselves and set very high expectations. “It’s about learning how to prioritise,” she says. “Decide what is essential and what you can get away with perhaps missing on occasion. No student does absolutely everything we tell them to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/18/adoption-has-become-runaway-train-social-workers-cannot-stop","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T18:08:45Z","webTitle":"Adoption a 'runaway train often breaching rights of birth parents'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/18/adoption-has-become-runaway-train-social-workers-cannot-stop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/18/adoption-has-become-runaway-train-social-workers-cannot-stop","fields":{"headline":"Adoption a 'runaway train often breaching rights of birth parents'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Adoption has become a “runaway train” impossible for individual social workers to stop, according to an independent inquiry into adoption law in the UK. The exhaustive two-year inquiry, which canvassed evidence from social workers, adult adoptees, adoptive parents and birth parents across the UK, has raised the alarm over practices that favour adoption over alternative care options seeking to help children stay with their birth parents. The British Association of Social Workers’s (BASW) independent adoption inquiry is the first to investigate the role of social workers in adoption with a focus on ethics and human rights and has called for a significant rethink and review of adoption law. The UK has the highest number of adoptions in Europe and is one of just three EU countries that allow forced or non-consensual adoptions – where children are adopted against the wishes of their birth parents. The inquiry examined these issues and looked at our rationale for being the only country in Europe to have a uniform rule forbidding any direct contact between adopted children and their birth and foster families. Ruth Allen, chief executive for BASW, said: “Adoption can be highly successful, providing children with stable, loving homes and adoptive parents with the experience of creating the family they want. Birth families may consent to adoption and recognise the value to their biological child. “However, the inquiry explores the complex realities of adoption for many people, particularly in non-consensual adoption, with mixed outcomes and experiences for all involved, which raise questions about what the report calls a dominant ‘happy ever after’ narrative.” At the inquiry’s launch on Thursday night, a mother who had her children taken from her at birth said there were no support services, preventive help or children’s centres available to help her cope, and that most were being closed because of funding cuts. Social workers said the adoption process was not working and that there was not enough post-adoptive support for birth or adoptive families. There was also call for government to not only fund the system properly but to be more open over its data. “The government needs to supply a breakdown of figures so we can see how many children who are adopted then go back into the care system because of a breakdown with the adoptive family – often through lack of post-adoption support – which is morally wrong but also doesn’t make sense financially,” said Allen. Adoption has been promoted by government policy in England in recent years as the best solution for children from vulnerable families. The former prime minister David Cameron and the current environment secretary, Michael Gove, have both publicly supported adoption as a public good and the best decision for children. But the inquiry painted a far less rosy picture. “Often at the early help-points, a case is seen as an ‘adoption’ case because adoption is so high profile,” one senior social worker said. “[A permanent solution for the child] has been hijacked to [mean] adoption – the child’s ‘right’ to adoption. Adoption becomes a ‘runaway train’ and impossible for individual social workers to stop. “Court processes can feel like a ‘fait accompli’ for birth families.” The inquiry also came to the damning conclusion that “social work’s professional ethics are not routinely and transparently used to inform adoption practice”. One acute ethical concern repeatedly expressed by experts was that the impact of austerity on wider social policies has directly led to increased rates of adoption among already disadvantaged families. “The enquiry explored how a rights and ethics perspective is not routinely embedded in social work practice or in statutory guidance,” said Allen. “For example, adoption should never be an intervention primarily for family poverty or because parents have care and support needs that are not being adequately met. “And yet cuts to family support and social work services were a recurring theme with less available for earlier interventions that could support children to stay at home safely. “This means the rights of children and their parents are being breached thanks to austerity measures in public services which continue to undermine preventive and supportive services for families.” Allen also questioned the grounds for government’s promotion of adoption above other care options. “There is a dearth of information and meaningful longitudinal research to inform policy and social work practice on adoption,” she said. “Without this information, the arguments made for adoption in its current form and current policy are insufficiently evidenced.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/18/like-a-chronic-illness-emily-maitlis-describes-impact-of-being-stalked","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T09:39:27Z","webTitle":"'Like a chronic illness': Emily Maitlis describes impact of being stalked","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/18/like-a-chronic-illness-emily-maitlis-describes-impact-of-being-stalked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/18/like-a-chronic-illness-emily-maitlis-describes-impact-of-being-stalked","fields":{"headline":"'Like a chronic illness': Emily Maitlis describes impact of being stalked","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Emily Maitlis fears she will never be able to put an end to the harassment she has suffered for more than 20 years, despite the man responsible having been jailed again this week. The Newsnight presenter hit out at the authorities for allowing Edward Vines to continue writing to her while he was serving a previous prison sentence for breaching his restraining order. But even as she described the strain his harassment placed on her, she said she believed he was a victim too. “This has literally been going on for 20 years. It feels like sort of a chronic illness,” Maitlis told BBC Radio 5 Live. She said the stress had turned her into a “jumpy” person who could be short-tempered with her family. “Your head is somewhere else and you’re having to think about things that are just ludicrous, like how do you get in and out of your front door and how [the children] are getting back from school. “It’s not that you think everyone is out to kill you. You recognise it as a paranoia. But it doesn’t make it any easier.” Vines was jailed for three years in 2016 for breaching his restraining order. Despite that, he wrote to Maitlis from prison and once out on licence. On Tuesday he was sentenced to another jail term, of three years and nine months, for the further breach of the indefinite order. The Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for the administration of prisons in England and Wales, apologised to Maitlis on Wednesday for having allowed the correspondence to continue even as Vines was in custody. It promised to step up its monitoring of prisoners. In the radio interview, Maitlis said it was “extraordinary to think that a stalker behind bars for corresponding can then carry on corresponding”. She added: “It’s not that I ever believe it will stop or he will stop, or the system will manage to prevent it properly. Whatever treatment he’s had isn’t working as a cure and he is obviously also a victim in this. “He is unwell and has wasted half his life. Stalking is a weirdo glamorised term for what is essentially mental ill health and so somewhere along the lines we have to change the mechanism.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/19/coalitions-foreign-agents-bill-attacked-for-overreach-and-curtailing-freedoms-of-expression","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T17:00:04Z","webTitle":"Coalition’s foreign agents bill attacked for overreach and curtailing ‘freedoms of expression’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/19/coalitions-foreign-agents-bill-attacked-for-overreach-and-curtailing-freedoms-of-expression","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/19/coalitions-foreign-agents-bill-attacked-for-overreach-and-curtailing-freedoms-of-expression","fields":{"headline":"Coalition’s foreign agents bill attacked for overreach and curtailing ‘freedoms of expression’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government’s bill to require Australians to register if they are lobbying on behalf of foreign entities is “startling” in its reach and unsuspecting organisations will face criminal penalties for failure to register, a Senate committee has been warned.

The AFMA, a not-for-profit industry body representing financial market participants and wholesale banking service providers, submitted that this “expansive definition” acted in a “catch-all manner”. It warned the bill would require groups as diverse as arts bodies and sporting associations to register if they have any non-Australian members and contact the government to seek funding or promote an event. Even a person who helped a non-Australian citizen or resident to make representations about their visa status would need to register, it said. Intentional failure to register is punishable by criminal penalties of up to seven years’ prison; reckless failure by up to five years. Failure to keep appropriate records is subject to a strict liability offence, with a penalty of $12,600. AFMA said the reach of the bill was “startling” and would make it “one of the most wide-reaching regimes in the Australian regulatory system”. It argued the registration scheme would prove particularly onerous for membership-based organisations, which conduct advocacy on behalf of all their members, some of which may be foreign, including submissions to government inquiries and communications with officials. AFMA blasted the government for the “absence of prior consultation” which it said had given rise to “unintended consequences” that could have been avoided. Tony Kevin, an Australian career diplomat for 30 years and former ambassador to Poland and Cambodia, labelled the bill an “attack on the freedoms of expression and association that all Australians currently enjoy”. He argued it would require Australians who publicly express views on international political issues and who have contact with foreign persons to register or risk criminal charges. Kevin questioned what “advocacy” would be captured by the scheme, arguing that “there is a fine line between elucidating a foreign country’s position on an issue in international contention, eg Russia on the Crimea issue, or China on the disputed South China Sea territories, and advocating that position”. “Much of my writing explains Chinese or Russian views on international issues in contention: does this make it advocacy?” While introducing the bill in December, Malcolm Turnbull said it was “intended to provide transparency for the Australian government and the Australian public about the forms and sources of foreign influence in Australia”. He said the focus was on “the activities of foreign states and their agents in Australia and not the loyalties of Australians who happen to be from a foreign country”. At a press conference on 5 December, Turnbull said the principle behind the scheme was that “if a person or entity engages with the Australian political landscape on behalf of a foreign state or a principal, then they should register. “Being registered, I should say, should not be seen as any kind of taint and certainly not a crime. “But if you fail to disclose your ties, then you will be liable for a criminal offence.” He said that organisations or individuals who “think they might come within the ambit of the legislation would be wise to register”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/19/australia-v-england-second-one-day-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T13:12:42Z","webTitle":"England beat Australia by four wickets in second ODI – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/19/australia-v-england-second-one-day-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/19/australia-v-england-second-one-day-international-live","fields":{"headline":"England beat Australia by four wickets in second ODI – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here’s Vish’s report from the Gabba: England lead the series 2-0 with three matches to play That was a fine win for England, and a nice contrast to their victory in the first ODI. That was all about Jason Roy; this was a team effort. The series isn’t over - England were 2-0 up in South Africa two years ago and lost 3-2 - but Australia have to change something quicksmart. Bowling first might be a good place to start, because England are formidable when they bat second. Thanks for your company; sorry I didn’t chance to read all the emails. It was just too darn exciting watching England play one-day cricket. Goodnight. 44.2 overs: England 270-6 (Root 46, Woakes 35) Woakes hurries England over the line with consecutive boundaries. He played beautifully, making 39 not out from only 27 balls, and England have won emphatically. Again. 44th over: England 266-6 (Root 46, Woakes 31) Mitch Marsh comes on, a development he must be thrilled with in the circumstances. Four from the overes; five to go. 43rd over: England 262-6 (Root 45, Woakes 28) This is as close as you’ll get to a four-wicket thrashing. The most impressive thing has been the way England have completely ignored the pressure points during their run-chase. Not interested! “Just a quick thanks for mentioning Dan in today’s OBO,” writes his father Gary. “Seeing that and people’s reactions is still moving in a positive way. We all appreciate you remembering him after all this time and of course the Ashes series and 6 Nations would have been particular highlights of his working year.” And ours. I can imagine his facial expression at the precise nanosecond James Vince edged another drive to slip. 42nd over: England 253-6 (Root 43, Woakes 21) Woakes pulls Richardson towards long leg, where a Stoinis misfield gives England four runs. It’s been a good day for Root, who also took two for 31 from seven overs. That might be enough for a low-key Man of the Match performance, though Michael Vaughan, on BT Sport, suggests Eoin Morgan could get it for his captaincy. 41st over: England 247-6 (Root 42, Woakes 16) Woakes plays another excellent stroke, square driving Tye for three. Every time England have been under a bit of pressure, they have hit their way back into the ascendancy. It’s so impressive. England teams really aren’t hardwired to do this against Australia in Australia. 40th over: England 243-6 (Root 41, Woakes 13) So much for Chris Woakes’ defensive technique - he’s just spanked Richardson for 10 in two balls! A cracking extra cover drive was followed by a whriling pull-drive for six. The camera cuts to Eoin Morgan, who looks on like a proud father. He’s taught his kids some pretty good values. “I was about to message you and ask what you thought the chances were of England stuffing this up,” says Richard O’Hagan. “It seems that I can jinx them merely by the power of thought nowadays.” My favourite thing about Richard’s email was the subject: a simple, old-fashioned ‘here we go’. I’m not sure anything speaks of being English – and certainly not of being an English cricket fan - quite like a weary ‘here we go’. 39th over: England 231-6 (Root 40, Woakes 2) Tye comes back into the attack. There is a bit of reverse swing, so Root bats with due care and attention. If he goes, Australia will fancy their chances of a smash-and-grab victory. “Hi Rob,” says Lloyd. “Bairstow isn’t ‘going to give up the gloves, or be told to give them up’? Is that really how it works? Genuine question. I understand he might not want to give them up, but if he was told by his captain/coach that he was batting up the order with someone else keeping, wouldn’t he have to lump it and do his job like a pro? Or is player power really that strong these days?” I think it’s more the realisation that to enforce something to which he is so strongly opposed would probably diminish his game – not through suking so much as feeling uncomfortable. The same applies to Joe Root batting at No3. If I were in charge of English cricket I would show Bairstow what happened when Kumar Sangakkara gave up the gloves, and try to persuade him that he would probably add 7-10 runs to his average by being a specialist batsman. Wear him down with cold, hard, undeniable stats. 38th over: England 228-6 (Root 38, Woakes 1) Chris Woakes’ defensive technique comes in very handy: he repels the last two deliveries to be bowled by Starc, who ends with figures of 10-0-59-4. That is magnificent bowling! Moeen is knocked over by a sizzling inswinging yorker from Starc, who has dragged Australia back into the game with a brilliant final over. And he still has two balls remaining! Buttler’s entertaining innings of 42 from 32 balls is ended by Starc, who produces a beauty from around the wicket that takes the edge en route to the keeper Carey. 37th over: England 224-4 (Root 37, Buttler 42) England are scoring at more than a run a ball, yet at now stage has the innings felt forced. They bat with formidable certainty, especially when they are chasing. They are more erratic when they are setting a target. “Morning Rob,” says Rich Ibbetson. “Not sure if this has been discussed already this morning, but how do you see England selection for the ODI team panning out once Stokes is back? Will he have to come in for Moeen, and leave us with just 5 real bowlers, as they have done today? Having Roy, Bairstow and Hales up top together seems to work beautifully.” I think they’ll just rotate for the next 15 months and see how everyone’s form is at the start of the World Cup. They will probably want six bowlers for that, so one of the top three might miss out. That said, things will probably change before the World Cup. Experience suggests one of today’s XI won’t make the squad, never mind the team. 36th over: England 215-4 (Root 33, Buttler 37) The last, last, last, last, last throw of the dice, with Starc returns to the attack. But it’s not happening for him or Australia. England take six low-risk runs from the over to move within 56 of victory. 35th over: England 209-4 (Root 31, Buttler 33) Travis Head returns to the attack, replacing Stoinis. Buttler strongarms a superb boundary through midwicket to bring up a rapid fifty partnership. He has 33 from 24 balls; Root, the perfect modern anchor, has 31 from 39. “Hi Rob,” says Matt Colton. “Bairstow has the potential to be a very good Test No3 – he is the second-best bat in the Test side, can grind it out, plays all forms of bowling well, rotates the strike and runs well. Looking at the (albeit bizarre) Test squad we took to Australia Bairstow is by far the most obvious No3, if we assume that Root won’t play there. It’s also worth noting he isn’t the best wicket keeper in the squad either. We have spent a year and a half proving the theory that neither Ballance nor Vince is test number 3, without trying the far more obvious and natural selection of Bairstow there. And for all the naysayers who think he isn’t a good enough bat for a test 3, remember when they said he wasn’t good enough to bat anywhere in the one-day side?” I suppose all bets are off with the Test team, and I wouldn’t put anything past Bairstow, but are you really playing to his strengths by putting him in the top three? Either way, I don’t think he’s going to give up the gloves, or be told to give them up, so I suspect he’ll spend the rest of his career at No6/7 and end up with a Test average of 39.81 and a conversion rate of 17 per cent. 34th over: England 200-4 (Root 27, Buttler 26) Buttler reaches outside off stump to clout Richardson over midwicket for four. That brings up the 200; England are in control again after a slight wobble. “So much of cricket is about the perception of strength - reputation - and how that feeds back into how both teams play (confidence/intimidation/apprehension/risk, etc),” says Scott Oliver. “Just as Test teams with great bowling attacks can afford to be gung-ho with the bat because they know they will always have a chance to drag it back with the ball, so the same notion, albeit differently modulated, applies with this England ODI team: the opposition’s perception of England’s batting power (which is of course based on a long list of real achievements and not simply feverish and awe-struck imaginings) causes them to take more risks, to set higher ‘par score’ figures, to over-extend themselves, and consequently to get it wrong more often. Or, as was very much the case of this England team on its way up - superbly marshalled by Morgan, granted, but essentially the result of having several brilliant attacking batting talents come along at once, and of course the selectorial vision that made that happen - they find out through this higher-risk cricket that they haven’t remotely touched the outer limits of their own potential as a team. They find the proverbial next level. And maybe the next, too.” Yep, I completely agree with this. Steve Waugh understood it better than anyone. Trouble is: when the force is with Pakistan, they do not give a solitary one about reputation, perception or anything else. 33rd over: England 188-4 (Root 24, Buttler 20) Stoinis replaces Tye. Buttler introduces himself in the contemporary style by launching the first ball over mid-off for a one-bounce four. That was, or at least appeared to be, comically effortless. He gets four more later in the over with a top-edged hook straight over the keeper’s head. That almost went for six. I hope Buttler doesn’t take the Morgan route away from first-class and Test cricket, though I suspect that will happen. 32nd over: England 178-4 (Root 24, Buttler 10) Steve Smith continues the policy of pace at one end, with Richardson replacing Starc. It’s good captaincy from Smith, who won’t die wondering if Australia lose this game. Joe Root punches a few nice drives without piercing the field, and there are two runs from the over. 31st over: England 176-4 (Root 22, Buttler 10) Tye is pulled smoothly round the corner for by Buttler, who then fresh-airs an attempt to dump the ball out of the ground. Whatever the circumstances, this England batting line-up carry on almost robotically with their ultra-attacking game. It’s as if they don’t register the fall of wickets or pressure moments. “Let me get this right then,” writes Mike Selvey. “You are live-blogging the Gabba from Orkney? I think that’s as leftfield as it gets.” The weirdest thing is that they are playing on despite a blanket of snow at the Gabba. Wait, hang on. 30th over: England 169-4 (Root 19, Buttler 6) This is Starc’s eighth over. I think that’s a justified gamble. It doesn’t leave much for the death overs, but then there might not be any death overs if Australia don’t take another wicket here. Buttler, who could do with a score after a fairly barren run in ODIs, pulls breezily for two, and a handful of singles take England to within 102 of victory. 29th over: England 164-4 (Root 18, Buttler 2) One more wicket would give Australia a plentiful sniff of victory. Moeen is brilliant but unreliable and pressure can do strange things to a lower order, however talented. “I’m not sure Morgan has quite the importance of Colly to England’s white ball stuff,” says Gary Naylor. “The Durham man raised standards in the field, showed the way with pace-off, wicket-to-wicket bowling on dead tracks, could re-establish a innings in crisis or accelerate one going well and skippered the side to a global trophy. But I’ll revise my opinion in 2019 if things go to plan.” That’s a persuasive argument, especially as he won a white-ball trophy with England. Morgan’s biggest achievement is that he has altered DNA like nobody before him. 28th over: England 159-4 (Root 14, Buttler 1) Dear England, please don’t play silly buggers and lose this game. Love, Rob. “You’ve got it exactly right on Morgan as a captain,” says Kevin Wilson, high-fiving me with joy and love. “I know he had a rough time in the UAE against Pakistan but don’t you just wish he went back to Middlesex and knuckled down? Given England’s middle-order woes, I’d take a 30 average from Morgan if he captained the side.” I used to think that, but focussing exclusively on the one-day stuff has surely made him a much better captain. He’s got a doctorate in white-ball cricket. Morgan falls, dragging Starc onto the stumps via the body. It was a useful knock, 21 from 27 balls, but England need to be careful or they could lose a game they have dominated throughout. 27th over: England 157-3 (Root 13, Morgan 21) Andrew Tye replaces Jhye Richardson and draws a leading edge from Morgan that plops short of mid-off. That’s all. “Bairstow as keeper is a decision that needs to be challenged more,” says Mark Gillespie. “Bairstow will never be a world class Test batsman while he’s expected to keep wicket as well. He may not become that anyway, but he’s by far the most likely. I don’t understand why we haven’t yet tried Foakes behind the stumps to free up Bairstow to move into the top 5. Batting him at 5 while keeping just seems like a fudge. I sometimes get the impression that we don’t do that because of how much stock he seems to place on being keeper, but it needs to be what’s best for the team that matters. It doesn’t preclude him doing it in the future if it doesn’t help his batting and/or another keeper doesn’t make runs.” I agree, up to a point. I’m not sure he realises how good a Test batsman he could become. Thing is, though, the emergence of Malan changes things because England no longer need a No5, which would have been Bairstow’s natural position as a specialist batsman. The number of moveable parts and contradictory imperatives make selecting a Test XI really tricky, which is one reasons why I think they should embrace rotation. 26th over: England 153-3 (Root 10, Morgan 20) Starc returns, a good move from Steve Smith, though one he might have made before Morgan rushed to 18. Morgan can be susceptible to hot hot heat, especially early in his innings. He looks comfortable enough now, and is content to take a couple of runs and see off Starc’s over. 25th over: England 150-3 (Root 9, Morgan 18) A quiet over from Head, four from it. England need 122 runs from 152 balls; Australia need seven wickets from 152 balls. 24th over: England 146-3 (Root 8, Morgan 15) Morgan plays a remarkable stroke, picking Richardson up for a lazy six over deep backward square. I know Morgan’s form fluctuates wildly these days but when he’s in form he’s quite exhilarating. He should get more credit; you could argue (politely) that he’s the most important white-ball cricketer England have ever had. 23rd over: England 138-3 (Root 7, Morgan 8) Travis Head replaces Stoinis and almost picks up the wicket of Morgan, who slices a cut fractionally short of Warner at backward point. The ball runs away for four, and a hearty pull brings him a second boundary later in the over. Incidentally, look at this innings from Morgan in the final of the T10 league last year. 22nd over: England 129-3 (Root 6, Morgan 0) Eoin Morgan, beaten for pace, inside edges his first ball back onto the pad. This is a very impressive debut from Richardson, who has figures of 5-1-17-2. “While you’ve been coming to terms with ‘cognitive dissonance’, I think I’ve found the truest meaning in the phrase ‘The agony, the ecstasy’,” says Matt Dony. “Waking up and checking the score during the Test series was, more often than not, a painful chore. My phone was not my friend. Many wintery mornings started off in a funk. Now, though, I can pick up my phone and wonder what combination of batsmen will win it for England today? Which bowler wreaked the most damage? Who will frustrate Australian bowlers the most? It’s great. This must be what it felt like to be Australian for so long.” Hold that thought for a few overs, eh. Another one for Richardson! Bairstow slaps a drive straight to extra cover, where David Warner takes a comfortable catch. Australia are back in the match. 21st over: England 124-2 (Bairstow 60, Root 1) Stoinis’s slower short ball beats Bairstow for lack of pace. The wicket has changed the mood slightly, with a bit of a spring in Australia’s step. They need more wickets though, ideally eight of them. “Morning Rob,” says Matt Emerson. “Given that all bets are off when it comes to the Test team would it be worth a go putting Bairstow up to open in Tests? He’s got a better technique than most of the others we’ve tried and you could drop Cook to three as you’ve suggested and Vince to five/six, which is where it feels like he belongs.” I think that would be too much. Remember his dismissal to the second new ball at Sydney, for example. That said, he’s so talented and resourceful that it’s not beyond him. If Bairstow is going to stay as keeper, which seems likely, I wouldn’t have him any higher than No5. 20th over: England 119-2 (Bairstow 58, Root 0) “How is it possible we never looked like winning a Test and never look like losing an ODI vs pretty much the same opposition?” says Tom Morgan. “Either bald or seven wigs the Spanish would say (if they followed both formats of cricket).” The short answer is confidence, though there’s a lot more to it than that. Having England’s best ever ODI captain helps. The pacy Jhye Richardson replaces Mitchell Starc. Man better know it’s hot out there - and that heat has led to a wicket! Hales, hurried by a delivery that also cramps him for room, drags the ball back onto the stumps to end an excellent innings of 57. That’s Richardson’s first ODI wicket, a lovely moment for any young player. At 21, he looks a seriously exciting find. 19th over: England 119-1 (Bairstow 58, Hales 57) Marcus Stoinis replaces Aaron Finch nand is milked for three runs. Australia, who started with furious intent, look pretty downbeat. 18th over: England 116-1 (Bairstow 57, Hales 54) England are cruising. They need 155 from 32 overs, and that’s drinks. “Dan Lucas had (“had” - isn’t it ridiculous to write that word of such a young man) a treasure trove of knowledge about loads of stuff that doesn’t matter... by virtue of which, of course, it does,” says Gary Naylor. “He held an opinion on all of it, that he would argue, day and night, with the kind of passion that reminded me of happy days in halls of residence. And - how I miss this - he’d do it all with a smile, a wry word or two and a generosity of spirit that the world can ill-afford to have lost in these grim-faced, keyboard-mashing, humourless times.” You know, that’s a great point. The once noble art of argument has become a tedious, point-scoring exercise. With Dan, it was usually fun. 17th over: England 109-1 (Bairstow 52, Hales 53) Now Hales reaches his fifty, swinging Finch sweetly over long-on for six. This is a masterclass in businesslike punishment. Australia are desperate for a wicket and briefly consider a review when Bairstow survives an LBW appeal after missing a sweep. It was missing leg.null 16th over: England 101-1 (Bairstow 52, Hales 46) Mitchell Starc returns to the attack, a move that is both desperate and sensible. Bairstow smokes him back over his head for four to reach a storming half-century from 41 balls. Right here, right now, he looks a helluva one-day opener. It’s not all bish-bosh, either; he is one of the world’s best runners between the wickets. “Loving this England one-day team, slightly deflated by the Test performances of late, especially away from home,” says Dave Besley. “Any ideas on having consistently good performances over all 3 formats? (Of course, I understand if you knew the magical answer, you’d be working for an International team and not doing the OBO).” I would definitely try split coaches. It didn’t work in 2013, because Ashley Giles got the dregs for the white-ball teams, but things have changed since then: there is less crossover between the teams and a greater emphasis on limited-overs cricket. 15th over: England 93-1 (Bairstow 46, Hales 44) “While I am ever glad of your word pictures I do wish I was watching this,” says Ian Copestake. “I have cathartic needs that only the evidence of my eyes can assuage.” Copestake, you need to be nicer to me. 14th over: England 91-1 (Bairstow 46, Hales 42) Australia need wickets if they are to have any chance of winning this game. I’d be tempted to get Starc back for a couple of overs. Hales survives a run-out referral after stealing a second run to third man. 13th over: England 85-1 (Bairstow 45, Hales 37) Australia turn to another part-time spinner, Aaron Finch. Actually, that description is unfair: he’s not a spinner, he’s a slow bowler. Honk. His first over goes for seven, with Bairstow heaving a boundary over midwicket. Bairstow’s average is the 11th highest in ODI history. He wasn’t even in the team six months ago! 12th over: England 78-1 (Bairstow 39, Hales 36) Bairstow is duped by Tye’s slower ball but gets enough on it to clear mid-off and get three runs. He ends the other with a boundary, blasting a back cut to the fence. This is hilarious. This is England. I haven’t a clue what I’m watching. At the 2007 World Cup, in a de facto quarter-final against South Africa, England were nine for none after seven overs. Now look at them. “Pretty sure nobody else in Piura, Peru is following you at 03:20am,” says David Murphy. “Any other ridiculous places or times on offer from your army of fans?” Army! Fans! 11th over: England 68-1 (Bairstow 31, Hales 35) Bairstow plants the front dog and wallops a sweep shot for four off Head. This is tremendous batting. BIFF! BANG! BONG! MO FARAH SIGN! Bairstow has quietly taken his ODI average to a whopping 49.33; it was 32 at the start of the last English summer. “Let me second your post on Dan Lucas, Rob,” says Guy Hornsby. “It still seems utterly bewildering that he’s not here. He’d be sharing our bafflement about how England are dominating Australia with the white ball, excoriating the ECB’s wonky logic over Ben Stokes, and posting YouTube videos to late-90s indie bands to illustrate the power of a Hales leg-side ramp. What an unfair world this is sometimes.” 10th over: England 60-1 (Bairstow 25, Hales 33) When Tye drops short, Bairstow smashes a boundary over the head of backward point. That defeat to Pakistan in the semi-final of the Champions Trophy is getting more irritating by the day. I don’t know if England can ensure they get fast pitches for next year’s World Cup. But they should do everything they can, because on good batting tracks they are the best team in the world. 9th over: England 56-1 (Bairstow 21, Hales 33) Bairstow, on the walk, survives an LBW appeal from Head. It was a decent shout but there were far too many variables for Smith to review. The technology suggests it would have bounced over the top. A rubbish delivery is then dragged round the corner for four by Bairstow, continuing England’s brilliant, businesslike start. 8th over: England 49-1 (Bairstow 12, Hales 33) The white-ball specialist Andrew Tye comes into the attack. A good start - five dot balls - is tarnished when Hales slams the last delivery between extra cover and mid on for four. “As a follow up to Andrew Benton’s question (over 4), could you shed light on why Ben Stokes is charged with a serious crime and is eligible to play, but Ben Duckett tips a drink over someone and gets fined and banned for a series and a half?” says Richard. “It’s just anti-Northants bias isn’t it?!” Can I phone a friend? 7th over: England 45-1 (Bairstow 12, Hales 29) Australia must regret coming into this match without a specialist spinner. Steve Smith has already turned to the part-time offspin of Travis Head, a fair gamble during the Powerplay. Hales muscles his first ball to the cover boundary and sweeps his fourth over short fine leg for four more. England are batting with such cold-eyed authority. 6th over: England 36-1 (Bairstow 12, Hales 20) Four more for Hales, pumped through the covers off Richardson. You need Batman fight graphics for this England batting line-up. BOFF! KAPOW! ZOK! FETCHTHAT! A thick edge goes well wide of the only slip for a single. 5th over: England 29-1 (Bairstow 12, Hales 15) Many felt England should have played three openers during the Ashes. They’re doing that in this series - but three openers means something completely different in one-day cricket, and the No3 Hales is off to a flyer. He pings Starc through backward point for his third boundary before rotating the strike. That allows Bairstow to hit consecutive fours with a hearty clout through the covers and a pristine drive through extra cover. Starc responds with a cracking short ball that follows Bairstow and thumps him in the left breast as he tries to sway out the way. “Afternoon Rob,” says Phil Withall. “The dismissal of Roy has just reinforced the difference between watching the Test team and the one-day side. In Tests, when an important batsman falls, I get nervous about impending collapse. With the 50-over lot I just shrug and think there’s still a lot more to come. I’m enjoying this new development rather a lot.” I suspect that, at least unconsciously, the teams react that way as well. 4th over: England 16-1 (Bairstow 4, Hales 10) Another good over from Richardson, who is bowling a challenging full length at impressive speed. One from it. “Could you kindly shed light on why Ben Stokes has now been charged he’s eligible to play, but when he wasn’t charged he wasn’t eligible?” says Andrew Benton. “Makes no sense to me.” I don’t think it’s as black and white as that, particularly in an age of social-media witch hunts. This piece, from Cricinfo’s Andrew Miller, sums it up well. 3rd over: England 15-1 (Bairstow 4, Hales 9) Hales gets off the mark with a boundary, flogging a Starc bouncer over midwicket, and he gets another with a scythe through point off a low full toss. The start to this innings has been a fascinating slugfest, with neither team putting their gloves up. 2nd over: England 6-1 (Bairstow 4, Hales 0) Jonny Bairstow gets off the mark with an emphatic cover drive for four off the debutant Jhye Richardson. He tries to drive the next delivery, which beats him for pace, takes the inside edge and misses the stumps by a whisker. That’s an impressive start from Richardson, whose pace has already reached 90mph/145kph. 1st over: England 2-1 (Bairstow 0, Hales 0) Starc is swinging the new ball, which is always good news for Australia. Mitchell Starc strikes with his fourth ball! This is great cricket from Australia. They had a short midwicket especially for Jason Roy, who clipped an inswinger straight to him. After smashing 180 on Sunday, Roy lasted four balls today. “Nice pattern emerging as an Englishman watching this series,” says Brian Withington. “Have a sleep whilst Finch gets a hundred then wake to enjoy everything else.” Yeah, but if he does it a third time he gets to keep us. Yesterday would have been the 32nd birthday of the OBO’s Dan Lucas. We all miss him terribly. I really want to know what he thought of Twin Peaks, and hear him rant about James Vince’s batting. His loved ones are continuing to raise funds for JDRF, which is dedicated to Type 1 Diabetes research; if you are feeling charitable, this link is for you. Thanks Geoff, morning everyone. Time was, being ripped from happy sleep at 6am to cover an England ODI made a man growl with dissatisfaction. Not now. It’s a pleasure to watch this England team. Not only are they brilliant and entertaining; they’re also educational. For the first time in my life, I think I understand what ‘cognitive dissonance’ means. After decades of watching mostly mediocre England teams, there is now the jarring sensation of expecting them to beat Australia in Australia. Not hoping against hope; not praying against prayer; expecting. They need 271 to win at the Gabba after another streetwise performance in the field. Australia never really threatened to get away, despite another century from Aaron Finch. Since the last World Cup England have won six and tied one of the seven games in which they’ve been asked to chase between 250 and 300. A win today would leave them 2-0 up with three to play, on the brink of a first ever bilateral ODI series win in Australia*. And it would probably further our understanding of cognitive dissonance. * There have only been a handful of bilateral series. England did win triangular/quadrangular tournaments in 1986-87 (twice) and, ridiculously, 2006-07. Australia was... not good. That’s all you can say there. Some terrific bowling from England to stop them getting away, some difficulty timing the ball from the home side. Mitch Marsh dragged the pace down through the middle when sent out to speed things up. Cam White struggled late. Aaron Finch was supposed to be the anchor but was out trying to lift the rate. Travis Head looked all at sea. Only Alex Carey really hit the ball well from the get-go. Should be a formality for England, but we’ll see if today’s batting struggles extend to both sides. Australia has no specialist spinner, and England’s spinners took five of the seven wickets to fall to bowlers. The other two also fell to a bowler, but via Woakes’ run-outs. He was terrific today. Rob Smyth will be terrific too, and I’ll leave you in his capable hands for the chase. Farewell. 50th over: Australia 270-9 (White 15) The wicket falls first ball. Woakes bowls White a perfect yorker which can only be dug out for one. In comes AJ Tye, and slaps two runs to the midwicket gap. Misses the next short ball, then gets a low full toss and powers it down the ground for six! Final ball, another short one, another attempt to scramle the single, and this time White is backing up well enough to make it down to the striker’s end, but Woakes goes by hand this time, picks up the ball, spins, and throws down the non-striker’s stumps to run out Tye. A fitting end for a struggling innings. No mistake this time. Same ball, same shot, difference side of the ground in the shade, and Roy hangs on. 49th over: Australia 261-7 (White 14, Starc 3) White nails a pull shot, but straight to the man in the deep. Starc can only find singles as well. Finally Starc tries to launch a length ball from Wood, it goes straight to Root at deep midwicket, but he’s in bad position and drops the catch. Doesn’t really amtter, you wouldn’t think, aside from the bowler’s figures. Root was looking straight into the sun. Saves the four, though. 48th over: Australia 255-6 (White 11, Starc 0) Three overs left. Australia need about 20 from each of them. Woakes is bowling, and Carey can only jab a single to midwicket. White comes across to the off side, trying a pick-up shot, but misses. Doing the right thing moving, but can’t connect. Then backs away to leg, but Woakes goes wide of off, and there’s no connection. Then the fateful jab to leg, Carey takes off for the run, and Woakes is fleeter by foot. Starc can’t score from the last two balls. One run from the over. Goooooooolazooooo! Golazo! Qué patada increíble. Woakes with the shot and it’s in the top corner. He tied down Cameron White, the batsmen scrambled or a single from a back-foot defensive shot, Woakes took the kick in his follow through, and hit the stumps from short midwicket before Carey could get home. Terrific skills. 47th over: Australia 254-6 (White 11, Carey 26) No one can time it on this pitch. Carey and White both get short balls from Wood, but both are dragged away for singles rather than punted into the stands. Slow-ball bouncer from Wood beats Carey entirely,as the bowler takes a tumble. Carey charges the last and slogs, but deep midwicket is there. Six from the over, after White started with a brace to cover. 46th over: Australia 248-6 (White 7, Carey 24) White goes the reverse again, but England know their man and have a short third in place. Only a single. Carey drops to one knee and pounds Rashid out through deep mid for four! Lovely shot, good attack and it split the gap perfectly. Got to go, so Carey motors for the single to point next ball. White awaits, charges the ball, but can only find cover. Another dot. Then a single to long-off. Needs to set sail. Carey does! Down on one knee again, this time over cover for four! Rashid gave that more width, fearing his leg-side play, but Carey has all the options. 45th over: Australia 237-6 (White 5, Carey 15) Mark Wood back on, staying back of a length. Carey blocks one, then punches a run to cover. White gloves a run to third man. England are right on top here - four singles from the over, 30 balls to go, and it’s gonna take an explosion for Australia to get a competitive score. 44th over: Australia 233-6 (White 3, Carey 13) That’s more like it, Alex Carey! Smacks the sweep shot square for four, then goes with more nuance fine on the same shot for four more. Takes a single, and Cam White nearly nails the reverse for four, but Buttler gets a boot one it and keeps it to one. Rashid adds a wide that Carey has the presence of mind to watch go by, then adds a single, and it’s another costly Rashid over, this time worth 12. 43rd over: Australia 221-6 (White 2, Carey 3) Ok, Carey is going to make me look silly. Defends, miscues, finds the field, defends. Plunkett can’t believe he’s bowled the 43rd over of an ODI, and had it cost a single and a wide. Looking grim for Australia. “What is it about 50-over cricket that seems to bring out the ‘failings’ of Australian batsman? There seems to be a more vulnerable side to them that isn’t on display in the Tests. Or is it the varied use of the England bowling attack?” Australia hasn’t produced a lot of players in recent times who can score from just about any delivery. And who can find the boundary whenever required. England has. Travis Head at his best is like that, but hasn’t been. Glenn Maxwell is like that, but isn’t playing. David Warner was like that, but has come down the gears, and ditto Steve Smith. 42nd over: Australia 219-6 (White 2, Carey 2) So, Alex Carey from South Australia prepares to face his debutant ball. Always a nerve-wracking occasion. Luckily he’s worn the right outfit. One-day cap 223, and 15 List A games to his name beforee today. The left-hander punches a run first ball behind point. Can be super destructive, and eight overs can be enough. He made a hundred in 17 overs for the Adelaide Strikers the other night. Again, only three from this over. Lovely ball from Rashid. Flight, turn, and as Stoinis lunges forward it takes the outside edge through to the keeper. A big threat defused. 41st over: Australia 216-5 (Stoinis 4, White 1) So, tough ask for Cameron White. Three years out of the side, bumped down the order today, then asked to come in with 10 overs left and make a difference. England swarming here, ten overs left and just past 200 on the board, with two new men at the crease. Even 300 could be tough from here. White has to not panic and play himself in. There’s a touch of panic as he gets off the mark though, a real Morse Code run: dot, dot, dash. Stoinis is slow to respond and would have been in strife with a better throw, but makes his ground. Two singles and a wide from the over. A wicket is next. Just as they fell back to back in Melbourne, so do Marsh and Finch fall here. His weak spot, Finch, the lofted smear to mid-on or mid-off. This one goes to the former, a big drive at easily catchable height, and again Finch makes three fingers but can’t go big beyond it. 40th over: Australia 213-4 (Finch 106, Stoinis 3) The big-hitting Stoinis to the crease. What’s next? Marsh charges, misses, and it’s simple. He doesn’t even try to get back. Although maybe he could have if he had dived, because Jos Buttler missed the bails on his first swipe. Had to knock them off with a second attempt. Buttler was only being so casual because Marsh was stranded, but maybe if the batsman had really scrambled... anyway, he’s gone. 39th over: Australia 208-3 (Finch 104, Marsh 36) Finch wants to go here, looking for the big shots, but Plunkett is defeating him nicely, mixing up pace and width so Finch can’t time the ball away. Gets a couple, then one, and Marsh is trying a spine-contorting pull shot that he drags over midwicket for four. You know when they describe strokeplay as effortless? That was the opposite. 38th over: Australia 200-3 (Finch 101, Marsh 32) Rashid makes Finch wait, finding the field twice to start the over, but from the third ball Finch squeezes it out through square leg, runs the first hard, and belts back for the second run at full stretch. Celebrates in understated fashion. Back to back hundreds to Aaron Finch, and his 10th career ODI ton. That takes him level with another barrel-chested opener, Matthew Hayden, and leaves only four Australian batsmen ahead of him on the centuries list: Warner, Gilchrist, Mark Waugh, and Ponting. Not bad company. 37th over: Australia 195-3 (Finch 98, Marsh 30) Marsh gives it the full Sharapova again, but again can’t enhance his performance enough to find the boundary with his pull shot against Woakes. Two runs and a leg bye! In the 37th over. Very shortly, something has got to give. 36th over: Australia 192-3 (Finch 97, Marsh 29) Rashid to Finch. A couple of singles, then the Australian opener is down on one knee, slamming the sweep shot through backward square for four! Two men in the deep there, and neither could stop it. He’s a boundary away from another century, and keeps the strike with a late single. 35th over: Australia 185-3 (Finch 91, Marsh 28) Woakes to continue after drinks, to Finch and Marsh. Singles, then Marsh is beaten on the outside edge, looking for a big drive. Then a block. The ball rolls back a bit, and Marsh blocks it with his bat again towards the bowler, then jokingly mimes at picking it up. Woakes feigns an appeal to the square leg umpire. An impromptu parody of the Under 19 World Cup, with that dismissal for obstructing the field that people have bee talking about this week. Four from the over. 34th over: Australia 181-3 (Finch 89, Marsh 26) Ah, here we go. Adil Rashid is back in the attack. He’s been swung around to the Stanley Street End, Michael Clarke noting on the telly that the boundaries are a bit bigger from this end, affording him some more protection. Went for a couple of sixes in his abortive first spell earlier. Lands a couple alright here, and gets away with a low full toss punched for a single. Rashid half saves a brutal drive that goes back through his legs from Marsh, and just takes enough heat off it to stop it going for four down the ground, as long-off comes around. Seven from the over in ones and twos. Drinks. 33rd over: Australia 174-3 (Finch 86, Marsh 22) Just can’t get going against Woakes. Slower ball bouncers, a wide, a couple of singles, and when Marsh tries a big pull shot he lets out an Australian Open grunt of effort, but still can’t time it and only drags a run to the deep. Three singles and the wide from the over. 32nd over: Australia 170-3 (Finch 85, Marsh 20) Root with another good over, three singles from it. England have used three spinners today, Australia don’t have a specialist spinner. And they have to start lifting this run rate, hoving around 5.3. 31st over: Australia 167-3 (Finch 84, Marsh 18) Wood continuing at the body, but this time the Australians have his measure, Finch glancing a couple, Marsh glancing three when he gets on strike. Six runs from the over. 30th over: Australia 161-3 (Finch 81, Marsh 15) He’s playing the spinners well now, Finch. Backs away again, gives himself the width, and carves Root through point for another four. That wasn’t even that short, and would have clean bowled him had he missed. high stakes stuff, but Finch has his eye in now, and the chance of another hundred on the cards. Seven from the over with some singles. 20 overs to go. Run rate near 5.5. 29th over: Australia 154-3 (Finch 75, Marsh 14) Macbeth, ye shall be king till Mark Wood shall come to Dunsinane. Here he comes, and its’ so nearly a good over, pinning both batsmen down with sharp stuff at the body. But the last ball slips too short, and Marsh pounds away the pull for four as Wood curses. 28th over: Australia 149-3 (Finch 74, Marsh 10) Mitch Marsh working the singles alright, which hasn’t traditionally been part of his game. He also takes advatnage of a Root short ball to slap it through point for four. Another eight-run over. They’ll need plenty of those. “So, erm, did Steve Smith just miss one on his pads?” asks Sam on email. “That’s weird. Is Lucifer also putting his coat and gloves on? What a strange thing to happen.” It did happen. The ball turned a bit. I wonder how Australia’s no-spinner policy will look by about 9pm tonight. 27th over: Australia 141-3 (Finch 72, Marsh 4) Single, single, then Moeen bowls a touch short and Finch is back away, crouching, and powering this through point for four. Savage cut-slash-drive-whateveryoulike. A couple more singles, and eight from the over will please Australia. 26th over: Australia 133-3 (Finch 66, Marsh 2) Root keeps on turning the screws. Even when the ball slips and he bowls a beamer, he sends down the free hit slower, and gets bite as it lands. Mitch Marsh aims an unholy hoick at it over midwicket, and gets nothing, hit on the body. Four from the seven-ball over including the penalty run. “At the risk of sounding really silly if this match goes pear shaped, this is almost too easy at the moment. An expert white ball team slowly but surely outplaying a behind-the-times side. As a long suffering England fan , I say, enjoy the good times while they last.” That’s all that one can do in life, Sachin Paul. 25th over: Australia 129-3 (Finch 64, Marsh 1) So nearly a run out! Moeen to Finch, flicks the ball square and wants the second run. Finch knows that he’s pretty brisk, but the ball goes to the non-striker’s end, and Marsh is a much more ponderous runner. Nor does Marsh essay the dive, which might have gained him precious ground. But it’s the classic split-screen scenario: in one frame, Marsh is out and the bails are on. In the next, the wicket is broken and the bat is in. So he has to be not out, and so the third umpire rules. Three singles follow. 24th over: Australia 124-3 (Finch 60, Marsh 0) Mitchell Marsh promoted, which is interesting. Cam White can hit big and can bat long with the rest of them, and Marsh isn’t usually the fastest starter. So whether they want stability or to lift the run rate, I can’t see the value of the change from the pre-game team sheet. We shall see. Well, he never looked comfortable in this innings, and it ends uncomfortably. Cramped for room as Root targets his body, bit of a nothing push at the ball, and lobs it back to the bowler. Root is on fire, 2 for 9 in his third over. 23rd over: Australia 119-2 (Finch 55, Head 7) Plunkett carrying on, and Head gets a couple of twos by working them through midwicket. But he keeps finding the field from his other shots, and he’s sputtering on 7 from 17. 22nd over: Australia 115-2 (Finch 55, Head 3) Root to continue. Head nearly plays onto his stumps, a big drive into his back boot as he dropped into a crouch. Two singles from the over. England getting back on top. 21st over: Australia 113-2 (Finch 54, Head 2) England getting back on top, an over worth three runs from Plunkett, as Head gets off the mark by punching two through cover. 20th over: Australia 110-2 (Finch 53, Head 0) A lot rests with Finch now, with both Australia’s most senior players gone. The leadership duo and the most experienced in Warner and Smith. Travis Head to the crease. Root’s introduction to the bowling crease pays huge dividends. Both reviews burned now! Smith tries to play round his front pad and work the ball to leg, Root gets some turn to strike his pad in line. The review always looked optimistic, but Smith asked Finch if it was turning enough to miss leg, and as Finch yo’d probably find it hard to tell your captain no. The review shows it hitting between middle and leg, though umpire’s call for height. It looked out live, if I were the non-striker. 19th over: Australia 108-1 (Finch 52, Smith 17) A shocker from England really. Ok, there were two noises as the ball missed Smith’s inside edge and hit both pads on the way through to the keeper. But England were so excited about the prospect of actually dismissing Smith that they were willing to go for anything. The ball clearly misses the inside edge on one reply, but we still go through the rigmarole of Hot Spot and Snicko and the rest just to reach the obvious conclusion. Australia’s pair work some singles and a two, and Finch raises his fifty from 51 balls. 18th over: Australia 102-1 (Finch 49, Smith 15) Better milking this over from Finch. He goes to the leg side repeatedly with the turn of Moeen Ali, for a couple of twos and then a one. Smith takes a single. These middle-over accumulations suit the captain. 17th over: Australia 96-1 (Finch 44, Smith 14) Finch is having a real stop-start day. Spends some time in the doldrums, then catches a leading breeze. He’s becalmed against Rashid in this over, four dot balls and then a single after Smith works a run first ball. The run rate is still only 5.65. 16th over: Australia 94-1 (Finch 43, Smith 13) Another corker from Moeen, three singles from it in the end. Another appeal for a catch down leg, but that ball just brushed Finch’s pad, which saved the bowler from conceding a wide. 15th over: Australia 91-1 (Finch 42, Smith 11) Adil Rashid goes for his second six in seven balls. This time it’s Smith, advancing as he loves to do, and lofting this ball straight. The field was up there, but long-on immediately is dropped back, and Smith contentedly takes the single to that position. Big appeal next as Rashid’s googly comes back and beats Finch, but might have been just missing leg stump, and HawkEye has it as umpire’s call. England don’t review. A couple of singles follow. 14th over: Australia 82-1 (Finch 41, Smith 3) Fire and ice. Moeen drills down another accurate over of off-breaks, conceding three singles. 13th over: Australia 79-1 (Finch 40, Smith 1) Adil Rashid on, and nearly bowls Finch round his legs! Smith takes a single first ball of the over, then Finch spars at one down leg side, it beats his pad and turns back enough to hit the keeper but not leg stump. Wide, but nearly a wicket. Is Finch rattled? Um, no, as Rashid overpitches and Finch takes the ACE line alllll the way downtown. That was Harlem to the Staten Island ferry, the ball was still going up as it crossed the rope, I reckon, and it hit the second tier of the Gabba grandstand before bouncing back into the first. What a strike. Finishes off the over with another two through square. 12th over: Australia 69-1 (Finch 32, Smith 0) A couple of singles and a brace from the Moeen over before Warner’s wicket. Steve Smith to the crease, a player who has been astronomical in Tests but so far only very good in ODIs. There’s no question that Virat Kohli is miles ahead of him (and anyone else) in this discipline. Can he continue the Summer of Smith today? Not immediately, with a leg bye keeping him on nought. Lovely bowling from Mo! He’s speared a few balls in at Warner, then this one he tosses up and rips. Warner hasn’t adjusted, and is playing from the crease, only prodding at that delivery as it comes down. Morgan has been adventurous enough to install a slip, and the outside edge comes directly to Root in that position. Fine play from England, and the first strike. 11th over: Australia 64-0 (Warner 32, Finch 31) Finch to Plunkett, and just clears mid-on. Woakes was standing just inside the fielding circle, and Finch’s attempt at the lofted drive became more of a drag. It cleared the fingertips and away for four. 10th over: Australia 56-0 (Warner 30, Finch 26) Moeen Ali on his way for his first over. Does well, ties down Finch for a few balls, and in the end gives up only a couple of singles. Good start. “Geoff, from an Aussie to all your English readers, who are so excited by England’s ODI performance, I say only this: Four – Nil. To quote Metallica – Nothing Else Matters.” Well, John Phaceas, I would say the World Cup matters, and this contest is a key part of both teams’ preparation. 9th over: Australia 54-0 (Warner 29, Finch 25) Plunkett for his first over. A single for Finch behind square, then Warner steals two very cheeky runs. Expert cat burglar level there, as Finch came out of his crease, the throw hit the non-striker’s stumps, then ricocheted into a gap at midwicket for the left-hander. Warner was alive not just to the chance of an overthrow, but got back legs pumping for the second. Gets off strike next ball, Finch glances a four, then a single. The 50 partnership is up. 8th over: Australia 45-0 (Warner 26, Finch 19) Finally another boundary for Finch, who was tied down last over, as Woakes gives him a short enough length and Finch can help the pull shot on its way. Woakes comes back well though, keeping Finch to a single, before Warner finds the field three times in a row. 7th over: Australia 40-0 (Warner 26, Finch 14) Mark Wood really pulling things back here. Makes Finch defend once... twice... three times! Finally Finch gets a single. Warner says, none of this, we need runs. So he plonks his front foot down and drills a length ball back down the ground for four! Wood predictably goes shorter, and Warner goes back on his stumps and pulls four more. A great over becomes a poor one in the blink of an eye. 6th over: Australia 31-0 (Warner 18, Finch 13) Spectators wearing replica baggy greens, get in the sea. Finch runs a single to fine leg, Warner gets a full ball and utterly pounds Woakes down the ground. That shot made a rifle crack, dead straight down the pitch. Woakes dials his length back and Warner can only stab a dot ball back to close the over. So this pair hitting some nice shots, but Australia hasn’t yet got away. Five an over with the field restrictions in place. 5th over: Australia 26-0 (Warner 14, Finch 12) Now it’s Finch’s turn to tip and run a single. Punches to mid-on and a quarter of a chance for him to be run out, but the throw goes to the striker’s end instead. If you’re keeping an eye on the Australian Open in Melbourne, where it’s 39.7 degrees with a max of 42 coming, the good news is it’s not so pad in Brisbane. Just over 30 now, with a high of 32. So, plenty hot, but not as ridiculous for elite sport. Warner punches off the back foor through point, splits the field there, and though Jason Roy puts in a great chase and dive, the back of his hand has touched the rope as he flicks the ball back, so four runs are awarded after all. 4th over: Australia 21-0 (Warner 10, Finch 11) Ooof, Warner skews a single away in the air but gets a run behind point. Finch is settling in for the long haul, is the indication, as he leaves and defends a few balls from Woakes. Happy to wait for the ones that suit him, and when he plays like that, Finch tends to make hundreds. Just saying. Only two from the over, good comeback. 3rd over: Australia 19-0 (Warner 9, Finch 10) Wood to Warner, still banging away toward the left-hander’s hip, and Warner is able to swivel-pull a couple of runs, then glance a single. Another short ball for Finch, it’s a better one, but he absolutely creams that for four! It was airborne and on slow-mo looked a chance for Hales at midwicket, but Finch hit the ball so hard that it was past Hales before he even had time to put his hand up. Nowhere near it in the end, and Hot Spot shows that coming perfectly out of the exact middle of the sweet spot. Impressive. Tops off the over with another two through square leg. “You can say the Aussie team looks ‘bits and pieces’ but let’s face it Geoff, you must have that feeling in your tummy like all English fans that this false hope of a English resurrection is about to be dashed.” As a lifelong Australian and an impartial observer of cricket, Neil Brandom, it is my melancholy duty to inform you that your thesis is awry. 2nd over: Australia 10-0 (Warner 6, Finch 4) Chris Woakes to open the bowling from the other end, and also starts with a dot as Warner bunts one off his thigh. A beauty next ball rips past the outside edge as Warner prods uncertainly. Good lift and nice carry with the new shiny white pill. Woakes has the bartender’s towel hanging out of his trousers, and serves up another that sears past Warner’s back-foot prod. Woakes just laughs. Warner stabs to mid-on and bolts with the shot, and this time Finch responds. He’s glad he did, as he gets a nice friendly short ball and pounds it to the midwicket fence. Thanks for that. Good contest so far. 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 5, Finch 0) Heeeere we go. The gold-clad duo make their way to the middle. The sun shines bright on the Gabba. Mark Wood is ready with his 100-metre sprint take-off. Warner blocks the first ball, but the second is fast and short. His shot is a bit more reflex than planned, but he gets enough on the hook to lift it over square leg and away for four. Fielding restrictions in place, so swing and swing hard. Almost a run-out on the next ball, as Warner punches to cover and hares off, but Finch sends him back. Could have been trouble if he’d made it another yard down the pitch. Finally pinches a single to point, and Finch is hit on the thigh pad from the last ball. “In Brisbane!” writes an excited Alex Coe. “But sadly about to disappear into meetings all day. Without even a phone to surreptitiously check the scores. It would great if Aus could be bowled out for, say, 73 by the time I get clear. Could you arrange?” Let me fire up the chair. Kevin Pietersen is giving batting demos in the middle, as his complex relationship with Brisbane continues to evolve. “I’m following England play from work in Bangkok,” emails Simon Nazer. “Unfortunately, my boss is Australian. I’ve had months of running commentaries from him about England’s continual Ashes failure - including email updates when I’ve been out of the country. May I kindly ask for another trouncing ODI win today and a reminder to Chris that England can play cricket sometimes? Thanks Geoff.” I’ll exercise every option within my power, from the chair in my living room. It’s a very powerful chair. Steve Smith calls correctly. And there’s an update to the expected team listed below, which has been revised, but if you haven’t refreshed your page - Cameron White is in, and Adam Zampa is out. As ever, the OBO needs you. Your thoughts, hopes fears, desires. Get me on Twitter @GeoffLemonSport, or email geoff.lemon@theguardian.com. Australia Warner Finch Smith * Head White Marsh Stoinis Carey + Starc Richardson Tye No spinner! This is interesting. Australia relying heavily on the two seaming all-rounders, will go in with Cameron White in the top order, and Carey batting down at eight. So a long batting line-up, but a lot of seam-up bowling. Pat Cummins was already due for a rest before Hazlewood got sick, so Jhye Richardson is in to join his Perth Scorchers teammate AJ Tye, and it’s an inexperienced specialist trio for Australia. Not too sure about this combo, it all looks kind of bits-and-pieces. England Roy Bairstow Hales Root Morgan * Buttler + Moeen Woakes Wood Plunkett Rashid Unchanged for England. A lot of the intrigue for Australia is about team line-ups. Glenn Maxwell isn’t in the squad. Cameron White is, but couldn’t get a game the first time round due to the preference for Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh and Marcus Stoinis in a middle order packed with all-rounders. Where’s ya bowling, Cam? Josh Hazlewood is sick with a virus, and won’t play. Tim Paine is sick too, so South Australia keeper Alex Carey gets his first Australian cap in any format. He’s fresh off a hundred in the Big Bash a couple of days ago, so he’ll be confident. Steve Smith and David Warner have been sick as well, but will apparently play lacking any reports otherwise. Of course we’ll fill you in soon... England will likely go unchanged after a barnstorming win at the MCG, chasing down 304 with overs and wickets aplenty to spare. Hello, halo, halloa, aloha. You know what’s better than the first One-Day International? The second One-Day International. Because now, in Brisbane, the plot lines are in motion, the narratives are forming, and it’s up to the players on the field to confirm them or divert them somewhere crazy and new. England is probably the best ODI team in the world at the moment, though India would make that a close contest. Australia is neither of those, and has been rusty for a couple of years despite often featuring a star-studded team sheet. These games are important, because Australia doesn’t play a ton of one-day cricket before the World Cup which is now only a year and a few months away, mid-2019 in England. So this series is a proper hit-out against a quality team, and a chance for certain players to stake their claims or be cast aside. Geoff will be here shortly.

Opponents of the mine have accused the state government of attempting to break its promise of “no public funds for Adani’ through a “backdoor” by continuing to consider Aurizon’s application for federal government funds to build the central Queensland rail line. The rail line is considered a key piece of infrastructure in opening the central Queensland region up to mining and would ultimately boost Adani’s prospects for opening its controversial mine. During Queensland’s election campaign in November, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced Labor would veto any loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund (Naif) to Adani to build the rail line from the Galilee basin to the Gladstone port. Under Naif rules, the state has to agree for the funds to be spent. The veto was seen as helping win crucial votes in the state’s south-east – where support for the Adani coalmine, once billed as the largest in the southern hemisphere, is low – and was considered instrumental in saving deputy premier Jackie Trad’s seat. While the Adani loan is considered dead, Aurizon put in its own application to Naif in March 2017 to build the rail line, which would allow not only Adani but GVK Hancock and Clive Palmer to potentially move forward with their mining interests in the area. Ben Pennings, who is challenging Larissa Waters and Andrew Bartlett for the Queensland Greens’ Senate spot, said the Galillee Blockade group, which was instrumental in lobbying against the Adani Naif loan, would now turn its attention to Aurizon. Trad, now the Queensland treasurer, was the first target, with a six-foot tall mascot, the “veto mosquito”, launched to follow state government MPs around until the Aurizon loan is also scuttled. “Labor promised no public funds would be used to help this mine,” Pennings said. “They are now looking at helping Adani through the backdoor, which is what this Aurizon loan would be. “It was a clear promise – no public funds for Adani. We are confident they will see sense and also veto this loan, so no public money goes to this mine either through the back or front door. “We shouldn’t have to hassle them to keep their promises but here we are.” A spokeswoman for Palaszczuk said the Naif loan that Adani had applied for had been vetoed, meeting the premier’s election commitment. But the government remained uncommitted on any further loan applications for the rail line. “Any other Naif loan will be assessed on its merits,” she said. The federal resources minister, Matt Canavan, strongly supports the mine. He attacked the state Labor government over its decision to veto the Adani loan and remains one of the firmest advocates for opening the basin up to mining. A spokeswoman for Aurizon confirmed the company had lodged its application for a Naif loan in March and said “dialogue” over the loan was continuing. “Any commercial commitment to invest by Aurizon would requite long-term take or pay contracts for the full capacity and at appropriate rates of return with Aurizon board sign-off,” she said. Pennings said he believed fighting the Aurizon loan was just as important as fighting Adani. “It could make the Adani coalmine billions of dollars cheaper,” he said. “It allows for Gina’s mine [Hancock] or Clive’s [Palmer] mine, to get the infrastructure they need. “We’ll keep turning up at functions, press conferences and their offices, until they [Labor] get the message.” Front Line Action on Coal Supporters of the Frontline Action on Coal group chained themselves to equipment at the central Queensland Abbot Point coal terminal on Thursday morning, shutting down the port for what they said was the second time this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/22/pay-of-australian-university-heads-called-into-question-after-uk-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"Pay of Australian university heads called into question after UK protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/pay-of-australian-university-heads-called-into-question-after-uk-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/22/pay-of-australian-university-heads-called-into-question-after-uk-protest","fields":{"headline":"Pay of Australian university heads called into question after UK protest","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australians should question how much university vice-chancellors earn, the education minister has declared, amid controversy in the UK over the “outrageous” salary of the University of Bath’s vice chancellor that was only half that of Australia’s highest-paid equivalent. Simon Birmingham said on Thursday that universities should reconsider the pay packets of their senior executives, some of whom earn more than a million dollars a year in salary and accommodation benefits. On Wednesday, the University of Bath vice-chancellor, Dame Glynis Breakwell, retired after controversy over her salary of £468,000 a year ($812,500). The furore led to a national conversation and drove students to the streets in protest. But in Australia, Breakwell’s pay packet – which was Britain’s largest – would be Australia’s 28th highest, and half of what the vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney earns after benefits are added. According to the Australian, 12 vice-chancellors in Australia took home more than a million dollars in 2016, and the University of Sydney’s Michael Spence nearly doubled Breakwell’s total pay at $1.44m. Breakwell was paid less than UNSW’s Ian Jacobs ($1.25m) and the Australian Catholic University’s Greg Craven ($1.24m), among others. The vice-chancellor of Oxford, Louise Richardson, made even less at £350,000 ($600,000), putting her below the heads of Newcastle University, James Cook University, and the University of Southern Queensland. Birmingham said the international comparison should prompt taxpayers to ask if they were “getting value for money”. “While Australians recognise the high level of skills needed to run a university, many taxpayers would question why remuneration should exceed global benchmarks.” Birmingham has previously called for vice-chancellors’ salaries and university marketing budgets to be slashed, and the funds reinvested in student places. Vice-chancellor salaries are set by each university’s board or senate without government input. The president of the National Tertiary Education Union, Jeannie Rea, said the salaries were “extremely embarrassing” and “out of proportion”. “Our public university system is world class, praised by international commentators … but some of the vice-chancellors could be making more in a week than a casual academic makes in a year,” she said. “It used to be the case that a vice-chancellor would be paid some proportion, or related to that of a senior professor, plus some. They saw themselves as leaders of an academic institution, now they see themselves as CEOs.” Belinda Robinson, the chief executive of Universities Australia, said the minister’s attack on salary was an attempt to distract from the government’s recent $2.2bn cuts to university funding. “This distraction strategy will not hoodwink the community,” she said. Rea agreed: “It’s somewhat flippant to say you can redistribute vice-chancellor’s salary and be able to pay for a whole lot of things. The underfunding of university places is a much bigger problem than that.” Guardian Australia contacted several universities about the salaries of vice-chancellors. The ACU’s deputy vice-chancellor, Stephen Weller, said Craven’s salary included the accommodation costs of managing a national, multi-campus university. “Vice-chancellors oversee complex multimillion-dollar organisations with thousands of staff. Their salaries are commensurate with some very senior heads of public enterprises and are less than the salaries for Australian CEOs who run similarly-sized organisations,” he said. The University of Sydney, UNSW and the University of Queensland similarly said the million-dollar sums included superannuation and a housing allowance. A spokesman for the University of Queensland, whose vice-chancellor Peter Høj earns $1.15m a year, said “the combined annual salaries of all Australia’s vice-chancellors comprise about 2% of the government’s latest cuts to the university sector”. “UQ has 52,000 students and is ranked in the top 50 of more than 10,000 universities globally. As a point of comparison, the University of Bath has 17,308 students enrolled.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/18/china-testing-facial-recognition-surveillance-system-in-xinjiang-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T08:16:01Z","webTitle":"China testing facial-recognition surveillance system in Xinjiang – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/18/china-testing-facial-recognition-surveillance-system-in-xinjiang-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/18/china-testing-facial-recognition-surveillance-system-in-xinjiang-report","fields":{"headline":"China testing facial-recognition surveillance system in Xinjiang – report","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Chinese surveillance chiefs are testing a facial-recognition system that alerts authorities when targets stray more than 300 metres from their home or workplace, as part of a surveillance push that critics say has transformed the country’s western fringes into a high-tech police state. Authorities in Xinjiang, a border region that is home to China’s largely Muslim Uighur minority, have been experimenting with the “alert project” since early 2017, according to Bloomberg. The programme, which matches faces caught on surveillance cameras to a watchlist of suspects, is the work of a state-run defence contractor that is developing software designed to help predict and thwart terrorist attacks before they occur. “A system like this is obviously well-suited to controlling people,” Jim Harper, a counter-terrorism specialist and former US homeland security official was quoted as saying. “‘Papers, please’ was the symbol of living under tyranny in the past. Now, government officials don’t need to ask.” The Bloomberg report is the latest to detail the cutting-edge techniques being rolled out as Xinjiang becomes a real-life laboratory for surveillance. Other methods include the harvesting of biometric data, smartphone scanners, voice analysis and compulsory satellite-tracking systems for vehicles. “They are combining all of these things to create, essentially, a total police state,” said William Nee, a China campaigner at Amnesty International. No journalist’s visit to Xinjiang now goes unnoticed. An Associated Press correspondent was stopped by police during a recent visit and told his movements were being remotely tracked with surveillance footage. During a 12-day tour of China’s “total surveillance state”, the Wall Street Journal’s vehicle was hemmed in by police after cameras spotted its out-of-town number plates. When the Guardian visited Xinjiang last spring its journalists were summoned to meet police within minutes of checking in to a Kashgar hotel and told that reporting was forbidden without official permission. One exasperated local said Xinjiang had become hell: “I would prefer to be a Syrian refugee than Chinese.” Yang Shu, a terrorism expert at Lanzhou University, said Xinjiang’s dire security situation was an open secret and surveillance could provide “powerful clues” to help catch those causing the violence. “High technology can guarantee security without interrupting people’s normal activities,” Yang said. Beijing argues such controls are necessary given repeated eruptions of violence, which authorities blame on Islamic extremists but which activists believe are partly driven by repression of the Uighurs. Nee said reports that Islamic State had recruited some Uighurs meant some surveillance was justified: “China does face a real threat from terrorism with all of the people who have gone to Syria and could, potentially, come back.” However, the indiscriminate targeting of Uighurs was fuelling “incredible anger” and happening outside the boundaries of international or Chinese law. “People should really pay attention to this because they could easily use the same tools of surveillance elsewhere in China, or for export. A lot of these companies will naturally want to grow their businesses and sell this technology to other authoritarian countries, or even democracies, that are looking for the same tools of control.” Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/21/seven-uk-police-forces-report-zero-charges-under-anti-slavery-law","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T20:23:40Z","webTitle":"Seven UK police forces report zero charges under anti-slavery law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/21/seven-uk-police-forces-report-zero-charges-under-anti-slavery-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/21/seven-uk-police-forces-report-zero-charges-under-anti-slavery-law","fields":{"headline":"Seven UK police forces report zero charges under anti-slavery law","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At least seven police forces in England have not charged a single person under modern slavery legislation introduced more than two years ago. The Modern Slavery Act was put in place in May 2015 to make prosecution easier and help protect victims. But despite a rising number of reports under the act, several police forces have not charged anyone while others have done so only in one or two cases. Data from two thirds of police forces obtained through freedom of information legislation shows that across England and Wales the number of reports under the act rose from 469 in the financial year to 31 March 2016 to 1,214 in the same period a year later and 1,042 in the eight months to November 2017. But during this period the total number of charges declined, from 94 to 43, with 4.13% of cases leading to formal action in 2017 – down from 7.58% the year before. Thames Valley police is one of seven forces that laid no charges, despite receiving 203 reported cases under the Modern Slavery Act from April 2015 to November 2017. Dorset police, which only supplied figures up to October 2017, laid no charges but received 45 reports. The other forces that did not bring cases were North Yorkshire, Cumbria, Devon and Cornwall, Dyfed-Powys and Norfolk. Charities and politicians have expressed concern, although they noted bringing charges is complicated as witnesses often withdraw from proceedings. Forces could also be bringing charges under different offences, such as conspiracy or rape. Jakub Sobik, from Anti-Slavery International, said the number of charges was a reflection of shortcomings of the government’s response to the issue. “The main point of the Modern Slavery Act was to make prosecution simpler, so if the number of charges under it aren’t growing, that’s concerning,” he said. The Crown Prosecution Service said: “Charges can be brought under a variety of legislation, including the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 and others. In 2016-17, we received 271 referrals from police and charged just under 70% of those cases, a charge rate only slightly below the national average for all crimes. “These crimes are some of the most complex handled by the CPS, but we work closely with investigators to build robust cases, while ensuring victims are protected.” Thames Valley police said: “Frequently, cases of modern slavery require further evidence in order to bring an offender to justice.” Kent police recorded nine charges out of 280 reports over that period. West Midlands police had 547, the highest number of reports, leading to nine charges. Some forces said cases were still under investigation. Supt Andy Waldie, from the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate, said: “The absence of a criminal charge does not mean a victim has gone unsupported or indicate a lack of enforcement action, as offenders may be charged with associated offences, such as assault.” Other forces noted that getting victims to confront perpetrators was a big challenge. The MP David Lammy said: “This legislation is absolutely crucial to tackling trafficking, but also in cracking down on organised crime and criminal gangs. Knife crime, for example, is not being driven by minors but by the gangsters and kingpins who are trafficking drugs ... If we want to get to grips with serious, organised crime and the people who perpetrate it then the Modern Slavery Act must -absolutely be used to its fullest.” The Home Office said: “We are now seeing the first convictions for the new offences prosecuted under the Modern Slavery Act. These are often highly complex cases ... Given the significant increase in operational activity directed against modern slavery over recent months, we expect to see more prosecutions commenced as investigations reach the point of charge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/18/very-discreet-arrested-cia-spy-kept-a-low-profile-in-hong-kong","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T04:54:40Z","webTitle":"'Very discreet': arrested CIA spy kept a low profile in Hong Kong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/very-discreet-arrested-cia-spy-kept-a-low-profile-in-hong-kong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/very-discreet-arrested-cia-spy-kept-a-low-profile-in-hong-kong","fields":{"headline":"'Very discreet': arrested CIA spy kept a low profile in Hong Kong","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A former CIA agent arrested on suspicion of keeping classified information, including the names of informants in China, was virtually unknown in Hong Kong, where he lived, according to interviews with security experts. Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 53, kept a low profile in the former British colony, where he lived for most of the time since leaving the CIA in 2007. He was largely unknown in security and intelligence circles in the city and avoided leaving a digital footprint. Those who had heard of him before his arrest on Tuesday described a man who largely kept to himself and did not elicit suspicion among a community of private security professionals with decades of experience working at various government agencies. He did not maintain any internet presence under his name in English or Chinese, or under an alternative spelling Zhen Cheng Li. He may have used an alias or avoided using public internet accounts altogether. He settled in Hong Kong after leaving the CIA and returned after a brief stint in the US in 2013. Lee was arrested after stepping off a Cathay Pacific flight to New York in a visit that reportedly surprised US agents investigating him. US federal agents found in 2012 he had notebooks containing secret operational notes from his time at the CIA, about “asset meetings, operational meeting locations, operational phone numbers, true names of assets and covert facilities”, according to court documents. It is unclear why they did not charge him at the time. Lee faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of “unlawful retention of national defense information”. He reportedly was responsible for passing the names of CIA informants in China to Chinese authorities. More than a dozen US sources were killed or imprisoned between 2010 and 2012, and American authorities struggled to determine the source of the leaks, according to the New York Times. It was a major blow to US intelligence efforts in China, and hindered the ability to obtain inside information at a time when the Chinese government underwent a once a decade leadership transition. Lee was not charged with spying this week, a case that may be difficult to prove in court. But former Hong Kong police superintendent Clement Lai, said he was “not surprised” Lee may have provided intelligence to Beijing, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. “Apparently, he operated here in Hong Kong very discreetly and not many people knew him,” said Lai, who briefly met Lee. Most recently in Hong Kong he was working at Christie’s, the international auction house, and the company suspended an unnamed employee thought to be Lee, the Wall Street Journal reported. He reportedly ran a team tasked with providing security assessments of employees and property. Lee is a naturalised American citizen who grew up in the US and served in the army before joining the CIA as a case officer in 1994, according to the Justice Department."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/30/the-franklin-would-be-dammed-today-australias-shrinking-environmental-protections","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T19:02:02Z","webTitle":"'The Franklin would be dammed today': Australia's shrinking environmental protections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/30/the-franklin-would-be-dammed-today-australias-shrinking-environmental-protections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/30/the-franklin-would-be-dammed-today-australias-shrinking-environmental-protections","fields":{"headline":"'The Franklin would be dammed today': Australia's shrinking environmental protections","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What if the Franklin river hadn’t been saved? Stopping the Gordon-below-Franklin dam was one of the Australian environment movement’s great victories: in the late 1970s, the state-owned Hydro-Electric Commission wanted to flood one of three last temperate rainforests in the southern hemisphere to create a power station. About 33km of the Franklin, a pristine wild river home to breathtaking ravines and rapids, and surrounded by untouched Huon pine and myrtle beech forest, would have drowned. After years of heated debate, pro-dam Liberal Robin Gray took power in 1982 and passed legislation allowing construction to begin. What happened from there was partly down to luck and timing, but could not have been achieved without one of Australia’s most successful acts of mass civil disobedience. An estimated 6,000 people headed to the town of Strahan to join the protest, and nearly 1,500 were arrested on the river. Rallies and newspaper ads helped build an extraordinary level of buy-in throughout Australia. At a byelection for the Victorian federal seat of Flinders, 41% of voters scribbled “No Dams” on their ballot paper. The momentum was such that the incoming prime minister, Bob Hawke, pledged in March 1983 to stop the dam, a stance narrowly backed by the high court. In economic terms, the arguments for the dam now seem thin – the 180 MW plant would have increased energy capacity by only 14% while leaving the state with a disproportionate debt. Yet it is easy to imagine circumstances in which the damming would have gone ahead. For instance, if the fight over the Franklin was happening not 35 years ago, but today. Guardian Australia interviewed 20 campaigners and political veterans and found broad – though not unanimous – agreement that a project similar to the Gordon-below-Franklin dam in scale and impact would be near impossible to stop now. Legally and politically, they say environmental protection is harder to win than at any time since before the wave of landmark 1980s decisions to recognise the Daintree rainforest and Kakadu national park and to block mining in Antarctica. Bob Brown, whose role in saving the Franklin launched him onto the national stage, believes the campaign would now fall at multiple hurdles: it would be unlikely to win crucial government backing for world heritage listing, as it did in 1982 under the Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser; that no political leader since had shown Hawke’s willingness to prioritise the environment over development; above all, that activists would be highly unlikely to turn out in large numbers given increased risk of serious fines or other criminal penalties. The last point is key, he says, as it would deny a campaign momentum. While Brown won a recent high court case that struck down harsh Tasmanian forestry laws that threatened fines of up to $10,000 and up to four years jail for anyone obstructing a “business activity”, that judgment was as much about the shoddy way in which the laws were written as the principle. The court found the aims of the laws were legitimate. The former Greens leader believes laws challenging peaceful protest will return. “The Franklin would be dammed if it were today,” Brown says. “It would be just a dead moat around [nearby peak] Frenchman’s Cap.” While Labor governments are not spared criticism, the broad consensus among those interviewed was that environmental protection has reduced sharply since the federal Coalition won power in 2013. Former Labor environment minister and activist Peter Garrett says the standard of environment policymaking and protection in Australia has reached a nadir. He cites two reasons – a lack of political will, and conservative environment ministers not having the capacity to prioritise nature. “It comes about partly because of the ideological fixations of the right, and because the current government has chosen to allow the environment to become an invisible issue,” he says. Some recent headline-grabbing cases of loss of environmental protection in the name of helping industry or agriculture are easy to identify: a staggering increase in land clearing in Queensland; a proposed 400,000 sq km reduction in marine park high-protection areas; Australia becoming the first country to abolish a carbon price that required business to pay for its carbon dioxide emissions. Other changes are more complicated, and sometimes less visible. Environmental activists are facing what they say is a multipronged attack to limit green groups’ ability to run campaigns and be involved in political advocacy. The Abbott government initially launched a failed attempt to amend national environmental laws so green groups based outside the immediately affected area would no longer have the right to challenge development decisions in court. That right had been used to overturn several flawed government approvals – for example, allowing logging in Tasmania’s Wielangta forest without considering the cumulative impact on three threatened species across a wider area. The plan to abolish it failed to pass the Senate. The government then wanted to limit the right to receive tax deductible donations – a significant source of revenue – to environment groups that dedicated at least 25% of spending to “practical” work in the community. That plan was dropped in December when industry support evaporated. It has been replaced with a new push announced under the banner of outlawing foreign donations, but that actually goes much further. It would significantly increase the administrative work required by any group that spends more than $100,000 on “political expenditure” in a year. The definition of “political expenditure” might be described as broad: any work that includes public expression on an issue “that is, or is likely to be, before electors in an election”, even if an election has not been called. Legal advice seen by Guardian Australia suggests it is likely to require groups to tally how much they spend in time and resources on submissions or evidence given to parliamentary inquiries, any communication with a United Nations body, any opinion expressed about a political party. If it is more than $100,000 they would be branded a “political organisation”, rather than members of civil society. Registered charities – including most environment groups – would need to set up separate bank accounts for money to be spent on political advocacy and direct environmental works, and report the political party membership of senior staff. All groups would be required to nominate a financial controller who could face up to 10 years in prison and fines up to $210,000 if they breached their responsibilities. The Human Rights Law Centre said the harsh penalties meant groups were likely to err on the side of caution. “This could cause a chilling effect, where organisations steer clear of voicing views on any matter publicly,” it says. In the same week, the government put Keating-era Labor cabinet minister Gary Johns – a consistent critic of non-government organisations who believes charities should be barred from advocacy – in charge of ensuring they comply with the law, with powers to redraw rules governing the sector. In a briefing note, the Australian Conservation Foundation says the proposed changes are part of a blatant attempt to shut down environmental opposition to government policies. “This will be dressed up as ‘levelling the playing field’ or ‘cleaning up the money in politics’ but it is actually the silencing of civil society, and will prevent many charities from effectively pursuing their missions,” it says. While green groups are under pressure, funding for government environment and biodiversity programs has been slashed. This isn’t a new phenomenon – there have been notable cuts under governments of both stripes – but, as Guardian Australia revealed last month, they have been particularly sharp under this federal Coalition. Analysis by the Australian Conservation Foundation found spending on environment department programs and staff suffered a 33% cut (from $1.4bn in 2013-14 to $945m in the last budget). Forward projections included in the budget papers promise deeper cuts into next decade. Australian Conservation Foundation policy analyst James Trezise, who worked at the federal environment department until 2014, says biodiversity conservation and monitoring and auditing programs has suffered. “There are good people in there who want to do good work to ensure the environment is protected,” Trezise says. “But they are heavily constrained by a government that has deprioritised the environment, by serious resource cuts and a lack of ambition in implementing policy and legislation.” Any discussion of the state of environmental protection and natural resource management returns to the use of the national environmental laws introduced by the Howard government. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBCA) was divisive when it came into effect in 2000. Promised as a framework to protect biodiversity and matters of national environmental significance, it was welcomed by some for gathering decision-making powers previously spread across different ministerial portfolios under the environment minister. Others objected to the near total level of discretion it gives whoever is environment minister at any given time in deciding how to apply the law. It is less divisive now. There is a strong view across the community, from green groups to the business community, that the act is not fit for purpose in its current form. Since the Coalition was elected in 2013 it has used the act to stop only one development: a pair of wind turbines on Lord Howe Island that were blocked last year due to their “intrusive visual impact”. The Wilderness Society national campaigns director Lyndon Schneiders says the legislation is ill-conceived and weak, having been designed as a form of triage – to maintain the minimum viable population of a species through conditions and offsets – while allowing proposals to go ahead. “There is no underlying principle in the act to say it is to protect the environment. It’s not – it’s to manage development,” he says. Nicola Beynon, head of campaigns with Humane Society International, is more positive – “it’s a good piece of legislation” – but says it is weakened by the extent to which the minister can decided how it is used. She gives the example of offset provisions. “The way ecology works you can’t just replace it somewhere else, but these days they have even abandoned the concept of trying to replace like for like,” he says. “Now it can be replaced with another species. The net effect is you lose biodiversity over time.” Some are positive about what the existing law can deliver. Of the 20 proposed developments stopped using the act, 13 were by Garrett in the less than three years he was minister. The Midnight Oil frontman says: “Under a strong minister with political support in the cabinet it’s still better than most acts in most countries.” But everyone interviewed agreed it should be revamped or replaced. A review by former public servant Allan Hawke commissioned by Garrett recommended in 2009 a raft of changes to toughen and streamline the law, but they have not been acted on. The man who oversaw the act’s introduction, former Liberal environment minister Robert Hill, says the law was regarded as world’s best practice when it came in and that he has not seen advances on it elsewhere, but agrees there is a case for change. “It’s been nearly 20 years. I have assumed there will be a new evolution. I’ve been expecting it and I know various law reform bodies have been thinking about it,” he says. He warns against judging the legislation on the number of developments blocked as the primary goal was to ensure the best environmental outcomes when they were approved, but adds: “I don’t know the act has always been employed as rigorously as I would have liked to have seen.” He declines to say it when it could have been better used. Hill is an ambassador for Conservatives for Conservation, a Coalition-aligned group making the case for environmental protection from the centre-right. He does not agree the big decisions of the 1980s would not be made now – the act makes them easier to achieve, he says. But he does not support the targeting of environment and other civil society groups. “I wasn’t demanding it. I thought it was working OK.” The act’s current custodian, environment minister Josh Frydenberg, says the existing law is still the best national mechanism to protect important and sensitive environment matters. He says it has “ensured Australia has remained at the forefront of global best practice” in meeting its international obligations for migratory species, wildlife trade and world heritage. Many of those interviewed say there has been a cultural shift, that there was once bipartisan agreement that protecting the environment was a public good, but that has disappeared as public life has become more ideological and parliament drawn from a narrower cross-section of the community. Environment Victoria chief executive Mark Wakeham says: “It has become a badge of honour for many Coalition MPs to beat up on the environment. That wasn’t always the case.” Judy Lambert has watched the change since her time in Canberra in the 1980s and 1990s, first as a national liaison officer with the Wilderness Society and later a non-political technical advisor to Labor minister Ros Kelly. “The extremes are more extreme than they were. You used to be able to go and speak to political offices on both sides to discuss issues, whether you agreed or disagreed. I don’t think that would be possible now,” she says. “It feels to me that we’ve lost the commitment to good science, or good technical expertise of any sort.” Lambert says there was a noticeable shift in the 1990s when industry lobbyists began to borrow techniques used in environmental campaigns to build community support for their position. Employed successfully, it helped shift the weight in decision-making discussions towards short-term economic gain over longer-term environmental benefits. It coincided with a dramatic growth in the number of industry-backed lobbyists employed to make their case in Canberra. At the same time, the number of professional environmental activists based in the capital has been cut in half since late last century. In the face of this, the green movement will campaign this year for an overhaul of national environment laws, coming together under the banner Places You Love. Don Henry, who campaigned for years as the head of the Australian Conservation Foundation and is now professor at the University of Melbourne, is optimistic about the chances of success. Unlike others interviewed, he believes the big environmental wins of the 1980s could be landed today. Research shows the majority of Australians care deeply about the environment. If that can be tapped into, the political will would follow. “People are now much more aware how important clean air, clean water and the environment is than they were 40 or 50 years ago,” he says. “What we don’t have in place at the moment in Australia is a 21st-century suite of environment laws, and it is about time we did.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/18/this-is-what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-metoo","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T17:00:04Z","webTitle":"#MeToo is messy and emotional – but it could change everything | Brigid Delaney's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/this-is-what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-metoo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/this-is-what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-metoo","fields":{"headline":"#MeToo is messy and emotional – but it could change everything","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Has it really only been a touch over three months since the first tranche of Weinstein allegations aired in the mainstream media? It feels like a lifetime. In the meantime, ordinary men and women are trying to process it all. Up for grabs is everything: from “Does this mean I can’t enjoy Master of None or House of Cards anymore?”, to reframing the conduct of your drunk boss on a work business trip, to realising that you stand in quite different places to some friends on these issues, to discovering that almost every woman you know has a #MeToo story. How we talk about it all among ourselves is much messier and more emotional than the clear-eyed essays and hot takes suddenly filling the feminist canon. I’ve kept a rough diary of the last few months of the conversations I’ve had with friends, colleagues and strangers about this moment in time. It has been like a drone flying overhead trying to film a fast-moving target: the picture will only ever be partial. But this is what we talk about when we talk about #MeToo. South Coast, NSW, mid-October 2017: Harvey Weinstein Stories in the New York Times and the New Yorker have just started to appear about Harvey Weinstein’s treatment of women. By the second week of this story cycle, the few stories about Weinstein have become a torrent. In all, more than 50 women will accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to rape. Some of the stories that make me saddest are the stories of women I’ve never heard of – whose careers were ruined before they even began. In mid-October I go to a 40th for a weekend in the country with a group of a dozen women, most of whom I don’t know. Weinstein is all we can talk about. We talk into the night, sharing experiences. Everyone is fired up. A strange alchemy takes place that weekend and I realise I’ve talked about solidarity before but never really felt it until now. The realisation is this: our experiences, which we had assumed all our lives to be discreet, personal and our own, are part of a collective female experience. The catcalls, the date rape, the unequal pay, aren’t an individual experience that we as individuals bear alone but baked into the structure of our society. Once you see it, you can’t unsee it. There’s something happening here, but what it is ain’t exactly clear. Melbourne, late October: #MeToo Many thousands of women are posting their #MeToo stories on social media – sharing their experiences of sexual assault, harassment and discrimination. The sheer volume of stories threatens to overwhelm: it’s like every woman you’ve ever known, and all the ones you don’t, have some buried trauma. I meet a colleague for a drink. We talk about #MeToo. She is bristling with rage. She’s angry at all men. Men on the next table to us are being boorish and rude to the waitress. We mightn’t have noticed it so much before but now everything gleams with new and awful significance. We’re seeing the entitlement now – to call out from a car, to take what you want, to order others around. There is a cleansing energy to our rage and a thrilling sense that we are all actually in the middle of a bona fide social movement. But another friend is annoyed by the nascent movement. “Oh for godsakes – it’s not all men. Most men are very nice.” “Shh! You can’t say that!” I warn her. The thing that’s started feels very powerful – pushing away all in its path. Already men I know have been shut down on social media for saying “not all men”. It’s like the voice of the #MeToo women, each singular and unique but at this point, choral. It is a pure, painful, primal scream. Sydney, early December: Louis CK, Kevin Spacey, Matt Lauer, Glenn Thrush, Garrison Keillor, Roy Moore I catch up with a criminal barrister friend for a drink after work. We talk about how gross Louis CK is, how gross Kevin Spacey, how swiftly they’ve been dealt with. But in his corner of the legal profession – the criminal bar – there is none of the prurience or the euphoria. Instead, his colleagues are appalled. They’re not appalled at the men, per se, they are appalled at the frenzy – at the chaos, catharsis and destruction that is characterising this early stage of the #MeToo movement. “Whatever happened to the presumption of innocence? People are being tried on social media and losing their reputations and jobs. There is no due process. The whole foundation of the legal system is based on innocent until proven guilty, refined for centuries – you can’t just chuck a whole system.” But yet that is exactly what is happening. “These men are all entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence,” said my friend. “Matt Lauer, Glenn Thrush, Garrison Keillor, Roy Moore ...” “What, Roy Moore? He’s a gross child molester.” My friend shoots me a reminder across the table: “Alleged”. There is this thing we learned in law school, a cornerstone of the whole system: “It is better that 10 guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.” January 2018, Facebook messenger: Aziz Ansari The sex scandals come pretty much daily now. They range from Eliza Dushku alleging she was molested by a stunt co-ordinator on the set of True Lies when she was 12, to multiple women accusing actor James Franco of misconduct, to the US Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles accusing team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual assault, to whether actors on Woody Allen films should apologise, to whether Matt Damon should just shut up. And that’s just this week. Men and women are asking each other: “What do you think?” It’s like we have to keep checking one another’s temperatures, feeling for a fever. With Weinstein, of course everyone thinks he’s a monster. But other situations provoke more discussion, such as Glenn Thrush, Garrison Keillor, Michael Fallon and those accused of misconduct who have denied allegations, including Geoffrey Rush. “What do you think?” is code for: “Do you think this counts as assault?” Because right now, some men don’t seem to know, or else frame an encounter very differently from women. Television actor and comedian Aziz Ansari was surprised that the encounter written about this week in Babe was not consensual: “I’m so sad to hear this,” he responded to his date’s text the day after the encounter. “Clearly, I misread things in the moment and I’m truly sorry.” A male friend messages me on Sunday about Ansari. Him: Let me know what you think Me: I dislike knowing his technique for fingering. He comes across as a total douche. Bad for his rep – that story but should have been sourced Should have shut it down and called her an uber after she said she was uncomfortable – not got her to give him a blowie What you reckon? Him: Yeah sounds like he was a dick - just wanted sex and was v pushy about it The piece itself is weird though The whole thing about him serving her red not white wine And how at the end she identifies herself as a victim of sexual assault But also maybe she could have translated her intense discomfort and violation into leaving? Which is not to defend him being pushy and not caring about her feelings Me: There surely is a middle ground tho – btw fucking and leaving Like – Seinfeld and making out in a respectful way Him: Does it ruin Master of None for you? Me: Yes!! Does it 4 u?? Him: I guess I’m still processing it It’s not nice to know he can be a selfish dickish dude But I don’t think he’s a rapist or anything either My favourite Master of None scene happens in an Uber. It’s a long scene, almost four minutes. Ansari’s alter ego, Dev, has just realised that he’s in love with a friend, who’s engaged. The camera stays on his face as the expression of recognition and loss flickers across it. We’ve all been there. Could all this be as small and significant as putting the camera on the woman in the back seat of the Uber, instead? Telling the story from her point of view? She moves from object to subject. So small, so significant, but it changes everything.

Little is known about the remuneration and obligations of contracts signed by the Australian government with companies such as Paladin, JDA Wokman, Toll Group, NKW and International Health and Medical Services (IHMS). One of the contracts causing controversy is that signed with the security firm Paladin Solutions, which is earning $72m for providing security on Manus Island for four months – about $585,000 a day. The contract amount was nearly doubled – from $39m – but extended by a month just before it was due to expire. But Paladin staff have been kicked out by a local security firm, Kingfisher, which says it should have the lucrative contract. In December, the Senate supported an order for the production of documents made by the Nick Xenophon Team senator Stirling Griff and the Greens senator Nick McKim requesting documents and parts of contracts detailing the health, construction and security services to be provided at the Australian-built and controlled immigration centre at West Lorengau. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, this week refused the request, telling the Senate: “I believe the disclosure of the requested material would, or could reasonably be expected to, cause damage to international relations: specifically, Australia’s relations with Papua New Guinea”. “Unilateral disclosure by Australia of information pertaining to the constitution and services at the three alternative accommodation sites … would undermine PNG’s confidence in its good working relationship with Australia and might reasonably be expected to jeopardise cooperation on people-smuggling matters.” Griff said the minister’s reasoning “stretches credibility”. “How does, for example, releasing details of the hours medical staff will work, or the range of medical services to be provided by contractor IHMS risk diplomatic relations? “We had sought the order to produce documents because we want the truth about what is happening at West Lorengau Haus and the conditions the men are facing there. We wanted to get to the facts.” Griff said the government was hiding behind the public interest immunity claim. Speaking from Manus Island, McKim told the Guardian the minister’s refusal to accept the Senate’s order was unacceptable. “The reasons the minister has given for refusing to release even this basic factual information are completely spurious,” he said. “It’s an admission that Peter Dutton was lying when he said in November the accommodation centres were ready. We knew they were not, from media reports and from the UNHCR, and this is just further proof.” Meanwhile, the standoff over security at the new Australian-built accommodation centres continues, with refugees and asylum seekers saying their safety has been compromised by the chaos caused by the dispute. Paladin, co-owned by Australian Craig Thrupp, has a $72m contract to provide security for four months at the three accommodation centres nearby to Lorengau, Manus’s main town. But local company Kingfisher, owned by Manusian businessman Peter Mochon, is insisting it should have the security contract. This week its staff forcibly took over security at the Manus sites, telling Paladin staff to leave. Some Paladin staff have since been allowed to return. Officials from the Australian Border Force – which retains ultimate control over the offshore immigration regime and the movement of refugees held on Manus and Nauru – are on Manus attempting to broker a solution. But the impasse appears no closer to resolution: nearly 50 foreign security guards employed by Paladin have had their visa applications rejected by PNG’s immigration authority. The PNG government is demanding that security positions be filled by local staff. Visas are only being issued for positions that cannot be filled by locals. The Iranian refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani told the Guardian: “Kingfisher company is in competition with Paladin, because of that they sent all of Paladin staff out. “Same problem happened 11 November last year. It’s unacceptable that the companies who have responsibility for security are making the situation unsafe.” Some refugees have been warned not to leave the accommodation compounds by the new guards, who told them it is not safe for them. McKim said the 600 men remaining on Manus had been left in limbo. “Many of the guys had pinned their hopes on the US resettlement deal. But there has been frustratingly slow progress there. The feeling here is overwhelming one of abandonment, and of uncertainty.” He said three months after the former immigration detention centre was closed, and those remaining in the centre were forcibly removed from it, the promised new accommodation centres were not yet complete. The West Haus accommodation centre, in particular, has been the subject of protests from Manus landowners, who have blockaded the centre over untreated sewage flowing on to their land. “The situation here is a complete shambles. The refugees fear, again, they will be the collateral damage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/18/antonio-conte-chelsea-norwich-city-var-mistake","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T00:40:19Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte: VAR official made ‘big mistake’ over Chelsea penalty shout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/18/antonio-conte-chelsea-norwich-city-var-mistake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/18/antonio-conte-chelsea-norwich-city-var-mistake","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte: VAR official made ‘big mistake’ over Chelsea penalty shout","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Antonio Conte has suggested the video assistant referee, Mike Jones, was guilty of a “big, big mistake” after opting not to flag up a potential penalty as Chelsea’s third round replay victory over Norwich City descended into farcical scenes in extra-time. The hosts, who would prevail on penalties, were reduced to nine men following the dismissals of Pedro and Álvaro Morata, who were both shown one of their two yellow cards for diving. Willian was also cautioned for going to ground in an incident with Timm Klose. Conte watched a replay of that challenge and was insistent it should have resulted in a spot-kick, but the VAR apparently decided no clear and obvious error had occurred. “If we want to use a new system, I can’t accept a big mistake,” he said. “In this case, the Willian penalty was a big, big mistake. Not from the referee on the pitch, who took quickly a decision to book Willian and didn’t have any doubt, but from the person watching the game [Jones]. I hope the VAR wasn’t a referee because if you see that watching on television and don’t think that’s a penalty … he has to improve. It was very clear. “At least to avoid a big mistake, [the VAR has] to call the referee and tell him: ‘Look, maybe this situation there is a doubt. For me it’s no penalty, but it’s better you go and watch it, and then take the final decision.’ We need to improve if we want to use this new system. We have to wait to check with the person who is watching the game and then, if this person is sure 100% that it is simulation, go and book Willian.” Klose subsequently admitted he had caught his opponent. The Chelsea head coach said Pedro and Morata deserved yellow cards for diving – he had not seen a re-run of the striker’s tumble away from Christoph Zimmermann – and the pair are now banned for Saturday’s trip to Brighton. “About Pedro, if there is a dive it’s right to take a yellow card,” said Conte. “It’s the same for Morata. I don’t want an advantage, especially if you know this system is being used. You can watch every situation with this situation. If someone gives a punch or an elbow, you must pay great attention. In this case, if it wasn’t a penalty, it was right to give a yellow card. “For sure, I’m not happy for the second yellow card for Morata. The first yellow card was for a doubtful situation – I didn’t watch Morata’s situation yet – but the second was for dissent. You must pay great attention. In this moment of the game you have to pay great attention to stay calm and make the best decision.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/the-african-gang-crisis-has-been-brewing-in-australias-media-for-years","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T02:39:08Z","webTitle":"Burst your bubble: Australia's 'African gang crisis' has been brewing for years | Jason Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/the-african-gang-crisis-has-been-brewing-in-australias-media-for-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/the-african-gang-crisis-has-been-brewing-in-australias-media-for-years","fields":{"headline":"Burst your bubble: Australia's 'African gang crisis' has been brewing for years","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"How do you end up with a neo-fascist propounding his views on immigration on national television? To answer this question, you need to understand how a racially motivated moral panic has brewed in right-leaning media over months, and even years. You then need to see how such a panic is part of a political project, which includes state and federal politicians. The panic over Sudanese immigrant gangs has reached fever pitch in this new year of 2018. Even though it’s rooted in selective distortions, both of crime rates, and the concept of a “gang”, it’s triggered a hasty policy response. This month, it has dominated the news in Victoria to such an extent that it seems that premier, Daniel Andrews, is unable to talk about much else. After his immigration minister, Peter Dutton, inflamed the situation, the prime minister has recently chosen to weigh in on an issue which is clearly not on his constitutional patch. But if the panic has only come into bloom in recent weeks, it has been nurtured like a delicate sapling for two years. This long-term effort has been made by the rightwing outlets that still dominate print and online media in Australia. If you search Australia’s news archives, there are relatively few mentions of the “Apex gang”, a group which has increasingly come to stand in for the Sudanese-Australian community as a whole, before 2016. On 13 March that year, people identifying as members of the group were involved in a brawl in Melbourne’s CBD, during the Moomba Festival. That led to an initial flurry of coverage. Some of this was in the Age, but the story was led by News Corp’s Melbourne tabloid, the Herald Sun, and the Australian edition of the Daily Mail, which presented the brawl in populist terms. By 14 March, the Mail and the Hun had established the habit of referring to the young men in these groups as “thugs”, a term which has, in the USA, been described as a “nominally polite way of using the N-word”. The same day, Andrew Bolt wrote in a column that “there seems almost a conspiracy to stop the public knowing that our refugee and immigration policies have become a threat, introducing new levels of violence and gun crime to our cities”. This take was dutifully, and approvingly, reposted on several far right forums. That’s unsurprising – the idea that refugees are in themselves social poison, and that this is being covered up, is a central claim of the contemporary far right. From this moment on, the “Apex gang” became a way for right-leaning media to establish a connection between crime, immigration, race, and even terrorism. While Fairfax, the ABC and Guardian Australia gradually turned to other matters, rightwing outlets continued their focus on the gang over the succeeding two years. According to Nexis searches, the Australian edition of the Daily Mail has published the largest number of articles on the “Apex gang”, with 344 in the last five years. But the Herald Sun is close on its heels with 320. Each have run more than four times the number of articles that the Age has run, with a mere 76. The Age only just beat out News Corp’s national daily, the Australian, with the quantity of its coverage. Many of the Age’s articles came around specific incidents. But the combined News outlets and the Daily Mail kept things bubbling along even when there was little to write about. News and MailOnline breathlessly reported run of the mill property crimes as the work of “Africans”. The Australian took the opportunity, to try to connect the Flinders Street car attack to Sudanese youth, as did Peta Credlin in News tabloids. Stories about ”African” crime persisted in the face of efforts by police to point out that the story had been blown out of proportion, and the refusal of local residents to say there was a problem. On the other hand, the same outlets soft-soaped far right vigilantism when it emerged in 2016. When the Soldiers of Odin, a white supremacist group, announced that they would be the patrolling Melbourne’s CBD, the Daily Mail ran their comments uncritically, including the idea that they were representing “old-school Aussie values”. In a way, Channel Seven’s uncritical interview with Blair Cottrell was just following the precedent set in moments like this, and in the fawning coverage given to Milo Yiannopoulos late last year. Rightwing politicians picked up this ball and ran as far and fast as they could with it. Their interventions show the symbiotic relationship between racial politics, ginned up in conservative newspapers, and conservative politics. Last November, federal liberal MP Jason Wood was calling for 16 year olds who had offended to be deported to their home countries. In December, Liberals worked hard to insert a discussion of Sudanese crime into a parliamentary committee report on immigration late last year. So the ground was well prepared for Peter Dutton to threaten deportation of young offenders, too. This is all part of the normal, repetitive functioning of Australia’s conservative media and its conservative politics. The reason Australia has never given birth to a Breitbart-style far right outlet is that there is no niche for them to occupy. The country’s print media market is dominated by outlets whose politics – on immigration, culture wars, and the “war on terror” – are indistinguishable from websites that elsewhere, dwell on the margins. So we shouldn’t be shocked when far right ideologues, whose views on immigration don’t really differ much from the conservative consensus in Australia, get on TV. Tabloids and mainstream politicians have worked long and hard to push ideas that, as a by-product, accord legitimacy to the far right. All sides benefit from a project that leads to heightened fear, demands for a crackdown, and political problems for a Labor government. The reason that Channel Seven felt that Blair Cottrell’s views on Sudanese crime needed to be aired – despite his history of far right street activism, and his criminal history – is that by degrees, Australia’s right-leaning media have come to frame the issue in terms of reactionary populism for some years. This is what they do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/20/women-shouldnt-have-to-travel-interstate-for-abortions-doctor-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T22:52:27Z","webTitle":"Women shouldn't have to travel interstate for abortions, doctor says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/20/women-shouldnt-have-to-travel-interstate-for-abortions-doctor-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/20/women-shouldnt-have-to-travel-interstate-for-abortions-doctor-says","fields":{"headline":"Women shouldn't have to travel interstate for abortions, doctor says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Women who need surgical abortions between nine and 14 weeks of pregnancy will be left in the lurch throughout Australia unless state and territory governments learn from Tasmania and start preparing for the closure of private abortion providers, gynaecologist Dr Paul Hyland says. Hyland has been Tasmania’s primary surgical abortion provider for 17 years, but was recently forced to close his Hobart clinic, the only provider of surgical abortions to women in the state. While public hospitals also carry out surgical abortions, these are not routine, and are usually reserved for women in later stages of pregnancy who are experiencing life-threatening and emergency complications. There has been a rapid uptake of the pill RU486 since it was registered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in 2012. The pill brings on a miscarriage, known as a medical abortion, and it has caused the demand for surgical abortions to decline rapidly in countries where it has been introduced. Hyland said this was one of the reasons it became financially unsustainable to keep his surgical abortion clinic open. He said the closure of his clinic was a good thing, because it meant women had more choices regarding abortion and no longer had to attend a clinic or undergo a surgical procedure. However, he is angered by the failure of the Tasmanian government to fill the gap that the closure of his clinic will leave for women who are too advanced in their pregnancy to take RU486, but who are also not suffering a medical emergency or foetal abnormality and so will not be able to undergo an abortion in the state’s public hospital system. These women have been forced to travel to Victoria to get the surgical procedure, leaving their families and taking time off education or work, a situation Hyland described as unacceptable. A spokeswoman for Michael Ferguson, the Tasmania health minister, told Guardian Australia he was still awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services that was exploring other options. “We made the department of health aware of this issue before our other clinic closed in Launceston in 2016, and that is the point he should have been working hard to make abortion services available in the public system,” Hyland said. Ferguson said he had extended the patient travel assistance scheme for women who were referred by their GP to go to Melbourne for the procedures so they would not be out of pocket. He had opposed the introduction of RU486, and has joined in protests against changes to make abortion access easier. Hyland said other states would face similar problems if they did not start making abortions more readily available through the public system. Medical terminations using RU486 were first approved in France in 1988, followed by the UK in 1991. According to Scotland’s National Statistics office, in 1992, one year after RU486 was licensed in the UK, 16.4% of terminations were performed medically. Within five years, that number rose to more than one-third, and by 2016 it was 82.9%. “Eventually public hospitals will have to provide abortion,” Hyland said. “Tasmania, because of its small population size, has been the experiment. And it should be the trigger for other states realising they have to bite the bullet and provide it in public hospitals.” The head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Michael Gannon, who is an obstetrician, agreed that the situation in Tasmania was unacceptable. He said the personal ideologies of people in government should not get in the way of providing legal medical services to women. “I have a lot of experience with the great trauma and sadness that has for generations now seen Irish women having to travel to terminate a pregnancy,” he said. “And to think Tasmania has women crossing the Bass Strait to access something which is a legal and legitimate form of healthcare, and the fact that they have to make excuses to be absent from school or work or university to obtain what is their right, is very simply not good enough. Asked what should be done to address the problem, he said the Tasmanian and other governments were “duty-bound” to provide abortion services. The deputy leader of the Tasmanian opposition, Michelle O’Byrne, was behind the successful amendment that led to abortion being removed as a criminal offence when her party was in government. She said that when the Liberal government was elected in 2014, she had done all she could to make abortion access easier and safer for women. Now, when women seek information about health and abortion services on the Tasmanian government’s website, they get a message: “page not found”. “I am devastated by what is happening,” O’Byrne told Guardian Australia. “We were so careful to make sure no one would be disadvantaged when it came to abortion. And while medical abortions are often better than surgical abortions for women, they will never and should never replace surgical abortions altogether. “It’s heartbreaking we are back here again and horrifying that in 2018 we are still trying to get women access to abortion in a state where it is legal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/18/european-league-title-races","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T12:01:13Z","webTitle":"If you like tight title races, these are the European leagues to watch | Barry Glendenning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/18/european-league-title-races","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/18/european-league-title-races","fields":{"headline":"If you like tight title races, these are the European leagues to watch","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Despite their reverse in the thriller at Anfield on Sunday, Manchester City still lead the Premier League title race by 12 points from a posse that has at times seemed so incapable of organising a successful chase its members would not look out of place in a Blazing Saddles remake.

The Swiss, Austrian, Bulgarian, Slovenian, Russian, Belgian and Ukrainian top flights are similarly among the majority of Europe’s leagues dominated by one or two teams. While far from over the Dutch Eredivisie is headed by PSV Eindhoven, who have a five-point cushion over Ajax with AZ Alkmaar eight points behind in third; the Romanian, Portuguese and Belarussian leagues are each being fought out by three teams. Elsewhere in Europe, particularly close championships are harder to find. Readers looking for scrambles in which a blanket can still be thrown over four or more live contenders could do worse than keep an eye on the following leagues. Greek Superleague Only five points separate the top four teams in a Greek Super League headed by Olympiakos, who lead AEK Athens and PAOK by one with Atromitos a further four points behind. Things would be even tighter were it not for Atromitos’s decidedly mediocre home form, which has meant the team from western Athens winning three and drawing four of the eight matches they’ve played at their Peristeri Stadium, compared to six wins and two draws out of nine on the road. The most successful team in Greek history, Olympiakos are trying to win their 45th title. Turkish Super Lig Istanbul Basaksehir, who have just signed Arda Turan on loan from Barcelona, head a wide open Turkish Süper Lig by a point from Galatasaray, with Fenerbahce three off the pace. All three clubs are based in Istanbul, while Kayserispor and Goztepe, from Kayseri and Izmir respectively, have six points to make up on the leaders, like Besiktas, another Istanbul team. Runners-up behind Besiktas last season, Basaksehir are looking to win their first title and number the former France and Arsenal full-back Gaël Clichy and Swiss veteran Gokhan Inler among their players. Should Basaksehir prevail Inler, a former Leicester and Besiktas midfielder, will get his third championship medal in as many seasons with three different clubs. Polish Ekstraklasa After 21 rounds of games the top four teams in Poland’s Ekstraklasa are separated by two points, while nine of the 16 teams in the top flight are within eight points of the leaders, Legia Warsaw. The defending champions and 12-times winners are two points clear of a group comprising Lech Poznan, Gornik Zabrze and Jagiellonia Bialystok, with Zaglebie Lubin a further four points back in fifth. Jagiellonia Bialystok are the only team never to have won the title and are hoping to go one better than their second-place finish last year. Once all 16 teams have played each other home and away, the league will split and a championship and relegation round begins with each team starting on half the number of points they accrued during the regular season. Israeli Ligat The Israeli top flight looks tighter than a drum, with Hapoel Be’er Sheva leading the 14-strong league after 18 games, but only on goal difference from Maccabi Tel Aviv. Locked together on 38 points, the two clubs are one clear of Beitar Jerusalem with Hapoel Haifa a further point back in fourth. Despite being eight and 10 points off the pace respectively, Bnei Yehuda Tel-Aviv and Maccabi Netanya will also fancy their chances of taking their points totals into a round-robin play-off for the top six that will ultimately decide the champions. Cypriot First Division Omonia Nicosia’s Matt Derbyshire was the unlikely top scorer in last season’s Cypriot championship, but his team are currently in sixth place, 13 points off the pace in a division headed by Apoel Nicosia on 45. Two points behind them are Apollon Limasson and both have a game in hand over AEK Larnaca, also on 43, and Anorthosis Famagusta on 41. Best known for his spells at Blackburn and Nottingham Forest, Derbyshire should end up in the six-team round-robin that will decide the champions. Beaten home and away in this season’s Champions League by Tottenham, his club’s “eternal enemies” Apoel are the reigning champions and aiming to win their sixth consecutive title. Bosnia and Herzogovina’s Liga 12 FK Zeljeznicar from Sarajevo, with whom Edin Dzeko began his career, top the division, which was reduced from 16 teams to a round dozen last season. They are a point clear of the reigning champions, Zrinjski, with FK Sarajevo and Siroki Brijeg six points off the pace in third and fourth. Another league where the top and bottom six go into championship and relegation mini-leagues at the end of the regular season, 10 of the 12 clubs are still in with a shout of finishing in the top six with four games to go, even if only eight have realistic chances. Like so many of the title races featured, it is a league that seems likely to go right down to the wire ... before going right down to the wire again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/18/canadas-use-of-lengthy-solitary-confinement-in-jails-is-unconstitutional-judge","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T01:18:32Z","webTitle":"Canada's use of lengthy solitary confinement in jails is unconstitutional – judge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/18/canadas-use-of-lengthy-solitary-confinement-in-jails-is-unconstitutional-judge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/18/canadas-use-of-lengthy-solitary-confinement-in-jails-is-unconstitutional-judge","fields":{"headline":"Canada's use of lengthy solitary confinement in jails is unconstitutional – judge","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Canada’s use of prolonged or indefinite solitary confinement in federal prisons is unconstitutional, a judge has said in a ruling that could end the controversial practice unless Ottawa appeals the decision. Canadian law currently allows an inmate to be placed in “administrative segregation”, as solitary is known, for an indefinite period of time for non-disciplinary reasons, such as protecting prisoners from fellow inmates. The result seen some inmates left in solitary for as long as four years. The United Nations considers solitary over 15 days to be torture. On Wednesday, a British Columbia supreme court judge found that the laws governing administrative segregation in Canada’s federal prisons contravene the country’s charter of rights and freedoms. Inmates placed in solitary confinement are at significant risk of psychological harm, as well as increased incidence of self-harm and suicide, Justice Peter Leask said in his ruling. Many are left with permanent harm as a result of their confinement, he added. The decision was hailed by the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, who were among the organisations that challenged the practice in court. “This is the most significant trial court decision in the prison context that we’ve ever seen in Canadian history,” said lawyer Jay Aubrey. “It’s really transformative.” The ruling gives the federal government one year to bring its laws in line with the charter. Canada’s public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, who oversees the federal prison system, said in a statement the government is reviewing the ruling. Goodale said Ottawa has already introduced legislation aimed at limiting the amount of time someone can be held in solitary confinement. The ruling is the second judgment in recent months to take aim at Canada’s use of solitary confinement. In December, a judge in Ontario ruled that the system lacked proper safeguards and gave Ottawa 12 months to address the issue. Aubrey said British Columbia ruling went much further than the limited violation of the constitution highlighted in Ontario. Wednesday’s ruling noted that Ottawa’s use of solitary discriminated against indigenous and mentally ill inmates. Both are severely over-represented in the prison population and in solitary confinement, said Aubrey. Between 2005 and 2015, approximately one quarter of non-Aboriginal inmates spent some time in segregation. In the case of Aboriginal inmates, the percentage climbs to a third. The law currently caps solitary for disciplinary reasons at 30 days. The vast majority of people in solitary confinement in Canada are under administrative, not disciplinary, segregation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/17/wigan-bournemouth-fa-cup-third-round-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T21:55:21Z","webTitle":"Wigan sense repeat of history after crushing win over Bournemouth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/17/wigan-bournemouth-fa-cup-third-round-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/17/wigan-bournemouth-fa-cup-third-round-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Wigan sense repeat of history after crushing win over Bournemouth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Paul Cook admitted everything fell Wigan Athletic’s way as they defeated Bournemouth in a third-round replay again to evoke memories of their 2013 FA Cup triumph. The League One leaders recorded a 3-0 victory over the Cherries at the DW Stadium after Samy Morsy’s early strike was added to by goals in quick succession from substitute Dan Burn and defender Callum Elder. It was Bournemouth who Wigan defeated at this stage en route to winning the trophy when a top-flight side five years ago, though their manager Cook stressed they have to be considered a different kettle of fish now they are in the third tier. Told it was Bournemouth who Wigan beat at the start of their Cup run in 2013, Cook replied: “I love that one, me! I think it has been mentioned but I think there’s a gulf in class between teams now. “If West Ham [Wigan’s fourth-round opponents] were to turn up with all their first-team players, we’re not stupid, we know the type of game we would be in for. We’re delighted to win. “It’s a fantastic game, West Ham are a big club with massive support. I’m sure they’ll travel here in large numbers. For us, it’s a good diversion from the league but nothing can detract from our main objective which is trying to be promoted this season. “Games go for you sometimes. Everything’s gone our way. We can enjoy the night, it’s a good win for us but the scoreline, in my opinion, was very flattering to us.” Bournemouth had fought back from two goals down in the first encounter at the Vitality Stadium to force a replay but they lacked that kind of fighting spirit on a miserable night. The Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe, claimed he had no regrets about making eight changes to his team having conceded he was wrong to switch all 11 players for their third-round exit to Millwall last year. However, Howe also acknowledged that those who were brought in at the DW Stadium had done little to force their way into his thinking for Saturday’s trip to West Ham. “The players I picked are the main regular Premier League players who’ve done so well for the club over a long, long period of time,” Howe argued. “I didn’t take any major risks with the team selection and Wigan made changes as well. We can’t use that as an excuse. I think the changes last year definitely affected the result, I would be the first to admit that. This year, no. I don’t think I can look at that team and regret any of those players who played. The majority have done so well for me over a long time. The reality is they didn’t perform. Every time you put on the shirt it’s an opportunity for you to impress and make sure you make my decisions for the next game harder. I don’t think many did that.” Wigan took the lead when Ryan Colclough found Will Grigg with a near-post cross and though his flick was kept out by Artur Boruc, Morsy tucked away the rebound. For their second Burn scored via the crossbar. They put the tie to bed when Max Power’s cross to the back post was met by the left-back Elder, who headed across goal into the far corner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/17/apple-cash-tax-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T21:30:10Z","webTitle":"Apple says it will pay $38bn in foreign cash taxes and create 20,000 US jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/apple-cash-tax-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/17/apple-cash-tax-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Apple says it will pay $38bn in foreign cash taxes and create 20,000 US jobs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Apple said on Wednesday it would make a one-time payment of $38bn to repatriate some of its vast overseas cash holdings. The company, which has faced international criticism for its tax evasion policies, also said it would spend $30bn in the US over the next five years, creating 20,000 new jobs. Lawmakers in the US, European Union and the UK have criticized Apple over its tax policies. The company holds $246bn in low-tax countries. During the election campaign, Donald Trump attacked Apple’s policy of building its phones, tablets and other gadgets overseas. In June, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple’s chief executive officer, Tim Cook, had promised to build three “big, big, big” plants in the US as part of a discussion about tax reform. The company is the latest to announce a one-off payment as a result of recent changes to US tax law, which allows companies to pay a levy of 15.5% on overseas cash holdings that are repatriated to the US. Commenting on the company’s plans, Cook said: “We have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible.” Apple has not specified how much of its cash pile it intends to repatriate. In 2013, a Senate committee accused Apple of using a “highly questionable” web of offshore vehicles to avoid paying taxes in the US. Senator John McCain said his constituents were “mad as hell” to learn that the world’s biggest company was paying tax rates that were sometimes lower than 1%. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” he said. According to the Paradise Papers, a leak of 13.4m files from offshore service providers and tax havens’ company registries published by the Guardian and other international media, in the wake of the US and EU’s criticisms Apple secretly shifted parts of its empire to Jersey as part of a complex rearrangement to keep its low tax rates. In December, the Irish government was forced to start collecting $15bn that the European Union says Apple has unfairly avoided in taxes. Apple is fighting the decision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/21/venezuela-looting-violence-food-shortages","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T06:16:20Z","webTitle":"'We loot or we die of hunger': food shortages fuel unrest in Venezuela","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/21/venezuela-looting-violence-food-shortages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/21/venezuela-looting-violence-food-shortages","fields":{"headline":"'We loot or we die of hunger': food shortages fuel unrest in Venezuela","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Amid desperate food shortages Venezuelans are picking up new survival skills. On the night of 9 January, for example, a hungry mob took just 30 minutes to pick clean a grocery store in the eastern city of Puerto Ordaz. By the time owner Luis Felipe Anatael arrived at the bodega he’d opened five months earlier, the looters had hauled away everything from cold cuts to ketchup to the cash registers. “It makes you want to cry,” said Anatael in a telephone interview. “I think we are headed for chaos.” Evidence for his prediction can be found in towns and cities across Venezuela that have been hit by an outbreak of looting and mob violence. Angry about empty supermarket shelves and soaring prices, some people are breaking into warehouses, ransacking food trucks and invading outlying farms. During the first 11 days of January the Venezuelan Observatory for Social Conflict, a Caracas rights group, recorded 107 episodes of looting and several deaths in 19 of Venezuela’s 23 states. But the figures don’t fully capture the level of desperation. Recent headlines from Venezuela read like notes from the apocalypse: On Margarita Island dozens of people waded into the ocean and forced their way aboard a fishing boat, making off with its catch of sardines In the city of Maracay, just west of Caracas, thieves broke into a veterinary school, stole two pregnant thoroughbred horses and slaughtered them for meat. A recent video from the western state of Mérida shows a group of people cornering a cow before stoning it to death as bystanders yell: “The people are hungry!” There have been previous incidents of looting but analysts fear that the current wave could linger amid the Venezuela’s economic freefall. President Nicolás Maduro blames the country’s woes on an “economic war” against his government by rightwingers and foreign interests. But his critics say his government has disrupted domestic food production by expropriating farms and factories. Meanwhile, price controls designed to make food more widely available to poorer people have had the opposite effect: many prices have been set below the cost of production, forcing food producers out of business. Meanwhile the government has less cash to import food because of its mismanagement of the oil sector, where production has fallen to a 29-year low. Hyperinflation and the collapse of the currency have put the prices of foodstuffs available on the black market beyond the reach of many families. But rather than reforming the economy, the government has resorted to handouts and far-fetched schemes. A newly formed ministry of urban farming encourages people to grow tomatoes and raise chickens on their patios and rooftops. Another campaign encourages Venezuelans to breed rabbits for the table. At a recent news conference, Freddy Bernal, the urban farm minister, declared: “We need people to understand that a rabbit is not a pet. It’s two and a half kilos of meat.” But as they grow thinner some Venezuelans insist they have a right to take matters into their own hands. That was the case in the western city of Maracaibo, where residents recently swarmed into the streets, stopped two trucks filled with flour and candy, and emptied them. “We either loot or we die of hunger,” one of the looters, Maryoli Corniele, told Diario la Verdad, the local newspaper. Sometimes the looting has been spontaneous. But in other cases the targeting of shops and food trucks appears to have been coordinated via chat groups on Facebook and Whatsapp. Security forces have largely stood by. Although his bodega is located just down the street from a national guard post, Anatael said that his pleas for help were ignored. He scoffed at officers’ claims that they lacked enough troops to protect businesses. “Whenever there are anti-government protests, they have more than enough teargas, tanks and troops to put them down,” he said. “But for us business people, there is no security.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/17/birth-control-app-natural-cycle-pregnancies","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T21:42:11Z","webTitle":"Birth control app reported to Swedish officials after 37 unwanted pregnancies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/birth-control-app-natural-cycle-pregnancies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/17/birth-control-app-natural-cycle-pregnancies","fields":{"headline":"Birth control app reported to Swedish officials after 37 unwanted pregnancies","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A much-hyped birth control app has been reported to Swedish authorities after a hospital found 37 cases of unwanted pregnancies among women relying on the app for contraception. Natural Cycles, a smartphone application that marries hi-tech algorithms with the old-fashioned rhythm method, last year became the first app to be certified as a contraceptive method in Europe. The app requires women to input their temperature every morning, then calculates the users’ menstrual cycle and informs them when they can have sex without protection. The Stockholm-based company, founded by Cern physicist Elina Berglund and her husband, Raoul Scherwitzl, claims to be 93% effective with typical use – and without the side-effects that many women experience from hormonal birth control. But the startup is now on the defensive after the Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported that 37 of the 668 women who sought an abortion at one of Stockholm’s largest hospitals from September to December 2017 were relying on Natural Cycles for birth control. The hospital reported the app to Sweden’s Medical Products Agency, and Natural Cycles said in a statement that it was “responding to each reported case”. “An unwanted pregnancy is, of course, very unfortunate and we deeply care every time one of our users becomes pregnant unplanned,” the company said. “As our user base increases, so will the number of unplanned pregnancies coming from Natural Cycles users. This is an arithmetic truth applicable to all contraceptive methods.” A 93% effectiveness rate means that out of every 100 women using the app, seven will experience an unwanted pregnancy. Those figures are about comparable with typical use of oral contraceptives, and better than condoms or other barrier methods, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The traditional rhythm method, which involves tracking one’s cycle without the assistance of a nuclear physicist’s algorithm, has a typical use failure rate of 24%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/26/praise-the-lord-and-pass-the-rattlesnakes-mack-wolford-lauren-pond-test-of-faith-old-yeller-rattlesnake","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-26T15:54:09Z","webTitle":"'Praise the lord and pass the rattlesnakes': the pastor killed by the viper he preached with","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/26/praise-the-lord-and-pass-the-rattlesnakes-mack-wolford-lauren-pond-test-of-faith-old-yeller-rattlesnake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/26/praise-the-lord-and-pass-the-rattlesnakes-mack-wolford-lauren-pond-test-of-faith-old-yeller-rattlesnake","fields":{"headline":"'Praise the lord and pass the rattlesnakes': the pastor killed by the viper he preached with","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Pastor Mack Wolford had many ways of getting the faithful all fired up. He would drive from town to town, preaching, singing, speaking in tongues and brandishing – on several occasions – venomous snakes. Wolford, who lived in McDowell County in West Virginia, belonged to the Full Gospel Apostolic House of the Lord Jesus, one of the few remaining small Appalachian Pentecostal sects known as “sign followers”. They adhere to a literal interpretation of a passage from the Gospel of Mark in the King James Bible. “And these signs,” it says, “shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.” Lauren Pond began photographing Wolford and his congregation in 2011, overcoming her own fear as she shot rattlesnakes and copperheads being coiled around the arms and necks of worshippers as they reaffirmed their faith in the divine. On 23 May the following year, just before his 44th birthday, Wolford posted this message to his followers on Facebook: “Praise the lord and pass the rattlesnakes, brother.” Four days later, Pond followed him deep into the Appalachian hills. She shot several frames at an outdoor service as Wolford held, and then walked on, a timber rattlesnake called Old Yeller he had owned for several years. “Gone was the benevolent energy I had felt the previous year,” Pond later wrote, “and in its place an odd sense of urgency.” As she shot, “suddenly an eerie stillness fell over the picnic site”. The cause quickly became clear: Wolford had been bitten. Eight hours later, he died, his family and followers having respected his steadfast refusal to send for medical treatment until it was too late – so strong was their belief that his fate was solely in God’s hands. For Pond, who had become friends with Wolford, it was a deeply upsetting experience and one, you sense, she has not fully come to terms with. “I was only 26,” she says, “and I was a bit overwhelmed. I felt powerless and helpless. I didn’t know what to do, but my instinctive response was to pick up the camera again. In a way, the camera was my shield. I also knew he had been bitten before and I thought he would get better. Looking back, it did spin out of control for me.” Pond’s new book, Test of Faith: Signs, Serpents, Salvation, chronicles her time among the sign followers. It includes images that track Wolford’s agonising final hours as he is carried, semi-conscious and drenched in sweat, to a nearby chair by members of the congregation. He was then driven from the service to his mother-in-law’s house, where he died. There are powerful images of him lying prone on a couch while his family pray around him. “I went with them to the house, then left for a few hours so the family could have some space,” says Pond. “When I returned, he was having trouble breathing. He declined very rapidly in the end, and people were devastated. No one expected him to die.” In the aftermath, ABC News reported that the park authorities had been unaware of the nature of the event and quoted a spokesperson saying: “If we had known about it, or if we had been asked for permission, permission would not have been granted.” Nevertheless snake-handling is still legal in West Virginia, if a fading tradition. Other Appalachian states, including Kentucky and Tennessee, have banned the practice in public spaces. Four years ago, Jamie Coots, a Kentucky pastor who hosted a reality TV show called Snake Salvation also died from a snakebite, having refused medical treatment. For a long time afterwards, Pond, who is from California and had been welcomed with her camera into the small community by Wolford, was haunted by his death. “It didn’t feel right for me to impose my values on theirs, but then you are left thinking, ‘Would I do anything differently now?’ The truth is, I still don’t know. It was such a heightened atmosphere, such an unreal experience.” Her relationship with the family grew more fraught when some of her photographs were published in a newspaper soon after his death. In two, Wolford was shirtless. “They are such a modest community that it was akin to him being seen naked,” she says. “They are people of the spirit, not the flesh.” Wolford’s wife had asked her not to photograph him with his shirt off. So for her, it was even more of a betrayal. “Being an outsider, I didn’t fully understand the sensitivity of the issue. I made a mistake,” says Pond. “I had a responsibility to tell the story, but I should not have published those two photographs. It was a hard experience.” The book’s title, Test of Faith, seems double-edged, referring to the risks Wolford took in his sermons and Pond’s belief in the transformative power of photography. In the year following the death, Pond questioned her role as a documentary photographer, so much so that her style changed, becoming more detached. “I was afraid to get too close,” she says. “I was shooting my subjects from a distance. I had to learn to get close all over again.” Pond was raised in a Presbyterian family “but never went to church”. On her website, she describes herself as “specialising in faith and religion”. She also works for Ohio State University, filming and recording religious communities. Has her experience made her more religious? “I think my upbringing instilled a curiosity in me that has perhaps become more defined of late. But I am not on any big religious quest. I enjoy connecting with people who are very different to the mainstream, to the point where they are seen as ‘other’.” A year after Wolford’s death, Pond attended his anniversary service at the invitation of his family. “It was a gesture of forgiveness on their part. I went and I talked to them about everything that had happened, all the confusion and misunderstanding. That started the mutual healing.” Wolford’s own father actually died of a snakebite when he was a teenager and the family continue to handle snakes, with Wolford’s brother Chris now leading the congregation at a new church. Over the past few years, Pond has travelled back to West Virginia to spend Thanksgiving with Wolford’s family. They have even allowed her to take pictures of them. “The photographing came back as the relationship was restored,” she says. “My work has changed dramatically since then, though, probably as a result of this experience and the pain it caused. I’ve realised the value of listening and being present with those I photograph – rather than being an outsider.” • Test of Faith: Signs, Serpents, Salvation is published by Duke University Press."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/17/trade-unions-call-government-reassurances-over-carillion-flimsy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T20:15:59Z","webTitle":"‘Flimsy’ reassurances anger unions as creditors brace for Carillion fallout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/17/trade-unions-call-government-reassurances-over-carillion-flimsy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/17/trade-unions-call-government-reassurances-over-carillion-flimsy","fields":{"headline":"‘Flimsy’ reassurances anger unions as creditors brace for Carillion fallout","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Efforts by the government to reassure thousands of staff employed by Carillion to work for private sector clients were called “flimsy”, as the small businesses owed money by the failed company braced for losses. The prime minister’s spokesman said most of the companies that were using Carillion’s 8,500-strong private sector workforce have agreed to provide funding to continue paying them. But trade unions warned the promise would not provide sufficient reassurance and voiced fears that Carillion’s financial failure would spread further among suppliers, some of which have begun laying off staff. As the government grappled with the fallout from Carillion’s collapse: Banks and HM Revenue &amp; Customs vowed to assist affected firms. Carillion’s former boss quit a £60,000-a-year job at another company. Directors’ bonuses and salaries were stopped. Government monitoring of Carillion was criticised. The Insolvency Service, which is sifting through Carillion’s contracts in an effort to limit disruption, said 90% of firms contacted have agreed to “provide funding” to ensure the services such as cleaning and maintenance continue. “Over the past 48 hours all of the company’s private sector service customers have been contacted to determine their ongoing needs,” the Insolvency Service said. “The Official Receiver is very pleased with the level of support shown by Carillion’s private sector service customers. Work has paused on construction sites, pending decisions as to how and if they will be restarted.” Some 10% of Carillion’s list of private sector customers, which include Nationwide and National Grid, have yet to make such a commitment. The GMB trade union said the statement from the Insolvency Service “raises more questions than it answers”. “Ensuring most workers get paid beyond today doesn’t go nearly far enough to give the reassurance our members need right now,” said general secretary Tim Roache. “We need proper guarantees that they will not be left in the lurch and unable to pay the bills within days due to a crisis they did not cause. Without assurances as to how long wages are secure for and who will be running these contracts given the company’s spectacular failure, this is not going to help Carillion workers sleep easier tonight.” Britain’s biggest trade union Unite warned that thousands of staff at Carillion’s estimated 30,000 supplier and subcontractor companies were also at risk. Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: “The government has a moral duty to provide direct financial assistance as well as other support in order to ensure that subcontractors and suppliers don’t needlessly go to the wall, with thousands of workers potentially losing their jobs.” Business secretary Greg Clarkmet banks on Wednesday morning, asking them to provide additional financial support. “SMEs are not responsible for the collapse of Carillion and banks should bear that in mind,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. HMRC and the banking industry both promised extra time to make tax and loan repayments. UK Finance, the trade body that represents banks, said the industry was ready to offer “emergency measures”. HMRC offered affected companies the chance to pay by instalment, defer payment, and avoid penalties for missing tax deadlines. As the prime minister fielded questions in parliament about the crisis, the government faced criticism over its dealings with Carillion. Court documents filed as part of the firm’s liquidation show many of its customers were abandoning the company even as the government continued to award it contracts. Wolverhampton-based Carillion began weekly reporting on its financial position to government from the autumn, several months after its July profits warning. A witness statement from interim chief executive Keith Cochrane said the company subsequently won “significant new contracts, including with [the government] at a time when certain long-standing customers informed the company that they would not place new work until its balance sheet issues were resolved”. Carillion announced the award of eight public sector contracts after the July warning, including joint venture arrangements to build parts of the HS2 line. Transport secretary Chris Grayling told ITV there was “no legal basis for excluding a consortium of companies that have done nothing wrong” and that due diligence had been carried out. But Jon Trickett, Labour’s shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, accused ministers of ignoring warning signs: “Many other businesses, including longstanding customers stopped supporting Carillion because of the state of its finances. “Yet the government continued to hand them major contracts whilst failing to monitor them properly until it was too late.” The Cabinet Office has pointed to the fact that many of these contracts were joint ventures with partner firms who could step in to pick up the work. The document also shows that Carillion hoped “that HMG would provide support to the company to mitigate and help managed the challenges it faced”. But the end came a week after Carillion asked ministers for a bailout on 8 January of about £20m. Ministers refused the request at a meeting on Sunday, forcing it to enter liquidation the following day. The Cabinet Office said directors who were in charge when Carillion collapsed are no longer receiving salaries or bonuses, including severance payments due to executives who have left. The government has asked the Insolvency Service to fast-track an investigation into the conduct of the directors. Former chief executive Richard Howson, who quit in July after the firm first revealed it was in financial difficulty, has stepped down from a £60,000-a-year job with oil services company John Wood Group. Shadow work and pension secretary Debbie Abrahams said she had written to her opposite number, Esther McVey, to ask for more detail on plans to deal with Carillion’s retirement scheme, which has a £590m deficit. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here. • This article was amended on 18 January 2018 to remove a suggestion that British Gas was in the 10% of Carillion’s private sector customers which had yet to make a commitment to the Insolvency Administrator."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/feb/03/best-microbead-free-body-scrubs-beauty-sali-hughes","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T08:00:15Z","webTitle":"The best microbead-free scrubs | Sali Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/03/best-microbead-free-body-scrubs-beauty-sali-hughes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/feb/03/best-microbead-free-body-scrubs-beauty-sali-hughes","fields":{"headline":"The best microbead-free scrubs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On 9 January, the use of plastic microbeads in rinse-off beauty products and toiletries was finally outlawed, after years of campaigning by environmental groups and more responsible sections of the beauty industry. Good riddance, I say, since microbeads – those tiny, coloured, plastic spheres suspended in scrubs and shower gels, ostensibly to “exfoliate” dead skin and “release” skincare ingredients – were as useful as a glass tennis racquet. In practice, they fall off skin, down the plughole and into the oceans before they come close to bursting. In any case, their size, sparseness and softness makes them wholly ineffective skin exfoliants. While I am strongly of the view that facial exfoliants should never be granular (I prefer a flannel and grit-free AHA and BHA products to remove dead skin from the face), I am happy with the refreshing, bracing feel of densely packed, textured scrubs on sturdier body skin. These are my personal favourites, none of which are affected by the ban. Lush’s Rub Rub Rub shower scrub (£9.95, 350g) is brilliantly effective on tricky areas such as shins, elbows and scalp, especially when applied to dry skin before entering the shower. It removes even fine flakes extremely well, rinses out fully and doesn’t irritate. If dry flakes are a secondary concern to goosebumpy upper arms and thighs, you will need a chemical exfoliant as well as a physical one. Cult Beauty’s Ameliorate (£17.50, 150ml) contains both and work wonders with regular use. Make sure you apply it five minutes before entering water, to give the lactic acids a chance to knuckle down (it is cruelty-free but, unlike everything else here today, not vegan; it contains milk proteins). Ground-coffee scrubs, which also contain sea salt and essential oils, are an all-natural, fun alternative to classic exfoliants. They also have practical benefits: the dry consistency and compact, brown-paper packaging make them an environmentally responsible option, although I find myself more likely to use too much and consequently waste product. I like all of Frank Body’s scrubs, but its Coconut Coffee (£13.95, 200g) smells extraordinary and gives me a jolt of energy on knackered mornings. My favourite of the posher, gift-appropriate scrubs is Ren’s Guérande salt body balm (£23, 330ml), which smooths thoroughly, smells divine and melts fully into bath water for a decadent, skin-softening treat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/18/turning-offices-into-homes-threatens-affordability-study","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T00:01:34Z","webTitle":"Turning offices into homes threatens affordability – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/18/turning-offices-into-homes-threatens-affordability-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/18/turning-offices-into-homes-threatens-affordability-study","fields":{"headline":"Turning offices into homes threatens affordability – study","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than half of all new homes in some areas have been created by allowing developers to convert offices without building any affordable homes, an impact study of the policy has revealed. Since 2015, 30,575 housing units in England have been converted from offices to flats without having to go through the planning system, in a bid by ministers to boost housing supply. It means there has been a potential loss of more than 7,500 affordable homes, according to the study by the Local Government Association. Such office to residential conversions under permitted development rules in place since 2013 accounted for 73% of new homes in Stevenage during 2016-17, the LGA said. In Nottingham, Basildon, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Hounslow and Harlow the figure was more than half. Last year the Guardian revealed plans by the London borough of Barnet to transform its former head office into 254 flats, some of which are to be 40% smaller than a Travelodge bedroom and have been labelled “dog kennels” by critics. Across England and Wales, 8% of new homes since 2015 were created by the change of use in office buildings. Councils have warned that “office space could dry up as a result, leaving businesses and startups without any premises in which to base themselves”. Martin Tett, the LGA’s housing spokesman, said: “Permitted development is detrimental to the ability of local communities to shape the area they live in. Planning is not a barrier to housebuilding, and councils are approving nine in 10 planning applications. But it is essential that councils, which are answerable to their residents, have an oversight of local developments to ensure they are good quality and help build prosperous places. The resulting loss of office space can risk hampering local plans to grow economies and attract new businesses and jobs to high streets and town centres.” The Department for Housing Communities and Local Government defended the policy. “We are determined to build the homes our country needs and permitted development rights play an important role in helping us deliver more properties,” said a spokesman. “We need a mix of dwelling types to meet different housing needs and over 17,500 additional properties were created by converting offices in the year to March 2017.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/17/us-government-shutdown-looms-as-republicans-struggle-to-pitch-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T21:21:49Z","webTitle":"US government shutdown looms as Republicans struggle to pitch bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/us-government-shutdown-looms-as-republicans-struggle-to-pitch-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/us-government-shutdown-looms-as-republicans-struggle-to-pitch-bill","fields":{"headline":"US government shutdown looms as Republicans struggle to pitch bill","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Capitol Hill edged closer to a potential shutdown on Wednesday, as Republicans struggled to come up with a bill to keep the government open past a funding deadline on Friday. Democrats have long insisted that they will not support any legislation to further fund the government unless protections are added for the “Dreamers”, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. An Obama-era program that protected them from deportation was cancelled by the Trump administration last year, and is set to expire on 5 March. A potential compromise on the program, negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators, was vetoed in a White House meeting last week in which Donald Trump reportedly disparaged a number of nations as “shithole countries”. The resulting impasse forced Republicans to introduce a short-term bill, instead, which would keep the government open for one month, repeal several taxes, and renew the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) for six years, a top Democratic priority. This bill was met with “broad and strong revulsion” from Senate Democrats, said Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the chamber. Because of a 60-vote filibuster rule, Republicans need nine Democrats in the Senate to vote for any budget deal. However the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, suggested that he was less concerned with the need for Democratic votes than the obstacle of Trump himself. “I am looking for something that President Trump supports and he has not yet indicated what measure he is willing to sign,” McConnell said. “As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we are not just spinning our wheels going through this issue on the floor, but actually dealing with a bill that has a chance to become law.” Trump repeated his criticism of the bipartisan proposal in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. “It’s the opposite of what I campaigned for,” he said, adding that he thought the compromise “very, very weak”. In the meantime, as Congress points towards yet another round of brinkmanship over keeping the government open, lawmakers are growing frustrated with the process. “A lot of Americans are scratching their heads and saying we didn’t know the Jerry Springer show was in syndication, what’s going on up there,” said Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/21/lover-for-a-day-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T08:00:15Z","webTitle":"Lover for a Day review – ‘Frenchness’ fetishised","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/21/lover-for-a-day-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/21/lover-for-a-day-review","fields":{"headline":"Lover for a Day review – ‘Frenchness’ fetishised","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A slight, sexed-up, black-and-white rumination on desire, daddy issues and age-gap relationships, Philippe Garrel’s romantic drama fetishises “Frenchness”.

Sturridge has found himself surplus to requirements at Anfield this season, making only nine league appearances this season, and Liverpool would prefer permanent offers for a player who can earn up to £150,000 a week on a heavily incentivised contract. A sizeable transfer fee plus the lucrative salary has deterred several clubs, however, including Real Betis, although Inter are exploring the possibility of signing the 28‑year‑old on loan. Sevilla are also understood to have had a loan request turned down. They would still have to pay a significant loan fee and Sturridge’s salary to sign him until the end of the season, providing Liverpool allow a temporary departure. A deal is currently a long way from being agreed. Sturridge has scored 63 goals in 133 appearances for Liverpool since arriving for £12m from Chelsea five years agoWhile he was an integral part of the team that almost won the Premier League under Brendan Rodgers, his Anfield career has been beset by injuries. He last appeared for Jürgen Klopp’s team in the 7-0 Champions League rout of Spartak Moscow on 6 December. Liverpool have allowed Marko Grujic to join Cardiff City on loan until the end of the season. The Serbian midfielder has made only six appearances for the first team this season and, despite interest from Premier League clubs including Huddersfield Town, Klopp wanted the 21-year-old to drop into the Championship in search of a regular starting role."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jan/17/welcome-return-of-school-prints-loan-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T18:43:31Z","webTitle":"Welcome return of School Prints loan scheme | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/17/welcome-return-of-school-prints-loan-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jan/17/welcome-return-of-school-prints-loan-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Welcome return of School Prints loan scheme","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is good to see that schools in Wakefield will benefit from a renewed School Prints loan scheme from the Hepworth Wakefield (Editorial, 15 January).

Speaking during a Senate committee hearing on extremist propaganda and social media, Clint Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, warned of foreign countries using the kinds of persuasive techniques previously used to recruit Islamist terrorists to manipulate political discourse and mobilise unwitting Americans to attack specific targets. Watts described this new type of threat as “Anwar Awlaki meets Pizzagate”, referring to the US-born jihadist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, credited with using social media to inspire terror attacks around the world, and the viral online conspiracy theory that led an armed man from North Carolina to discharge his weapon in a Washington pizza restaurant. Instead of recruiting Americans to their own ideologies, foreign actors will instead focus on sowing division based on existing political issues within the United States, and manipulating individuals to the point where they take violent action. “The greatest concern moving forward might likely be a foreign intelligence service, posing as Americans on social media, infiltrating one or both political extremes in the US and then recruiting unwitting Americans to undertake violence against a target of the foreign power’s choosing,” said Watts in his testimony to the Senate’s commerce, science and transportation committee. Alongside representatives from Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, Watts faced questioning from the committee about tackling extremist propaganda such as that of Islamic State. However, the conversation frequently shifted to Russian influence operations, bots and fake news – issues that have dogged the social media platforms over the last couple of years. The technology companies outlined the steps they had taken to police their networks for extremist content and recruitment. All three said they had allocated additional resources to identifying and removing extremist content, including implementing tools powered by artificial intelligence to automatically find and remove it. They highlighted previously reported measures including the creation of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. However, Watts argued that they were being reactive rather than proactive to the threats they face. “Social media companies realise the damage of these bad actors far too late, they race to implement policies that prevent the last information attack, but have yet to anticipate the next abuse of their social media platforms by emerging threats,” he said. To tackle these emerging threats, social media companies need to make more effort to verify users’ identity, clamp down on bots and hire threat intelligence specialists to prepare for new exploitation techniques and deliver more transparency around both political advertising. In November, Facebook announced that it would alert users if they had interacted with a Facebook page or Instagram account created by the Internet Research Agency, a state-backed organisation based in St Petersburg that carries out online misinformation operations. During the hearing, Twitter’s Carlos Monje said his company would be doing the same. Watts said that although the US government had made efforts to tackle the use of social media by terrorist organisations, its response to state-sponsored influence on Americans was “disjointed and perplexing”. “There’s been no response from the US government with regard to Russian influence campaigns on social media,” he said, referring to the techniques used in the run up to the 2016 US presidential election. “So they have stayed on course with their operations.” The endgame is to create “widespread apathy in democracies” and dilute the lines between fact and fiction. “When that happens you can’t keep a democracy moving forward. It’s about breaking our system and turning us against each other,” he said. Russia has made attempts to influence elections not only in the United States but also in Europe and Latin America, and other regimes have adopted similar strategies. “Everyone is adopting the technique,” Watts said. For example, Myanmar, where disinformation on Facebook masks deadly violence against the minority Rohingya population, and the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte harnesses social media to silence political opponents. “Lesser-educated populations around the world predominantly arriving in cyberspace via mobile phones will be particularly vulnerable to social media manipulations of terrorists and authoritarians,” Watts said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/17/jo-cox-sister-experienced-bouts-loneliness","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T19:12:56Z","webTitle":"Jo Cox's sister reveals late MP experienced periods of loneliness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/17/jo-cox-sister-experienced-bouts-loneliness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/17/jo-cox-sister-experienced-bouts-loneliness","fields":{"headline":"Jo Cox's sister reveals late MP experienced periods of loneliness","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The public image projected by the late Labour MP Jo Cox was of a cheerfully confident and outgoing professional, so it is startling to hear her sister describe her as someone who struggled at times with profound loneliness. She experienced it first when she went to university. “When she went to Cambridge she found herself in a new world, which for a working class northern girl was very intimidating and she found it very difficult,” her younger sister Kim Leadbeater said. “We used to talk on the phone late at night. She missed the safety and the comfort of her family and friends.” Cox felt very isolated again shortly after the birth of her first child. “When she was a young mum, home alone with a baby she felt very lonely. She would call and say: ‘I just need to have a conversation with an adult,’” Leadbeater said. “When you experience something yourself it stays close to your heart.” Tackling loneliness was a cause that Cox had begun to work on as an MP, in the 13 months between being elected in May 2015 and being murdered in June 2016, setting up an independent cross-party commission to work on it. After her death, the Jo Cox Foundation made a commitment to continue her work and Theresa May announced this week that she was creating a minister for loneliness to focus on the issue in Cox’s honour. At a reception at Downing Street to celebrate the plan on Wednesday, the prime minister made a vow directly to Cox’s son Cullin, whose father Brendan previously said had written a song that went “I love my mummy, I will not leave her behind”. “Cullin, don’t worry – none of us will leave your mummy behind,” May said. “None of us will forget her life, her ideals or what she stood for and all of us will do all that we can to see that in her memory we bring an end to the acceptance of loneliness in our society.” Earlier, Leadbeater had said her sister would have been “elated” at the announcement. “Jo would be over the moon that the issues that she felt passionate about have been taken on. She did so much in the first half of her life and would have achieved so much more in the second half, that there is a responsibility for those of us who loved Jo and knew her to pick up where she left off.” In an interview shortly before meeting Theresa May and MPs from all parties at a reception to discuss ways of carrying forward Cox’s legacy, Leadbeater said Cox would have found it “hilarious” to see her younger sister forced into the limelight to talk about the campaign. But Leadbeater, who runs a personal training business in Yorkshire, stepped forward to become a spokeswoman for her family in the days after Jo was shot three times outside her constituency office, when she spoke movingly about how her sister “only saw the good in people”. She remains determined to help push on with the work Cox initiated. As a new MP, meeting people throughout the constituency, Cox was inspired to take up the cause of loneliness because she met so many socially isolated individuals, Leadbeater said. It is striking how many of the profiles of Thomas Mair, the man who shot Cox, refer to him as a “loner” and as “reclusive”. Leadbeater does not believe Mair’s crime could have been averted if he had lived a less solitary life, but she is convinced that isolation has “a very negative impact”. “The best case scenario is that you just feel lonely and the worst case scenario you get drawn towards ways of dealing with that which are incredibly destructive,” she said. The commission on loneliness set up by Cox warned in December that loneliness can be as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and stated that more than 9 million people always or often feel lonely. As part of its work to combat that crisis, the Jo Cox Foundation is announcing a second “great get together”, a weekend of community-building events in the MP’s honour. Last year it was held on the anniversary of her death. This year, it will be held on what would have been her 44th birthday, 22 June. The idea is to promote community spirit by having lunches and public gatherings, encouraging people to forge new connections, in the spirit of people having “more in common that that which divides us”, a point highlighted in Cox’s maiden parliamentary speech. The 18 months since her sister’s death have been made more challenging for her family by the string of violent attacks in London and Manchester. “Any time something like that happens we are massively shaken emotionally,” said Leadbeater. It is extremely heartbreaking to see other people go through what we have been through. When you have been through something so horrific you think about the families of the victims; you know what the next 24 hours are like, and what the next weeks and months are like and how life has changes forever – beyond recognition in our case.” This Christmas was much harder for the family than the first one they spent without her. “Last year we were totally numb and on autopilot,” she said. “This year the reality was more acute.” But Cox’s children, now five and seven, are doing very well. “They are bathed in love and the family has done a fantastic job at keeping them safe,” said Leadbeater. “They have so much of Jo in their personalities – they are extremely positive and resilient, so being around them is wonderful and heartbreaking at the same time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/18/security-experts-say-us-attempt-to-link-terror-and-immigration-skews-the-data","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T12:00:13Z","webTitle":"Security experts say US attempt to link terror and immigration 'skews the data'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/security-experts-say-us-attempt-to-link-terror-and-immigration-skews-the-data","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/security-experts-say-us-attempt-to-link-terror-and-immigration-skews-the-data","fields":{"headline":"Security experts say US attempt to link terror and immigration 'skews the data'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"National security experts have criticized the departments of justice and homeland security, describing a report that attempts to link terrorism and immigration as misleading, “awfully thin” and of “little value” to the US. The Trump administration claimed the report demonstrated a need for stricter immigration policies, though it presented little new information on terrorism convictions and omitted key data points and context. Alistair Millar, chairman of the board of directors at the Global Center on Cooperative Security, a nonpartisan thinktank, said the report distorted terrorism numbers to suggest foreign-born people carry out the majority of terrorist attacks in the US. “They are really skewing the data, almost coincidentally, it seems, with this fever-pitch attempt to get people from coming from certain countries into the US,” Millar told the Guardian. The report concentrates on the 549 people convicted of terrorism-related charges in US federal courts from 11 September 2001 to 31 December 2016, 254 of whom were not American citizens, while 148 were naturalized citizens and 147 citizens born in the US. In all, 402 of the 549 people were foreign-born; 295 were US citizens. National security experts were quick to note that the report did not distinguish which people were brought to the US for trial versus those who had immigrated there first. The report also included people who were charged with terrorism-related offenses carried out overseas. “It’s an awfully thin report for an absolutely important topic,” Karen Greenberg, director of Fordham University’s Center on National Security, told the Washington Post. “There’s almost no rhyme or reason to the things they choose to include or not include – they don’t explain it.” Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized the report for failing to introduce new information. “It’s remarkable that, given almost a year to produce such a report and with the vast resources of the federal government combined with reams of government information unavailable to the public, that they were able to produce a report of so little of value,” he wrote for the thinktank. In the Cato Institute’s own analysis of terrorism, it found that from 2002 to 2017, native-born Americans were responsible for 78% of murders in terrorist attacks in the US. Trump provoked further criticism with a tweet about the report that did not include the word “international” – implying that most people convicted of terrorism in the US are foreign-born, when the report is specific to people convicted on charges of international terrorism. “We need to keep America safe, including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system, to one that is merit-based,” Trump said. The report was also criticized for ignoring the threat of domestic terrorism, which resulted in 225 deaths from 12 September 2001 to the end of 2016, according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study. The study said violent extremist groups with far-right beliefs were responsible for 73% of the 85 incidents counted in the report, while radical Islamist extremists were responsible for 27%. The DHS and DOJ’s joint 11-page report was released the same day that the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, testified before Congress for a routine update on the department. “They are obviously trying to make news with the report but I’m not sure it’s going to have a real long-term effect on the overall immigration discussion,” said James Norton, a deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs at the homeland security department under George W Bush. Norton said the report was another example of the administration’s hardline position on new, strict immigration policies, including several versions of a travel ban, capping refugee admissions and ending temporary protected status for people from four different countries. “A lot of folks are hopeful that we can find some ways to improve parts of the system, at least in the short term, to get to a broader fix,” Norton said. “But it doesn’t seem like there is a lot of willingness to do that.” The DHS and DOJ report was published to comply with a March 2017 executive order that first banned entry to the US for people from six predominantly Muslim countries. The order has since expired and been replaced with a new travel ban."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/17/man-convicted-of-theft-in-1976-cleared-after-googling-his-arresting-officer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T17:43:19Z","webTitle":"Man convicted of theft in 1976 cleared after Googling his arresting officer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/17/man-convicted-of-theft-in-1976-cleared-after-googling-his-arresting-officer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/17/man-convicted-of-theft-in-1976-cleared-after-googling-his-arresting-officer","fields":{"headline":"Man convicted of theft in 1976 cleared after Googling his arresting officer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man found guilty of stealing mailbags more than 40 years ago has had his conviction quashed in what the lord chief justice described as an exceptional case. The court of appeal heard that the arresting officer in the original trial had died in prison not long afterwards while also serving a sentence for mailbag theft. Stephen Simmons, now 62, a businessman from Dorking in Surrey, was arrested with two friends in Clapham, south London, in June 1975 by DS Derek Ridgewell of the British Transport Police, who attributed incriminating remarks to the young men. They were allowed to see a duty solicitor who told them that if they called the police liars, the judge would jail them for a long time. Despite the solicitor’s warnings, they pleaded not guilty but were all convicted. Simmons was sent to a borstal in Suffolk and served eight months. He said that the conviction had haunted him ever since and until recently he had not even told his grown-up daughters about the case. Steven Powles, for Simmons, told the court: “Mr Simmons has been waiting for 43 years for this day.” The crown did not contest the application nor seek a retrial, he said. The court heard that four years ago Simmons was given “friendly advice” by barrister Daniel Barnett on LBC radio’s legal advice programme to Google the name of his arresting officer if he wished to overturn his conviction. He did so without expecting to discover anything but what emerged was that Ridgewell himself had been jailed for seven years for mailbag thefts totalling £300,000 in 1980, and had died in prison in 1982. “I was gobsmacked,” Simmons told the Guardian. He then took his case to the criminal cases review commission whose “meticulous research”, carried out by case worker Adam Bell, led to the appeal. The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, sitting with Mr Justice Warby and Mr Justice Julian Knowles, paid tribute to Bell’s “remarkable” efforts and expressed regret to Simmons that the case had taken so long to come back to court. He said that the evidence before him was “extremely telling … It is an exceptional case”. What also emerged, the court heard, was that Ridgewell was responsible for a series of notorious cases in which young black men were falsely accused of “mugging” on the London Undergound. One victim was Winston Trew, who along with three others became known as “the Oval 4”, and who was present in court for Simmons’ appeal. Trew has written a book, Black for a Cause, which detailed Ridgewell’s long history of “fit-ups” and and which became part of the investigation. “This is one of the happiest days of my life,” said Simmons outside court after his conviction was quashed. “It has hardly sunk in but I am not a criminal any more. I can hold my head up high. “One of the hardest things for me was that my parents did not believe me because they were of the generation that believed that the police could not lie.” He had suffered ill-health as a result of the prosecution and one of his co-defendants became an alcoholic and is now dead. “Ridgewell ruined three lives for no reason and I am sure many, many more ... if this can help someone else who was also arrested by him then at least something will have been achieved.” Trew, who embraced Simmons after the case, said: “Today is a great day. This opens the door for me to present my case. It means that evidence that Ridgewell gave in our trial is as tainted as in Stephen’s case.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/17/a-tall-tale-accuracy-of-trumps-medical-report-and-new-height-questioned","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T17:38:26Z","webTitle":"A tall tale?

Accuracy of Trump's medical report – and new height – questioned","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s surprisingly glowing medical report has led to questions about the accuracy of some of the data announced by White House physician Dr Ronny Jackson on Tuesday – including how a man in his 70s has apparently grown an inch in height. Trump’s driving license, issued in May 2012, stated his height as 6ft 2in. Yet according to the report issued by the White House physician on Tuesday, Trump is 6ft 3in. The seeming growth spurt led to people comparing images of Trump to celebrities who are allegedly of the same height. One image showed Trump standing next to former baseball player Alex Rodriguez, who is 6ft 3in. Rodriguez looked considerably taller. A photo of Trump next to Barack Obama, taken one year ago at Trump’s inauguration, seemed to show that the pair were of the same height. Obama is 6ft 1in. Eyebrows were also raised at Trump’s stated weight. His weight of 239lb was just 1lb under him being classed as obese. The intrigue over the president’s body mass was fuelled by people sharing a series of photos of athletes who are also said to weigh around 239lb. The comparisons included NFL quarterback Jay Cutler and Minnesota Vikings running back Latavius Murray, both of whom weigh around 235lb. The athletes both looked significantly different from Trump. Trump’s suggested weight and body circumference has given rise to the “girther” movement, and Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn offered to pay $100,000 to a charity of Trump’s choosing if the president would publicly step on a weighing scale. The president’s diet does not immediately suggest a man whose health is “excellent”, as White House physician Dr Ronny Jackson said. Trump’s food intake has a heavy focus on McDonald’s, KFC and Oreo cookies, while he distrusts exercise – believing the human body comes with a finite amount of energy which is depleted by cardiovascular and resistance training. Trump is being assigned a new diet and exercise regimen and hopes to lose 10-15lb. Jackson said Trump’s life expectancy is “the same as every other American male right now, but it’s certainly no less”. The life expectancy for a man in the US is 76.1 years (Trump is 71). During Obama’s presidency Trump suggested Obama was not born in the US, and in 2012 offered $5m to a charity of Obama’s choosing if the then president released his college records and passport applications. The Guardian contacted Trump’s representatives at the time asking for Trump’s own college records and passport applications. A Trump adviser said that request was “stupid” and accused the Guardian of “trying to be funny”. The documents were not released."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/17/at-the-sharp-end-of-the-carillion-supply-chain","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T18:53:52Z","webTitle":"At the sharp end of the Carillion supply chain | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/17/at-the-sharp-end-of-the-carillion-supply-chain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/17/at-the-sharp-end-of-the-carillion-supply-chain","fields":{"headline":"At the sharp end of the Carillion supply chain","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Andrew Adonis is right to see Carillion as another Lehman (Report, 17 January). In the same way as letting Lehman fail undermined the whole banking sector, the failure of Carillion will infect the whole supply chain and threaten all companies that have the same flawed model of using high levels of debt to give the illusion of profitability. Like the banks, some form of state rescue will be needed. However, the state should not repeat the error of using public money to put Humpty Dumpty back on the wall. As Aditya Chakrabortty says (It’s time to take on the zombies, 17 January), the nonsense of neoliberalism must be challenged. Stratospheric executive pay, prioritising shareholder value and stock market froth do not reflect market efficiency. Nor are states households that must be disciplined by austerity. As I argue in my book Debt or Democracy, public money is an independent force, as the bank rescue showed. The private sector needs a vibrant public economy able to use all its powers to sustain overall economic wellbeing (wellth). The private sector is only as strong as its weakest link. When that fails, the only grownup in the room is the public economy. In the face of market failure, states need to plug the gap with surplus expenditure, that is, deficit spending, funded by quantitative easing not borrowing. When the crisis is over, if necessary, this spending can be reclaimed through taxation. Mary Mellor Newcastle upon Tyne • Your practical suggestions regarding a proper response to the Carillion debacle (Editorial, 16 January) are rather feeble. It is clear that Carillion was overindebted and that will doubtless be true of many other British companies, because the tax system encourages companies to use debt finance rather than equity finance, as debt interest is allowable against profit. This is bound to put companies seriously at risk of insolvency when their cashflow is reduced, so it is not a policy consistent with good macroeconomic management. The solution is clear: disallow debt interest as a charge against profits. This should be done – in phases, if necessary – only for large companies, leaving small and medium companies still able to charge debt interest against profits as now. The result would be threefold. First, large companies would be more financially stable. Second – other things being equal – they would pay more corporation tax. Third, SMEs would have a competitive advantage, and so a better chance of winning government contracts, which would serve the public interest better. This is one of a number of practical policy changes that need to be made to force large companies to better serve the public good, including measures to combat tax avoidance and evasion advocated by the Tax Justice Network. Ian Lovegrove Manchester • Carillion’s role in exacerbating the current prison crisis should be highlighted. Independent Monitoring Boards at Dartmoor and Ford have pointed to serious weaknesses in its service delivery. In late 2017 the prison inspectorate indicated that in Wormwood Scrubs “many repairs were outstanding, often for many months. Numerous cell windows were broken, affecting security … Many showers and telephones were out of action, which caused considerable frustration to prisoners, who often had only limited time on association to wash and make calls … These delays were caused by the maintenance services team, managed by Carillion, not being fully staffed, and also by difficulties with prison staff reporting repair jobs and allowing access to cells … The prison’s main stores were locked up during the inspection and were not currently staffed by Carillion, the remaining employees having left many weeks before. They had to be accessed on an ad hoc basis by prison managers, who left already-overstretched residential units to fetch essential daily items, which meant that supply was haphazard. Most cells had televisions and kettles, and some store rooms had been replenished before the inspection, but there was no reliable, weekly flow of these items to the wings … In our survey, only 31% of respondents said that they normally got clean sheets.” This is a shocking indictment not only of Carillion but also of the corrosive, immoral policies uncritically pursued by successive governments in facilitating private sector involvement in the criminal justice system. Is it any wonder that prisoners are frustrated and that the prison system is in severe crisis? Professor Joe Sim School of humanities and social science, Liverpool John Moores University • The government says that it awarded contracts to Carillion after the company’s profit warning in order to avoid pushing Carillion under. But, when awarding public contracts, purchasing authorities define the qualification criteria – including financial reliability criteria – that firms must meet to be allowed to bid. It would be an extraordinary failure if these did not exclude the possibility of bids being accepted from a company in serious financial difficulties. More troubling, if the criteria were in fact sufficient to prevent that outcome, and if what the government now says is true, its conduct would be unlawful. Purchasing authorities cannot waive financial reliability criteria for a particular company, no matter how important, since that would destroy the level playing field to which other bidders are entitled. It would expose the government to litigation by disappointed bidders. This was, after all, the fate, only a few years ago, of the then corporate officer of the House of Commons in a case concerning a contract for the supply of windows for parliament’s Portcullis House, a case which cost taxpayers more than £5m in damages and over £4m in costs. Let’s hope, as the government tries to explain its awards to Carillion, that it doesn’t sleep walk into an even more expensive round of litigation. Peter Kunzlik Emeritus professor of law, University of East Anglia • The collapse of Carillion raises yet more questions for Whittington Health’s new contract with a private provider. Its board has just appointed Ryhurst, a subsidiary of Rydon, the Grenfell refurbishment contractor, to manage and initially provide the capital to develop the Whittington estates strategy. Whittington Health provides general hospital and community services to 500,000 people living in Islington and Haringey, as well as other London boroughs. Though it’s pressing hospitals to develop, the government will not provide funding, so forcing hospitals into private finance. But why Ryhurst? The Whittington board won’t give reasons why Ryhurst’s bid was accepted over the others. All it and the CEO say is that there was an open procurement process which Ryhurst won. But that depends on what was in the contract specification, which also seems not to be available to public scrutiny. We can only assume that the lowest price was the winning factor. Just like Carillion, which has collapsed because they’ve taken underfunded contracts, which they couldn’t afford (or the profit margins weren’t big enough). So now thousands of jobs will go, pensions are under threat and communities will decline. The Defend the Whittington Hospital Coalition (DWHC) is campaigning to get Rydon out of the Whittington. We wish the workers solidarity over their jobs and pensions. Dr Valerie Lipman London • The British Woodworking Federation represents the UK’s £3.8bn woodworking sector, a craft at the heart of the UK’s construction sector, which employs approximately 60,000 people around the country. As the news of the liquidation of Carillion breaks, it is almost ironic that we are putting our final comments in on the government’s consultation into retention payments in the construction industry. This debate is not about whether the state should bail out Carillion, but whether government can in all conscience turn its back on a supply chain of SMEs who will end up carrying the can for poor procurement, bad business management and an endemic failure by the government to address some of the archaic procurement practices surrounding late payments and retentions that place risk unfairly on SME subcontractors. Many of the creditors are SMEs and the sums, while likely to be significantly lower than the liquidators will take, could define the future of these businesses – it would be a gross injustice if their money unfairly held is lost in this process. To my mind the government is complicit in the sorry saga that is unfolding, and we need decisions fast. In the short term we need to see some security against these retentions and unjust payment clauses. Moving forward, we urge the government to develop a structured and more consistent legislative process to deal with market failures, be they banks, construction firms or steel manufacturers. We cannot rely on arbitrary decision-making and political posturing. There needs to be clear process to ensure those responsible foot the bill and ensure society and supply chains do not suffer unduly. The government consistently fails to recognise the stress of running a small business and keeping people employed – a lot of business owners in this supply chain won’t be sleeping soundly until this is resolved.

The settlement relates to confidential proof of his persecution in his home country which was wrongly shared with the authorities there. The case has similarities to celebrity phone hacking cases where public figures such as Sadie Frost and Paul Gascoigne received six-figure sums following data breaches. Although the payout is less than in the celebrity phone hacking cases, arguably the risk to the life of the asylum seeker involved is greater. The Home Office shared the sensitive documents with the authorities in the man’s home country in a bid to authenticate the information he had given them to prove he had been persecuted at home. The man’s solicitor Dan Carey, of Deighton Pierce Glynn, said that when the asylum seeker discovered what the Home Office had done it had “a considerable impact on him”. Carey said: “In this case, the asylum seeker’s claims were later found to be genuine and the Home Office granted him asylum in the UK. However, his safety and that of his family was put at risk by the Home Office’s actions in sending documents evidencing state persecution to the state authorities in question. “The Home Office were slow to concede that they had done anything wrong in this case, which makes me worry that it was not an isolated aberration. Asylum seekers entrust the government with extremely sensitive, sometimes life-threatening, information in the course of their asylum claims and it is vital to the integrity of that system that it is kept confidential. Least of all do they expect that it will be shared with their persecutors in their country of origin. This can place lives at risk and prevent any hope of future return.” The Home Office refused to answer Freedom of Information Act requests submitted by Carey to try to ascertain the numbers of incidents of unauthorised sharing of asylum information on the basis that there was no central monitoring of the issue, and so it would take too long to go through each case individually. In a previous data breach case in 2016 relating to migrants where confidential information relating to family returns was inadvertently published online, the Home Office also paid compensation. The Home Office said: “In accordance with our obligations under the Refugee Convention and European and UK law, we do not disclose information about an individual’s asylum claim to that person’s home country, or seek information in a way that could expose them, or any family who remain in that country, to serious risk. We take any breach of this principle extremely seriously.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/17/the-guardian-view-on-anglo-french-relations-brexits-entente-cordiale","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T18:26:20Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Anglo-French relations: Brexit’s entente cordiale | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/the-guardian-view-on-anglo-french-relations-brexits-entente-cordiale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/the-guardian-view-on-anglo-french-relations-brexits-entente-cordiale","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Anglo-French relations: Brexit’s entente cordiale","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The recent history of relations between British prime ministers and French presidents is characterised by a gap in affection bridged by recognition of common interest. David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher had complex, sometimes tense alliances with François Hollande, Nicolas Sarkozy, Jacques Chirac and François Mitterrand. None lost sight of the need to manage an ancient rivalry with professional cordiality. In that spirit, on the eve of a summit meeting with Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron has approved a plan for the Bayeux tapestry to be displayed in the UK. This is a demonstration of Mr Macron’s fluency in gesture, pointing to two nations’ shared cultural ancestry. But their two leaders are far from kindred spirits. Mr Macron styles himself as a crusading pro-EU centrist – a personified antidote to the ethos of Brexit that defines Mrs May’s leadership. There are other tensions, predating the UK’s decision to quit the EU but complicated by it, notably the migration bottleneck at Calais. Mr Macron has pledged to renegotiate the Le Touquet accord that allows UK border police to operate in France. Within France his handling of asylum and immigration – with humane rhetoric undone by callousness on the ground – has dismayed his political base. The Calais border is sure come up at Thursday’s summit, with reports suggesting the UK will pay more to prevent migrants crossing the Channel. There will be a show of Anglo-French cordiality, highlighting defence and security cooperation. The UK’s decision to leave the EU is the unavoidable backdrop to Mr Macron’s visit. It also introduces a power imbalance into the relationship. Mr Macron is one of the most influential figures in those Brussels forums that Britain has unwisely chosen to quit, and where the shape of a final deal will be decided. Mutual understanding will be elusive when the two leaders have diametrically opposed European instincts. With Britain at the exit and Germany’s Angela Merkel weighed down by long incumbency, Mr Macron sees a leadership vacancy among EU nations. He certainly doesn’t lack the confidence to fill it. The French president is accused by domestic critics of vanity on a Napoleonic scale. And while his energy in domestic affairs is beyond doubt, his capacity to lead European renewal is less obvious. Mr Macron’s theory is that far-right populism thrives because EU leaders are too timid in extolling the moral purpose of their project and slow to drive it forwards. He urges structural reforms to the eurozone alongside pan-European universities and common European policies on defence and tax to boost economic, political and cultural solidarity. Such things give nightmares to British Eurosceptics. Their removal emboldens the EU’s more integrationist tendency. Mr Macron has cause to be grateful to the Tories. Their Brexit folly is his opportunity. But he should also heed the British experience. Euroscepticism is not unique to the UK. While it is true that the EU’s virtues are undersold, it is also the case that grandiose continental visions can reek of elitism, giving succour to nationalists. And while France is fortunate to have a leader committed to membership of the EU and its renovation, Britain’s referendum experience is a cautionary tale for pro-European politicians. The French president and the British PM are temperamentally and politically ill-matched, but their dialogue could still be fruitful. With such divergent perspectives on the forces that can undermine European partnership, they might have much to learn from one another."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/24/inside-dr-frankensteins-studio-glenn-brown-macabre-mashups-come-to-dust-gagosian-london","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Inside Dr Frankenstein's studio: Glenn Brown on his macabre mashups","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/24/inside-dr-frankensteins-studio-glenn-brown-macabre-mashups-come-to-dust-gagosian-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/24/inside-dr-frankensteins-studio-glenn-brown-macabre-mashups-come-to-dust-gagosian-london","fields":{"headline":"Inside Dr Frankenstein's studio: Glenn Brown on his macabre mashups","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Glenn Brown is showing me his latest sculpture, called Ain’t No Flies on the Lamb of God. It could be three cars crushed in a breaker’s yard painted in a jaunty style, or a trio of oversized candyflosses after a nuclear winter. But no. “It’s my rendition of the crucifixion,” he says. These three fibreglass and stainless steel pieces, each measuring more than two metres tall, will certainly tower over people, just as Christ and the two thieves did on Calvary. “It’s an image people have become blase about,” says Brown. “We pretend to look at paintings of the crucifixion, but we don’t take on board what’s there. That’s how we cope.” But why does he, as an atheist, care? “I live in a society that is predominantly Christian and we have so-called Christian values – if you believe Theresa May. It’s what surrounded me when I was growing up. A more horrible way of dying could not be imagined. It’s all about making death as slow and painful as possible – and public. Then people sit before a crucifixion and say, ‘Oh, that’s nice, isn’t it?’” Nobody will call Ain’t No Flies on the Lamb of God nice. Brown’s three figures are based on paintings of feet by German artist Georg Baselitz. “When you see them in the flesh, you realise they’re Christ’s tortured feet and there’s not much left of the toes – they’re decomposing.” Brown mutated Baselitz’s paintings into sculpture then painted the results, with colours Degas used to depict ballerinas. Why? “There’s an unpleasant note to Degas’ use of colour which is fascinating. When he uses pinks and greens and blues together, there’s something unnerving about it.” Brown thinks this is fitting because Degas’ dancers might be thought of as torture victims. “The pain that these girls had to suffer to dance en pointe would have been awful.” Much of Brown’s art is like this: mashups of works repurposed so cunningly and emotively that one can scarcely spot what he has appropriated. He often uses Photoshop to distort, invert, overlay and change the colour of images of past works, before creating new pieces from them in paint or pencil. He then puts them in lovely old frames. In the past, he has referred to himself as Dr Frankenstein, an artist who constructs paintings out of the “dead parts of other’s work” to bring “a sense of strangeness” to their depictions of the world. But today, Brown compares what he does with music. “What I’m doing in many ways is cover versions,” he says showing me around the sculptures, etchings, drawings and paintings in Come to Dust, his new show opening this week at London’s Gagosian gallery. “Though I’m using borrowed images, I’m putting them together in ways you’ve never seen before.” Like some musicians, Brown has got in trouble over allegations of plagiarism. In 2000, he was sued over Anthony Roberts’ cover illustration for Robert A Heinlein’s sci-fi novel Double Star. The case was settled out of court. While the threat of legal action doubtless haunts Brown, he’s convinced originality in art is a myth.At Goldsmith’s college in London in the late 80s, like many of his fellow students including Damien Hirst, he fell under the influence of Michael Craig-Martin, the charismatic teacher who became known as the godfather of Young British Artists. “Painting wasn’t taught,” he says. “Philosophy was taught. I realised you couldn’t do anything original – because if you did something that had not been done before, it would not be understandable.” Abandoning the idea of originality made art seem more fun and flexible. “It becomes a celebration, but not of the individual artist.” Like other YBAs, he lived in London under Thatcherism and his work took on a political resonance. “A lot of us were living in Shoreditch. On the other side of it was the City, which was the loadsamoney, never had it so good, philosophy. We were reacting to Thatcherism and saying there’s a dark side to all this, an underbelly.” The dark side remains in Brown’s work. The first thing I notice in his London studio is how many figures he’s decapitated. His idea of the macabre, born in the Thatcher years, endures. One painting called Passchendaele (several works are named after first world war battles) looks like the rendering of a strutting Delacroix male nude minus a head. Another, of a woman with her naked back turned to us, is called On the Way to the Leisure Centre (his titles are often droll and this one quotes from his friend the poet Lavinia Greenlaw). The woman’s head is shrunk to negligible portions. “I’m not sure why there’s so much headlessness,” he laughs. “I suppose I thought it was rather interesting that men should like the image of a woman without a head as a way of having the most perfect woman. It’s a form of misogyny, of course.” It’s also repulsive. “Why shouldn’t art be repulsive?” Brown retorts. “In literature, film and music, there’s an awful lot to repel you and to challenge you. And then you get beyond that sense of revulsion and you fall in love with something that previously you didn’t think was lovable at all.” But there’s more to this show than torture and dismemberment. There’s also the carnivalesque. “From the start,” he says, “I wanted to make great ideas that were operatic.” And a negative review by the Guardian’s Jonathan Jones helped. “In 2000, I did a show and he wrote that I was holding something back. He said, ‘There needs to be a larger Glenn.’ And he was right. So I became more, in the word he used in the review, carnivalesque.” Which explains one work looming over us, a grisaille called Let’s Make Love and Listen to Death from Above (a title pinched from a song by Brazilian electropop band CSS). The painting looks to me like a giddy, twisted take on Rubens’ Fall of Phaeton: a swirling, cloudy skyscape teeming with writhing, heavenly figures. A bit grey but definitely carnivalesque. Above all, the show celebrates Brown’s seduction by painting and drawing. Even though his brushstrokes and pencil lines are ironic appropriations, and his every painterly gesture comes with quotation marks, they betray his love of the original works, from Rembrandtto Boucher, Bloemaert to Goltzius. “I fell completely in love with drawing again about four years ago. I love the delicate intimate movement of the hand as it draws a line. With Goltzius, for instance, you get this thrill of delicacy. Drawing has a freshness and passion painting often doesn’t.” Does he never yearn to depict something on a blank canvas, to be free of all that history? “I don’t want to be free, no,” he says. “Even if I was sitting in a field painting flowers, Monet, Renoir or Fantin Latour would be influencing me. We trawl art history around with us whether we like it or not. There’s no escape – but it’s not really a prison.” Come to Dust is at Gagosian, London, 24 January to 17 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/21/a-passage-to-india-review-forster-caustic-colonialism-caricature-simple8","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T07:00:14Z","webTitle":"A Passage to India review – committed but stilted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/21/a-passage-to-india-review-forster-caustic-colonialism-caricature-simple8","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/21/a-passage-to-india-review-forster-caustic-colonialism-caricature-simple8","fields":{"headline":"A Passage to India review – committed but stilted","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"EM Forster’s 1924 novel explores complex relations among and between Britons and Indians in India before the first world war; his authorial voice takes the reader into the minds of characters male and female; Christian, Hindu, Muslim and atheist. Forster’s ironic - even caustic - presentation of the British occupation of India chimes with today’s anticolonial spirit. His imagining of Indian characters and interactions, however, although intended to be sympathetic, now appears Orientalist and othering. Simon Dormandy’s adaptation intensifies Forster’s critique of the British (characters are simplified into stilted posturings). It also reduces the complexity of the Indian characters and the number of scenes in which they feature - they become bit players whose function is to convey particular attitudes. Forster’s backgrounding to Dr Aziz’s behaviour and actions in the early scenes - when he interacts with visiting English ladies Mrs Moore and Miss Quested and with the resident schoolmaster, Fielding - is not communicated: the audience laughs as if he were a comic turn (no fault of actor Asif Khan’s delicate characterisation). A late scene, where the company impersonates worshippers at a religious celebration, comes across as cultural misappropriation.

It has called for the government to overhaul the oversight of academy chains after a string of high-profile failures. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, signalled to the the new education secretary, Damian Hinds, that the system of regulation had created overlaps and confusion, allowing some multi-academy trusts (Mats) to escape oversight. “We are particularly concerned by the extent to which failing trusts are stripping assets from their schools. It is not clear to us that all schools are benefiting from joining Mats, or that trusts are providing value for money,” Halfon said in a letter to Lord Agnew, the academies minister. Academies are state schools directly accountable to the Department for Education (DfE), rather than local authorities. The government has long claimed that converting schools into academies run by chains allows them greater freedom, but a series of failures such as that of the Wakefield City Academies Trust – which collapsed last year, giving up on the 21 schools it ran – has led to the policy being called into question. Wakefield has been accused of asset stripping after transferring millions of pounds of reserves of its schools into its own accounts before collapsing. “It seems to us that parents, staff and students are in the dark over who is running their schools and the decisions are being taken behind closed doors,” Halfon said. “Parents seemed to be the last people to know about the imminent collapse of Wakefield City Academies Trust, for example, and parents were the last to know about re-brokering or preferred sponsors for a school in other cases.” Halfon’s committee also argued that the lack of transparency was evident in the overlap in roles between the DfE’s regional agents, Ofsted and the Education and Skills Funding Agency. This overlapwas “a major cause of confusion”. To solve the problem the committee said the DfE’s regional schools commissioners – who are supposed to oversee academies in eight regions of England – should be more transparent and publish scorecards on Mats which combinied financial data and performance indicators in a way that is accessible to parents. More than half of all secondary schools in England are now run as as academies, as well as more than a fifth of primary schools. In a further letter to Hinds, Halfon asked for a statement from the DfE oabout the plight of schools affected by the collapse of infrastructure group Carillion this week. “Given the scale and nature of the services provided by Carillion to almost 900 schools and colleges, it is essential that the impacts of the firm’s collapse are understood and steps taken to ensure the continuity of services such as school catering and facilities management across the country,” Halfon said Along with providing services to schools, Carillion also ran 1,400 apprenticeships."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/17/private-probation-companies-face-huge-losses-despite-342m-bailout","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T18:59:33Z","webTitle":"Private probation firms face huge losses despite £342m 'bailout'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/17/private-probation-companies-face-huge-losses-despite-342m-bailout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/17/private-probation-companies-face-huge-losses-despite-342m-bailout","fields":{"headline":"Private probation firms face huge losses despite £342m 'bailout'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Private probation companies responsible for supervising more than 200,000 offenders in England and Wales face total losses of more than £100m, even after a £342m “bailout” by the Ministry of Justice, MPs have been told. Ministry of Justice officials acknowledged on Wednesday that 14 of the 21 community rehabilitation companies were expected to make losses ranging from £2.3m to £43m by 2021-22, partly due to a sharp fall in the number of offenders being sentenced to community punishments. Details of the state of the part-privatisation of the probation service – introduced by Chris Grayling when he was justice secretary in 2015 – were revealed during a Commons public accounts committee session. MoJ officials declined to comment on whether outsourcing was “an appropriate model” for probation services when pressed by Labour MPs, saying that it was a political question. During the hearing, Richard Heaton, the MoJ’s permanent secretary, sought to reassure MPs that maintenance contracts for 50 public sector prisons that have been held by the failed outsourcing company Carillion would continue uninterrupted, with state prison staff ready to fill any gaps. Senior MoJ officials even suggested that repairs and maintenance at some jails could improve as a result of a more direct management relationship. However, they refused to speculate on the position of a second major outsourcing company, Interserve, which is the largest probation provider, with five companies supervising 40,000 offenders in Manchester, Liverpool, Humberside and Hampshire. They said that they had an “open book relationship” with the company, with access to their internal figures, as well as external auditors taking an interest. Michael Spurr, the chief executive of Her Majesty’s Prisons and Probation Service, told MPs that the future of the private probation companies would be clearer after talks at the end of this month when new figures on reoffending rates were published. The income of companies is split between fixed-fee payments for supervising offenders on community punishments, and payments-by-results for rehabilitation work with offenders, including 40,000 short-term prisoners upon release. It is possible the companies could receive extra payments-by-results of between £32m and £128m up until 2021-22 for cutting reoffending rates. Spurr said talks would be held with the companies and then ministers on what further steps might be taken depending on the reoffending data. A National Audit Office report said initial figures showed that the number of further offences committed was actually rising, which could affect the future income of the companies. Spurr confirmed to MPs that talks were also being held about whether the probation companies could be given extra work. He refused to accept that the MoJ had been engaged in a “bailout” of the private probation companies, saying the £342m in additional fees and projected payments up until 2021-22 amounted to “windfall savings that had been put back into the contract”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2018/jan/22/inequality-gap-widens-as-42-people-hold-same-wealth-as-37bn-poorest","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T00:01:34Z","webTitle":"Inequality gap widens as 42 people hold same wealth as 3.7bn poorest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jan/22/inequality-gap-widens-as-42-people-hold-same-wealth-as-37bn-poorest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2018/jan/22/inequality-gap-widens-as-42-people-hold-same-wealth-as-37bn-poorest","fields":{"headline":"Inequality gap widens as 42 people hold same wealth as 3.7bn poorest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The development charity Oxfam has called for action to tackle the growing gap between rich and poor as it launched a new report showing that 42 people hold as much wealth as the 3.7 billion who make up the poorest half of the world’s population. In a report published on Monday to coincide with the gathering of some of the world’s richest people at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Oxfam said billionaires had been created at a record rate of one every two days over the past 12 months, at a time when the bottom 50% of the world’s population had seen no increase in wealth. It added that 82% of the global wealth generated in 2017 went to the most wealthy 1%. The charity said it was “unacceptable and unsustainable” for a tiny minority to accumulate so much wealth while hundreds of millions of people struggled on poverty pay. It called on world leaders to turn rhetoric about inequality into policies to tackle tax evasion and boost the pay of workers. Mark Goldring, Oxfam GB chief executive, said: “The concentration of extreme wealth at the top is not a sign of a thriving economy, but a symptom of a system that is failing the millions of hardworking people on poverty wages who make our clothes and grow our food.” Booming global stock markets have been the main reason for the increase in wealth of those holding financial assets during 2017. The founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, saw his wealth rise by $6bn (£4.3bn) in the first 10 days of 2017 as a result of a bull market on Wall Street, making him the world’s richest man. Oxfam said it had made changes to its wealth calculations as a result of new data from the bank Credit Suisse. Under the revised figures, 42 people hold as much wealth as the 3.7 billion people who make up the poorer half of the world’s population, compared with 61 people last year and 380 in 2009. At the time of last year’s report, Oxfam said that eight billionaires held the same wealth as half the world’s population. The charity added that the wealth of billionaires had risen by 13% a year on average in the decade from 2006 to 2015, with the increase of $762bn (£550bn) in 2017 enough to end extreme poverty seven times over. It said nine out of 10 of the world’s 2,043 dollar billionaires were men. Goldring said: “For work to be a genuine route out of poverty we need to ensure that ordinary workers receive a living wage and can insist on decent conditions, and that women are not discriminated against. If that means less for the already wealthy then that is a price that we – and they – should be willing to pay.” An Oxfam survey of 70,000 people in 10 countries, including the UK, showed support for action to tackle inequality. Nearly two-thirds of people – 72% in the UK – said they want their government to urgently address the income gap between rich and poor in their country. In the UK, when asked what a typical British chief executive earned in comparison with an unskilled worker, people guessed 33 times as much. When asked what the ideal ratio should be, they said 7:1. Oxfam said that FTSE 100 bosses earned on average 120 times more than the average employee. Goldring said it was time to rethink a global economy in which there was excessive corporate influence on policymaking, erosion of workers’ rights and a relentless drive to minimise costs in order to maximise returns to investors. Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “Oxfam is promoting a race to the bottom. Richer people are already highly taxed people – reducing their wealth beyond a certain point won’t lead to redistribution, it will destroy it to the benefit of no one. Higher minimum wages would also likely lead to disappearing jobs, harming the very people Oxfam intend to help.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/21/coco-review-pixar","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T08:00:15Z","webTitle":"Coco review – in the name of the forefather","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/21/coco-review-pixar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/21/coco-review-pixar","fields":{"headline":"Coco review – in the name of the forefather","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"With its catchy, singalong soundtrack and feelgood family-values message, Pixar’s latest project is a glittering return to non-franchise form after 2015’s lacklustre The Good Dinosaur. Twelve-year-old Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) wants to be a musician, so it’s pity that in his family of enterprising shoemakers, music is banned. Family folklore has it that his great great-great-grandmother, Mamá Imelda, had her heart smashed to smithereens by a selfish guitarist who abandoned his family to pursue music and so not a semiquaver is to be played or listened to in the house. It wouldn’t be a Pixar film, though, if our pre-teen protagonist weren’t also a rule-breaking scamp, so against the strictest orders of his guitar-smashing granny (Renee Victor), he sets about entering the town’s annual Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead) talent show. Hypothesising that deceased pop star Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt) might in fact be related to him, Miguel sneaks into his tomb, borrows his guitar and finds himself transported to the Land of the Dead. With the help of a skinny, lolloping dog named Dante and a ragtag vagabond voiced by Gael García Bernal, Miguel must find his family (or, at least, the skeleton versions of them) and secure their blessing to return home. On the Día de Muertos, families honour their deceased loved ones, encouraging their spirits to cross over to and communicate with the corporeal world. The Land of the Dead is rendered here in exquisite neon detail, from a magnificent bridge of floating, orange marigold petals to the rainbow-bright spirit animals or alebrijes that flit about the city.

It’s a bit like using “gadzooks”, which is one of its approximate English equivalents. But today is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so here goes. The news that Emmanuel Macron is proposing to loan the Bayeux tapestry to Britain is étonnant, extraordinaire and incroyable. In fact, all one can say is … Monsieur le Président, saperlipopette! Well, actually, not quite all. “Thank you” follows very close behind. The Bayeux tapestry is an astonishingly direct and vivid depiction of a pivotal event in Anglo-French history. The story of Duke William’s successful invasion of England in 1066 is told with a clarity that crosses the centuries. Its historic importance is beyond measure and its survival something close to a miracle. Though Bayeux itself is not far away, too few people in this country have had the chance to see the tapestry close up, all 70 metres of it. Allowing it to travel here is a historic cultural gesture on a par with Egypt’s loan of the Tutankhamun treasures a generation ago. Let’s hope that serious thought goes into deciding where in this country it will be put on display, and what kind of reciprocal gesture Britain should make to France. Yet here we enter the world not of cultural exchanges but of soft-power politics. For Macron’s gesture is every bit as political as it is generous and neighbourly, coming as it has on the eve of an Anglo-French summit at Sandhurst army college, where Brexit and big defence issues are on the agenda. We must therefore ask ourselves the famous question that the great French diplomat Talleyrand, an Anglophile ambassador to London among much else, is said to have asked on hearing of the death of the Turkish ambassador: “I wonder what he meant by that.” It is tempting to imagine that, behind the goodwill and generosity, Macron means to make a hard political point about Brexit. The Bayeux tapestry, after all, depicts a brutal lesson whose metaphorical significance as a story of power politics is hard to miss. The English prince Harold forms an alliance with William of Normandy, then betrays his promise to allow William to succeed. William invades, Harold is killed, and William rules England in his place. It would be stretching a point to suppose that Macron sees himself as Emmanuel the Conqueror. In spite of his occasional kingly pretensions and personal sense of the importance of political leadership, Macron lives in the real world. But there are other lessons to be learned from the tapestry. One is that Saxon England was not immune to the rest of the world. Another is, bad things can happen if a nation does not keep its promises to its neighbours. A third is, England does not always win. These apply as much in 2018 as they did in 1066. Before he was president, Macron once said that, when he travels to London on the Eurostar and the City towers in the distance, he sees two things: tall, modern buildings, and French policy failure. That comment should not be misinterpreted. Macron is not a mercantilist. He doesn’t think that international economics is a zero-sum game, in which what is good for London is therefore bad for Paris. What it says to him is that France needs to change. Macron has been in power for only eight months – too soon to pass a verdict on the Macron project for France. It has many dimensions, including the re-energising of centrist politics, the marginalisation of the extremes of the right and the left, the loosening of the corporate state, the defence of liberal social values and the reassertion of the European Union as a social as well as an economic engine. That’s a big project. Macron is a man with a mission. In this context, Brexit is an unwelcome distraction for him. He does not want it to happen, and he has made clear that the door would remain open if Britain had a change of mind. But this is not in his or anyone else’s gift. He cannot spend time trying to stop Brexit, and he must proceed on the basis that it will happen. Brexit is both a threat and an opportunity for France. It removes from the EU a country that has often stood out against France’s strategic wish to use the EU to enhance its importance in the world, and to bind Germany in. But it also clearly gives embodiment to the once unthinkable possibility that nations can leave the EU and survive. Macron therefore comes to Sandhurst on Thursday for talks with Theresa May with a strong interest in binding Britain into as much of the continuing European project, and in cooperating with Britain on as many aspects of policy, as possible. Above all, he does not want Britain to head off into the freewheeling economic or international role that hardline Brexiters dream of. That’s not because it may succeed - it will not. But such an approach to Brexit might challenge the EU economically or weaken Europe in other ways, principally military ones. When he was still François Hollande’s economic minister in 2016, Macron threatened a tough line against Britain in the event of Brexit. France might abandon its migrant controls in Calais, he said. It might cut trade links rather than negotiate new ones. But Macron now needs to hug Britain close as it leaves the EU. It is in France’s interests for Britain to be bound into the single market and customs union as much as possible, so that jobs do not leak across the Channel in a deregulatory Britain. And it is in France’s interests for British defence clout to be locked into Europe’s needs too. Britain and France seem fated to be rivals as well as friends. That Sweet Enemy is the book title of one major history of the relationship. Best of Enemies is the title of another. Macron does not offer a special relationship, but he does offer one that works and makes sense. With a bit of luck, he may help to save us from ourselves over the delusions of hard Brexit and the “global” Britain fantasy. Any other way, as the Bayeux tapestry shows, and it could all end badly. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/18/from-mothers-ruin-to-modern-tipple-how-uk-rediscovered-gin","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T05:24:06Z","webTitle":"From mother's ruin to modern tipple: how the UK rediscovered gin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/from-mothers-ruin-to-modern-tipple-how-uk-rediscovered-gin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/18/from-mothers-ruin-to-modern-tipple-how-uk-rediscovered-gin","fields":{"headline":"From mother's ruin to modern tipple: how the UK rediscovered gin","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Gin parties, gin menus, ginvent calendars and even a Ginstitute hotel: the UK’s renewed passion for all things gin is fast creating a whole new industry. There are 315 distilleries in Britain – more than double the number operating five years ago. According to figures collected by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, which hands out licences to produce spirits, nearly 50 opened last year, while just a handful shut up shop. Demand for interesting gins, made by small scale craft and artisan producers has driven a near-20% rise in the total amount of the juniper-flavoured spirit sold. A total of 47m bottles worth £1.2bn were served up last year – enough, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA), for 1.32bn gin and tonics. Such is its popularity that last year the Office for National Staistics put gin in the basket of goods it monitors to measure inflation. The craze has even reached BBC Radio 4’s series The Archers, where Toby Fairbrother is now producing Scruff Gin, flavoured with his own mix of botanicals. Then there is the UK’s first gin spa, where visitors can indulge in a juniper foot soak and a gin tasting menu. Trendy “ginsters” quaff from balloon glasses and increasingly prefer a sprig of rosemary or a handful of red berries to the traditional ice and slice. Waitrose’s spirits buyer, John Vine, said local and regional sales were driving the trend, rather than the international brands. Sales of artisan brands at the grocer are up 167%, compared with a 30% rise in mass-produced brands. “The rise in craft gin is certainly shows no sign of slowing,” Vine said. “To meet demand, this week, we have introduced three new local and regional craft gins.” The craft spirit boom follows a surge in demand for locally made small scale beers and wines, as the hipster generation seeks drinks with a more interesting taste created by individuals rather than faceless international corporations. Large drinks companies are battling to keep up and have started buying up smaller brands around the world. The London gin maker Sipsmith has been swallowed up by Beam Suntory, the world’s third-largest spirits company, while Pernod Ricard has bought out craft gin brand Monkey 47. Miles Beale, chief executive of the WSTA, said the number of new distilleries showed there was no sign that the trend was coming to an end. “It wasn’t that many years ago when a pub would stock one gin brand, and now a gin menu offering a range of gins and mixers is commonplace in pubs and bars,” he said. “It is welcome news that another 49 new distilleries opened in the UK last year, bringing new jobs to the British spirit industry and helping boost Britain’s export potential.” Exports totalled 180m bottles last year, worth £474m. Beale said distilleries in the UK were diversifying and new whiskies, vodkas, rums, brandies and liqueurs were appearing every year. Sainsbury’s spirits buyer, Anne Cooper, said craft gin sales were up 20% year on year, and predicted that craft rum would be this year’s new trend. “It’s gin that has dominated the craft spirits movement until now but we’re seeing a similar trend starting to emerge in rum, particularly dark and spiced variations. I’d expect to see a lot more of this as we head into the spring and summer of 2018,” she said. Vine said Waitrose would also expand its craft spirits range: “We don’t stock an English whisky yet, but based on the success of gin, we will be looking into other types of locally made spirits this year.” At least 19 distilleries in England and more in Wales are making or planning to make whisky in the coming years. Many of these have started producing gin because it can be made more quickly using the same equipment. Whisky must be aged in wooden casks for several years before itis bottled, so gin can provide income to keep a business going in the interim. Cooper King Distillery, near York, is expected to begin production of gin in the next few months, followed by a whisky in 2022. Its founders, Chris Jaume and Abbie Neilson, were inspired to set up their business after visiting Tasmania where local whisky Sullivan’s Cove was named the best single malt in the world in 2014. “It opened our eyes that whisky could be made in other countries than Scotland and Japan,” Jaume said. “The UK is dominated by scotch, but we are beginning to hear of people being disenchanted by a product made in such huge volumes. To some extent it has lost its romance.” While there are plenty of small Scottish distilleries alongside the big names, Jaume said English whisky makers had more freedom to experiment as, for example, they can age their whisky in walnut or cherry wood casks. In Scotland all whisky has to be aged in oak. Jaume likened the rise of small distilleries to the craft beer boom. “People are looking for a really great product and a really great experience. It’s more expensive but people are willing to pay more if it tastes better and has got a story behind it,” he said. Gin boom When the great gin boom began back in 2009 with the launch of Sipsmith, few thought that the category would still be expanding nearly 10 years later.Yet gin has overtaken vodka to become the most popular spirit in Britain, according to a recent YouGov poll. The public appetite for the stuff shows no signs of abating. One of the mothers at my daughter’s school put on a gin festival last year. It proved so popular she’s looking for a bigger venue this year. There are distilleries opening every month but, more importantly, most of the old ones are staying open. Here are three new brands that stand out from the crowd: Toad Gin (£38.95) The vast majority of gins are made from bought-in neutral grain alcohol. Nothing wrong with that, but The Oxford Artisan Distillery (Toad) do things a bit differently by making their own high strength alcohol from ancient grains grown within 50 miles of the distillery. The result which was launched last year is a very classic juniper led gin. Foxhole Gin (£39.95) Made in conjunction with the Bolney Wine Estate in Sussex using a spirit distilled from the leftovers from their harvest, which gives this gin a distinctive grapey, grassy taste but doesn’t overpower the more traditional botanicals. It does marvellous things with vermouth making it perhaps the ultimate dry martini gin. Hibernation Gin (£42.95) From Dyfi in Wales, this is another gin that makes full use of the local flora. It’s flavoured with crab apples and blackberries as well as juniper for a refreshing fruity tang and then aged to a creamy consistency in old white port casks, like a good whisky. It might be too good to mix with tonic.

Altior was already odds-on for the Champion Chase in March with many bookmakers when it emerged on 15 December that the eight-year-old had “made a noise” at exercise four days earlier. Following an operation to address “a small issue whereby his larynx was not opening sufficiently”, Henderson admitted facing a race against time to get Altior, who has not raced since 29 April, fit in time for the Cheltenham Festival. “He’ll be stepping up this weekend to the point I will nearly know if I’m hearing what I heard that time,” Henderson said. “He’d never made a noise before and he wouldn’t be making a noise where he is now [in his preparation] but I’m nearly getting to the point where he was.” Depending on Altior’s progress over the next fortnight, it is still possible he could have a prep-run for Cheltenham in Newbury’s Game Spirit Chase on 10 February. Even if he is not competing, a big crowd on Betfair day here should still catch sight of Altior at some stage. “Whatever happens, if he’s not quite ready for the Game Spirit I’d be asking Richard [Osgood, Newbury’s clerk of the course] if he could come and have a gallop,” Henderson said. “He’ll probably need two racecourse gallops and that would be the perfect timing for the first one.” Henderson was speaking after saddling a one-two at Newbury,, as the 7-4 chance Whatswrongwithou beat the odds‑on favourite Ok Corral. Both horses could have entries in the Supreme Novice Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival, while Henderson also hopes to extend a rich vein of form when the novice Brain Power lines up against Un De Sceaux in the Grade One Clarence House Chase at Ascot on Saturday. “It’s probably a mad thing to do,” Henderson said, “but I want to get into a race where they will go a good gallop, and the one guarantee is that you’re going to go a good gallop with Un De Sceaux around. That was my rather un-Henderson-like logic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/24/the-two-pizza-rule-and-the-secret-of-amazons-success","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T15:32:36Z","webTitle":"The two-pizza rule and the secret of Amazon's success","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/24/the-two-pizza-rule-and-the-secret-of-amazons-success","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/24/the-two-pizza-rule-and-the-secret-of-amazons-success","fields":{"headline":"The two-pizza rule and the secret of Amazon's success","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the early days of Amazon, Jeff Bezos instituted a rule: every internal team should be small enough that it can be fed with two pizzas. The goal wasn’t to cut down on the catering bill. It was, like almost everything Amazon does, focused on two aims: efficiency and scalability. The former is obvious. A smaller team spends less time managing timetables and keeping people up to date, and more time doing what needs to be done. But it’s the latter that really matters for Amazon. The thing about having lots of small teams is that they all need to be able to work together, and to be able to access the common resources of the company, in order to achieve their larger goals. That’s what turns the company into, in the words of Benedict Evans, of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, “a machine that makes the machine”. “You can add new product lines without adding new internal structure or direct reports, and you can add them without meetings and projects and process in the logistics and e-commerce platforms,” Evans notes. “You don’t need to fly to Seattle and schedule a bunch of meetings to get people to implement support for launching makeup in Italy, or persuade anyone to add things to their roadmap.” Amazon is good at being an e-commerce company that sells things, but what it’s great at is making new e-commerce companies that sell new things. The company calls this approach its “flywheel”: it takes the scale that can smother a typical multinational, and uses it to provide an ever-increasing momentum backing up its entire business. The faster the flywheel spins, and the heavier it is, the harder it is for anyone else to stop it. Perhaps the best example of that approach in action is the birth and growth of AWS (previously called Amazon Web Services). That’s the division of Amazon that provides cloud computing services, both internally and for other companies – including those that are competitors to Amazon in other areas (both Netflix and Tesco use the platform, for instance, despite Amazon also selling streaming video and groceries). It started, like so many things at Amazon, with an edict from the top. Every team, Bezos ordered, should begin to work with each other only in a structured, systematic way. If an advertising team needed some data on shoe sales to decide how best to spend their resources, they could not email analytics and ask for it; they needed to go to the analytics dashboard themselves and get it. If that dashboard didn’t exist, it needed to be created. And that approach needed to cover everything. From there, it was almost an afterthought to take the obvious next step, and let others use the same technology that Amazon made available internally. Those humble beginnings spawned a beast. The business is now 10% of Amazon’s overall revenue, making so much money that financial regulations forced the company to report it as a top-level division in its own right: Amazon divides its company into “US and Canada”, “International”, and “AWS”. AWS is large enough that it is dealt with on the same tier as the entire rest of the world. AWS is large enough that Netflix, a company that accounts for around a third of all internet traffic in North America, is just another customer. AWS is large enough that in 2016 the company released the “Snowmobile”, a literal truck for moving data. The companies that work with AWS move so much information around that sometimes the internet simply cannot cope. So now, if you want to upload a lot of data to Amazon’s cloud, the company will drive a truck to your office, fill it with data, then drive it back. If you need to upload 100 petabytes – that’s roughly 5m movies in 4k with surround sound – it turns out there’s no quicker way to do it than driving it down the freeway at 75mph. While AWS saw Amazon open up its internal technology to external customers, another part of the company does the same trick with Amazon’s actual website. Amazon Marketplace launched in 2000, allowing third-party sellers to put up their own wares on the site. The feature has expanded over the years to become a major plank in the company’s quest to be the “everything store” – the one destination on the internet you need to go to to buy anything in existence. Marketplace goes one better than the pizza rule, allowing Amazon to expand into new sectors without needing to employ a single extra employee. The variety of things sold on Amazon is now so huge that its internal computer scientists faced a problem. “E-commerce companies such as Amazon … process billions of orders every year,” a team of Amazon researchers wrote. “However, these orders represent only a small fraction of all plausible orders.” The solution? Train an artificial intelligence purely to generate plausible fake orders, to better guess how to market brand-new products. Amazon reports the revenue it makes from Marketplace as around 20% of the company’s total income. But that metric, which only counts the fees paid to the company by third-party sellers, understates the colossal scale of the business. “Marketplace is now around half of the total volume of goods sold through Amazon,” estimates Andreessen Horowitz’s Evans. “In other words, Marketplace means that Amazon handles (but does not, incidentally, itself set prices for) double the share of e-commerce that it reports as revenue.” Increasingly, then, Amazon resembles less a big-box retailer such as Tesco or Walmart, hovering at the edge of town sucking up commerce and killing the local high street, and more a shopping mall: independent retailers can exist, and even make a tidy living, but only if they get a slot in the mall itself – and if they always remember that the real moneymaker is the landlord. Since 2014, Amazon has added a third flywheel to its business: artificial intelligence. The company has always been near the leading edge of the industry, most obviously in its neural-network-powered recommendation algorithms. But, until recently, that approach was scattershot, segmented, and hardly world-class (think of the last time you bought something on Amazon only to have it recommended to you for weeks afterwards. “You like duvets? Why not buy 10 more?”). That changed when the company decided to build the hardware that would become the Echo. In classic Amazon fashion, it started at the end and worked backwards from there, writing a “press release” for the notional future product and then trying to figure out what expertise needed to be developed – or bought – to make it. Need a personal assistant? Buy Cambridge-based True Knowledge, once working on a Siri competitor, and you get Alexa. Require far-field voice recognition, letting you hear people on the other side of the room? Start working on that now, because no one’s really cracked the problem. Institutionally, the bulk of the Alexa AI team still sits under AWS, using its infrastructure and offering another tranche of digital services to third parties who want to build speech control into their devices. But the economies of scale that come to AI are unique. There’s the value to the data, of course: the more people use an Echo, the more speech samples it has to train with, and so the better the Echo becomes. And beyond that, machine learning technologies are so fundamental, and so general purpose, that every advancement Amazon makes ricochets throughout its business, increasing efficiency, opening up new fields, and suggesting further avenues of research. But nothing lasts forever, and even Amazon has its weak points. The two-pizza rule, for instance, may be a good strategy for building an infinitely expandable company, but it doesn’t lend itself to a pleasant, stress-free working environment. Amazon has long faced criticism over its treatment of warehouse workers: as with many companies in its sector, huge valuations and high-tech aspirations sit uneasily alongside the low-paid, low-skilled work that makes the company tick over. Where Amazon differs from companies such as Deliveroo, Apple and Facebook is that the highly skilled employees sitting in the headquarters have almost as many complaints. A New York Times exposé from 2015 described employees crying at their desks and suffering near-breakdowns from the pressure they were put under. Amazon denied a number of allegations made in the article. The company’s rapid employee turnover is legendary, with insiders describing a sort of Forth Bridge of technical debt: someone leaves, and someone else has to rewrite all their code to make it understandable to the people still there – but by the time the rewrite is finished, the person doing the rewriting has also left, requiring someone else to start the whole process again. But the one thing that’s been true from day one is that Jeff Bezos sits at the top of the food chain, with direct control of a $740bn (£530bn) business matched by few other bosses. It would take a bold gambler to bet against the company right now. • This article was amended on 26 April 2018 to make clear that Amazon denied allegations made about it in a New York Times piece."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/22/i-baked-fairy-cakes-and-it-dialled-down-the-horror-a-little","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"‘I baked fairy cakes and it dialled down the horror a little’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/22/i-baked-fairy-cakes-and-it-dialled-down-the-horror-a-little","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/22/i-baked-fairy-cakes-and-it-dialled-down-the-horror-a-little","fields":{"headline":"‘I baked fairy cakes and it dialled down the horror a little’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"She had a fever and her face was ashen. It was 4pm and although I was concerned, I gave her Calpol, nestled her by my side and read her a story. It was early February. I was certain it was a bad cold and that all would be well. What I didn’t realise was that my two-year-old daughter had an infection in her brain. By midnight, she was having a prolonged seizure and didn’t regain consciousness for six hours. The week that followed is ingrained in my memory. We watched her through each night as her fever raged, an IV needle in her tiny hand. Things looked grave. Her notes read “Encephalitis”. I was five months pregnant. It was a dark, harrowing time. There was no permanent damage to her brain. She recovered, but we were shaken. Then, seven months later, when my younger daughter was 11 weeks old, a close family member suffered a catastrophic brain injury. Memories from the six months that followed switch each of my neurons to horror mode. I played with a toddler while breastfeeding a tiny baby, simultaneously speaking to a consultant about the drugs required for enforced coma. We were told to prepare ourselves; that this person I loved would not survive. There was no visible structure left in her grey matter. We were told that we should grieve. Yet, she too survived. She woke up. She walked and spoke. The consultants could not fathom it. Life seemed utterly baffling and very, very fragile. Despite both family members surviving, I began to associate the colder months with wall-eyed terror and a maelstrom of cortisol. I had a sense that I should have felt grateful and elated for their survival. And I was, but the following autumn, as the leaves began to turn, I experienced what I now realise was a strong neurological reaction: a reliving of what had happened. I began to dream of menacing trees made of mangled limbs. I became severely depressed and cripplingly anxious. I had started a craft blog a few months earlier but didn’t write about how I was feeling. These were difficult subjects: the antithesis of the joy of a hand-knitted sock. I worried about alienating the small, but lovely community that had become a source of joy. I tried to continue to make things and blog about them, but was able to find neither words nor stitches. My blog stuttered, then fell silent. I am a biologist, an amateur botanist and a passionate nature-lover, yet I cowered indoors staring balefully at the grey skies through the window and longed for April. We live in a beautiful rural spot, but I didn’t go outside; I had no urge to do anything except care for my children and sleep. I had long used craft to relax after a day at the office and knew that if I did pick up pliers or yarn and crochet hook that I would feel a little better. In a desperate search for anything that might lift my mood, I began to make myself make things: I reached for my tiny daughters’ Plasticine and made an ammonite; I borrowed their poster paints and daubed a blackbird; I baked fairy cakes. It dialled down the horror a little, so I cast about for materials and made more things. I ventured into the wood behind our cottage and noticed birds and trees and seedheads. The sight of them lifted my mood a little and diverted my brain away from the horrific memories of loved ones being close to death. The following year, when I spotted the first leaves changing colour and I could feel my mood plummeting, I was terrified. I decided to try to fend it off. I was aware of seasonal affected disorder (Sad), knew that I had it and that its main cause was the decreased intensity of sunlight between November and March impacting serotonin levels in the brain, and that had been exacerbated by what had happened. I began a project on my blog encouraging readers to share the ways in which they made the grey days of November a little easier. I called it Making Winter. Suddenly, my feed was full of crochet, cakes, handmade socks, embroidery and knitted dogs. I became aware of many in this small community alone who were, in effect, self-medicating using craft, just as I was. Making was conferring a sense of achievement on dark, difficult days – but more than that, there is evidence that it confers a mental state similar to that induced by yoga or meditation, and can lift mood. Small, repetitive movements of hand and eye, such as those required to draw, paint, make crochet stitches or stir a cake mix, increase levels of serotonin and diminish cortisol. Indeed, there is a form of psychotherapy that harnesses the beneficial cognitive effects of the eye movements made during knitting in order to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Making seems to cause a shift in neurotransmitters that can bring calm and lift mood. The onset of the colder months has an effect on the energy levels and mood of about a third of the UK population. Many people experience mild symptoms and may simply feel a little sluggish or flat, but for about 7% of the population, the beginning of November can herald the onset of depression that can last until the sun’s intensity increases in spring. Getting outside for a walk in a green space most days will boost serotonin levels. And if that walk is combined with a creative activity, then the symptoms of winter blues can be assuaged further. I speak from experience. Both making with my hands and being outside were inducing more positive thoughts during the dark days of January and February, and the effect was cumulative. Each stitch or even the briefest walk in the woods behind our house was helping to mend my brain and lift my mood. And others, too, were joining in or starting their own projects, using creativity to alleviate stress and the symptons of depressions. Getting involved in craft or baking, knitting or painting and spending time outdoors can only help to improve our mental health – whatever the season.

Cheyenne Rose Antoine, 21, pleaded guilty this week to killing Brittney Gargol, who was found fatally injured on a road in the outskirts of the city in 2015. It was later determined that she had been strangled to death. A belt was found lying next to her body. Police later noticed that Antoine was wearing an identical belt in a selfie that had been snapped hours before Gargol was found. The small detail – barely noticeable in a photo that showed the close friends smiling as they stood side by side – turned Antoine into a key suspect in the case. Using the pair’s posts on social media, police were able to reconstruct a timeline of their night. “It’s quite remarkable how the police developed this information,” Robin Ritter, the crown prosecutor for the case told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. A tip ultimately led police to a witness who said that Antoine had confessed to the killing soon after it happened. The woman said Antoine had showed up at her house in hysterics. She confessed that the two had argued after going to a house party and that she had hit Gargol and strangled her. Antoine’s defence team told the court that the pair were drunk and high on marijuana when the argument took place. While she accepted responsibility for her friend’s death, Antoine did not remember killing her friend, her lawyer told the court. Antoine was initially charged with second-degree murder, but pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Her lawyer noted that Antoine had suffered years of physical and sexual abuse in the province’s foster care system. Antoine’s parents, both survivors of Canada’s residential school system, struggled with addictions issues. In a statement, Antoine said she remained deeply affected by what had happened. “I will never forgive myself. Nothing I say or do will ever bring her back.

John believed passionately that further education provided a key means of mitigating inequality. He worked tirelessly to champion the sector, in which many working-class students obtain qualifications, both vocational and academic. John was born in Saltaire, West Yorkshire, the son of John (Jack), a chief officer in local government, and Sarah (nee Mclellan). John attended 10 schools, the last of which was Baines grammar, Blackpool. In 1964 he went to Lancaster University to take a BA in international history and politics. We met in 1967, when he was studying for an MA in international politics, also at Lancaster. He was an enthusiastic internationalist, a lifelong Liberal and a great believer in the application of liberal values in all social contexts. In 1969 John was appointed a part-time lecturer at Lancaster and Morecambe College of Further Education. He then became a local government training officer, working in the London boroughs of Camden and Lewisham (1971-73). He spent three years at Middlesex Polytechnic (now University) as a senior lecturer in local government studies. In 1976 he became head of business studies at Barnfield College, Luton, moving to the role of head of the faculty of business studies at Luton College of Higher Education (now the University of Bedfordshire) in 1979. In 1981 he became vice-principal, and in 1985 principal, of Barnet College. Following his retirement in 2003, he embarked on a new venture, training to become a magistrate, a role he undertook for 10 years. He was also active in his local community, as governor of a local comprehensive school for 26 years, and involved with local patient participation groups. John was a man of phenomenal energy. Alongside his work and other professional and community activities, he played cricket, football, tennis and golf; he loved travelling and had friends and colleagues in the US, Australia and across Europe; he was a keen fell walker in the Lake District and an enthusiast for real ale, pubs and good food.

That’s the takeaway from those who say the sport’s governing body is “arrogant” and ignoring the country’s ever-growing Hispanic population. González, an 18-year-old American-born midfielder who never quite fit the US youth system, dreamed of playing for the US. The feeling wasn’t mutual. He wasn’t included in an experimental US squad that faced Portugal in a friendly last November – the Americans’ first run out since their World Cup qualification failure – nor the current national team winter camp. No big deal, maybe. Except in Mexico, González is considered an exceptional talent. The backstory reads like a love-gone-wrong romance novel. He appeared for US youth teams but was hardly a central cog. He did, however, stand out at the 2013 Sueno Alianza, a free-to-enter talent contest pitched at Hispanic players in the US that is heavily scouted by Liga MX clubs. While US Soccer remained unconvinced of his quality, González received offers from 13 Liga MX teams after his Sueno performances. He signed with Monterrey where he climbed the youth ladder and made his senior first team debut in July last year alongside veteran internationals from Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay and Colombia. It got better. Monterrey finished Liga MX runners-up last season, the kid from California was named to the league’s Best XI – and the US had a new star. Except January kicked off with González, who says he only spoke “so-so” Spanish when he arrived at Monterrey, saying he wanted to represent his parents’ birthplace – Mexico – in international soccer (this is not a decision motivated by a chance to go to the World Cup this summer: Gonzalez is unlikely to win a starting spot). “Jonathan wanted to continue playing for the US until the day before he chose Mexico,” says Brad Rothenberg, founder of Sueno Alianza. “His heart was in the United States. He grew up here. He’s American. I’m angry that we have an arrogant approach to Hispanic players and it was reflected by [US Soccer youth coach] Tab Ramos who said ‘If you want to play for the United States, it has to be in your heart’. What Mexico did was convince the kid by appealing to him directly.” Mexico’s bid to woo González was led by face-to-face conversations with technical director Dennis Te Kloese and phone calls from national team coach Juan Carlos Osorio. The US? Not so much. According to Rothenberg – whose father Alan was President of US Soccer from 1990 to 1998, Chairman of the 1994 World Cup Organizing Committee, and a major force in founding Major League Soccer – the González experience is evidence of a bigger issue: US Soccer systemically ignores Hispanic talent in favor of a Eurocentric outlook. “We all still have our our biases and preferences and the majority of the people who run the federation at the top and all the way down to the local level in each state are disproportionally Eurocentric and Anglo,” Rothenberg says. “Until we expand the definition of what great play looks like we are not going to be able to have the experts to find these kids in the Latino community or other minorities like African American communities. There are just not enough coaches or administrators who have enough appreciation for that.” Rothenberg’s view is backed by former USA international Herculez Gomez, a member of the USA’s 2010 World Cup roster and history-maker for winning MLS Cup with Los Angeles Galaxy in 2005 and Seattle Sounders in 2016 and a Primera Division championship with Santos Laguna in 2012. “It’s not that the US lost Jonathan González, it’s that a player like Jonathan González had to look elsewhere for opportunities,” says Gomez. “He was discovered by [former US youth coach] Hugo Perez but there are not enough coaches like Perez who think outside the box. We have been conditioned to believe that proper football is British and that proper football commentary is British. But this is not the world we live in. There are different worlds.” Rothenberg claims the USSF has failed to meet the needs of a growing Hispanic population across the US. The 2010 US census found the country has a Hispanic or Latino population of around 50.5 million people – around 16% of the total population - with approximately 60% of that number claiming Mexican ancestry. Those figures were almost double the 2000 census numbers. “For years [USSF] moved forward as an Anglo organization because that was the bulk of the participation base,” Rothenberg says. “It was highly Eurocentric and Anglo. Since the mid-1980s we had a huge influx of Latinos, they have become citizens, it has changed the country, and US Soccer hasn’t adapted.” That failure to adapt, according to critics, includes fueling a talent pipeline from middle class suburbs at the expense of less-wealthy inner-cities and minorities. Rather than participate in expensive pay-to-play academies, kids outside suburbia play for high schools and in church or other independent leagues that fall outside established US Soccer pathways. “We are very much a suburban sport,” says Gomez, who grew up in Las Vegas. “The reach is not long enough. A lot of these [talented] players are not in the same system. US Soccer needs to get into the communities. This is not just about Hispanic or Latin American players. It is about African American players. It is about minorities.” An irony is that while soccer in America is growing – especially thanks to the Hispanic market – that doesn’t necessarily translate to a connection with American soccer. The sport can eat itself. While Hispanic youth player development appears to be a challenge for US Soccer, Soccer United Marketing – a company owned by Major League Soccer – has tapped into the commercial benefits of the Hispanic market and owns the US marketing rights to the Mexico national team. SUM includes USSF president Sunil Gulati on its board and its president is Kathy Carter, a candidate to replace Gulati as US Soccer boss in an election this February. SUM profits when Mexico’s national team is promoted in the US. “Part of the problem is that these [Mexican-American] kids don’t give a crap about US Soccer,” says Rothenberg. “US Soccer should be going deep into these communities to show these kids that US Soccer cares about them. End the arrogance. US Soccer thinks these kids should come to them because the US is in their heart but it is a two-way street.” The battle for young hearts and minds is also influenced by Mexican soccer’s presence on US television. Te Kloese, who played a key role in luring Jonathan Gonzalez south of the border, says playing for a Liga MX team is a dream for many American kids. “The Mexican league is one of the most popular on TV and big on the internet and social networks,” he says. “For a lot of [American] kids, Mexican clubs are aspirational.” Te Kloese says Liga MX clubs aggressively scout in the US. Mexican-American communities can be talent mines. From his home in Mexico City, Te Kloese sees geography as one of the big challenges for US Soccer – the country’s huge size and population is underserved by professional teams and professional academies. “The United States is so big and the distances from where you live to where there might be a professional academy makes it hard to draw the best talent to the academies,” he says. “They are working hard but the youth football structure with independent leagues, one thinking one direction and another thinking another direction, makes it hard for people to put their finger on exactly where to develop and where to put money. “You have well organized [youth] clubs but you have to pay a lot of money for that and then there is an option to play in high school and in college which has a whole different approach. Then they have the MLS academies to groom players to a professional league and then there are all sorts of different professional leagues. “It is quite a challenge for the people who are in charge of youth development to unite all these aspects. There are so many different opinions and politics and interests in American soccer that it is difficult to get everyone on the same page.” Herculez Gomez agrees: “This is a big country,” he says. “There are 50 states but there aren’t 50 MLS clubs and there are not 50 MLS academies.” For Te Kloese, the combination of US dysfunction and talented dual citizens is an advantage other countries can exploit – especially if Hispanic players are shunned by the US system. Gonzalez will not be the last player to cross the border. “Cases like Jonathan have existed both on the women’s side and the men’s side,” Te Kloese says. “You can’t walk away from the fact that there are so many Mexicans living in the United States and there is an opportunity to represent both countries. It is also a unique case with the United States where there are so many people of a certain nationality that have two options to choose. I don’t think anywhere else in the world there is a similar option.” Rothenberg says Sueno Alianza would be out of business if US Soccer was doing a better job in engaging Hispanic players. He adds that if US youth teams were performing consistently at the highest level, Gonzalez’s decision to play for Mexico may not have been an issue. And if the US had qualified for this year’s World Cup, Christian Pulisic would be the talk and not a kid from California who could be on a plane to Moscow – with Mexico. “US Soccer never saw him play enough,” says Rothenberg of Gonzalez. “We thought it was sufficient to have Tab Ramos text message him. That wasn’t enough.” US Soccer did not respond to multiple requests to comment for this story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/18/carillion-taskforce-to-discuss-how-to-prevent-domino-effect-on-uk-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T16:09:46Z","webTitle":"Banks extend £225m lifeline to Carillion subcontractors as firms offer jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/carillion-taskforce-to-discuss-how-to-prevent-domino-effect-on-uk-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/18/carillion-taskforce-to-discuss-how-to-prevent-domino-effect-on-uk-economy","fields":{"headline":"Banks extend £225m lifeline to Carillion subcontractors as firms offer jobs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"High street banks have made more than £225m available to help businesses put at risk by the failure of Carillion, while companies have offered to take on staff who were working for the firm when it collapsed into receivership.

Greg Clark convened the meeting amid pressure from trade unions to ensure that the business world helps limit job losses among former Carillion staff and employees in its supply chain. As the meeting broke up, banks announced more than £225m worth of emergency support to help small business customers ride out the crisis, including waivers on overdraft fees and loan repayment holidays. Clark, who urged banks to provide support at a separate meeting held on Wednesday, said: “I welcome this quick and positive move by banks including Lloyds, HSBC and RBS. This follows my meeting with the banks yesterday where I challenged them to see what further support they could provide for SMEs affected by Carillion’s insolvency. “It is essential that small businesses exposed are given the support they need by their lenders, and I look forward to other banks following suit.” The lifeline comes after several of Carillion’s subcontractors began laying off staff, sparking fears for the survival of some of its estimated 30,000 suppliers, owed hundreds of millions of pounds between them. Lloyds Banking Group, which was bailed out with £20bn of taxpayers’ money during the financial crisis, moved first to set up a £50m emergency fund to help affected businesses. Royal Bank of Scotland, which required a £45.5bn bailout during the crash, offered £75m, while HSBC outgunned both with a £100m fund. Santander UK also offered support but did not place a value on it, while a Barclays spokesperson said the bank would “look at” increasing overdrafts, reducing loan repayments and helping firms with cashflow problems. Former clients of Carillion have also moved to take on some of its staff who were employed on contracts to provide services such as cleaning, catering and maintenance. British Gas owner Centrica, and Nationwide building society vowed to ensure former Carillion employees would continue to be paid or in some cases employed directly. Meanwhile, banks and businesses took part in a meeting at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to discuss ways to contain the fallout from Carillion. A BEIS spokesperson said: “We have created a taskforce to continue to support and monitor the impact on small businesses and employees who have been affected by Carillion’s insolvency. “The taskforce will comprise representatives from business, construction trade associations, the trade unions, lenders and government.” The Trades Union Congress, which has pushed for a crisis coalition of businesses and trade unions to deal with the Carillion fallout, said its general secretary, Frances O’Grady, would present demands designed to protect workers. These will include: measures to transfer Carillion staff to new employers and protect their pay; bringing public sector contracts back under government control; a risk assessment of other large outsourcing firms and a moratorium on awarding further public service contracts to rival companies. O’Grady said: “We are pleased the government has agreed to union calls for a national taskforce to deal with the collapse of Carillion. “Time is of the essence in dealing with this crisis. We need urgent action to protect jobs, pay and pensions. This cannot be a talking shop.” As the government stepped up efforts to limit the impact of Carillion’s collapse, several of the firm’s former clients said they would ensure staff continue to be paid. Nationwide said it would directly employ 250 people who had been working for the company on a contract held by Carillion. A further 1,500 staff who were working for third-party subcontractors will now be contracted to Nationwide. “Our contractors perform a vital and valued role for the society. During an unsettling time for Carillion employees we felt it was important to provide them with some reassurances,” said a spokesperson. Centrica said it would make funds available to the government’s Insolvency Service to ensure that 480 staff who helped manage facilities at its buildings would continue to be paid. National Grid, which used Carillion staff on its infrastructure programme, said work would continue on an overhead line between Richborough and Canterbury, which is designed to connect a Belgium-UK power cable to the grid, and a power cable at Wylfa in Wales for the planned new nuclear power station there. A spokesperson said: “National Grid has contingency plans in place for all its projects with Carillion, using alternative suppliers if necessary. We believe that these plans mean we will be able to keep any disruption to a minimum.” The company did not say whether it would take on any Carillion staff or whether it had provided funding to ensure they continue to be paid. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/24/vets-now-fees-out-of-hours-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-24T07:00:23Z","webTitle":"Vet fees: beware of out-of-hours charges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/24/vets-now-fees-out-of-hours-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/24/vets-now-fees-out-of-hours-bills","fields":{"headline":"Vet fees: beware of out-of-hours charges","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I wanted to alert readers to what is becoming a serious issue for pet owners: if your pet suffers a medical emergency at night, or on a weekend, you will need your vet’s “out-of-hours” service. In the last couple of years this has taken on a totally new dimension, leaving owners with massive bills. Many local vets are deciding that the extra costs of running an out-of-hours service are too high, so they are buying in the services of a company called Vets Now. Basically, it pays the local practice to take over its premises for the weekend. When you call, they tell you there is an “out-of-hours fee” of over £100, which is fair enough. But this is just the start. My cat had to go in on a Saturday with sickness and diarrhoea. I was told this might entail a couple of overnight stays and was quoted more than £1,800. After a discussion, some items were removed and we got down to £1,482. I had no option, as all other vets in town were also with Vets Now. In the end, my cat only stayed 24 hours but this still cost me £742 on a bill which looks as if it is being made up as it goes along. CA, Tunbridge Wells, Kent Mainly because of the enormous fees, 48% of reviews on Trustpilot rate Vets Now as “bad” or “poor”. Quite how your bill climbed so high is mystifying to the uninitiated. Among the charges are three for “hospitalisation” totalling £237, on top of hospital admission and consultation fees. “Minimum database” costs £40.50 and “OOH fee standard” another £106.61. That’s £448.57 before any of 10 tests and treatments are factored in. Vets Now, which works with 1,000 vet practices, says its fees are more expensive than out-of-hours services operated in-house because the latter are subsidised by routine daytime procedures. This is despite the fact that vet practices pay a subscription to help cover the cost of running the emergency service. “In return for our fees, pets receive a high standard of round-the-clock care and our vets and nurses are on duty all night,” it says. The mysterious “OOH fee” stands for “out of hours”, despite the fact that all Vets Now services are out of hours and already reflected by what it admits are “premium” prices. This, Vets Now says, is because it provides full clinical care rather than just first aid. “Minimum database” is, it explains, a blood test and “hospitalisation” the level of monitoring a pet requires. There’s no response from your usual vet when I contact them, but the British Veterinary Association says that third-party emergency provision is important for smaller vets practices who do not have enough staff to share a viable out-of-hours rota. It advises checking out-of-hours provision before choosing a vet and taking out pet insurance, the reliability of which is another story.

Monica Macovei, who was an architect of Romania’s anti-corruption policy when she was justice minister from 2004-07, said changes introduced to bring the country into the EU were being dismantled. She said recent changes to the judicial system and the proposed decriminalisation of some corruption offences constituted an unprecedented assault on the rule of law since Romania joined the EU in 2007. “There has been backwards and forwards, but this is worse.” Macovei, now an MEP, was speaking to the Guardian at her offices in Brussels before Romania lost its second prime minister in seven months this week. Viorica Dăncilă has been named as prime minister designate, following the sudden departure of Mihai Tudose, who fell out with the leader of the ruling Social Democrat party. Tudose’s unexpected resignation meant that the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, was left kicking his heels while on an official visit to Romania this week. After a meeting with the prime minister was cancelled on Tuesday, Abe made a last-minute trip to an outdoor village museum of traditional peasant houses. Hundreds of embarrassed Romanians apologised for the “careless” behaviour of their government on the Japanese embassy’s Facebook page. “On behalf of the Romanian people, please accept our sincere apologies,” wrote one Facebook user, in a typical post. “Unfortunately, our current government does not represent the people. They are only representing themselves, and in the poorest way.” Dăncilă, currently an MEP with a low profile in domestic politics, could be leading a new government by 1 February, but commentators say it is unclear if she will be an independent actor, or a proxy for PSD leader, Liviu Dragnea. Dragnea is barred from the premiership because of a conviction for ballot-rigging that led to a two-year suspended prison sentence. He also faces charges of abuse of office, but the case against him would be dropped if current legislative proposals are passed. Under a draft bill, abuse of office would no longer be a criminal offence if the sums involved were less than €200,000 (£176,000). The final text has not been adopted by the senate, following its adoption in the lower house earlier this month. Other changes being debated include decriminalising the offence of taking a bribe on behalf of someone else, as well as lower sentences for the bribe taker. Prosecutors would face restrictions on using wiretaps, CCTV footage or digital evidence as part of changes to the criminal code that have been sharply criticised by Romania’s anti-corruption prosecution unit, the DNA. “These changes could have a devastating impact on criminal investigations because they eliminate the indispensable legal instruments needed to investigate,” the DNA said in a statement last month. In December, the Romanian senate agreed changes to the judicial system, despite protests by thousands of judges and magistrates, who say the laws erode the independence of the judiciary. Macovei said these changes – unless overturned by the country’s supreme court – meant that the separation of powers was “finished”, while the proposed overhaul of the criminal code would allow MPs to get rid of all corruption investigations. Between 2006 and 2017 anti-corruption investigations led to the jailing of the former prime minister Adrian Năstase, as well as the indictment of 20 current and former ministers, 53 deputies and 19 senators. The latest changes are “a perverse effect of a successful fight against corruption, against money-laundering and fraud”, she said. On Saturday protests against the changes to the judiciary are expected in Bucharest, almost one year after the largest demonstrations since the fall of communism. Radu Magdin, an independent analyst at the Smartlink consultancy, said attendance at the 20 January protests was hard to predict but said the changes on abuse of office and judicial reforms were likely to pass, irrespective of the numbers of protesters. On Thursday, the Council of Europe’s anti-corruption watchdog, known as Greco, issued an indictment of Romania’s anti-corruption drive, when it concluded that the country had complied with only two out of 13 of its recommendations on tackling corruption in public life. Last month Greco launched an “urgent evaluation” of Romania’s draft law on the judiciary following a warning from seven EU member states. Recently passed laws on justice reform, as well as the latest draft amendments to the criminal codes, “risk jeopardising” progress Romania has made over the last decade, said a statement from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark and Finland. Romania, along with Bulgaria, which also joined in 2007, is subject to special EU monitoring on the judiciary and rule of law. The European commission, which oversees the monitoring, would like to bring the process to an end, but has faced criticism for being too soft on governments in Romania and Bulgaria. Macovei voiced frustration that Brussels had declined to take a tougher approach with the Romanian government. “The practice of the commission is we wait and see if it happens and then after it happens make pressure for change. And in my view this is a losing policy, for us, for my country [Romania] and for other countries. Because after it happens it is much more difficult to change.” • This article was amended on 19 January 2018.

The opinion may have far-reaching consequences for new breeding techniques that can remove specific parts of a plant’s genetic code and foster herbicide-resistant traits. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in the technology, which could be subject to labelling, authorisation and safety checks, if the court decides it falls under the EU’s GM legislation later this year. But in a complex preliminary opinion, Michal Bobek advised that “organisms obtained by mutagenesis” should not be seen as genetically modified, unless they contained recombinant nucleic acid molecules or other GM organisms. Biotech industries argue that gene editing-type alterations could occur naturally through evolution, but critics counter that they involve genetic mutations that are lab-based and artificial by definition. Dr Michael Antoniou, the head of the molecular genetics department at King’s College London, said exempting new plant-breeding technologies from GM laws was “wrong and potentially dangerous”. “None of these gene editing methods are perfect,” he told the Guardian. “They have ‘off target’ effects that can inadvertently disturb the biochemistry of organisms leading to unintended outcomes which – if you’re making a new gene edited food crop, for example – could result in the unexpected production of a new toxin or allergenic substance. Friends of the Earth Europe called for the European court of justice “to not uphold today’s opinion, and instead make sure that all new genetically modified foods and crops are properly regulated.” The European commission is waiting for clarification from the courts before deciding whether new legislation – or an update of existing laws – could be needed for the new technology. EuropaBio, which represents the largest and most influential biotech industry groups in the EU, gave the court’s opinion a cautious thumbs up. John Brennan, EuropaBio’s secretary-general said: “The advocate general’s opinion demonstrates that necessary steps are being taken towards clarifying the regulatory status of products that have been developed using the latest biotechnological tools and applications. We trust that the forthcoming ruling will contribute to establishing regulatory clarity.” The court was originally asked for its opinion by France in 2016 after a coalition of farmers and environmental groups had called for herbicide-tolerant crops resulting from new breeding techniques to be treated as GM products."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/19/liverpool-prison-worst-conditions-inspectors-report","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T00:01:08Z","webTitle":"Liverpool prison has 'worst conditions inspectors have seen'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/19/liverpool-prison-worst-conditions-inspectors-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/19/liverpool-prison-worst-conditions-inspectors-report","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool prison has 'worst conditions inspectors have seen'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Prison chiefs have been summoned next week to explain to MPs their “abject failure” over living conditions in Liverpool prison, which have been described by inspectors as the worst they can recall. Their official inspection report, published on Friday, highlights the plight of one prisoner with complex mental health needs who was left for weeks in a dark and damp cell with no furniture other than a bed, broken windows, exposed wires and a filthy blocked lavatory. It took the personal intervention of the chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, to get him moved “from such appalling conditions”. The Liverpool report follows the decision by the chief inspector to invoke a new procedure for the first time to demand urgent action by the new justice secretary, David Gauke, to intervene at Nottingham prison, which inspectors found last week to be “fundamentally unsafe”. Gauke formally has 28 days to respond. The report of the official inspection at HMP Liverpool carried out in September says many of the 1,155 prisoners had to endure squalid living conditions with rats, cockroaches, damp, dirt, hundreds of broken windows with jagged glass in the frames and filthy or leaking toilets. Inspectors also reported seeing rats in rubbish piles. The chief inspector says he was told by a senior member of staff that the rat-infested piles of rubbish had not been cleared by prisoners working as cleaning orderlies because they presented a health and safety risk “It was so bad that external contractors were to be brought in to deal with it. In other words, this part of the jail had become so dirty, infested and hazardous to health that it could not be cleaned.” The chief inspector reveals the prison also had a backlog of about 2,000 maintenance tasks. “It is hard to understand how the leadership of the prison could have allowed the situation to deteriorate to this extent … The inspection team was highly experienced and could not recall having seen worse living conditions than those at HMP Liverpool,” said Clarke. “We could see no credible plan to address these basic issues. On the contrary, the presence of inspectors seemed to provoke some piecemeal and superficial attempts at cleaning and the like, but the fear was that this would stop as soon we left, which is clearly what happened after the last inspection.” The report says half the prisoners remained locked in their cells during the working day, violence of all kinds had increased since the previous inspection in 2015, and nearly two-thirds of prisoners said it was easy or very easy to obtain drugs. Drug-carrying drones were described as a serious problem, with staff recovering 32 in the six months before the inspection. Clarke, a former head of the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command, makes clear that blame for the situation rests on the national leadership of the prison service as much as local prison governors. “We saw clear evidence that local prison managers had sought help from regional and national management to improve conditions they knew to be unacceptable long before our arrival, but the resulting support was inadequate and had made little impact on outcomes for prisoners,” concludes the chief inspector, describing the “abject failure of HMP Liverpool to offer a safe, decent and purposeful environment”. Michael Spurr, the chief executive of Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service, responded to the report, saying the conditions at Liverpool were unacceptable. A new governor was appointed following the inspection, the prison’s capacity was reduced by 172 places and the maintenance backlog halved, and an action plan was being published on Friday. “Liverpool has a dedicated staff who are committed to providing a safe and decent environment for prisoners. The governor will get the support she needs to deliver the action plan and make the changes necessary to substantially improve the performance and conditions at the prison,” said Spurr. But Bob Neill, the Conservative chair of the Commons justice committee, said the report was one of the worst he had seen and he was sceptical the response would resolve the problems. He announced he was taking the unusual step of summoning prison chiefs next week to consider their response. “A situation as bad as this raises urgent questions for the prison’s leadership, regional and national management and for the government, who seem to have collectively failed in their duty,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/29/lester-piggott-outstanding-jockey-of-post-war-era-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-29T08:44:02Z","webTitle":"Lester Piggott, the outstanding jockey of the postwar era, dies aged 86","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/29/lester-piggott-outstanding-jockey-of-post-war-era-dies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/may/29/lester-piggott-outstanding-jockey-of-post-war-era-dies","fields":{"headline":"Lester Piggott, the outstanding jockey of the postwar era, dies aged 86","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lester Piggott, the outstanding jockey of the postwar era and a figure who transcended the sport of racing when the popularity of the Derby was at its height, has died aged 86. Piggot’s son-in-law, Derby-winning trainer William Haggas, said: “Sadly we can confirm that Lester died peacefully in Switzerland this morning. I really don’t wish to add much more than that at this stage, although [my wife] Maureen will be making a statement later.” Frankie Dettori, the only jockey since Piggott to share similar fame as a jockey, was quick to pay tribute. He told Racing TV: “Lester was very special and was one of my heroes. I was one of the lucky ones [to have ridden alongside him]. I was in that [Breeders’ Cup] race when he won on Royal Academy [in 1990] and I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. A month out of retirement and he did what he did – it proved what a legend he was. “I kind of got close to him personally, because obviously we were both good friends with [trainer] Barney [Curley], and Lester was a good friend to me. He will never be forgotten.” Piggott earned the nickname “The Long Fellow” because of his relative tallness among jockeys at 5ft 8in but became popularly known as “the housewives favourite” during a period when he won nine Derbys and the Epsom Classic was the most famous race in the world. Piggott’s influence on racing was such that he spawned a new “shorter” race-riding style with pulled-up stirrup leathers which changed the art of jockeyship. His father Keith, a former champion jumps jockey turned trainer, provided his son with his first public ride in 1948 at the age of 12. The boy, whose shy exterior resulting from partial deafness and a speech impediment masked a ruthless streak and a fiercely competitive will to win, was successful on The Chase at Haydock, laying the foundations for a glittering career in the saddle. Piggott won his first Derby at 18 on Never Say Die and was champion jockey 11 times between 1960 and 1982. Despite his height there was no more natural rider in the saddle during a golden age for the sport which included rivals Pat Eddery and Willie Carson. Carson said on Sunday that he felt like a part of him had died with the most iconic racing figure of the 20th century. “I feel as though I have lost part of my life in way, as Lester has been part of my life ever since I came into racing,” said an emotional Carson. “I came to his in-laws as an apprentice and he was part of my life right from the word go, until the end. He was an iconic figure in the horse racing world. He is a legend. We had the luck of some ding-dongs on the track and he was a person who made us all better – because we had to be better to beat him. We had to up our game to compete with him, because he was so magical on top of a horse.” Controversy never strayed far from Piggott during and after his career on the Turf and he was banned from the track “until further notice” for what the stewards labelled his “dangerous riding” on Never Say Die at Royal Ascot, a few weeks after his Epsom victory. He returned six months later and in 1955 replaced the retired Sir Gordon Richards, his only rival for the outstanding jockey of the 20th century, in the top riding job in British racing as jockey to Noel Murless. Piggott’s association with Murless and his subsequent ones with Vincent O’Brien and Henry Cecil were the basis of his domination of the upper echelons of the sport, which included completing in 1970 the Triple Crown of 2,000 Guineas, Derby and St Leger on Nijinsky, an achievement that has still not been equalled. His association with the Ballydoyle stable of O’Brien during the most successful years of the 1960s and 70s became a key part of his glittering career and the current incumbent Aidan O’Brien, no relation of his predecessor, said: “Lester was a very special man and his knowledge was second to none. He didn’t say a lot but every word you hung on to. He had so much natural ability to assess a horse. We are so sorry that he has passed.” Piggott retired for the first time in 1985 but his burgeoning training career was cut short when he was sensationally jailed for tax fraud. He was stripped of his OBE before being released on parole after a year in 1988. He then stunned the sporting world when returning to the saddle in 1990, a comeback which spawned a fairytale story within days when he executed an audacious ride on Royal Academy to win at the Breeders’ Cup in America. The famously taciturn Piggott won his 30th and final Classic on Rodrigo De Triano in the 1992 2,000 Guineas but only finally hung up his boots for good in 1995."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/18/lost-in-the-woods-justin-timberlake-serves-bugs-and-bass-drops-at-album-party","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T18:56:30Z","webTitle":"Lost in the woods: Justin Timberlake serves bugs and bass drops at album party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/18/lost-in-the-woods-justin-timberlake-serves-bugs-and-bass-drops-at-album-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/18/lost-in-the-woods-justin-timberlake-serves-bugs-and-bass-drops-at-album-party","fields":{"headline":"Lost in the woods: Justin Timberlake serves bugs and bass drops at album party","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Generally, I find that I’ll eat anything put in front of me. But the menu at Justin Timberlake’s private listening party for his new album Man of the Woods put that theory to the test. The food, catered by the restaurant Noma, was of a piece with Timberlake’s rustic album rollout: there were ants, watercress, wild beach plants, sea urchin, kelp and grasshoppers. And also a spherical Danish pancake called aebleskiver. Perhaps enjoying such delicacies requires a certain level of sophistication, of woodsiness. I apparently fall short of that threshold. The menu and album title, not to mention the makeshift greenery that filled the event space, seemed to indicate what many have suspected: that Man of the Woods signals Timberlake’s mid-career pivot from sex symbol to woodsman, from tequila to IPA, from pop to country. Many of the track titles on Man of the Woods would bolster this assumption: Flannel, Montana, Breeze Off the Pond and Livin’ Off the Land, to name a few. But don’t worry: Man of the Woods is not Justin Timberlake’s Llewyn Davis phase. It’s actually just the Latin translation of his son’s name, Silas. Timberlake told us as much at last night’s listening session, where cellphones were prohibited and vinyls fashioned to look like tree bark distributed. Part of the proceeds from the ticket sales benefited the National Parks Foundation, and there was a photo-booth featuring a log cabin and a fake gilded taxidermy. The whole thing reminded me of Lady Gaga’s rollout for Joanne – her own supposedly radical rebrand – which was sponsored by Bud Light and featured lots of cowboy hats. This time, though, the sponsor was American Express, and cowboy hats were exchanged for termite-themed hors d’oeuvres. Timberlake, predictably wearing a jean jacket and camouflage pants, briefly introduced the album and its nominal inspirations before it played at what the singer called “an unspeakable volume”. The music itself sounds diametrically opposed to its own promotion, which has nonetheless inspired some very amusing memes invoking Timberlake’s all-denim outfit at the 2001 American Music Awards. Filthy, the lead single, is tried-and-true dance-pop; Supplies, a video for which was released this morning, is more of the same, with a funky, futuristic beat and a catchy chorus. The album has echoes of both Chance the Rapper and Bruno Mars, but more than anything it reminded me of Timberlake himself, which makes the aggressively arcadian PR strategy even more confusing. Many songs feature that famously silky falsetto backed up by vaguely trap- and Caribbean-inspired stylings. One song features country artist Chris Stapleton, and while it’s one of the album’s best, it feels a bit perfunctory in the context of Timberlake’s dog whistle to the wild west. Man of the Woods is a reliably good album from a reliably good artist, similar in nature to both Future Sex/Love Sounds and The 20/20 Experience; what it’s not is some sort of reinvention. Timberlake’s not going to appear at this year’s Super Bowl half-time show on horseback, and I seriously doubt he will even pick up a guitar. But either the singer or his handlers very much want us to think he will and, for one of the biggest and most talented pop stars of the last two decades, the fake-out is rather ill-advised, turning a bona fide superstar into a punchline. And yet, after seeing the music video for Supplies this morning, it seems like Timberlake’s basically just trying on various trends for size. Two months ago, his Woody Allen-directed film Wonder Wheel was released. Soon after, when the teaser video for Man of the Woods dropped online, people joked that Timberlake had finally realized he’s a white dude. But in Supplies, footage of Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, the #MeToo movement and Black Lives Matter protesters flash across dozens of TV screens. Then Timberlake croons: “I’ll be the wood when you need heat, I’ll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity.” What social justice movements or sexual abuse have to do with the Timberlake’s affinity for salacious double entendres is not immediately clear. But more than anything he appears conflicted about what contemporary trends to parrot for personal gain. The end result is, sadly, something out of a Portlandia sketch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"teacher-network/teacher-blog/2018/feb/01/staff-wellbeing-team-school-improved","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T16:34:30Z","webTitle":"Every school needs a staff wellbeing team – here’s how to start one","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2018/feb/01/staff-wellbeing-team-school-improved","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2018/feb/01/staff-wellbeing-team-school-improved","fields":{"headline":"Every school needs a staff wellbeing team – here’s how to start one","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I started as headteacher at Brimsdown primary school in Enfield, north London, during a troubling time for the school.

Two years later, our most recent Ofsted grade improved to good with three outstanding elements – and we’re now in the top 20% for progress in reading and maths. Staff report they are much happier and the school has more of a family feel to it. Here’s what we learned – which other schools may be able to use to get started with their own wellbeing teams. Have an open discussion about issues The first after-school meeting of the wellbeing team included some hard truths. Each attendee had the opportunity to be honest about how they felt. It was clear that the changes I had implemented had caused staff a great deal of stress, but they were still keen to engage with further training and development. While I was part of the problem, I also wanted to be part of the solution. We distributed a wellbeing survey and encouraged staff to approach us if they had any issues. At the beginning of our journey, 42% of staff said they got the support they needed for their job, 45% felt supported by their line manager and 20% of staff didn’t feel inspired to do their job. As well as dealing with change, there had been issues around fairness and consistency in the school, in terms of staff hours and overtime and behaviour expectations. We introduced procedures, including a behaviour policy, which went some way towards addressing this. Other problems associated with workload, particularly on an administrative level, were helped by acquiring a second photocopier, employing an intern to help with laminating, and setting time aside during inset days to prepare resources. Start small and fun The team’s initiatives started small – we added a wellbeing board to the staffroom and put fun, motivational posters in the staff toilets. We began to “mug” people – leaving mugs filled with treats, sweets and stationery for a particular member of staff. This proved particularly popular. It was up to staff who they chose to give a mug to, but the wellbeing team did also focus on those who seemed in need of a pick-me-up. All of the ideas came from the wellbeing team – things they’d either heard from friends and colleagues, or discovered online. Now we also get suggestions from staff of initiatives they would like to see – a weekly fitness class after school is the latest one we’re acting on. Of course, not all ideas were possible to follow up on. Getting fresh flowers and fruit baskets delivered to the staff room just wasn’t something we were able to afford to do. But the board is now busy with details about staff nights out, information about coping with stress, and “shout outs” for staff to praise each other. The team have set up a book and DVD swap in the staff room, and the school pays a housekeeper to tidy after lunch so it can be a haven for staff (our cleaners only work in the morning). Look at workload Something that was clearly an issue for all staff was getting their work-life balance in check. As well as the new photocopier and help with laminating, we ran training sessions for the school’s new English and phonics scheme. A member of the senior leadership team would go to the year group PPA (planning, preparation and assessment) sessions and offer support, working alongside the teachers. The teaching assistants, many of whom took phonics groups, had their own weekly PPA session to prepare resources, share good practice and ask the phonics lead teacher questions. In September 2016 we also introduced a no-marking policy across the school, meaning all feedback is given verbally. It’s a change we were nervous about but which has had an immeasurable impact on our staff. The wellbeing team also held regular staff meetings to talk about ways to manage workloads effectively and how to relax. Sharing resources between different teams has been an effective approach, as well as writing weekly priority lists and doing mindfulness activities. Be approachable as a leader By ensuring all of the school’s leadership team have an open-door policy, prioritising staff training, and supporting the wellbeing team, I’m pleased to say our school is a much happier place for our staff to be. Six months after we first issued the survey, we ran it again. Almost all (96%) of the school’s staff felt inspired to do their job (this was despite support staff redundancies happening at the time), 96% felt supported by line managers and 100% of staff said they had friendships within work – all huge improvements from the March survey. They also felt much less stress. In January 2018, this stress level has gone down even further from a previous average score of 3.31 out of five to an average 2.43 out of five. Now, staff are proud of where they work, feel supported and want to see the school go from strength to strength. Some members of the wellbeing team have left, others have stayed, but it remains a force for good in our school. I don’t know how we’d get by without one.

Clive Lewis, the MP for Norwich South, used a point of order in the Commons to highlight what he said was an “exceptionally serious issue” with the East of England ambulance service, highlighted by the whistleblower. The ambulance service became critically overstretched from 19 December, and senior managers wanted to move into what is called Reap 4, the fourth stage of the resource escalation action plan, which involves seeking outside help, Lewis told MPs. Because neighbouring ambulance services were also overstretched, the assistance would most likely have come from the armed forces, he said. Lewis said no decision was taken until 31 December, when a different plan was implemented. Over the period, 20 patients died in incidents when ambulances arrived late, the whistleblower has claimed. The latest NHS figures show that up to 100,000 patients this winter have had to wait in the back of ambulances for at least 30 minutes because of A&amp;E overcrowding. In all 104,987 patients brought to hospitals in England have been stuck inside an ambulance, or in parts of hospitals including corridors, for upwards of half an hour. They have faced long waits because A&amp;E staff, struggling to cope with a surge in demand for care, have been too busy to accept them at the time they arrive. Of the patients affected, almost a quarter – 24,624 – have endured a delay of at least an hour. Lewis told the Commons that the whistleblower’s claims, if true, raise “serious questions for both the trust and the government as to why Reap 4 was not declared and no aid sought, what potentially avoidable deaths resulted from those decisions, and above all how we avoid that ever happening again”. A spokeswoman for the ambulance service said it was looking into what had happened and accepted there had been delays over Christmas. She said: “We recognise that some people experienced a delay in their care over the festive period and we, along with the wider healthcare system, experienced significant pressure. “We always monitor our demand and capacity and take necessary actions to protect patients, working closely with NHS Improvement and NHS England. The trust has a robust internal process and we are investigating appropriately. “Since Christmas we have responded to in excess of 50,000 patients. Of those, less than 0.2% of patients have experienced a significant delay.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “These are serious claims and we urge Mr Lewis to provide the Department of Health and Social Care with evidence to substantiate them as soon as possible. We will of course carefully examine any such evidence and take appropriate action.” This month it emerged that an 81-year-old woman in Clacton, Essex, was found dead at home after waiting almost four hours for an ambulance from the East of England ambulance service. Chris Jenkinson, the east of England head of the Unison union, said: “There must be an independent inquiry to establish what went wrong, and whether these tragic deaths could have been avoided.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/28/enemies-within-richard-davenport-hines-review-strange-study-cambridge-spies","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T08:00:13Z","webTitle":"Enemies Within review – Richard Davenport-Hines offers a strange new study of the Cambridge spies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/28/enemies-within-richard-davenport-hines-review-strange-study-cambridge-spies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/28/enemies-within-richard-davenport-hines-review-strange-study-cambridge-spies","fields":{"headline":"Enemies Within review – Richard Davenport-Hines offers a strange new study of the Cambridge spies","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The British spy story, in fact and fiction, is an Edwardian mash-up of insular paranoia, late-empire adventurism, romantic class-consciousness and schoolboy fantasy. Its heroes, real and imagined, include Ian Fleming, Richard Hannay, Graham Greene, George Smiley, John le Carré and James Bond. Indeed, the entertainments of the double life became so braided into the actual work of SIS, the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service, that it became sometimes impossible to distinguish between reality and make-believe. After the Russian Revolution, SIS was the secret society that attracted a generation of young idealists, future Soviet agents whose names and exploits have passed into folklore as “the Cambridge spies”: Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess, John Cairncross, Donald Maclean and Kim Philby, who was also employed by the Observer. Their story became the real-life espionage thriller of the century, a sequence of human and institutional puzzles that have inspired a subgenre replete with myth and fabrication. This is the tantalising mystery that Richard Davenport-Hines has chosen to elucidate in Enemies Within. How was it that five Cambridge undergraduates fell under the spell of Stalin’s Russia? On the face of it, there could not be a more experienced interrogator of a subject so festooned with myths of sleaze, power and treachery. Gossipy and opinionated, Davenport-Hines has written about Auden, Keynes, Profumo and Edward VII and is well-versed in the back alleys of Oxbridge, Whitehall and Westminster. Enemies Within is a peculiar and fascinating hybrid, a mix of history, anthropology, elegy and rant. Davenport-Hines insists at the outset that his subject is “the destruction of trust” in the British establishment. He is also at pains to tick off some of his precursors in this wilderness of mirrors: “Historians fumble their catches when they study individuals’ motives rather than the institutions in which people work.” Having declared his inspiration to be anthropological, he’s certainly crammed a lot into these pages. As its subtitle suggests, Enemies Within is at least three books. There is, first, a scene-setting historical survey of the secret state in Russia before the rise of Stalin and the KGB and in Britain during the formation of Whitehall’s intelligence services. Davenport-Hines, the revisionist, debunks any class interpretation of Foreign Office vulnerability to Soviet spying. It was “gender exclusivity”, he writes, that sponsored the “conditions for espionage”. Enter five treacherous young men from Cambridge University. Davenport-Hines scorns “fantasies about hateful fathers and fables of nursery politics” and attacks those such as Le Carré who have portrayed the Cambridge five as “psychiatric misfits”. It was at public school, he argues, that these would-be spies acquired their faith in communism – a repudiation of Christianity, a fervent belief in the liberation of the working man, plus the egalitarian idealism of an interwar generation sickened by the ancien regime that had survived the trenches. The Cambridge five have been cast as establishment traitors but, although it was Eton, Westminster and Gresham’s that taught them “a smooth-mannered duplicity”, they were not, Davenport-Hines insists, really posh. “The Cambridge spies,” he declares in one of his wittier lines, “came from the mezzanine class.” A graduate of Selwyn College, Davenport-Hines is not afraid to have some fun with the influence of 1930s Cambridge on the impressionable public-school boys who became “the ring of five”. But there’s still an enigma within this conundrum: what was it that pushed these young men into Soviet hands? The crucial question was posed by Hugh Trevor-Roper: “How can any man, being an intelligent man, devote his whole life to so negative a satisfaction as the secret destruction of not merely of the impersonal system around him, but of all personal relations ?” Enemies Within supplies the raw materials for an explanation, but the question finally defeats Davenport-Hines, like so many before him. The motiveless malignity of the Cambridge spies must remain an enduring part of their appeal. The other narrative line in Enemies Within is neither historical nor anthropological but rhetorical. Once Burgess and Maclean have fled abroad, and Philby has bamboozled his interrogators, Davenport-Hines can begin to unpack a long closing argument about “the making of modern Britain” in which the historian becomes the pamphleteer. This opens with his analysis of the “moral panic” that followed Burgess and Maclean’s dramatic exit in 1951. “The defecting diplomats,” he writes, “launched a new national hobby of taunting and debasing government service.” Although Davenport-Hines has conscientiously trawled the espionage archives, he is determined not to draw predictable conclusions and briskly discounts the Cambridge spies’ damage to national security. Forget the hideous consequences of Philby’s betrayals. Rather, it was “the wrecking of the establishment” that was “their gift to the Kremlin”. From this baffling verdict, Davenport-Hines descends into an assault on “the smudged and crooked lines of fiction writers and journalists [who] made the truth ever more illegible”. Andrew Boyle’s 1979 bestseller The Climate of Treason comes in for a special thrashing. “The mole-hunters of the 1980s,” writes Davenport-Hines, “were foul-minded, mercenary and pernicious. Their besmirching of individuals and institutions changed the political culture and electoral moods of Britain far beyond any achievement of Moscow agents or agencies.” The scrupulous historian who introduced himself to his readers at the outset as a guide, mentor and friend becomes in these closing pages a swivel-eyed and blimpish patriot lamenting “the whips and scourges” wielded against “the establishment” by “journalists, by fantasists and by those worming their way into political power”. In Davenport-Hines’s conclusion, the security services were neither “silly asses nor obtuse reactionaries” but decent public servants: “generally subtle, patient, responsive and astute, though never superhuman or infallible”. After a hundred years of spy writing not much has changed: those who step between the reflecting mirrors of British and Soviet intelligence generally have their heads turned. • Enemies Within by Richard Davenport-Hines is published by William Collins (£25).

According to the city’s department of homeless services, the former Park Savoy Hotel at 158 W 58th St in midtown Manhattan will house 150 homeless people. It is scheduled to open in March, and backs on to One57, a 75-storey skyscraper on 57th Street. But the plan, part of a program to create 90 new shelters across all five New York boroughs that de Blasio says will be “in every kind of neighborhood”, is opposed by local residents who accuse the recently re-elected mayor of playing political games. “I think de Blasio is trying to score points,” said Helen Caputi, who was walking her dog on the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue. “The people here are uppity, they don’t like it. I’m for helping the homeless people, but I think they could have placed the shelter elsewhere.” Building superintendents and doormen said the plan was already facing stiff opposition from wealthy neighbors. “It’s not going to be a good thing cause you’ve got the Marriott and Hyatt hotels right here,” said the super at an adjacent building. “So it looks like there’s going to be a war with de Blasio. He doesn’t have to put the homeless here, he could put them all in the armory on 2nd Avenue.” De Blasio has previously said the city’s “Turning the Tide on Homelessness” program would include shelters in every neighborhood, as the city moved to tackle “a new kind of homelessness that is driven by years of wages not keeping up with the cost of most of the housing in our city”. Recent figures showed more homeless people live in New York City than in any other city in the country. The city estimates that the population has been growing for 35 years, with the population now standing at 76,501 on any given night, according to the US housing department. As part of the new effort to reduce homelessness, the city has outlined dozens of reforms including providing NYPD security, career counselling, mental health and and substance abuse disorder counselors at shelters. At One57, concierge services said they could not comment on the plan to convert the Savoy into a shelter. “I can tell you the residents here are not going to be happy,” a doorman remarked. When it launched sales in 2011, the $1.5bn, 1,004ft development was promoted as setting a new standard in luxury – and pricing. The skyscraper boasted a top-floor penthouse that sold for $100.5m, or about $9,200 per sq ft, making it the priciest closed apartment sale in the city. Developer Gary Barnett once referred to the view of Central Park from the upper floors of the tower as “the money shot”. Residents are said to include Silas Chou, backer of fashion brands including Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors. Business partner Lawrence Stroll, whose estimated wealth is put at $2.4bn, recently put his apartment on the market for $70m. Stroll’s apartment, according to The Real Deal, includes a “woven suede” entrance hall and a “sculpted ceramic wall” by the artist Peter Lane in the great room. The “extravagant” pad also features a 1,500 sq ft master suite, eat-in chef’s kitchen with a hidden ceiling TV. According to the real estate publication, property prices along Billionaires’ Row have been struggling in recent months in line with a broad downturn in the city’s priciest real estate. Until late last year, US secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross owned a 5,573 sq ft penthouse at the Briarcliff opposite. He sold it for a $2m loss."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/18/blood-test-could-use-dna-to-spot-early-stage-cancers-study-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T08:35:22Z","webTitle":"Blood test could use DNA to spot eight of the most common cancers, study shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/18/blood-test-could-use-dna-to-spot-early-stage-cancers-study-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/18/blood-test-could-use-dna-to-spot-early-stage-cancers-study-shows","fields":{"headline":"Blood test could use DNA to spot eight of the most common cancers, study shows","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Scientists have made a major advance towards developing a blood test for cancer that could identify tumours long before a person becomes aware of symptoms. The new test, which is sensitive to both mutated DNA that floats freely in the blood and cancer-related proteins, gave a positive result approximately 70% of the time across eight of the most common cancers when tested in more than 1,000 patients. In the future, such a test could be used in routine screening programmes to significantly increase the proportion of patients who get treatment early, at a time before cancer would typically show up on conventional scans. “The use of a combination of selected biomarkers for early detection has the potential to change the way we screen for cancer, and it is based on the same rationale for using combinations of drugs to treat cancers,” said Nickolas Papadopoulos, professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins University and senior author on the paper. The test could also identify the form of cancer that a patient had, a goal that previous cancer blood tests have failed to achieve. It works by detecting free-floating mutated DNA, released into the bloodstream by dying cancer cells. The test screened for the presence of errors in 16 genes that are frequently mutated in different kinds of cancer. The blood of patients was also tested for eight known protein biomarkers which are seen to differing degrees depending on where in the body a tumour is located. In blood samples from 1,005 patients, the test detected between 33% and 98% of cases of disease. Ovarian cancer was the easiest to detect, followed by liver, stomach, pancreas, oesophageal, colorectal, lung and breast cancers. For the five cancers that currently have no screening tests – ovarian, liver, stomach, pancreatic and oesophageal cancers – sensitivity ranged from 69% to 98%. When the test was assessed on 812 healthy control subjects, it produced only seven false-positive results. “Very high specificity was essential because false-positive results can subject patients to unnecessary invasive follow-up tests and procedures to confirm the presence of cancer,” said Kenneth Kinzler, professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins and a co-author of the paper. The patients in the trial had non-metastatic – ie localised – stage one to three cancers. Experts noted that the rates of detection were lowest in those who had the earliest stages of the illness – and might be expected to be even lower in people who had not yet shown any symptoms. Paul Pharoah, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Cambridge, said: “There are some major caveats. Firstly, 80% of the cancers evaluated were stage two or stage three cancers – fairly advanced. Demonstrating that a test can detect advanced cancers does not mean that the test will be useful in detecting early stage symptomatic cancer, much less pre-symptomatic cancer. The sensitivity for the stage one cancers in the study was only 40%.” Chris Abbosh, of the UCL Cancer Institute, described the work as exciting. “This is one of the first studies to combine protein biomarkers and circulating tumour DNA as a screening tool and to [apply] this tool across a range of cancer types in a large cohort of patients.” Although the current test does not pick up every cancer, it identifies many cancers that would likely otherwise go undetected. “Many of the most promising cancer treatments we have today only benefit a small minority of cancer patients, and we consider them major breakthroughs. If we are going to make progress in early cancer detection, we have to begin looking at it in a more realistic way, recognising that no test will detect all cancers,” said Bert Vogelstein, also a professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins. The team behind the test, known as CancerSEEK, predicted it would eventually cost less than $500 per patient. The findings are published in the journal Science."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/18/wolf-recaptured-after-five-hours-freedom-when-fence-blew-down","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T18:27:58Z","webTitle":"Escaped wolf was deliberately set free, sanctuary claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/18/wolf-recaptured-after-five-hours-freedom-when-fence-blew-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/18/wolf-recaptured-after-five-hours-freedom-when-fence-blew-down","fields":{"headline":"Escaped wolf was deliberately set free, sanctuary claims","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A wolf that escaped from a Berkshire sanctuary, prompting the mobilisation of police marksmen and local schools being put on lockdown, may have been deliberately freed as part of a protest, it has been claimed. The UK Wolf Conservation Trust realised Torak, a 12-year-old male, was missing at 7.45am when Teresa Palmer, the founder of the sanctuary in Beenham, was called by a friend who said they had spotted a wolf on a footpath. Armed police and animal specialists with tranquilliser guns launched a hunt as a police helicopter with a thermal imaging camera tracked the animal through woodland, fields and back gardens. But Torak, displaying none of the lupine characteristics feared, eventually allowed himself to be gently coaxed into a trailer eight miles from home, having loped through a field of sheep leaving them unmolested. “The fact he went through a field of sheep shows he never would have been a danger to the public. Now he’s given up. He’s had his moment of freedom,” said Palmer as the animal was captured five hours later in the village of Curridge, near the M4. At first it was thought strong winds had blown down its enclosure fence. But on checking, Palmer, 62, found Torak’s mate, Mosi, barking in an alarmed manner and the enclosure gate, normally securely padlocked, open. She now thinks somebody deliberately opened it. “A lot of people don’t particularly believe in having animals in captivity,” she said. While Thames Valley police warned residents not to approach the wolf, residents took the news in their stride. The wolves were much loved in the village, said Tony Roe, 53, a local solicitor, who learned of the escape while dropping his son off at Beenham primary school. “It’s not every day you take your child to school to be told there’s a wolf on the loose,” he said. The school’s emblem was a wolf and there was a lot of support in the village for the trust’s work, he said. Locals often saw the wolves being walked on leads in the woodland. “Of course I’m relieved the wolf has been found and delighted that it’s ended safely for all concerned, including the wolf,” he said. Before Torak was captured, he was photographed crossing the lawn of a house in Cold Ash, six miles from the sanctuary, deploying such stealth he did not even wake the resident cat. At Beenham primary school, on lockdown during the hunt, staff and pupils seemed unperturbed. “We are all fine. We all know the wolves and no one is worried,” a spokeswoman said. On the wolf sanctuary’s website, Torak is described as half North American and half European. It describes him as “a magnificent wolf, tall and proud with long legs and a handsome, masculine head”. The conservationist and wildlife presenter Anneka Svenska, who bottle-fed Torak and saw him again when he was three, described him as “exceptionally beautiful” and “a little bit timid”. She was relieved he had avoided the fate of another wolf who escaped from the Cotswold Wildlife Park in Oxfordshire in July and was shot dead. Garry Marvin, a member of the sanctuary’s education and scientific committee, and author of a book called Wolf, said: “Thank God they didn’t panic and send someone out to shoot him. One of the keepers just called him over and put a collar on him and walked him off to one of their vehicles.” Founded in 1995, the sanctuary has 10 wolves from the arctic and north-western breeds, living in four packs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/20/supermarkets-organic-food-packaging","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T06:59:45Z","webTitle":"Why do supermarkets sell organic products wrapped in non-cyclable plastic?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/20/supermarkets-organic-food-packaging","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/20/supermarkets-organic-food-packaging","fields":{"headline":"Why do supermarkets sell organic food wrapped in plastic?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My environmentally conscious wife Clare is the keenest recycler possible. She even collects and recycles the silver milk bottle tops that I tend to chuck out. But when it comes to organic food she’s furious. Why? Because she finds it is the worst culprit for wrapping almost everything in plastic and polywrap that cannot be recycled. How, she asks, did we reach the situation where the most environmentally produced food is also the worst for packaging and recycling? Like many others, the Brignall household despairs at the revelations over the past year that 86% of collected plastic is not actually recycled, and the Blue Planet claim that 8m tonnes of the stuff ends up in oceans. Yet when we pick up a packet of organic carrots, or apples, or avocados – in fact almost any organic fruit or veg in our local supermarket – it comes in plastic packaging that is not only unnecessary, it is almost always not recyclable. In Waitrose, organic beetroots that you could play football with without damaging, are packed in plastic trays surrounded in non-recyclable plastic sleeves. In Tesco this week organic mushrooms were housed in all-plastic containers, while the cheaper, conventional mushrooms could be bought in greener compostable trays. Organic apples and carrots that don’t need any packaging at all are almost always bagged in plastic that can’t be recycled. We don’t buy a lot of organic food in supermarkets as, in truth we can’t afford to, but we have been seriously wondering whether we should give up what we do buy, because the environmental benefits are overshadowed by the packaging it comes in. Take Morrisons, our family’s supermarket of choice. Its standard lettuces come in plastic wraps which we recycle separately. The organic lettuces, though, come in that crinkly packaging that can only be put in the bin, and this is replicated across the organic sector. Our unscientific study suggests Sainsbury’s is a little better than the others. But it is Waitrose’s Duchy Organic brand that disappoints us most for packaging. Red peppers, tomatoes and carrots are all bagged in non-recyclable plastic bags. If you’re a hedge fund manager and can afford the £3.30 for five organic Pink Lady apples, you’ll be putting the wrapping in the landfill bin. Two organic beetroots that could easily be in a paper, or compostable package, were covered in plastic. A spokeswoman for the Soil Association claimed organic food in supermarkets had to be packaged to prevent it being mixed with non-organic varieties. “While it is fair to say that there is a lot more to do on packaging when it comes to organic products, I would urge consumers not to give up on buying organic. The benefits to the environment, such as healthy soil, more wildlife and the protection of bees continue to be hugely important. We have convened a specialist working group of industry experts to come up with better packaging solutions, but it has to be done with other European certifiers,” she says. Waitrose said it didn’t believe its Duchy Organic products were packaged any differently to other organic brands. “We are actively looking at how we can reduce our use of plastic and package our products in more environmentally sustainable alternatives.” A final word from Clare. She says: “I simply don’t buy these arguments that organic food can’t be sold loose, or with minimal, greener packaging. It’s simple.

Most answers to that question start and end with Donald Trump. Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, two Harvard political scientists, though as horrified by Trump as anyone, try to take a wider view. For them the great harbinger of disaster happened during the final year of the Obama presidency. Following the sudden death of the conservative supreme court justice Antonin Scalia in early 2016, President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a centrist liberal, to replace him. It was up to the Senate to decide whether to confirm the president’s choice. But the Senate did something it had never done in more than 150 years: it refused even to grant Garland a hearing. This was not about Trump – most Republican senators were at this point deeply alarmed by, if not downright hostile to, the prospect of the Donald in the White House. Instead, it was about their shared view that any Republican supreme court nominee would be better than any Democratic nominee, and any price was worth paying to achieve that. It was scorched earth politics. This was a preeminent example of what Levitsky and Ziblatt call the erosion of norms, which they consider the greatest threat to contemporary democracy. Norms are the unspoken rules and conventions that hold a democracy together, many of them based on the idea that what’s good for your side in the short term may not do you any good in the long run, because you won’t be in power for ever (if you are, it’s no longer a democracy). When the other side get their turn, your impatience to take advantage will become their licence to exact revenge. It’s a version of the old show business adage: you should be nice to people on your way up so they’ll be nice to you on your way down. Clearly not everyone in showbiz lives by that rule. But in politics, at the moment, almost no one seems to. In refusing to do what all their predecessors had done, however reluctantly, the Senate class of 2016 did not break the law. It was not a coup, but it was a refusal to play by the rules of the game – and to hell with the consequences. Levitsky and Ziblatt want to get away from the idea that so long as the constitutional order is intact, democracy will be OK. They are deeply suspicious of any naive faith that deviant politicians can be “contained” by the right institutions, and not just because it didn’t work out for Weimar Germany with Hitler. They point out that US history is littered with examples of political behaviour that stayed within the letter of the law but still did catastrophic damage to democracy. The racist regime that prevailed in the American south during the first half of the 20th century was underpinned by a set of norms that made hard-won African American voting rights meaningless. The constitution did not have to be overridden to allow this to happen. All it took was brutal thuggery and shameless intimidation, while the lawmakers in Washington sat on their hands. The two primary norms that Levitsky and Ziblatt think underpin democracy are “mutual toleration” and “institutional forbearance”. They amount to the same thing: resisting the temptation to take every cheap shot going. This is where Trump comes in. There are many words that might describe his political style but toleration and forbearance are not among them. Trump treats the presidency as a platform designed for settling personal scores. He appears to be almost entirely lacking in impulse control, yet without impulse control there can be no lasting democracy. As a result, the US now has as its commander-in-chief the norm-shredder-in-chief as well. Levitsky and Ziblatt do not think Trump spells the death of US democracy. What they fear is what he will leave behind. He has taken the growing mistrust and mutual intolerance that preceded him and turbocharged it. Levitsky and Ziblatt call it “democracy without guardrails”: a helter-skelter race to the bottom. How bad could it get? This book provides a swift survey of authoritarian politics around the world and finds the same pattern repeating itself. Twenty-first century strongmen do not suspend the constitution and replace it with tanks on the streets. They pay lip-service to the constitution while behaving as though it didn’t exist. Think of Putin, formally swapping the role of president for prime minister in order to play by the rules, and thereby making a total mockery of them. Erdoğan in Turkey, Orbán in Hungary, Maduro in Venezuela, Modi in India (to name just a few): they all deride their opponents as criminals, show contempt for their critics in the media, stoke conspiracy theories about opposition movements and question the legitimacy of any vote that goes against them. Trump is no different. A lot of this is name-calling rather than sticks-and-stones politics – and much of it happens on social media. But it also includes a wide tolerance of violence. Sticks and stones may still break your bones, but only if the name-calling doesn’t silence you first. That said, this is not a fatalistic book. It looks to history to provide a guide for defending democratic norms when they are under threat, and finds that it is possible to fight back. Mainstream parties can ally against authoritarianism, as happened for example in Belgium in the 1930s, when incipient fascism was defeated by the willingness of the rightwing Catholic party to join ranks with the liberals. Since the second world war the main parties of the left and right in Germany have shown a readiness to work with each other rather than allow extremism to gain a foothold in government (they may be about to do it again). In Chile, Pinochet was eventually defeated in 1989 by an alliance of Christian Democrats and Socialists, jointly committed to the preservation of democracy. The survival of democracy requires politicians willing to put long-term stability ahead of short-term gain and ready to recognise that what goes around comes around. But knowing what it takes is not the same as knowing how to make it happen. The great weakness of this book is that it regards history as a pick and mix of useful lessons for us to drawn on. It treats context as though it were more or less irrelevant. Is today’s US really much like 1930s Belgium? And if not, what possible use is it to tell 21st-century Republicans that they ought to learn from how Belgian Catholic politicians resisted temptation a century ago? Context still matters. Levitsky and Ziblatt hold up the US Senate of the 1950s as an example of an institution where mutual forbearance was the essence of the rules of the game. But that same Senate was also the institution that effectively entrenched the racist order of the American south, as these authors acknowledge. Recognising that a club of old white men is capable of taking it in turns to enjoy the privileges of office is little help seeing how to do things once we believe that kind of club should be consigned to history. Levitsky and Ziblatt criticise the great 18th-century French political thinker Montesquieu for insisting that good constitutional design was enough to constrain “overreaching power” – and for neglecting the importance of norms in making any political system work. But they neglect the thing that Montesquieu never forgot: that politics is also made by the social, cultural, economic and even climactic circumstances in which it happens. This book has remarkably little to say about the conditions that might be driving current popular discontent with democratic norms, including the impact of digital technology, the changing nature of work, the threat of rising inequality and the reconfiguring of gender relations, however far we still have to go. We won’t find the norms to stabilise democracy in this changed world by looking for them in the world it has supplanted. Levitsky and Ziblatt say that political parties and other gatekeepers are essential to ensure democracy stays the course. They lament the demise of the smoke-filled rooms of political insiders that kept the rabble-rousers at bay. But the smoke-filled rooms are long gone, seen off by smartphones and social media, not to mention 21st-century standards of health and safety. It’s no good asking what will replicate them. We need to know how to get by without them. This is a provocative and readable book, but in the end it is also an unsatisfying one. It shares the weakness of too much contemporary political science, by treating history as a useful guide to the future, despite the paucity of the dataset, the superficiality of much of the evidence, and the long track record we have of being surprised by what comes next. I say this as a historian: if we want to know how our democracies might die, we have to stop looking to our yesterdays. • How Democracies Die, What History Tells Us About Our Future by Steve Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt (Viking, £16.99).

Low prices, aviator jackets, children’s clothing and new makeup ranges helped Primark outperform rivals – even though it does not sell online, the source of most sales growth in the sector. Sales rose 4% at Primark’s UK stores open for more than a year in the 16 weeks to 6 January, analysts estimated. The clothing chain said it had benefited because it kept prices steady. Many rivals had increased prices in response to rising costs caused by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Kate Ormrod, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said Primark’s strong end to 2017 in the UK, after 10% total domestic growth in its previous financial year, meant it was likely to overtake Next. Primark holds a 6.9% share of the clothing market by value, compared with Next at 7.1%. Marks &amp; Spencer remains the UK’s biggest clothing retailer with an 8.1% share. “The clothing sector is polarised, as mid-market players such as Next, M&amp;S and Debenhams lose out to premium and value rivals, with Primark adept at capitalising on shoppers trading down,” Ormrod said. All three chains are closing stores while Primark continues to expand. All of Next’s growth over Christmas was online, where sales rose 13.6%; its high street stores suffered a 6.1% slump. In contrast, Primark plans to open 1.2m sq ft of space internationally this year. In the UK, it opened a store in Charlton, south London, and a larger outlet in Rotherham in November. The rise of the cut-price clothing chain mirrors the changes taking place in the grocery market where traditional supermarkets are losing share to discounters Aldi and Lidl. John Bason, the finance director of Primark’s parent company, Associated British Foods (ABF), said the number of visitors to its UK stores had risen, and womenswear sales were up despite many of its rivals reporting a tough Christmas, particularly on the high street. “It’s all about the merchandise and the prices we’ve got,” he said. “There was no inflation across the piece.” Primark performed significantly better in the UK than in the rest of Europe where analysts said sales fell up to 6% at established stores. Total sales for the group rose 7% as it opened 8% more space, suggesting an overall 1% fall at established stores over the period. Shares in ABF slid 3.6% on Thursday as analysts were disappointed by the poor performance in other European countries and a 12% fall in revenues at the group’s sugar business amid falling prices for the commodity. The decline across much of the continent was partly caused by unseasonably warm weather in October in many countries. Sales at Primark’s existing stores, particularly in the Netherlands, were also down because the retailer had opened more stores. Primark’s strong performance bucks the trend in the UK as it does not sell goods online and so is missing out on the shift to home deliveries. Total non-food retail sales fell 1.4% nationwide in the three months to 30 December, according to the monthly British Retail Consortium and KPMG sales monitor, the lowest since March 2009. Online sales of non-food rose 6.2%. Primark’s website and social media activity play a key role in tempting shoppers into stores, according to Bason. The company has 11 million followers, nearly half of whom are on Instagram. Primark’s social media following is rising rapidly as young people increasingly use their mobile phones to browse fashions before heading into stores. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/21/the-womens-issue-1968-from-the-observer-magazine-archive","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T05:59:13Z","webTitle":"From the archive: the women’s issue, 1968","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/21/the-womens-issue-1968-from-the-observer-magazine-archive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/21/the-womens-issue-1968-from-the-observer-magazine-archive","fields":{"headline":"From the archive: the women’s issue, 1968","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Next month it will be 100 years since women got the vote – and what a roller-coaster century it has been. With 2018 hailed as the year of women and Oprah Winfrey’s rousing Golden Globes speech still ringing in our ears, let’s take a deep dive into the Observer Magazine women’s issue half a century ago today. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of women getting the vote, the 28 January 1968 cover featured a perfectly coiffed mother and daughter, sporting matching red ensembles. Questionable collars aside, that image of maternal domesticity served as a rather misleading backdrop for some quite radical journalism, told almost exclusively from a female perspective. The magazine particularly grappled with the then unusual phenomenon of working mothers. As part of a series of interviews with pioneering career women, Carolyn Vadasz, ballet dancer and granddaughter of suffragette Mabel Elliott, muses: ‘A mother trying to combine career and marriage is like backing an outsider both ways – the chances of success are very small.’ Cathy Come Home actor Carol White offers a more pragmatic case for having a job: ‘My husband suggested I did the odd bit of acting again when I started to get a bit depressed at home. Women can become very bogged down with the kids. It’s much nicer for a man to come home to a wife who’s got something to talk about.’ Perhaps the most rousing interview is with Barbara Castle, renowned for her quick temper and no-nonsense approach. ‘I get very cross when people ask what it is like being a woman in the cabinet. If I’ve made the point once, I’ve made it a hundred times… I’ve never been a man, so I don’t know if it feels any different being a man in the cabinet. I just suspect that whatever you are, you don’t go around thinking about your sex all the time when you happen to be very, very busy.’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/17/chelsea-talks-west-ham-andy-carroll-transfer","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T10:34:24Z","webTitle":"Chelsea open talks with West Ham over signing Andy Carroll on permanent deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/17/chelsea-talks-west-ham-andy-carroll-transfer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/17/chelsea-talks-west-ham-andy-carroll-transfer","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea open talks with West Ham over signing Andy Carroll on permanent deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Chelsea have indicated they would be willing to sign Andy Carroll on a permanent basis and have opened discussions with West Ham. The Premier League champions are scrutinising a number of forwards in an attempt to ease the workload on Álvaro Morata and were initially interested in taking Carroll on a six-month loan. West Ham would want around £20m for a player who has 18 months on his £70,000-a-week deal. The 29-year-old, who missed Tuesday’s FA Cup win over Shrewsbury Town with an ankle injury, has nine England caps but has scored only twice this season. He does not have the profile of player to whom Chelsea would normally turn, because of his limited resale value and injury record. Yet Antonio Conte’s team have struggled of late to convert chances and the manager believes Carroll would add a different dimension. Chelsea have found options limited in the midwinter market. There is interest in other forwards – Red Star Belgrade’s Ghana international Richmond Boakye has also been assessed and Conte admires Christian Benteke at Crystal Palace – but there is an acceptance it may be easier to pursue short-term targets. Carroll, even at £20m, may fall into that category and would be eligible for European competition, with Chelsea playing Barcelona in the Champions League next month. Any arrival would allow Michy Batshuayi, who has made three Premier League starts in 18 months, to join Sevilla on loan. West Ham have made it clear they will not countenance Carroll’s departure on a temporary basis but are open to selling a player who joined for £15m from Liverpool in 2013 after a season on loan at Upton Park. Javier Hernández and Diafra Sakho are also effectively up for sale. Chelsea signed Ross Barkley from Everton this month and had hoped to follow that up with a move for Alex Sandro at Juventus. However, talks have failed to yield a compromise on the fee for the left wing-back, prompting Chelsea to widen their search. There is interest in Alex Telles at Porto and Roma’s Emerson Palmieri."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/18/a-landscape-of-lies-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"A Landscape of Lies review – film-making frauds serve up a taxing watch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/a-landscape-of-lies-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/18/a-landscape-of-lies-review","fields":{"headline":"A Landscape of Lies review – film-making frauds serve up a taxing watch","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There’s something heroic in the backstory to this ropey Brit geezer-gangster film; it would be nice to report that it’s a classic, or even good. Sadly no. But maybe James Franco or Mel Brooks will make a hilarious drama about how it came to be made. A Landscape of Lies began as a phoney movie that existed only on paper: a scam to defraud the tax authorities, who suspiciously demanded to see the finished print. So, with some chutzpah, these dodgy fake-film chancers quickly cobbled together an actual movie – this movie – with its director and cast doing their best and entirely unaware of the illegality. Their employers were convicted in 2013, and only now can the film be seen: a clunkily written and embarrassingly acted extravaganza of silliness, like many another more expensive and notionally legal Britpic.

To join in you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. The truth about why we don’t use all our annual holiday leave ‘Work is important, but your health is everything’ I pushed on through for 12 years, working long hours, nonstop, even feeling guilty whenever I had to call in sick after a car accident (with concussion/broken bones). I went on and on, only to finally collapse. I can’t work anymore, and what that does to one’s self worth is impossible to describe. So I wish I had someone tell me to take time off, use my annual leave, to not check my emails once at home, and continue to work even while trying to fall asleep. Work is important, but your health is everything. Please everyone put your life and your health first, and take all the leave you can get. victoriangrl ‘Presenteism in the workplace despite the fact that so much office work can be done online from anywhere’ Holidays in the UK or abroad; even daytrips, are now so expensive that even if you have leave from work all you end up doing is sitting at home. The bulk of my leave days are now used going for job interviews, waiting in for deliveries or repairs, taking relatives to medical appointments or attending parents’ consultation afternoons. I have a sense that the government from the Cameron days onward has been content the hoi-polloi to stay at home and not clutter up places the well-off want to go. Such attitudes are reinforced by presenteism in the workplace despite the fact that so much office work can be done online from anywhere. KThorpe Has strong become the respectable face of skinny for young women? ‘Anything that makes people healthier’ A friend of mine has recently got into lifting weights and bodybuilding and it’s given her a new lease of life- especially since she’s watching her diet more closely. I think anything that makes people healthier, as long as it’s not taken to an extreme, should be encouraged. We’re quick to criticise those that don’t exercise and have poor diets, so let’s congratulate those that do. jimbo246 ‘There’s a happy balance’ I’m a female just gone sixty. I’ve been a runner since my late twenties but in my early fifties my running was getting slower and slower. I started doing weights, and found that not only has my miles per minute time dropped back to the times I achieved in my forties, but improved muscle strength has kept me injury free. I’d say that it may be more beneficial for women to do some form of weights training (there are classes like Body Pump at my gym where the participants are mainly women), than men. There’s a happy balance of course! mugclass ‘What you will get by building strength is a better metabolism and less chance of injury’ The article hints that women put on muscle much slower than men, but for years whenever I’ve encouraged women to lift weights I’ve commonly been told “but I don’t want to look like a body builder!” So allow me to repeat: you will not look like a body builder unless you are a body builder. What you will get by building strength is a better metabolism and less chance of injury to bone and muscle. IskarJarak Will Australians turn their back on the Queen for a celebrity president? ‘If we’re going to change anything in Australia, it should be set 4 years terms’ Australian politics is an entirely different beast to the US model. I’m not a republican, am more than happy with the current model. If we’re going to change anything in Australia, it should be set 4 years terms (like the US) and two tiers of government, not three. And if I had a wish list, I’d ban lawyers from becoming politicians. LiveSimply ‘I am strongly in favour of constitutional monarchy’ The non compulsory voting system, the campaign for Republicans to occupy State Legislatures and allow shifting of electoral boundaries and stripping of electoral rolls are factors. I voted for Gough Whitlam in my first election, which occurred after the dismissal but I am strongly in favour of constitutional monarchy and in keeping the system as it is now.

(See 2.37pm.) Steve Baker, the Brexit minister, has told MPs that the government is not expecting to ratify the withdrawal treaty with the EU until parliament has passed the withdrawal agreement bill. (See 5pm.) The government has won the first two of today’s votes on the EU withdrawal bill with majorities of 13 and 24. Theresa May’s spokesman has said Ben Bradley will keep his job as Conservative vice-chair for young people, despite having suggested that unemployed people should opt for free vasectomies rather than having children they could not afford. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Before the voting started, Steve Baker, the Brexit minister, wound up for the government. If you were watching Theresa May give evidence to the Commons liaison committee at the end of last year, you will remember an almost comic exchange between May and Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee. Cooper repeatedly tried to get May to confirm that MPs would vote on the EU withdrawal agreement and implementation bill before the withdrawal agreement gets ratified by the government. (May has promised MPs a vote on the bill, but obviously that will be a bit meaningless if by then the treaty has already been ratified.) But May just refused point blank to answer Cooper’s question. (Given her stubbornness and message discipline, in another world May would have made an ideal junior minister in the Gordon Brown Treasury.) In the debate a few minutes ago Ken Clarke asked Baker the same question. And, unlike Cooper, he got an answer. Baker said the Brexit department had set out its position in this written ministerial statement before Christmas. But he went on: Both Houses will have meaningful votes on whether to accept the agreement. And it is my expectation that we would not ratify before that primary legislation [the withdrawal agreement and implementation bill] has gone through. This goes beyond what May said, or did not say, to the liaison committee. Baker said the government is not expecting to ratify the withdrawal treaty with the EU until parliament has passed the withdrawal agreement bill. But he did not give an absolute assurance that that would be the case. MPs are now voting on an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill. According to the Labour whips, there could be up to eight votes. The government is not expected to lose any of them. Earlier I referred to Christophe Bondy, senior counsel to Canada when it was negotiating the Canada-EU free trade deal (Ceta), telling MPs that if the UK left the single market, it would face trade barriers with the EU, regardless of what any free trade deal said. Bondy was giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. This is what Bondy said about the disadvantages of a free trade agreement. With a free trade agreement, you have regulatory autonomy, but you have borders. For Canada it was a huge step forward to get rid of the walls that tariff barriers, for example, create, or rules that so no Canadian need apply, lots of those things. That’s great. But you step over the border and you have to show that you are compliant with the local rules in terms of the provision of services. You have to show that your permits meet the compliance rules in that new regulatory space. And in practice that can be a significant barrier. In a trading arrangement, if that’s what the UK wants, if it just wants a free trade agreement, it wants to retain complete regulatory autonomy, it can do that, but there will be trade barriers, in the sense of those regulatory conformity issues. Bondy also compared Brexit to blowing up a bridge. He told the MPs: A free trade agreement is like two parties are on either side of a river and are considering building a bridge across that river because they think it will be in their economic benefit. And that’s what the Ceta does. And I think it does provide for Canada and the EU real economic benefits. What the UK situation with the EU right now is that that bridge has been there for 45 years. Communities have been built up on either side of it. There are buildings on the bridge. And you are deciding what part of it you want to blow up without bankrupting yourself. Two organisations fighting Brexit have said Bondy’s evidence is significant. Open Britain, which says it is fighting against a hard Brexit, put out this response from the Labour MP Ian Murray. David Davis says he wants a Canada-plus-plus-plus deal, but the message from Canada’s trade negotiator is very clear: the best deal we could get is to stay in the single market and customs union. The Canada-style deal that is actually on offer from the EU would be disastrous for our country, and the government knows it. The prime minister said in Florence that it would damage our economy, and the chancellor says it ‘does not even remotely replicate the access we have as an EU member.’ And Best for Britain, which is campaigning for a second Brexit referendum, put out this statement from the Lib Dem MP Tom Brake. Mr Bondy, who knows more about trade than virtually anyone in the world, is bluntly restating the blindingly obvious - the arbitrary red lines set by PM May are a guarantee that the UK will have a poorer trade deal after Brexit than the one we have now. This is the first time ever that a country is seeking to secure a worse trade deal than the one it currently holds. The Insolvency Service has said that bonus payments to directors and former executives at collapsed construction giant Carillion have been stopped. Nick Fletcher and Graeme Wearden have more on this on their business live blog. President Macron has joined Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker et al (see 9.27am) in saying it is not too late for the UK to change its mind about Brexit, the Evening Standard reports. An aide to Macron told reporters: If tomorrow, or the day after, the United Kingdom decided to change its mind, it’s clear that we would look at this with kindness. But it’s not up to us if the United Kingdom wants to change its mind. Chuka Umunna, the Labour pro-European, has welcomed the news. Justine Greening, who was sacked as education secretary last week and who left the cabinet after refusing a move to work and pensions, has taken to sitting in the “remainer corner” in the House of Commons since her return to the backbenches, alongside some of the pro-European Tories who rebelled last year over the EU withdrawal bill. She is there today and this afternoon, for the first time since she became free to speak out after leaving the government, she made an intervention on Europe. Greening, like her Putney constituency in south west London, was strongly pro-remain in the referendum. As education secretary she did not really speak out on Brexit issues at all, but this afternoon she effectively issued a warning to her party that, if it opts for a hard Brexit, it will prove unsustainable. She made the point when she made this intervention during a speech by her Tory colleague, Ken Clarke. She said: I represent a very young constituency here in London. And the bottom line is that, looking ahead, if Brexit doesn’t work for young people in our country, in the end it will not be sustainable. When they take their place here, they will seek to improve or undo what we have done and make it work for them. So we do absolutely have a duty in this House to look ahead and ensure that whatever we get is sustainable and works for them. By “take their place here”, she meant become MPs. And by a Brexit that “doesn’t work for young people”, she clearly implied some form of hard Brexit, although she did not elaborate. (Perhaps she will give a full speech later.) Clarke welcomed what she said and told Greening he entirely agreed. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, has pledged that the EU will continue to fund cross-border peace projects on the island of Ireland even after Brexit. Juncker said he could see “no more importance use” in EU funding than supporting initiatives which promoted peace and reconciliation between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. There had been fears that border counties particularly in Northern Ireland would no longer receive EU largesse after Brexit. The EC president told the European parliament that he wanted continued backing for the peace process in Ireland. Since the early 1990s the EU have invested hundreds of millions of euros into community and infrastructure projects especially targeted at divided communities along the border and in areas of sectarian division in places like north and west Belfast. Stressing “unconditional European commitment” to the EU’s Peace and Reconciliation Fund, Juncker’s announcement means financial support for these projects could continue up to 2025. Jeremy Corbyn has used PMQs to accuse the government of “negligence” over Carillion and launch a wholesale attack what he described as the “costly racket” of big public firms being allowed to run public services for profit. (See 1pm.) The outsourcing firm Interserve is not in a similar position to the collapsed construction and services company Carillion, the government has insisted. Theresa May will set out a timetable to break the secrecy surrounding the foreign ownership of British property worth billions after facing a House of Lords defeat at the hands of two Conservative peers. One in 10 nurses are leaving the NHS in England each year, according to official figures, raising fresh concerns about staffing shortages in hospitals. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has renewed his call for the UK to change its mind about Brexit and said he would be “happy” to let it return if it does leave the EU. (See 9.27am.) Christophe Bondy, senior counsel to Canada when it was negotiating the Canada-EU free trade deal (Ceta), has told MPs that if the UK leaves the single market, it will face trade barriers with the EU, regardless of what any free trade deal says. Bondy was speaking to the Brexit committee. Labour’s Seema Malhotra, a member of the committee, posted this clip. And Stephen Kinnock, another Labour member of the committee posted a Twitter thread summarising Bondy’s evidence. It starts here. A new treaty on the handling of migrants at the French port of Calais is set to be signed by Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron, according to reports in the French media. As the Press Association reports, press on the other side of the Channel reported a statement from the Elysee Palace which said the treaty would “complete” the Le Touquet agreement, which allows Britain and France to station border officials on each other’s soil. Downing Street declined to comment on the reports, which came ahead of a high-profile UK-France summit at Sandhurst on Thursday. Macron is understood to be seeking new financial contributions from the UK to bolster security at the port, which has attracted thousands of migrants hoping to sneak on board trains and ships heading for the UK over recent years. French media reported the Elysee as saying the new treaty was “still in the process of being finalised”, but would focus principally on the handling of unaccompanied minors, asylum requests and family reunions. It will reportedly include “precise commitments” from the UK to process asylum claims more quickly, accept more young people travelling alone and to deliver “significant” extra sums for frontier protection. May has welcomed Macron’s decision to let the Bayeux Tapestry go on display in the UK. Speaking at PMQs, in response to a question from Bexhill and Battle MP Huw Merriman said saying Battle Abbey would be an appropriate location for the exhibition, May said: It is very significant that the Bayeux Tapestry is going to be coming to the United Kingdom and that people are going to be able to see this. I am sure we will be looking very carefully to ensure that the maximum number of people can take the benefit of seeing this tapestry. May has told MPs that, if President Trump does not get invited to Prince Harry’s wedding later this year, that won’t be here responsibility. “I’m not responsible for invitations to the royal wedding,” she told MPs. Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, has urged Saudi Arabia and its allies have been urged to keep ports open to allow the flow of aid into Yemen amid concerns the blockade could be reimposed. David Miliband, the former UK foreign secretary, has urged Theresa May and other world leaders not to forget about civilians being bombed in Syria at a time when the UN security council has been “driven out of the picture”. Suspended Labour MP Jared O’Mara is returning to work with “immediate effect” after scaling back his duties following a backlash over offensive blog posts, the Press Association reports. In December, the Sheffield Hallam MP’s office said he was cutting down his activities on the advice of doctors. The 36-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, has not attended parliament since. His office said at the time he would continue to serve voters in his Sheffield Hallam constituency in other ways, but it is unclear how he has done so. In a statement, O’Mara announced he would now be resuming his duties on a phased return with immediate effect. It comes after the Yorkshire Post visited his constituency office on Friday to find he was absent. O’Mara said: I am so pleased to be returning to work. Last June I was incredibly proud to have been elected the member of parliament for Sheffield Hallam and I am now delighted to be moving forward and able to represent my constituents. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs. There is no consensus today, with some calling it for May, some for Corbyn, and some declaring it a draw. From the Daily Mirror’s Jason Beattie From PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From the Daily Mirror’s Kevin Maguire From HuffPost’s Paul Waugh From the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn From the Mail on Sunday’s Dan Hodges From Sky’s Lewis Goodall From the Guardian’s Peter Walker From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman From New European’s Matt Kelly From the FT’s Stefan Stern Here is the Press Association take on PMQs. Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of “negligence” over Carillion as he urged Theresa May to end the “costly racket” of private companies running services for the public. The Labour leader said the “ruins” of the collapsed construction giant lie around the prime minister and he called for private firms to be “shown the door”. May said a third of government contracts with Carillion were let by the previous Labour administration, adding she wants to provide “good quality public services, delivered at best value to the taxpayer”. The fate of Carillion dominated the pair’s exchanges at Prime Minister’s Questions. Concluding his attacks on the government, Mr Corbyn said: “This isn’t one isolated case of government negligence and corporate failure - it’s a broken system. “Under this Government, Virgin and Stagecoach can spectacularly mismanage the East Coast Main Line and be let off a 2 billion payment. “Capita and Atos can continue to wreck the lives through damaging disability assessments of many people with disabilities and win more Government-funded contracts. “G4S promised to provide security at the Olympics - failed to do so and the Army had to step in and save the day. “These corporations need to be shown the door - we need our public services provided by public employees with a public service ethos and a strong public oversight. “As the ruins of Carillion lie around her, will the prime minister act to end this costly racket of the relationship between government and some of these companies?” May cited Labour’s involvement with Carillion before outlining the government’s plan for public services. She added: “We’re making sure in this case that public services continue to be provided, that workers in those public services are supported and taxpayers are protected. But what Labour oppose isn’t just a role for private companies in public services - it’s the private sector as a whole.” May said the vast majority of workers in the country are employed in the private sector but claimed Labour has “turned its back on investment, on growth and on jobs”. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, used this two questions about PMQs to ask about Brexit, and the government’s failure to publish impact assessments. In response to his first question, Theresa May said the government was “constantly looking at the impact decisions will have on our economy”. Blackford then said: Nineteen months after the EU referendum and the prime minister has not a shred of economic analysis on the impact of leaving the single market ... Leaving the single market will cost each Scottish citizen up to £2,300 a year. How much of a hit will families take before the PM recognises the folly of leaving the single market? May replied: We saw the figures this morning for GDP in Scotland. In the third quarter GDP in Scotland grew by 0.2%, in the rest of the UK it grew by 0.4%. Over the last year Scotland grew by 0.6%, in the UK as a whole it grew 1.7%. My analysis? 1.7 is more than 0.6, you’re better off with the Conservative government than an SNP one. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, asks if May will support a bill in the Welsh assembly ensuring Westminster does not keep powers after Brexit that should be devolved. May says Saville Roberts’s descripion of what is happening is wrong. There will be an amendment to clause 11 to the EU withdrawal bill introduced in the Lords, she says. Alberta Costa, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees that sustainable development needs to take into account the needs of the environment. May says it is possible to protect the environment and promote growth at the same time. Labour’s Stephen Timms says families on low incomes face a benefit trap because if they receive a small pay rise, they will lose free school meals. That means they will lose out overall. That is a benefit trap. It should not happen. May says under universal credit 50,000 more children will be eligible for free school meals than under the old system. May says loneliness is the sad reality of life for too many people. She says she will be hosting a reception for the Jo Cox Foundation later on. Their work on loneliness is very important. She can confirm that she has appointed a minister for loneliness. Labour’s Imran Hussain asks about school funding. He says schools in his constituency are missing out on funding. May says increased amounts of funding are going into schools generally. Victoria Prentis, a Conservative, asks about Syria, and praises the bravery of charity staff from the Hansard Society working with children in the country. May praises the work of the volunteers. Labour’s Alex Norris asks about modern slavery. May says the government is working on this issue, not just in the UK but with partners across the world. Huw Merriman, a Conservative, asks May to ensure the Bayeux Tapestry goes to Battle Abbey in his constituency. May says Hastings, Amber Rudd’s constituency, also wants it. The government will look at where it can be seen by most people. Labour’s Nic Dakin asks about a constituent having to wait too long for pain relief treatment. May says the government is putting more money into the NHS. An extra £2.8bn went in in the budget. But the government also wants to ensure all hospitals are world class, and acting in accordance with best practice. A Conservative, asks about radiotherapy treatment under the NHS at a local hospital. May says the government wants people to have access to these treatments. These are decisions to be taken at a local level, she says. PMQs - Snap verdict: One of the best PMQs for ages, with strong, detailed questions, the prime minister being properly held to account, and Corbyn and May using the exchanges to make big, political arguments. Corbyn comfortably come off best - he has the wind behind him on this issue - but May managed to pull it back a bit with her final answer. Until then, although clearly across the detail of her brief, she struck the wrong tone in at least two places. Refusing to engage with Corbyn second question just because it did not conclude with a question mark sounded petty, and her repeated insistence that the government was just a “customer” of Carillion, while technically correct, made her sound rather feeble. She’s not just a customer - she’s the prime minister, armed with the full power and authority of the UK state. May came to office promising a crackdown on excessive corporate and a bolder and more imaginative PM would have use the Carillion catastrophe to reboot this whole agenda. Surprisingly, May did not even try to do this, and her response to Corbyn’s question about what the Carillion directors are receiving sounded correct but uninspiring. That paved the way for Corbyn’s powerful final question/soundbite, a tirade against the whole private sector contracting “racket”. It was his best moment. May’s final answer was her most effective too. Her argument about Corbyn and McDonnell being fundamentally anti-business is persuasive enough to have some traction, but attacking New Labour for putting these contracts out to tender in the first place was probably a mistake. If anyone is going to get credit of opposing New Labour neoliberalism on an issue like this, it’s not going to be May, but Corbyn. Corbyn says Carillion was notorious for paying its bills late. Why did the government allow this? Will May back Labour’s call for abiding by the prompt payment code to be a requirement for a firm getting a public contract? May says this has been an issue since she has been an MP. The government has taken action. She says the government will help workers who are unemployed as as result. Corbyn says this is not one isolated case. This is a broken system. Virgin and Stagecoach can spectacularly mismanage the East Coast mainline and be let off a late payment. Capita and Atos can get new contracts, even though they mismanage benefit checks. Companies like this need to be shown the door. Will May act to end the racket of the relationship between these companies and the government. May says a third of the Carillion contracts were let by Labour. Labour oppose not just a role for private companies, but the private sector as a whole. The vast majority of people are employed by the private sector, but John McDonnell calls them the enemy. The Labour party will always put politics before people. Corbyn says he asked if the government was negligent. The government is supposed to protect public money. So why - “and this is a question that the PM needs to answer’ - did the position of crown representative remain vacant, when shares were in freefall. May, in respone to heckling from Emily Thornberry, says Thornberry has praised Carillion in the past. May says a Cabinet Office official took over those crown representative procedures. That is a standard procedure. Corbyn says they were not looking at Carillion very well. It went into liquidation with debt of £1.29bn. The chief executive will be paid for another 10 months. Can May assure MPs that not a single penny more will go to the chief executive or directors? May says her understanding is that a number of facilities manager contractors who have come to an agreement with the official receiver to ensure they are paid. On bonuses, May says the official receiver’s investigation will be fast-tracked, and will look into previous directors and their action. And the official receiver can look into payments and recover them. The official receiver must be free to do their job. She says Corbyn said the government had to ensure Carillion was properly managed. But it was a customer of Carillion, not its boss. Jeremy Corbyn says the government has awarded £2bn worth of contracts to Carillion in the last six months, even after profit warnings. Why? May says a profit warning means a company is not going to make as much profit as expected. If it was the case that the government pulled out of contracts whenever a profit warning was issued, that would be the best way to ensure companies failed and jobs were lost. It would also stop the government being able to provide services. The government ensured all but one of those contracts were joint ventures. So someone else was able to step in. And the Labour-run Welsh government issued Carillion a contract last July. And Labour-run Leeds council agreed a contract with Carillion only last week. Corbyn says Leeds has not signed a contract with Carillion. Between July and the end of last year the share price fell by 90%. Some contracts were issued after the third profits warning. It looks as if the government was handing out contracts either to keep the company afloat or was negligent. May says she will answer a question if Corbyn asks one. (He did not turn his last sentence into a question.) Simon Hoare, a Conservative, asks May to support manufacturing. May says she is happy to give that commitment. It is very pleasing to see ONS figures saying production has grown for eight months, the longest streak since 1994. The economy is strong. Labour’s Catherine McKinnell says the government must take responsibility for its role in the Carillion mess. Will all the apprentices be able to complete their training and get trained? Theresa May says this has been a difficult time for a number of people. Carillion employees working on public projects will continue to get paid. But the government does not run Carillion; it is a customer. It wants to reassure workers, Carillion pensioners, and service users. The government is aware of the issues around apprentices. The minister responsible will be looking at what can be done. This is from the Spectator’s James Forsyth. The SNP’s David Linden has put on a special tie for his question at PMQs. PMQs is about to start. Ben Bradley, the 28-year-old Conservative MP appointed a party vice chairman for youth last week, is turning into a textbook example of how provocative bloggers should think twice before venturing on a career in politics - or at least work out how to erase their internet history. Yesterday he apologised for a blog he posted six years ago suggesting that the unemployed should have vasectomies rather than father children they could not afford. He was forced to respond after BuzzFeed uncovered what he had written. Now BuzzFeed has unearthed another blog from the Bradley oeuvre. In a post written in 2011 headed “Public sector workers: They don’t know they’re born!”, he urged people in the public sector to stop complaining about their pay. He said: I can’t believe for the life of me that people in the public sector are so lost in their own fantasy land that they can’t see how good they’ve got it. Yes, okay, many teachers and teaching assistants and nurses work hard for their money and deserve to get excellent pay and pensions, but headmasters on seventy-odd grand a year ... If you think your job or your pay isn’t good enough for you, quit! There are millions and millions of other people who will quite happily take your burden off your hands! If you think you deserve better pay, then get a job with better pay. If you don’t feel capable of getting a job with better pay then be grateful for the one you’ve got! Bradley would have been a student at the time he wrote this. But, even so, public sector pay was frozen at the time, and no one in frontline Tory politics was making comments like this. Southerners are more likely to consider standing for election than northerners, according to new research carried out by academics from the University of Bath. Using a survey of 10,000 people, which involved asking if they had ever considered trying to get elected as a council or an MP, the researchers sought to investigate what drives political ambition. And they found gender, salary, class and location were all significant factors. You can read the report in full, An Analysis of Political Ambition in Britain by Peter Allen and David Cutts, here (pdf). Here is a summary of the findings sent out by the University of Bath. Only one in ten had thought of standing as a candidate or putting themselves forward. Men were more than twice as likely as women to have considered running. Eighteen to 24-year-olds had the highest levels of political ambition of any age group. Highly educated respondents, e.g. with a university degree, were more than three times as likely to have political ambitions than those who failed to finish secondary school or quit even earlier. Those from mixed-race backgrounds expressed slightly higher levels of ambition than those who were white. People identifying as South Asian were least likely to stand. More than twice as many people identifying as upper class had considered putting themselves forward than those in the middle or lower class bracket. Those earning in excess of the average UK annual salary of £27,600 were more likely to consider running for office. Respondents in the South are more ambitious politically than those living in the North. Those whose parents were politically active during their childhood were more likely to run for office than those without. Confident and outgoing people with faith in politicians are more likely to have political ambition. They are not necessarily the kindest or most sympathetic individuals however. Here is are two charts from the report showing how salary, class, education, ethnicity, and gender affect ambition. If the bar goes right, that means people in this group are more likely than average to be interested in standing for office. If the bar goes left, they are less interested than average. And here is the chart with the regional figures. Peter Allen, who led the research, said: Our political institutions don’t ‘look like’ the British people because of these biases. This study highlights how political parties risk further alienating the public who already think Westminster is run by London elites. They should adjust how they recruit to minimise this effect. If they don’t then people will switch off long term, and politics will increasingly become the domain of the wealthy and highly-educated. It’s a matter of self-preservation. In the European parliament debate Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has just delivered a speech. He said that he did not want a second referendum on Brexit, but that he thought EU leaders were conspiring to make it happen. He told MEPs: I don’t want a second referendum on Brexit, absolutely not. But I fear that you are all working together with Tony Blair and Nick Clegg to make sure that we get the worst possible deal. I say that because I’ve seen it all before. The difference is, if you force the Brits to do it again, there will be a different outcome. By “different outcome”, he meant different from Ireland and Denmark, where second referenda on EU treaties resulted in a vote against being reversed. Farage has, of course, changed his tune somewhat since Thursday last week, when he said he was warming to the idea of a second referendum. He told Channel 5’s The Wright Stuff: My mind is actually changing on all this. What is for certain is that the Cleggs, the Blairs, the Adonises will never, ever, ever give up. They will go on whingeing and whining and moaning all the way through this process. So maybe, just maybe, I’m reaching the point of thinking that we should have a second referendum on EU membership. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has announced today that he is allocating an extra £15m “to boost police resources and help officers tackle knife crime”. This came a day after Scotland Yard’s head of knife crime said young children should be taught about this issue because the problem is so serious. One of the big talking points this morning is the announcement that President Macron is going to mark his visit to the UK tomorrow by declaring that France will lend the Bayeux Tapestry to Britain, so that it can go on display here. The tapestry, which records the death of King Harold at the Battle of Hastings, is, of course, a vivid illustration of what happened to the first English leader who tried to take a stand against integration with Europe. Here is our story on the offer. And here is some Twitter comment. From ITV’s political editor Robert Peston From the Labour peer Lord Adonis Earlier I quoted Jean-Claude Juncker saying, if the UK left the EU, it could re-apply to join under article 94. (See 9.27am.) That is what the translator said Juncker said, but either he or Juncker mis-spoke, because the relevant article is article 49. This is what it says: Any European State which respects the values referred to in article 2 and is committed to promoting them may apply to become a member of the Union. The European parliament and national parliaments shall be notified of this application. The applicant state shall address its application to the council, which shall act unanimously after consulting the commission and after receiving the assent of the European parliament, which shall act by an absolute majority of its component members. The conditions of admission and the adjustments to the treaties on which the union is founded, which such admission entails, shall be the subject of an agreement between the member states and the applicant state. This agreement shall be submitted for ratification by all the contracting States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. The conditions of eligibility agreed upon by the European council shall be taken into account. Thanks to LegalRage2 in the comments BTL for flagging this up. UPDATE: In the comments BTL LearningIsLife offers this possible explanation. In German, one of Juncker’s language, 94 is spoken as ‘vier und neunzig’ or ‘4 and 90’; while 49 is ‘neun und vierzig’ or ‘9 and 40’, so that could be where it got confused. Varadkar says it is hard to imagine the Good Friday agreement being signed without EU membership. Ireland is determined to protect it, he says. And that is why Ireland is so insistent there must not be a hard border after Brexit. He says the Irish people are grateful for the unswerving support they have had from the European parliament, the European commission and the European council. The EU has recognised the unique position of Ireland, he says. He says a majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU. And a majority of people elected to the Northern Ireland assembly want the UK to remain in the single market and the customs union. He says the agreement reached before Christmas makes it likely a hard border will be avoided. But now the EU must ensure that “what has been promised in theory is delivered in practice” and that there is no “backsliding”. He says he hopes the new relationship between the UK and the EU is as close and as deep as possible, consistent with the need to protect the integrity of the single market. Varadkar has delivered a passage of his speech in French. The Independent’s Jon Stone is impressed. This is from RTE’s Tony Connolly. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, is about to address the European parliament. You can watch it live here. David Miliband, the former Labour foreign secretary who now runs the International Rescue Committee aid organisation in America, said this morning that the British government should do more to highlight the humanitarian crisis being caused by the war in Syria. Speaking on the Today programme, he said: It cannot be right that civilians are being bombed to hell without the UN Security Council playing any role at all - as far as anyone can see, it has been driven off the scene ... The UK should have a foreign policy that matches the responsibility that goes with being a permanent member of the security council. At the moment the UN has been sidelined when it comes to the greatest war in the Middle East at the moment, the Syrian war. That cannot be in the interests of the region or, frankly, in the interests of the wider world because one of the lessons of the last seven years in Syria is that nothing that is born in Syria stays in Syria and the instability is exported beyond its borders, not confined within them. Yesterday Donald Tusk, president of the European council, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission (see here) and Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European commission (see here) all said explicitly that it wasn’t too late for the UK to change its mind about Brexit. Their comments killed once and for all any specultion about article 50 not being revocable. But they received a frosty response from London. Asked about the comments, the prime minister’s spokesman told journalists at the lobby briefing: “We have been absolutely clear that the British people voted to leave the European Union and that is what we will be doing.” But Juncker has not given up. He was speaking again in the European parliament this morning, ostensibly about the Bulgarian presidency, and he took the opportunity to restate his claim that Britain could still decide to stay in the EU if it wanted. And he went even further; even if the British did leave, the EU would be happy to take them back, he said. He told the MEPs: Our hand remains outstretched. The UK people, the UK government, may wish to find a different way out. We’re very much willing to deal with them. We are not throwing the British out. We would like the British to stay. And if they so wish, they should be allowed to do so. I did note that in London there was a rather irritated response to this proposal. But, note that even if the British leave according to article 50, then article 94 [Juncker meant article 49 - see 10.05am] would allow them to accede again. And I would be happy to facilitate that. I would not want to push anyone into a corner. Juncker also said that Brexit would be a “lose-lose” situation for Britain and for the EU and that he continued to see it as “a catastrophe”. But he suggested that the EU may be partly responsible; the British had never felt “entirely comfortable with the EU”, he acknowledged, and he said the “guilt” for Brexit “lies on many shoulders”. At Westminster the main event today will be PMQs. We have not heard from Theresa May on the subject of Carillion, but today the story is likely to dominate the PMQs exchanges. It is a big opportunity for Jeremy Corbyn, who has described the collapse of Carillion as “a watershed moment”. For more on Carillion, do read my colleague Graeme Wearden’s business live blog. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, addresses the European parliament. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 1pm: MPs begin their final day of debate on the EU withdrawal bill before it goes to the Lords. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today’ top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

The former Labour politician, who runs the International Rescue Committee, an aid NGO, said the UK as a member of the security council should not be leaving diplomatic activity in Syria to Russia, Iran and Turkey. He highlighted renewed evidence that civilians in Idlib and elsewhere were being bombed by the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and the ever-growing refugee crisis, as reasons the UK and others needed to renew pressure at the UN. He told BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme: “If the Syrian government carries on with this tactic, 2.5 million people are in the firing line. It cannot be right that civilians are being bombed to hell without the UN security council playing any role at all. It has been driven off the scene.” Miliband said the UK “does have a role here as a member of the UN security council, which is to pay attention to the humanitarian situation that exists”. He said Syria had been a killing field for seven years and there was a risk that the “tactics Assad is using to end this war are going to create an endless war”. Turkish officials warned last week that the Assad regime’s assault on Idlib, the last Syrian province under rebel control, could spark a “new wave of migration” and add significantly to the refugee crisis in the region. Tens of thousands of people have fled from the frontlines in Idlib. According to the UN, about 30,000 refugees moved into Idlib’s heavily populated cities and to camps along the Turkish border in the second week of January. The violence has cast doubt on efforts to negotiate a Syrian peace settlement brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran. A new deal had designated Idlib and other regions of Syria as “de-escalation zones” in an attempt to stem the violence and create the conditions for talks, but the bombardment is endangering those talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/18/new-generation-inspired-not-burdened-by-home-pressure-at-australian-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T21:16:27Z","webTitle":"New generation inspired not burdened by home pressure at Australian Open | Simon Cambers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/18/new-generation-inspired-not-burdened-by-home-pressure-at-australian-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/18/new-generation-inspired-not-burdened-by-home-pressure-at-australian-open","fields":{"headline":"New generation inspired not burdened by home pressure at Australian Open","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Billie Jean King, the former world No1 and winner of 39 grand slam titles, likes to say: “Pressure is a privilege.” It is the title of the American’s book and one that perhaps all Australian players might do well to get a copy of. It is 40 years since the last home champion at the Australian Open, when Chris O’Neil won the women’s singles, and 42 years since their last male winner, Mark Edmondson. In the intervening four decades, the likes of Wendy Turnbull, Pat Cash, Lleyton Hewitt and Pat Rafter have all gone close but for many, the desire to win the title has become almost suffocating. Watching Sam Stosur tense up almost every time she walks through the gates of Melbourne Park is the height of frustration for home fans. Good enough to be a grand slam winner at the US Open in 2011, when she beat Serena Williams, the focus of a nation seems to weigh heavy on her shoulders, just as it did for France’s Amelie Mauresmo at the French Open. In 16 attempts, Stosur has never made it past the fourth round and at times, it was better to watch her matches through the fingers of one hand. As she said a few years ago: “I put far too much pressure on myself in the Aussie summer because I really, really wanted to do well. You only get the opportunity to play at home for a few weeks and I probably built it up too big and didn’t handle the occasions on court very well at all.” But perhaps the next generation are handling it better and some actively seem to enjoy it. Nick Kyrgios, the best hope in the men’s event, says having Hewitt still around, as Davis Cup captain and an occasional player, takes some of the pressure off the leading men. “As long as he keeps playing, he’s kind of the legend that we’ve got,” he said. “Obviously we have a rich history in Australia of past champions and past legends. I’m doing my best to follow in their footsteps but it’s good to see we’ve got a good crop of guys coming up now who are making their mark.” Before Edmondson, Australian men had won the title in five of the previous six years. In the 1960s, Australian men won 32 of the 40 grand slam titles on offer. On the women’s side, Margaret Court won 64 grand slam titles in all, including a record 24 singles victories. The generations that followed suffered by comparison but Ashleigh Barty, the country’s No1 and a woman now ranked inside the top 20, believes it is an inspiration not a burden. “We’re extremely fortunate to have such legends of the game from Australia and learn from them,” she said. “On the women’s side even having a really close relationship with our Fed Cup captain, Alicia Molik, she’s been through everything you can as a tennis player. Even just getting a text message from her, seeing her in the weeks before or day before matches, it’s extra special to have that support from such legends of Australian tennis.” Media demands are understandably greater in a home grand slam and distractions can be everywhere, if players let them. “I do a lot of media but I try to stay off Twitter a lot before I play,” Kyrgios said. “I guess a couple of years ago, I’d be very into it, I’d be on social media a lot. I feel like I’m getting better with it. Now I do room service most times and I like to go out and have dinner with family or my girlfriend.” And what of the crowd, who want their men and women to win so badly. “It’s the best feeling ever, the adrenalin, the extra boost, the support you get from the very passionate Australian Open crowd is amazing,” Barty said. “It really is the best way to start the year. Hopefully we can play well, to feel a little better. I’d love to play well for myself and my team but the public and the fans as well.” And Daria Gavrilova, another Australian who plays better in Melbourne than anywhere else, said before her second-round defeat to Belgian Elise Mertens on Wednesday night she didn’t even know what pressure really meant. “I just look at it as they [the crowd] want the best for me, and I want it as much. I feel like I can put pressure on myself by [feeling] that, but I feel like I’m just going to go out there and compete really hard, hopefully not disappoint anyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/17/gkn-rejects-74bn-hostile-takeover-bid-melrose","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T12:53:18Z","webTitle":"GKN rejects £7.4bn hostile takeover bid from Melrose","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/17/gkn-rejects-74bn-hostile-takeover-bid-melrose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/17/gkn-rejects-74bn-hostile-takeover-bid-melrose","fields":{"headline":"GKN rejects £7.4bn hostile takeover bid from Melrose","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"GKN has rejected a firm £7.4bn bid from Melrose after the turnaround specialist went hostile in its attempt to buy the aerospace and automotive group. The terms of the cash and share deal are unchanged since Melrose’s initial approach was revealed on Friday, consisting of 1.49 Melrose shares and 81p in cash for every GKN share. But a rise in Melrose’s share price since Friday from 215p to 230p means the value of the offer has increased from 405p a share to 423p. In the market GKN has added 0.2p to 442.2p, with the City betting either on a higher bid from Melrose or a rival bidder. Melrose made its firm offer after both sides began lobbying GKN shareholders in a series of meetings which are continuing. The activist investor Elliott has already begun urging GKN to open talks with Melrose. Simon Peckham, the Melrose chief executive, said: “We are having discussions with shareholders about the potential for the merged business, which will be one of the largest companies in the UK.” But GKN, which has put forward its own plans to split the company in two, said the benefits of any turnaround should go to its own investors. Its chief executive, Anne Stevens, said: “We believe GKN’s current owners should retain all the benefits of the clear upside potential in GKN. We are actively engaging with shareholders to explain how our transformation plan will provide value.” Matthias Heck, an analyst at Moody’s, said a demerger would be negative for GKN’s credit rating “because the scale of separated activities will be smaller and there will be less product diversification”. Meanwhile GKN’s pension trustees said any potential buyer should be aware of its £1bn-plus deficit, adding: “Any material change to the corporate and capital structure of GKN would lead the trustees to reassess the strength of the covenant going forward.” A Melrose spokesperson said: “Melrose has an impeccable track record of safeguarding and improving pensioners’ rights in every acquisition we have made. We look forward to meeting the trustees as soon as is appropriate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/17/luxurious-carpet-of-investment-whipped-from-under-their-fee","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T15:59:17Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | The luxurious carpet of investment whipped from under their feet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/17/luxurious-carpet-of-investment-whipped-from-under-their-fee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/17/luxurious-carpet-of-investment-whipped-from-under-their-fee","fields":{"headline":"The luxurious carpet of investment whipped from under their feet","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"PO’RAFA!

FIVER LETTERS “Re José Mourinho’s comment about Henrik Mkhitaryan that “we have a feeling he can stay there, but also a feeling he can move.” I suspect he is trying to explain that Mkhitaryan is in some kind of superposition of quantum states, only to be determined after observation of position or momentum rather than just relying on feelings. I can’t figure out whether to ignore the whole thing in the hope that it goes away, or whether paying attention will make the waveform collapse, decide Henrik’s state one way or the other, and get the whole thing over with. But I’m guessing that nothing will get the whole thing over with, arguably contravening the principles of thermodynamics” – Louise Wright. “Sir [eh? - Fiver Ed], 20 years ago, my ex-wife was invited to use the spa at the Bisham sports centre when the England squad was training.

In the same twilight slot as Monday, Kyrgios set out to repeat his first round demolition job, but while the No 17 seed’s outfit and newfound zen demeanor promised more of the same, something at first seemed amiss. The Australian’s judgment appeared off – he feigned to leave groundstrokes that landed well in, while at the same time attempting several drop shots from deep in the court that found the middle of the net (and would have safely been returned had they landed in). Usually able to fall back on his thumping serve when in trouble, Kyrgios also found himself in the unusual position of being out-served by his opponent, who regularly rattled off aces at the 200km mark. Yet, as much as Viktor Troicki’s serve was a weapon it was also his undoing; of the three double-faults he served for the set, two crucially allowed Kyrgios a look at break point, and a look was all he needed. He closed out the opening set in unremarkable fashion, taking back the ace tally from the Serb as if out of pride more than anything. By set’s end he had won a remarkable 100% of first serves in, to the delight of a stadium with barely a seat to fill. At its most electric, Hisense warrants the tag ‘people’s court’. Whether the purists like it or not, blaring crowd-pleasers like The White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army (a favourite of the Fanatics) pumps up the atmosphere, and gives the court a tennis’-equivalent-to-T20 feel. The audience love it, and it suits the flashiness of Kyrgios’s game. But, on a night that was no advertisement for the Australian Open, the sound disintegrated so badly at the start of the second set that the court umpire was forced to abandon the on-court microphone and bark instructions at the disbelieving players instead. It was farcical, and play was briefly delayed for the microphone to be replaced, only for the sound to worsen again. The umpire continued to speak over the PA with a sound quality worse than anything Skype has ever produced, to the point where the crowd laughed uncontrollably every time he spoke. It was more than distraction, it was embarrassing – and tournament officials shook their heads courtside, seemingly powerless to do anything about it. The tennis continued, but distractions abounded. The Serb’s erratic serving cost him once more. He resorted to practising his ball toss between points as more double-faults ensued. As it was in the first, it was all the window the Australian needed, the early break enough for Kyrgios to take the second as the rest unfolded to serve. Between, a man in the crowd was ejected for ‘swirling’ mid-point to take a selfie, drawing Kyrgios’s personal ire. The Australian stared him down until the spectator escorted himself to security. Then, a helicopter hovered overhead for what seemed an excessive amount of time. Eyes to the sky in disbelief, Kyrgios showed understandable frustration, but never lost his cool. “I told the umpire to maybe just not use a microphone any more because the crowd just found it so amusing,” said Kyrgios. “I mean, I was just like ‘dude, just stop doing it’. It’s going to create more of a circus … it was tough.” However, Kyrgios also acknowledged that he had coped with circumstances much better than he would have even a year ago. “I think last year, the year before, I probably would have been still out on the court right now, [I] could be losing that match. “It’s pretty easy to think, why me? The guy in the crowd was crazy. I didn’t really know what was going on. [Then with] the helicopter, that’s when I was thinking like, of course, it’s at my match. It’s just hovering there. Of course, it is.” From thereon in, the No 17 seed continued to show patience and resolve, resisting the urge to over-hit. He was not as ostentatious as he can be, but he was efficient, and his first service advantage proved the difference. If there was ever a sign that he was remade in a calmer mould, Wednesday night was surely it. Next up, he will face Jo Wilfred-Tsonga in a year in which he has already outperformed his last outing at Melbourne Park. Later on Margaret Court Arena, Matt Ebden became the latest of Kyrgios’s compatriots to be sent packing from his home grand slam, losing in straight-sets to Ukraine’s Alexandr Dolgopolov 7-6, 6-3, 6-4. The Australian No 2 men’s player was left to rue missed opportunities in the first set, winning one of just four break point attempts on the traditionally-strong Dolgopolov serve. In his first match of the tournament, the world No 38 Dolgopolov lost only 10 points on his first serve, and a similar pattern repeated here. The Ukrainian likewise hit more outright groundstroke winners, Ebden better suited to a match of attrition, his defensive scrambling keeping him in points longer than most. In the tiebreak, the Australian was blown off the court, outclassed in almost every element of the game. It was a flat end to a promising first set that continued the form that has seen him rocket from a ranking of 699 to 78, culminating in the career highlight of defeating his first top 20 player in John Isner on Monday. On a night where off-court distractions at times overshadowed the tennis itself, Margaret Court arena became embroiled in a drama of its own when in the second set Dolgopolov lost his shoe, and the point, before the central umpire ordered the men to replay the point. Ebden remonstrated, before the umpire seemingly changed her mind and awarded the point to Ebden, resulting in further, more intense remonstration from Dolgopolov, still missing a shoe. Dolgopolov laughed off the incident, explaining that he was upset because “usually when we drop an item, the point gets stopped”. “I thought that was what was supposed to happen. I was arguing because I wanted to replay the point.” It was yet another oddity on a bizarre night for the Australian Open."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/17/us-unilateralism-makes-tacking-climate-change-harder-wef-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T12:11:40Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump is hampering fight against climate change, WEF warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/17/us-unilateralism-makes-tacking-climate-change-harder-wef-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/17/us-unilateralism-makes-tacking-climate-change-harder-wef-warns","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump is hampering fight against climate change, WEF warns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The World Economic Forum delivered a strong warning about Donald Trump’s go-it-alone approach to tackling climate change as it highlighted the growing threat of environmental collapse in its annual assessment of the risks facing the international community. In the run-up to the US president’s speech to its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, next week, the WEF avoided mentioning Trump by name but said “nation-state unilateralism” would make it harder to tackle global warming and ecological damage. The WEF’s global risks perception survey showed Trump’s arrival in the White House in 2017 had coincided with a marked increase in concern about the environment among experts polled by the Swiss-based organisation. It said all five environmental risks covered by the survey – extreme weather events, natural disasters, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, and human-made natural disasters – had become more prominent. “This follows a year characterised by high-impact hurricanes, extreme temperatures and the first rise in CO2 emissions for four years. We have been pushing our planet to the brink and the damage is becoming increasingly clear. “Biodiversity is being lost at mass-extinction rates, agricultural systems are under strain, and pollution of the air and sea has become an increasingly pressing threat to human health.” Trump has threatened to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris agreement under which nations agreed to take steps to limit the increase in global temperature. He has said the commitments made by his predecessor, Barack Obama, would damage the American economy. Other states have said they will keep to the pledges made in Paris, an approach supported by the WEF. “A trend towards nation-state unilateralism may make it more difficult to sustain the long-term, multilateral responses that are required to counter global warming and the degradation of the global environment,” it said. The survey said the extreme weather events in 2017 included unusually frequent Atlantic hurricanes, with September the most intense month on record. It was also the most expensive hurricane season. It added that when data was finalised, 2017 would be among the three hottest years on record, and the hottest without an El Niño, the Pacific Ocean climate cycle that affects the world’s weather. Biodiversity loss was occurring at mass-extinction rates, the WEF said, noting that the populations of vertebrate species declined by an estimated 58% between 1970 and 2012. “Globally, the primary driver of biodiversity loss is the human destruction of habitats including forests – which are home to approximately 80% of the world’s land-based animals, plants and insects – for farming, mining, infrastructure development and oil and gas production.” Stronger than expected growth in 2017 meant economic risks were seen as less pressing, but the WEF said the upbeat picture masked continuing underlying concerns, including unsustainable asset prices; high levels of indebtedness, particularly in China; and continuing strains in the global financial system. The International Monetary Fund is likely to raise its forecast for global growth when it gives its latest economic update in Davos next Monday, and the WEF survey said the recovery underway in all major economies had to led to a sharp improvement in sentiment. But it expressed concern that the swing to optimism might lead to complacency and a blind spot to economic risks. “There are certainly reasons to be cautious: one does not have to look far for signs of economic and financial strain”, the WEF added, calling for greater attention to be paid to the risks of another crisis erupting. The survey warned there would be limited policy firepower in the event of a new crisis. It also warned of the disruption caused by automation, noting that “for the foreseeable future, automation and digitalisation can be expected to push down on levels of employment and wages, and contribute to increases in income and wealth at the top of the distribution.” It also highlighted the buildup of protectionist pressures against a backdrop of rising nationalist and populist politics and growing cybersecurity risks. The WEF said cyber attacks against businesses had almost doubled in five years, and that the financial impact of cybersecurity breaches was rising."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/jan/22/rose-hill-primary-oxford-an-orphan-school-at-the-sharp-end-of-academisation","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"‘We feel unwanted’: an ‘orphan’ school at the sharp end of academisation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/22/rose-hill-primary-oxford-an-orphan-school-at-the-sharp-end-of-academisation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jan/22/rose-hill-primary-oxford-an-orphan-school-at-the-sharp-end-of-academisation","fields":{"headline":"‘We feel unwanted’: an ‘orphan’ school at the sharp end of academisation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two years ago, Rose Hill primary on the outskirts of Oxford was branded a failing school. Ranked “inadequate” by the schools watchdog Ofsted, it was placed in special measures and staff and parents were told an academy trust would be brought in to turn around the school’s fortunes. Two years on – and two education secretaries later – the school is still waiting. When the Guardian visited in January 2016, morale was at rock bottom. The Ofsted report had been so devastatingly negative that the headteacher, Sue Vermes, and her team said they felt “criminalised” by the experience. A compulsory academy order was made and Vermes and her colleagues waited for their new masters to move in. Then – nothing. Rose Hill, which serves a disadvantaged community far from Oxford’s dreaming spires, has become what is known as an “orphan” school. It is yet to be adopted by a sponsor. Though a local academy trust has shown an interest, a deal is yet to be secured. As the new education secretary, Damian Hinds, gets to grips with his brief, this small school is a reminder of the challenges the government’s academies programme faces. “You feel unwanted,” says Vermes, sitting in her drab office. “With the day-to-day running of the school, it doesn’t have much impact. But long term, where are we going? I’ve given up trying to explain it to parents.” Rose Hill is not alone. Estimates suggest there are around 60 orphan schools in England waiting to be taken over by a sponsor. The government claims its academies policy – which takes schools out of local authority control and puts them in the hands of an academy trust, making them directly accountable to the Department for Education (DfE) – enables it to intervene swiftly when a school is in trouble. However, Rose Hill and others like it show this is not always a straightforward process. And it has an impact on the children, too. After Rose Hill’s inadequate rating, one pupil asked Vermes: “If this is an inadequate school, does that mean I’m an inadequate child?” The longer the uncertainty continues, the less appealing the school looks to future pupils and their families, hence numbers drop and so does income. The school building, which was crying out for repairs when we last visited, is just as bleak two years on. There is mould on the ceiling, the toilets smell, the paintwork is chipped, the classrooms are overheated and stuffy and the shabby corridors are chilly and unwelcoming. It was due to be demolished and rebuilt under the last Labour government – the plans were drawn up and published in the local newspaper. When the coalition government took over in 2010, the funding disappeared overnight and Rose Hill has been struggling to keep up appearances ever since. Since the Guardian’s last visit, the local authority has spent £200,000 on patching up the roof and replacing some windows; the DfE has set aside £1.4m for a new sponsor to spend on further repairs. But Vermes thinks a total rebuild is needed, which would cost £9m. “This is not a building that says to the children and their families that their education is crucial. It’s just saying to them, you are not worth the investment,” she says. The building will be an ongoing issue for any sponsor. In addition, staffing costs are high: 35 different languages are spoken at the school, a third of the children have special educational needs and around half of them live in poverty. Vermes says the pressures on vulnerable families have increased as austerity continues to bite. There are two local food banks, which are well used, but some children are not getting enough to eat. The children’s centre based at the school has closed – like all Oxfordshire’s children’s centres – so problems are not being picked up at an early stage. Pupils who need to attend a special school cannot always find one because of a shortage of places, so Rose Hill keeps them on roll with additional support staff. After the academy order was made, Vermes was asked to quit – but she refused. “It’s the wrong culture. It’s like football managers,” she says. She has worked as a teacher in Oxfordshire since 1985 and has taken just three days of sick leave in that time. Last October, Ofsted returned to Rose Hill and found it much improved. The school was taken out of special measures and rated “requires improvement”, but in three categories was ranked “good”. Yet still the school is stranded without a sponsor. More than half of all secondary schools in England are now run as academies, along with a fifth of primaries. On 17 January, MPs on parliament’s education committee called on the government to overhaul the oversight of academy chains after a string of high-profile failures. Vermes is optimistic there will be a positive outcome for Rose Hill, hoping that the local academy chain she favours will take the school on, but the journey to this point has been long and bruising. It is, she says, a good example of the chaos of government policy surrounding academisation. “I also think we are a symbol of the current punitive attitude towards children and families in poverty: ‘You’re poor, so your education is less important, and you can certainly put up with a substandard building,’” she says. The Department for Education was unable to say how many “orphan” schools there currently are in England. A DfE spokesman said: “We have been working hard to achieve a positive solution for Rose Hill Primary school and to address the most urgent needs which will make the building fit for purpose. “We are still in negotiations with River Learning Trust, which is supporting the school, and continue to work with the local authority, which remains responsible for maintaining the buildings and site at Rose Hill.”‎"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/21/john-robins-interview-darkness-of-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T11:00:19Z","webTitle":"John Robins: ‘Men need to be honest with themselves’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/21/john-robins-interview-darkness-of-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/21/john-robins-interview-darkness-of-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"John Robins: ‘Men need to be honest with themselves’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Bristol comedian and Radio X DJ John Robins, 35, won the 2017 Edinburgh comedy award for his standup show, The Darkness of Robins, about the breakup of his four-year relationship with fellow comic Sara Pascoe. He takes it out on the road this week. You’re about to embark on your biggest tour yet. How are you feeling? A mix of dread and excitement. There’s been a five-month gap since I did the show in Edinburgh, so there’s mild anxiety. I’m worried people will stare at me, going: “Why is this guy just talking about himself?” But as soon as I’m on stage and they start laughing, all that stops instantly. And then it begins again when I walk off stage. It’s a real confidence rollercoaster. What kind of tourer are you? A thrifty tourer. I spend as little time as possible in hotels, although I often berate myself for that at 3am on a motorway, thinking “Why didn’t you just stay over?” But I don’t mind long drives and I embrace that Alan Partridge attitude towards service stations, taking pleasure in small things. You’ve described this show as: “My life fell apart and I won an award for talking about it”… Did I? That’s a decent way of putting it. Well done me. My shows have always been about what I’ve been doing the preceding year. This one’s just more honest. And with that honesty comes an ability to talk about men’s mental health issues – not by giving a lecture but by displaying them. The best way to deal with slightly taboo topics is to give very subjective examples. If you stand on stage and say, “Hey everyone, this is a show about mental health”, everyone tenses up. If you just tell a story about having a panic attack in Ikea, the audience can go: “Yeah, I had that once. I shouted at myself in a traffic jam too. I heard a certain song and was suddenly in bits.” By being more personal, you can connect more. Are you comfortable with how intimate it is? I’ve been telling embarrassing stories about my own failings for 12 years now, so I don’t feel as exposed. Although when you rehearse it aloud in your living room to no one and there’s no laughs for an hour, it does seem pretty heavy. Sara Pascoe’s Edinburgh show, LadsLadsLads, was also about the breakup too. Have you seen each other’s shows? We haven’t had a chance. But our shows weren’t about each other, they were about ourselves. Mine is less about our breakup, more about me going nuts afterwards. Hers is the same and I’m sure it’s excellent. What’s your reaction to the Louis CK and Aziz Ansari scandals? The early stages of all sexual relationships are a series of signals. Men need to reassess how they read those signals and act on them. After justice for people who have suffered abuse, the most important thing to come out of #MeToo is for men to examine their own history and be honest with themselves about times when their actions were unacceptable. Sara said something to me which is so true: “These people are you and your mates once.” Every man, somewhere in their back catalogue of drunken nights, flirtations and exploits, has a memory where they go: “Do you know what? That wasn’t cool.” If you dismiss men who have been accused as monsters, it stops you checking your own behaviour. You don’t really do topical material. How come? I guess my stuff is topical but about me. It’s not about what’s in the newspapers, unless you’re reading the John News, which has just gone tabloid and is quite leftwing. But I will never, ever tell a Donald Trump joke. It’s just not my world. There are people who do those far better than I can. You’re a big snooker fan. Who’s your favourite player? I’m dangerously obsessed with Ronnie O’Sullivan. My tour starts a few days after the Masters final and finishes just before the World Championship final. That’s no accident. You used to be pescetarian but lapsed. Where are you at now, diet-wise? I am – I’m careful on the wording of this – broadly vegan. Broadly in capital letters. There’s no area more contentious than ethical diets, so I don’t nail my flag to any mast too firmly. Because the next thing you know, there’s a photo of you eating a prawn. What else is in the pipeline? I’ve written a draft sitcom script with Elis [James, his Radio X co-host]. Just a speculative thing but we’re very pleased with it. What’s remarkable in our industry is that I can write something in two days which then takes a year to be read. It’s a long and winding road.

Chadwick told his new buddy he’d written some songs that were more along the lines of what they were talking about. “So I went round his place and played them for him.” “I was blown away,” Cunningham says. “We still play a couple of ’em now.” This year, the Levellers’ celebrate 30 years together, marking the occasion with an acoustic album, We the Collective, of eight old songs and two new ones. For much of that time they have been resoundingly unfashionable: if you judged a group’s success by press coverage and radio play, you would assume the six-piece were these days plying their trade to half a dozen diehards in pub backrooms. In fact, every year they sell all 17,500 tickets to their own festival – the proudly sponsorship-free and affordable Beautiful Days, in Devon – and have notched up seven Top 40 albums and 14 Top 40 singles. There was a period when the Levellers were the most popular indie band in Britain – their 1994 performance at Glastonbury was reckoned to have drawn the biggest crowd the festival had seen. They embodied the subculture known mockingly as “crusty” – the travellers and punks and social outcasts who were scoffed at for their dreadlocks (Cunningham remains extravagantly belocked) and for their dogs on strings. “There were lot of disenfranchised people,” Chadwick says. “They were pissed off and we were talking to them. Instead of talking about drugs and girls, we were talking about their lives.” The contempt of the press irritated the Levellers. They accept that many music writers just didn’t like the music. But they also think their image didn’t fit in with received notions of cool. When one NME critic gave their 1991 album Levelling the Land a kicking, Cunningham responded – prefiguring Sharon Osbourne – by sending him a piece of human excrement. “It was in a shoebox, nicely gift-wrapped. It’s not one of my proudest moments.” The crustiness meant the Levellers had a puritanical image (“People thought we were out selling Socialist Worker or something,” Cunningham says) but at the peak of their success, they were prone to just as much ridiculous rock-star behaviour as any other band in sudden possession of money and surrounded by people keen to indulge them – the drugs, the drink, and the cliche of the television and the hotel window. “It was an A&amp;R man who wanted to throw the telly out of the window,” recalls Chadwick. “But he didn’t have the bottle to do it.” Cunningham chips in. So Chadwick took charge, ripping the TV from the wall, pulling out the cabling and dispensing the lot on to the street below. “I had a shower, got into bed,” Chadwick recalls. “Next thing I knew I had a torch in my eyes and it was the Met, saying, ‘Come on, sonny.’ There’d been a guy in a telephone box who’d phoned the police. But he never showed up as a witness, so I got away with it.” The Levellers, by their own admission, were a creation of Margaret Thatcher. Not just in the politics of the 1980s giving them the pricks against which to kick, but in the funding they got to run the band through the enterprise allowance scheme (“Though we did abuse it,” Cunningham admits). They say their songs aren’t polemics – though the new album contains a cover of Subvert by the 80s anarcho-punk band Zounds – but reflections of real life. They’ve tried to retain their principles – they once turned down £250,000 to headline the Reading festival because they despised its commercialism – and Chadwick says that the thing he values most is their connection with their fans, and the fact they remain approachable (“If they come to the local pub, they can have a pint with us”). He’s happy to take on those among his audience who want to argue the case for the opposition. “You’d be surprised how many Tories and Brexiteers like the Levellers,” he says. “And I will rag them and rag them until they cry. Or until they never come to see the band again. But I don’t care.” All of which makes the fact that the Conservatives once approached Chadwick to stand as a councillor for Kemptown in Brighton all the more surprising. “I said, ‘Are you insane?’ It was because I had a profile and I was political.” The Greens, Liberal Democrats and Labour have also all approached him, and he has said no to them all, though last year he joined the Labour party, “because I could see something different there, something positive”. After 30 years together, Chadwick and Cunningham sound like nothing so much as the two old codgers who’ve spent most of their lives propped up at the bar, noting the injustices of the world. “If we could get get away with doing nothing, we probably would,” Chadwick. “We’re not that driven. We were once, but you can only be like that for a certain amount of time before you realise it’s pointless if you want to live a life, rather than drive a life.” And they still have their heroes. All the Levellers were inspired as young people by Crass, the punk band who lived as a collective in a farmhouse in Essex (“The only thing that was unlistenable was the music,” Cunningham says). Years later, they booked the band’s frontman Penny Rimbaud to play at Beautiful Days. “I told him, ‘If it wasn’t for you, none of this would be here.’ He said ‘You’re the fourth member of your band that’s come up to me and said that.’” Chadwick recounts his own memory of meeting a hero. “I did the same with Johnny Cash.” “And what did he say?” Chadwick adopts a burly deep-south baritone. “He said, I’m not familiar with your work, son.” And the two of them hoot, fit to burst. We the Collective is released in On the Fiddle on 9 March. The Levellers play the Roundhouse, London, on 4 February, then tour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/21/andreas-gursky-review-widescreen-world-hayward-gallery-exhibition","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T08:00:15Z","webTitle":"Andreas Gursky review – a world in dizzying high definition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/21/andreas-gursky-review-widescreen-world-hayward-gallery-exhibition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/21/andreas-gursky-review-widescreen-world-hayward-gallery-exhibition","fields":{"headline":"Andreas Gursky review – a world in dizzying high definition","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Too good to be true: that is the art of the German photographer Andreas Gursky. His monumental pictures of our world – magnificently orchestrated, gorgeous in their super-saturated colours – are so improbably detailed you can view the sea from outer space and somehow see tiny people far below on the shore. Everything is in equal focus, and every photograph holds more than the eye can see. That they are not real is surely obvious at first glance. Or is it? This remains the crux of his work. When Gursky’s picture of the Rhine as a band of silver light between parallel grass-green stripes became the most expensive photograph ever sold, in 2011, many people didn’t realise it had been digitally altered. Gursky removed dog walkers, trees and an entire power plant for the sake of abstract beauty, updating German Romanticism with his geometric sublime. But the photograph still partook of the reality it depicts; it is the Rhine, and yet it is not. At 63, Gursky has done more than any other contemporary photographer to expand the medium’s vocabulary. His highly rhetorical visions may be as much as 12ft wide, as remote as possible from the casual snap; they may double, tile and collage multiple images into vast panoramas – jammed trading floors and hurtling highways, corporate atriums and industrial farms, mass tourism and skyscraper cities, each lonely window a glittering pixel by night. Think of a frantic stock exchange or a 3am hyperstore, and his work springs to mind. Our world has come to look like a Gursky. It was not always thus, as this lifetime survey reveals in almost 70 works handsomely installed in the refurbished Hayward, reopening next week for its 50th year. It is a perfect match: outsize images in chasmic galleries (the viewing conditions, alas, remain gloomy despite a few extra skylights). You almost expect a photograph of crowds seething round this post-industrial bunker. But the 80s landscapes that made Gursky’s name turn out to be pastoral: Sunday fishermen deafened by the nearby autobahn, beauty spots marred by telegraph wires, a lone hiker dwarfed beneath a concrete flyover. Austerely composed, yet oddly sentimental. But in 1991, Gursky hit upon the idea of using computer software to manipulate a photograph of a Siemens factory, multiplying the wires, bales and dangling cables so the human beings are scarcely visible. The picture is almost illegible in its micro-detail, yet uniformly sharp and clear. Gursky had come up with the all-over focus. And this has been his metaphor, pretty much, ever since: the idea that everything is happening all at once all over the world to an incomprehensible degree. The supermarket shelves are so densely arrayed with generic objects they become formal abstractions. The airport departures board flashes up endless destinations. In the stock exchange there is no human narrative, only a shifting pattern of frantic figures; and there they are again, repeated ad infinitum on little computer screens at the centre of the picture. There is a spacey uniformity to Gursky’s aesthetic that is both sumptuous and numbing. Abstract at a distance, figurative close-up, his pictures are simultaneously beautiful and bloodless. You miss the camera’s potential for chance observation and discovery in these intensely premeditated scenes. And all the artifice – involving planes, cranes, satellite cameras and elaborate software – what’s more, may be put to the service of surprising banality. A classic Gursky, for instance, is the epic Paris, Montparnasse (1993), showing all 750 flats in the city’s largest apartment block. Made using multiple shots taken from two different vantage points, this architectural vision does away with foreshortening and gives equal emphasis to every window. Much has been written about its creation. But in fact it offers nothing more than the actual experience on the street. The viewer searches the picture in exactly the same way as the reality, looking for the telling quirk – an easel, a mannequin – among all the windows full of standard lamps and plant pots. Is this democracy, or generalisation? Too often Gursky tends to the latter, lumping everyone and everything together. To witness two hundred Chinese women making basket chairs in dismal conditions is to see mass-production in action, to be sure, but where is the human being in the crowd? People, for him, are ant-like against nature, the concrete city, globalisation. At a rave, they are just units of energy, turning this way and that in repetitive collage (an image that pretends to show a single moment, but self-evidently doesn’t). “I am never interested in the individual,” Gursky has said, “but in the human species and its environment.” Behold! That is what his supersized images say. But what do they want us to notice: miles of factory-farmed cattle, prairies of plastic bags, deserts of Mexican waste (all unnecessary multiplications)? Confronted by the Great Pyramid at Giza, he sees what we all see: the eye-filling facade of a million blocks. At the industrial port, he witnesses industrial numbers of ships. These images range from platitude to tautology. The ambiguous relationship between reality and fiction is at issue all through the show. Sometimes the manipulations are visible (the inmates in a panopticon prison don’t quite fit their cells). Sometimes they feel suspect. The largest work here shows the Amazon warehouse in Phoenix, Arizona: a tumultuous landscape of objects ordered by some mysterious Borgesian algorithm – atlases next to nappies, grammar guides with bath mats – to bewilder the mind and eye. Except that there are no pathways for the poor benighted workers (who aren’t shown in any case). Artifice undermines evidence. Just as one searches for the individual in Gursky’s masses, so one looks for the artist’s own temperament in his work. It is most present, it seems to me, in his strongest works. In that beautifully sombre Rhine, for instance, rolling away into the imagination, and in a marvellous photograph of a Prada store got up to look like a minimalist white-cube gallery with lighting by Dan Flavin and shelves by Donald Judd, all to flog some mingy overpriced garments wittily deleted from the picture. Gursky’s sense of humour, indeed, is too often underplayed. But you can see it at the Hayward in a gigantic fiction of four German chancellors sitting before a big red Barnett Newman canvas. Angela Merkel in shrill yellow turns to Gerhard Schröder, who is puffing on his customary cigar. German smoke drifts like Romantic fog across this triumph of American abstract expressionism, a wonderful parody of international politics and culture. But the show’s masterpiece is unlike almost anything Gursky has made before. It is a new work, a single shot of some prefab houses skimmed on a mobile phone while driving through Utah. The photograph registers the speed of the car racing through the landscape – and modern life – in all its random glitches and blurs. At the same time, the houses look perilously ephemeral against the ancient mountains behind them. This fragile little thing, a spontaneous and disposable shot, is enlarged to the size of a cinema screen – a monumental homage to the mobile phone and the outsize role it plays in depicting our times. • At the Hayward Gallery from 25 January until 22 April"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jan/18/trump-style-populism-murderous-leaders-free-rein-human-rights-watch-report","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T13:13:03Z","webTitle":"Trump-style populism gives 'murderous leaders' free rein, says rights group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/18/trump-style-populism-murderous-leaders-free-rein-human-rights-watch-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jan/18/trump-style-populism-murderous-leaders-free-rein-human-rights-watch-report","fields":{"headline":"Trump-style populism gives 'murderous leaders' free rein, says rights group","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rising intolerance in many western countries has created an “open field for murderous leaders” around the world, a leading human rights group has warned. In an annual report assessing more than 90 nations, Human Rights Watch warned of a “frontal assault on the values of inclusivity, tolerance, and respect” across states that have previously championed rights. Kenneth Roth, the group’s director, pointed to Donald Trump, saying he won the US presidency “with a campaign of hatred against Mexican immigrants, Muslim refugees, and other racial and ethnic minorities, and an evident disdain for women”. Roth warned that the rise of intolerance has caused western powers, including the UK, to become more inward-looking. “With the United States led by a president who displays a disturbing fondness for rights-trampling strongmen, and the UK preoccupied by Brexit, two traditional if flawed defenders of human rights globally are often missing in action,” the report said. Germany, France and their EU partners, many of which are struggling with anti-refugee rhetoric domestically, have failed to fill the vacuum. Instead, Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have “aggressively asserted an anti-rights agenda”. This has allowed mass atrocities in Yemen, Syria, Burma and South Sudan to continue with near impunity. While Human Rights Watch is known for documenting abuses in conflict zones and under repressive regimes, its report criticised intolerance across the US and EU, which Roth warned should not become complacent. Creeping authoritarianism in Poland and Hungary is a “fundamental threat to the entire European project”, he said. “It’s not enough to say this is just something that is affecting a couple of relatively small countries,” he said. “If you allow any member of the European Union to undermine democracy, undermine the rule of law, undermine judicial independence you are allowing exceptions to core EU values – and that’s when you begin to eat away at those values.” Roth accused the EU of hypocrisy for cooperating with the Libyan authorities in order to reduce the number of refugees and migrants reaching Europe. “The conditions there are deadly, nightmarish, and to force somebody back is a blatant violation of international law,” he said. “To pretend they can do that indirectly by training the Libyan coastguard to keep people in, instead of pushing people back, is basically a distinction without a difference.” The report urged the EU to do more to oppose Saudi airstrikes in Yemen, military abuses against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, and Turkey’s crackdown on press freedom. Roth said that while the advocacy group does not have a stance on Brexit, citizens’ human rights will be weakened if the UK withdraws from the European convention on human rights. “We’re also frankly concerned about some of the rhetoric of the Brexiteers, which is not only anti-European Union but also anti-European convention on human rights. And there’s a real tendency to demagogue the issue. It’s a very short-sighted approach,” he said. “As much as possible, people should be able to maintain established lives without new restrictions imposed on them because of Brexit.” The report praised mass movement that opposed populism, and said resistance to Trump’s policies in the US have limited the harm that might have been done. “The lesson of the last year is that resistance matters,” said Roth. “The only way to limit the rise of autocrats is to stand up to them. The only way to preserve the values populists attack is to defend them. The battle is very much under way, and it’s one very much worth engaging in.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/19/post-work-the-radical-idea-of-a-world-without-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T05:45:15Z","webTitle":"Post-work: the radical idea of a world without jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/19/post-work-the-radical-idea-of-a-world-without-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/19/post-work-the-radical-idea-of-a-world-without-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Post-work: the radical idea of a world without jobs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Work is the master of the modern world. For most people, it is impossible to imagine society without it. It dominates and pervades everyday life – especially in Britain and the US – more completely than at any time in recent history. An obsession with employability runs through education. Even severely disabled welfare claimants are required to be work-seekers. Corporate superstars show off their epic work schedules. “Hard-working families” are idealised by politicians. Friends pitch each other business ideas. Tech companies persuade their employees that round-the-clock work is play. Gig economy companies claim that round-the-clock work is freedom. Workers commute further, strike less, retire later. Digital technology lets work invade leisure. In all these mutually reinforcing ways, work increasingly forms our routines and psyches, and squeezes out other influences. As Joanna Biggs put it in her quietly disturbing 2015 book All Day Long: A Portrait of Britain at Work, “Work is … how we give our lives meaning when religion, party politics and community fall away.” And yet work is not working, for ever more people, in ever more ways. We resist acknowledging these as more than isolated problems – such is work’s centrality to our belief systems – but the evidence of its failures is all around us. As a source of subsistence, let alone prosperity, work is now insufficient for whole social classes. In the UK, almost two-thirds of those in poverty – around 8 million people – are in working households. In the US, the average wage has stagnated for half a century. As a source of social mobility and self-worth, work increasingly fails even the most educated people – supposedly the system’s winners. In 2017, half of recent UK graduates were officially classified as “working in a non-graduate role”. In the US, “belief in work is crumbling among people in their 20s and 30s”, says Benjamin Hunnicutt, a leading historian of work. “They are not looking to their job for satisfaction or social advancement.” (You can sense this every time a graduate with a faraway look makes you a latte.) Work is increasingly precarious: more zero-hours or short-term contracts; more self-employed people with erratic incomes; more corporate “restructurings” for those still with actual jobs. As a source of sustainable consumer booms and mass home-ownership – for much of the 20th century, the main successes of mainstream western economic policy – work is discredited daily by our ongoing debt and housing crises. For many people, not just the very wealthy, work has become less important financially than inheriting money or owning a home. Whether you look at a screen all day, or sell other underpaid people goods they can’t afford, more and more work feels pointless or even socially damaging – what the American anthropologist David Graeber called “bullshit jobs” in a famous 2013 article. Among others, Graeber condemned “private equity CEOs, lobbyists, PR researchers … telemarketers, bailiffs”, and the “ancillary industries (dog-washers, all-night pizza delivery) that only exist because everyone is spending so much of their time working”. The argument seemed subjective and crude, but economic data increasingly supports it. The growth of productivity, or the value of what is produced per hour worked, is slowing across the rich world – despite the constant measurement of employee performance and intensification of work routines that makes more and more jobs barely tolerable. Unsurprisingly, work is increasingly regarded as bad for your health: “Stress … an overwhelming ‘to-do’ list … [and] long hours sitting at a desk,” the Cass Business School professor Peter Fleming notes in his new book, The Death of Homo Economicus, are beginning to be seen by medical authorities as akin to smoking. Work is badly distributed. People have too much, or too little, or both in the same month. And away from our unpredictable, all-consuming workplaces, vital human activities are increasingly neglected. Workers lack the time or energy to raise children attentively, or to look after elderly relations. “The crisis of work is also a crisis of home,” declared the social theorists Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek in a paper last year. This neglect will only get worse as the population grows and ages. And finally, beyond all these dysfunctions, loom the most-discussed, most existential threats to work as we know it: automation, and the state of the environment. Some recent estimates suggest that between a third and a half of all jobs could be taken over by artificial intelligence in the next two decades. Other forecasters doubt whether work can be sustained in its current, toxic form on a warming planet. Like an empire that has expanded too far, work may be both more powerful and more vulnerable than ever before. We know work’s multiplying problems intimately, but it feels impossible to solve them all. Is it time to start thinking of an alternative? * * * Our culture of work strains to cover its flaws by claiming to be unavoidable and natural. “Mankind is hardwired to work,” as the Conservative MP Nick Boles puts it in a new book, Square Deal. It is an argument most of us have long internalised. But not quite all. The idea of a world freed from work, wholly or in part, has been intermittently expressed – and mocked and suppressed – for as long as modern capitalism has existed. Repeatedly, the promise of less work has been prominent in visions of the future. In 1845, Karl Marx wrote that in a communist society workers would be freed from the monotony of a single draining job to “hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner”. In 1884, the socialist William Morris proposed that in “beautiful” factories of the future, surrounded by gardens for relaxation, employees should work only “four hours a day”. In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that, by the early 21st century, advances in technology would lead to an “age of leisure and abundance”, in which people might work 15 hours a week. In 1980, as robots began to depopulate factories, the French social and economic theorist André Gorz declared: “The abolition of work is a process already underway … The manner in which [it] is to be managed … constitutes the central political issue of the coming decades.” Since the early 2010s, as the crisis of work has become increasingly unavoidable in the US and the UK, these heretical ideas have been rediscovered and developed further. Brief polemics such as Graeber’s “bullshit jobs” have been followed by more nuanced books, creating a rapidly growing literature that critiques work as an ideology – sometimes labelling it “workism” – and explores what could take its place. A new anti-work movement has taken shape. Graeber, Hester, Srnicek, Hunnicutt, Fleming and others are members of a loose, transatlantic network of thinkers who advocate a profoundly different future for western economies and societies, and also for poorer countries, where the crises of work and the threat to it from robots and climate change are, they argue, even greater. They call this future “post-work”. For some of these writers, this future must include a universal basic income (UBI) – currently post-work’s most high-profile and controversial idea – paid by the state to every working-age person, so that they can survive when the great automation comes. For others, the debate about the affordability and morality of a UBI is a distraction from even bigger issues. Post-work may be a rather grey and academic-sounding phrase, but it offers enormous, alluring promises: that life with much less work, or no work at all, would be calmer, more equal, more communal, more pleasurable, more thoughtful, more politically engaged, more fulfilled – in short, that much of human experience would be transformed. To many people, this will probably sound outlandish, foolishly optimistic – and quite possibly immoral. But the post-workists insist they are the realists now. “Either automation or the environment, or both, will force the way society thinks about work to change,” says David Frayne, a radical young Welsh academic whose 2015 book The Refusal of Work is one of the most persuasive post-work volumes. “So are we the utopians? Or are the utopians the people who think work is going to carry on as it is?” * * * One of post-work’s best arguments is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the work ideology is neither natural nor very old. “Work as we know it is a recent construct,” says Hunnicutt. Like most historians, he identifies the main building blocks of our work culture as 16th-century Protestantism, which saw effortful labour as leading to a good afterlife; 19th-century industrial capitalism, which required disciplined workers and driven entrepreneurs; and the 20th-century desires for consumer goods and self-fulfillment. The emergence of the modern work ethic from this chain of phenomena was “an accident of history,” Hunnicutt says. Before then, “All cultures thought of work as a means to an end, not an end in itself.” From urban ancient Greece to agrarian societies, work was either something to be outsourced to others – often slaves – or something to be done as quickly as possible so that the rest of life could happen. Even once the new work ethic was established, working patterns continued to shift and be challenged. Between 1800 and 1900, the average working week in the west shrank from about 80 hours to about 60 hours. From 1900 to the 1970s, it shrank steadily further: to roughly 40 hours in the US and the UK. Trade union pressure, technological change, enlightened employers, and government legislation all progressively eroded the dominance of work. Sometimes, economic shocks accelerated the process. In Britain in 1974, Edward Heath’s Conservative government, faced with a chronic energy shortage caused by an international oil crisis and a miners’ strike, imposed a national three-day working week. For the two months it lasted, people’s non-work lives expanded. Golf courses were busier, and fishing-tackle shops reported large sales increases. Audiences trebled for late-night BBC radio DJs such as John Peel. Some men did more housework: the Colchester Evening Gazette interviewed a young married printer who had taken over the hoovering. Even the Daily Mail loosened up, with one columnist suggesting that parents “experiment more in their sex lives while the children are doing a five-day week at school”. The economic consequences were mixed. Most people’s earnings fell. Working days became longer. Yet a national survey of companies for the government by the management consultants Inbucon-AIC found that productivity improved by about 5%: a huge increase by Britain’s usual sluggish standards. “Thinking was stimulated” inside Whitehall and some companies, the consultants noted, “on the possibility of arranging a permanent four-day week.” Nothing came of it. But during the 60s and 70s, ideas about redefining work, or escaping it altogether, were commonplace in Europe and the US: from corporate retreats to the counterculture to academia, where a new discipline was established: leisure studies, the study of recreations such as sport and travel. In 1979, Bernard Lefkowitz, then a well-known American journalist, published Breaktime: Living Without Work in a Nine to Five World, a book based on interviews with 100 people who had given up their jobs. He found a former architect who tinkered with houseboats and bartered; an ex-reporter who canned his own tomatoes and listened to a lot of opera; and a former cleaner who enjoyed lie-ins and a sundeck overlooking the Pacific. Many of the interviewees were living in California, and despite moments of drift and doubt, they reported new feelings of “wholeness” and “openness to experience”. By the end of the 70s, it was possible to believe that the relatively recent supremacy of work might be coming to an end in the more comfortable parts of the west. Labour-saving computer technologies were becoming widely available for the first time. Frequent strikes provided highly public examples of work routines being interrupted and challenged. And crucially, wages were high enough, for most people, to make working less a practical possibility. Instead, the work ideology was reimposed. During the 80s, the aggressively pro-business governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan strengthened the power of employers, and used welfare cuts and moralistic rhetoric to create a much harsher environment for people without jobs. David Graeber, who is an anarchist as well as an anthropologist, argues that these policies were motivated by a desire for social control. After the political turbulence of the 60s and 70s, he says, “Conservatives freaked out at the prospect of everyone becoming hippies and abandoning work. They thought: ‘What will become of the social order?’” It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but Hunnicutt, who has studied the ebb and flow of work in the west for almost 50 years, says Graeber has a point: “I do think there is a fear of freedom – a fear among the powerful that people might find something better to do than create profits for capitalism.” During the 90s and 00s, the counter-revolution in favour of work was consolidated by centre-left politicians. In Britain under Tony Blair’s government, the political and cultural status of work reached a zenith. Unemployment was lower than it had been for decades. More women than ever were working. Wages for most people were rising. New Labour’s minimum wage and working tax credits lifted and subsidised the earnings of the low-paid. Poverty fell steadily. The chancellor Gordon Brown, one of the country’s most famous workaholics, appeared to have found a formula that linked work to social justice. A large part of the left has always organised itself around work. Union activists have fought to preserve it, by opposing redundancies, and sometimes to extend it, by securing overtime agreements. “With the Labour party, the clue is in the name,” says Chuka Umunna, the centre-left Labour MP and former shadow business secretary, who has become a prominent critic of post-work thinking as it has spread beyond academia. The New Labour governments were also responding, Umunna says, to the failure of their Conservative predecessors to actually live up to their pro-work rhetoric: “There had been such high levels of unemployment under the Tories, our focus was always going to be pro-job.” In this earnest, purposeful context, the anti-work tradition, when it was remembered at all, could seem a bit decadent. One of its few remaining British manifestations was the Idler magazine, which was set up in 1993 and acquired a cult status beyond its modest circulation. In its elegantly retro pages, often rather posh men wrote about the pleasures of laziness – while on the side busily producing books and newspaper articles, and running a creative consultancy with corporate clients, Idle Industries. By the early 21st century, the work culture seemed inescapable. * * * The work culture has many more critics now. In the US, sharp recent books such as Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (and Why We Don’t Talk About It) by the philosopher Elizabeth Anderson, and No More Work: Why Full Employment Is a Bad Idea by the historian James Livingston, have challenged the dictatorial powers and assumptions of modern employers; and also the deeply embedded American notion that the solution to any problem is working harder. In the UK, even professionally optimistic business journals have begun to register the extent of work’s crises. In his 2016 book The Wealth of Humans: Work and its Absence in the 21st Century, the Economist columnist Ryan Avent predicted that automation would lead to “a period of wrenching political change” before “a broadly acceptable social system” emerges. Post-work ideas are also circulating in party politics. Last April, the Green party proposed that weekends be lengthened to three days. In 2016, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour was “developing” a proposal for a UBI in the UK. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told his party conference last September that automation “can be the gateway for a new settlement between work and leisure – a springboard for expanded creativity and culture”. “It felt like a watershed moment,” says Will Stronge, head of Autonomy, a British thinktank set up last year to explore the crisis of work and find ways out of it. “We’re in contact with Labour, and we’re going to meet the Greens soon.” Like most British post-workists, he is leftwing in his politics, part of the new milieu of ambitious young activist intellectuals that has grown up around Corbyn’s leadership. “We haven’t talked to people on the right,” Stronge admits. “No one’s got in contact with us.” Yet post-work has the potential to appeal to conservatives. Some post-workists think work should not be abolished but redistributed, so that every adult labours for roughly the same satisfying but not exhausting number of hours. “We could say to people on the right: ‘You think work is good for people. So everyone should have this good thing,’” says James Smith, a post-workist whose day job is lecturing in 18th-century English literature at Royal Holloway, University of London. “Working less also ought to be attractive to conservatives who value the family.” Outside the insular, intense working cultures of Britain and the US, the reduction of work has long been a mainstream notion. In France in 2000, Lionel Jospin’s leftwing coalition government introduced a maximum 35-hour week for all employees, partly to reduce unemployment and promote gender equality, under the slogan, “Work less – live more.” The law was not absolute (some overtime was permitted) and has been weakened since, but many employers have opted to keep a 35-hour week. In Germany, the largest trade union, IG Metall, which represents electrical and metal workers, is campaigning for shift workers and people caring for children or other relatives to have the option of a 28-hour week. Even in Britain and the US, the vogues for “downshifting” and “work-life balance” during the 90s and 00s represented an admission that the intensification of work was damaging our lives. But these were solutions for individuals, and often wealthy individuals – the rock star Alex James attracted huge media attention for becoming a cheesemaker in the Cotswolds – rather than society as a whole. And these were solutions intended to bring minimal disruption to a free-market economy that was still relatively popular and functional. We are not in that world any more. * * * And yet the difficulty of shedding the burdens and satisfactions of work is obvious when you meet the post-workists. Explorers of a huge economic and social territory that has been neglected for decades– like Keynes and other thinkers who challenged the rule of work – they alternate between confidence and doubt. “I love my job,” Helen Hester, a professor of media and communication at the University of West London, told me. “There’s no boundary between my time off and on. I’m always doing admin, or marking, or writing something. I’m working the equivalent of two jobs.” Later in our interview, which took place in a cafe, among other customers working on laptops – a ubiquitous modern example of leisure’s colonisation by work – she said knowingly but wearily: “Post-work is a lot of work.” Yet the post-workists argue that it is precisely their work-saturated lives – and their experience of the increasing precarity of white-collar employment – that qualify them to demand a different world. Like many post-workists, Stronge has been employed for years on poorly paid, short-term academic contracts. “I’ve worked as a breakfast cook. I’ve been a Domino’s delivery driver,” he told me. “I once worked in an Indian restaurant while I was teaching. My students would come in to eat, and see me cooking, and say: ‘Hi, is that you, Will?’ Unconsciously, that’s why Autonomy came about.” James Smith was the only post-workist I met who had decided to do less work. “I have one weekday off, and cram everything into the other days,” he said, as we sat in his overstuffed office on the Royal Holloway campus outside London. “I spend it with our one-and-a-half-year-old. It’s a very small post-work gesture. But it was a strange sensation at first: almost like launching myself off the side of a swimming pool. It felt alien – almost impossible to do, without the moral power of having a child to look after.” Defenders of the work culture such as business leaders and mainstream politicians habitually question whether pent-up modern workers have the ability to enjoy, or even survive, the open vistas of time and freedom that post-work thinkers envisage for them. In 1989, two University of Chicago psychologists, Judith LeFevre and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, conducted a famous experiment that seemed to support this view. They recruited 78 people with manual, clerical and managerial jobs at local companies, and gave them electronic pagers. For a week, at frequent but random intervals, at work and at home, these employees were contacted and asked to fill in questionnaires about what they were doing and how they were feeling. The experiment found that people reported “many more positive feelings at work than in leisure”. At work, they were regularly in a state the psychologists called “flow” – “enjoying the moment” by using their knowledge and abilities to the full, while also “learning new skills and increasing self-esteem”. Away from work, “flow” rarely occurred. The employees mainly chose “to watch TV, try to sleep, [and] in general vegetate, even though they [did] not enjoy doing these things”. US workers, the psychologists concluded, had an “inability to organise [their] psychic energy in unstructured free time”. To the post-workists, such findings are simply a sign of how unhealthy the work culture has become. Our ability to do anything else, only exercised in short bursts, is like a muscle that has atrophied. “Leisure is a capacity,” Frayne says. Graeber argues that in a less labour-intensive society, our capacity for things other than work could be built up again. “People will come up with stuff to do if you give them enough time. I lived in a village in Madagascar once. There was this intricate sociability. People would hang around in cafes, gossiping, having affairs, using magic. It was a very complex drama – the kind that can only develop when you have enough time. They certainly weren’t bored!” In western countries too, he argues, the absence of work would produce a richer culture. “The postwar years, when people worked less and it was easier to be on the dole, produced beat poetry, avant garde theatre, 50-minute drum solos, and all Britain’s great pop music – art forms that take time to produce and consume.” The return of the drum solo may not be everyone’s idea of progress. But the possibilities of post-work, like all visions of the future, walk a difficult line between being too concrete and too airy. Stronge suggests a daily routine for post-work citizens that would include a provocative degree of state involvement: “You get your UBI payment from the government. Then you get a form from your local council telling you about things going on in your area: a five-a-side football tournament, say, or community activism – Big Society stuff, almost.” Other scenarios he proposes may disappoint those who dream of non-stop leisure: “I’m under no illusion that paid work is going to disappear entirely. It just may not be directed by someone else. You take as long as you want, have a long lunch, spread the work though the day.” Town and city centres today are arranged for work and consumption – work’s co-conspirator – and very little else; this is one of the reasons a post-work world is so hard to imagine. Adapting office blocks and other workplaces for other purposes would be a huge task, which the post-workists have only just begun to think about. One common proposal is for a new type of public building, usually envisaged as a well-equipped combination of library, leisure centre and artists’ studios. “It could have social and care spaces, equipment for programming, for making videos and music, record decks,” says Stronge. “It would be way beyond a community centre, which can be quite … depressing.” This vision of state-supported but liberated and productive citizens owes a lot to Ivan Illich, the half-forgotten Austrian social critic who was a leftwing guru during the 70s. In his intoxicating 1973 book Tools for Conviviality, Illich attacked the “serfdom” created by industrial machinery, and demanded: “Give people tools that guarantee their right to work with high, independent efficiency … from power drills to mechanised pushcarts.” Illich wanted the public to rediscover what he saw as the freedom of the medieval artisan, while also embracing the latest technology. There is a strong artisan tendency in today’s post-work movement. As Hester characterises it: “Instead of having jobs, we’re going to do craft, to make our own clothes. It’s quite an exclusionary vision: to do those things, you need to be able-bodied.” She also detects a deeper conservative impulse: “It’s almost as if some people are saying: ‘Since we’re going to challenge work, other things have to stay the same.’” Instead, she would like the movement to think more radically about the nuclear home and family. Both have been so shaped by work, she argues, that a post-work society will redraw them. The disappearance of the paid job could finally bring about one of the oldest goals of feminism: that housework and raising children are no longer accorded a lower status. With people having more time, and probably less money, private life could also become more communal, she suggests, with families sharing kitchens, domestic appliances, and larger facilities. “There have been examples of this before,” she says, “like ‘Red Vienna’ in the early 20th century, when the [social democratic] city government built housing estates with communal laundries, workshops, and shared living spaces that were quite luxurious.” Post-work is about the future, but it is also bursting with the past’s lost possibilities. * * * Now that work is so ubiquitous and dominant, will today’s post-workists succeed where all their other predecessors did not? In Britain, possibly the sharpest outside judge of the movement is Frederick Harry Pitts, a lecturer in management at Bristol University. Pitts used to be a post-workist himself. He is young and leftwing, and before academia he worked in call centres: he knows how awful a lot of modern work is. Yet Pitts is suspicious of how closely the life post-workists envisage – creative, collaborative, high-minded – resembles the life they already live. “There is little wonder the uptake for post-work thinking has been so strong among journalists and academics, as well as artists and creatives,” he wrote in a paper co-authored last year with Ana Dinerstein of Bath University, “since for these groups the alternatives [to traditional work] require little adaptation.” Pitts also argues that post-work’s optimistic visions can be a way of avoiding questions about power in the world. “A post-work society is meant to resolve conflicts between different economic interest groups – that’s part of its appeal,” he told me. Tired of the never-ending task of making work better, some socialists have latched on to post-work, he argues, in the hope that exploitation can finally be ended by getting rid of work altogether. He says this is both “defeatist” and naive: “Struggles between economic interest groups can’t ever be entirely resolved.” Yet Pitts is much more positive about post-work’s less absolutist proposals, such as redistributing working hours more equally. “There has to be a major change to work,” he says. “In that sense, these people want the right thing.” Other critics of post-work are also less dismissive than they first sound. Despite being a Tory MP from the most pro-business wing of his party, Nick Boles accepts in his book that a future society “may redefine work to include child-rearing and taking care of elderly relatives, and finally start valuing these contributions properly”. Post-work is spreading feminist ideas to new places. Hunnicutt, the historian of work, sees the US as more resistant than other countries to post-work ideas – at least for now. When he wrote an article for the website Politico in 2014 arguing for shorter working hours, he was shocked by the reaction it provoked. “It was a harsh experience,” he says. “There were personal attacks by email and telephone – that I was some sort of communist and devil-worshipper.” Yet he senses weakness behind such strenuous efforts to shut the work conversation down. “The role of work has changed profoundly before. It’s going to change again. It’s probably already in the process of changing. The millennial generation know that the Prince Charming job, that will meet all your needs, has gone.” After meeting Pitts in Bristol, I went to a post-work event there organised by Autonomy. It was a bitter Monday evening, but liberal Bristol likes social experiments and the large city-centre room was almost full. There were students, professionals in their 30s, even a middle-aged farmer. They listened attentively for two hours while Frayne and two other panellists listed the oppressions of work and then hazily outlined what could replace it. When the audience finally asked questions, they all accepted the post-workists’ basic premises. An appetite for a society that treats work differently certainly exists. But it is not, so far, overwhelming: the evening’s total attendance was less than 70. And yet, as Frayne points out, “in some ways, we’re already in a post-work society. But it’s a dystopic one.” Office employees constantly interrupting their long days with online distractions; gig-economy workers whose labour plays no part in their sense of identity; and all the people in depressed, post-industrial places who have quietly given up trying to earn – the spectre of post-work runs through the hard, shiny culture of modern work like hidden rust. Last October, research by Sheffield Hallam University revealed that UK unemployment is three times higher than the official count of those claiming the dole, thanks to people who come under the broader definition of unemployment used by the Labour Force Survey, or are receiving incapacity benefits. When Frayne is not talking and writing about post-work, or doing his latest temporary academic job, he sometimes makes a living collecting social data for the Welsh government in former mining towns. “There is lots of worklessness,” he says, “but with no social policies to dignify it.” Creating a more benign post-work world will be more difficult now than it would have been in the 70s. In today’s lower-wage economy, suggesting people do less work for less pay is a hard sell. As with free-market capitalism in general, the worse work gets, the harder it is to imagine actually escaping it, so enormous are the steps required. But for those who think work will just carry on as it is, there is a warning from history. On 1 May 1979, one of the greatest champions of the modern work culture, Margaret Thatcher, made her final campaign speech before being elected prime minister. She reflected on the nature of change in politics and society. “The heresies of one period,” she said, always become “the orthodoxies of the next”. The end of work as we know it will seem unthinkable – until it has happened. This article was amended on 22 January 2018 to clarify the categories of unemployed counted in the Sheffield Hallam research.

All long-distance train services were cancelled in Germany after the Netherlands bore the early brunt of the second major winter storm this month, with Schiphol airport in Amsterdam suspending all traffic for two hours and closing two of its three departure halls as tiles flew off the terminal building. More than 260 flights were cancelled as winds of up to 90mph (140km/h) prompted the Dutch weather service to issue a nationwide red alert, the highest alarm level. Services resumed later but with severe delays. A 62-year-old man was killed in the central village of Olst when he was hit by a falling branch as he got out of his lorry to remove debris from the road, while another 62-year-old died in the eastern city of Enschede after a tree fell on to his car, and a 66-year-old man died in a fall believed to have been caused by the high winds. In Rotterdam, shipping containers were toppled and roofs ripped off homes. Europe’s busiest cargo port was “virtually unreachable from the north” because of traffic holdups on three of the main motorways into the city, the national traffic service VID said. At least 25 large freight trucks had been knocked on their sides by the winds, causing huge traffic jams on six of the country’s main roads. The Dutch national railways service, NS, halted all trains for most of the morning except for local services in the south of the country and warned that “a large number of breakdowns” meant normal service could take hours to restore. Neighbouring Belgium halted the high-speed Thalys services to the Netherlands and Germany. Six people were also killed in Germany, where gusts of wind reached up to 80mph (130km/h). They included a 59-year-old man hit by a falling tree in Emmerich near the Dutch border, a 68-year-old lorry driver died in a storm-related accident in Lippstadt, and two firefighters, one of them a 28-year-old who died after a tree fell on him while he was trying to help a woman trapped in her car. More than 40 people were injured in weather-related traffic accidents in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), the country’s most populous state, police said. Up to 100,000 were left without electricity and flights were cancelled at Düsseldorf and Cologne-Bonn airports. Deutsche Bahn suspended nearly all long-distance train services across the country and regional rail traffic was also cancelled in several states. Residents of a British army base in NRW told the Guardian cars had been crushed, tiles ripped off buildings and the roof of a tank shed torn off in the gale. Schools were closed as a precautionary measure in many parts of the country and Germans – particularly in western regions – were warned to stay indoors if at all possible. Heavy snowfall and slippery roads were causing car accidents “every other minute” on some roads in northern Germany, authorities said. The Belgian port of Ghent was temporarily closed, and a woman was killed near Brussels when her car was crushed by a falling tree. Trams were suspended in the Belgian capital for several hours and the city’s major parks closed for fear of falling trees. Parts of the UK were also hit by gale-force winds of up to 70mph (110km/h) and thousands of homes in south-east England were without electricity. Overhead power lines supplying trains were damaged and trees brought crashing on to tracks, causing severe delays for thousands of commuters. Driving conditions in parts of Scotland were described by the Met Office as extremely hazardous, with motorists advised to stay off the roads because of blustery winds, heavy snow and icy conditions. Thousands of homes in the east of England were also left without power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/19/william-blakes-a-vision-of-the-last-judgement-a-moment-of-epiphany","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T09:59:23Z","webTitle":"William Blake’s A Vision of the Last Judgement: a moment of epiphany","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/19/william-blakes-a-vision-of-the-last-judgement-a-moment-of-epiphany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/19/william-blakes-a-vision-of-the-last-judgement-a-moment-of-epiphany","fields":{"headline":"William Blake’s A Vision of the Last Judgement: a moment of epiphany","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Perfect symmetry...

Carillion’s collapse has emboldened Corbyn to press home his message that Labour rejects the “dogma of privatisation”. “We will rewrite the rules to give the public back control of their services,” he told the Guardian shortly after clashing with the prime minister over the issue in the House of Commons. “Theresa May exposed the failure of the outsource-first ideology at prime minister’s questions when she said the government was ‘a customer’ not ‘the manager’ of Carillion. I’m sorry, but if these are public contracts we should be the manager and not have a middleman like Carillion creaming off the profits.” In a radical departure from the cross-party consensus of the past 25 years, Labour would impose strict conditions on local authorities and Whitehall departments that would be likely to drastically reduce the use of private-sector contractors. Corbyn also used a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian to brush off concerns he would be too old to govern by the next general election; to insist Labour MPs should be constantly accountable to their constituents; and to underline his scepticism about some aspects of the EU single market. He risked infuriating Labour backbenchers by warning that some of the rules Britain would have to accept to remain a member of the single market “do potentially make it harder for us to tackle the outsource-first racket”. That contention clashes with the thinking of a well coordinated and vocal group of rebels, including Alison McGovern, Heidi Alexander and Chuka Umunna, who are campaigning to keep the UK in the single market and customs union. Some experts question whether EU rules would limit a future government’s ability to halt outsourcing. Professor Anand Menon, director of thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, pointed to a 2014 procurement directive that explicitly stated it was up to member-states to decide “the means of administration” of public services. “The EU is about fairness between member-states,” he said. “It leaves it up to governments to decide how services are delivered”. The Labour leader said the UK government was ill-equipped to extract the best deal from giant outsourcing firms, which can outbid each other by undermining their workers’ terms and conditions. “It’s quite a small number of companies that are involved in this stuff. If you’re looking at major rail contracts, there isn’t a huge variety of companies available to do it, and we too often seem to be held over a barrel by these people,” he said. He condemned the behaviour of the Virgin-Stagecoach consortium that has received what the former national infrastructure commission chair, Lord Adonis, has called a “bailout” from government on the franchise for the East Coast mainline. Virgin rejects the idea that it’s a bailout. In a recent blogpost Richard Branson wrote: “The critics argue that Stagecoach and Virgin are somehow benefitting from this. The fact is we have both lost significant amounts of money – well over £100m in total – and have not received a penny in dividends.” Corbyn, however, said: “What they’ve done is underbid, made a lot of money out of it and then moved on. When the East Coast mainline was publicly-owned, it paid in a handsome profit to the Treasury and it was well-run.” In future, he said, “what we’re saying is, the preferred option on direct services should be the public option – and that means there should be a fairness in the delivery of these services”. Labour’s 2017 manifesto pledged to use government procurement contracts to encourage firms to recognise trade unions and pay taxes in the UK. Corbyn said: “Now we must go further. We are developing policies to make public delivery of public services the preferred option. We will put an end to the dogma of privatisation, which has hollowed out the public realm and held back our economy and services.” Under a Corbyn-led Labour government: Local authorities and Whitehall departments would only be able to outsource a service if it could be shown to be failing. If a decision was taken to outsource, there would be a statutory requirement to prepare a “realistic” in-house bid, “well-resourced with senior staff and workforce representatives”. A full public consultation would have to be held. A new public value contracts commissioner would “ensure that any tender process is awarded on the basis of public value rather than which company is the cheapest employer”. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has also said Labour will review PfI projects, of the kind that a national audit office report warned on Thursday will cost the taxpayer a total £200bn over the coming decades. On Brexit, where Corbyn has been accused of a lack of clarity over the kind of relationship Labour would like to maintain with the EU27, he repeated his assertion that it was not possible to remain inside the single market without being an EU member. “The single market requires membership of the EU. We can have a relationship with the single market, and that is what we want to have, and want to negotiate,” he said. When Corbyn made similar remarks last weekend, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith, said he found them “slightly puzzling”, adding, “it is clearly possible for us to be outside the EU and inside the single market, as is Norway and other countries”. The Labour leader insisted: “Norway is not a member of the single market. It accepts single market rules for the most part, but it does have some differences, particularly on fishing.” Corbyn also emphasised that Labour would seek to negotiate a Brexit deal loose enough to allow Britain to escape aspects of current EU competition policy, including the obligation to offer large public contracts to firms across the EU. “I would want us to have a trading relationship that would mean that we have tariff-free access to the market. I would also look at the competition policy, because there are elements of the direction of travel of Europe that I’m unhappy about,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/18/over-65s-drive-consumer-spending-back-to-pre-crisis-level","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T12:03:50Z","webTitle":"Pets and package holidays – how over-65s drive UK consumer spending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/over-65s-drive-consumer-spending-back-to-pre-crisis-level","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/18/over-65s-drive-consumer-spending-back-to-pre-crisis-level","fields":{"headline":"Pets and package holidays – how over-65s drive UK consumer spending","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Spending by British households has returned to its pre-financial crisis levels in real terms, driven by purchases of cars and spending by older consumers on package holidays and pets. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed average weekly spending in the UK rose to £554.20 in the financial year ending March 2017, an increase from £533 the previous year. Transport and recreation were the two categories where expenditure increased the most, rising by about £5 on average per week. Taking into account spending before and after the Brexit vote, the latest figures are an eye-opening reminder of the spending power of the older generation, versus the tough economic times for younger households – who are likely to be the first group in modern times to be poorer than their parents. Spending on recreation and culture among the under 30s was almost half that of those between 65 and 74, who shelled out almost a fifth of their disposable income on this category. Statisticians said pets, pet food, and package holidays were among their most popular purchases. The figures also illustrate buoyant economic conditions just before inflation started to outpace wage growth in the wake of the EU referendum, when a fall in the pound pushed up the cost of importing goods to Britain. Levels of consumer spending have since started to slow on average. Last year’s rise in spending also outstripped growth in disposable income over the course of the year, with expenditure increasing by 4% as the amount of money available for people to spend rose by 2.3%. Poorer households have been harder hit by rising prices, according to the Resolution Foundation, which found spending increased by 7% for lower income families, while rose by only 1% for the richest half. Stephen Clarke, policy analyst at the thinktank, said: “This extra spending outpaced the extra level of income available to households, who turned instead to their savings and credit cards.” Transport expenditure was the biggest single category for average weekly spending, at £79.70 per week, with the running costs of vehicles – such as petrol, diesel and repairs – taking up the biggest proportion from this category. The ONS said it had seen a big increase in the use of car finance deals – something which has worried the Bank of England amid rapid growth of personal debt to levels unseen since the 2008 financial crisis. Recreation and culture was the second highest category for average spending for the first time since comparable records began in 2000, at £73.50 per week. Housing and fuel ranked third, at £72.60 per week. However, officials do not include mortgage payments, council tax and insurance in calculations, which would have made housing the top category, with average weekly spending of about £173.40, up from £164.70 a year ago. The government has now been tracking spending habits for 60 years, helping to show how British culture has shifted from the late 1950s to the present day. Tobacco accounted for about 6% of total spending in 1957, although now only represents 1% of all purchases, mirroring the fall in the number of people who smoke. Expenditure on food and clothes has halved since 1957 from 33% to 16% and 10% to 5% respectively, which the ONS said could be down to greater levels of consumer choice and falling average household sizes. Robynne Davies, senior ONS statistician, said average weekly spending last year varied considerably across the country, with more than £200 difference between the highest and lowest spending areas. Average weekly spending was highest in London at £643.70 per week, set against the lowest levels in the north east of £437 per week. “The increases [by category] are across the board, but it’s also on more discretionary items such as recreation and culture and hotels,” she added. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/18/iphone-apple-users-turn-off-feature-battery-slow-down-devices-ios-tim-cook","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T10:24:35Z","webTitle":"iPhone users to be given option to turn off feature that slows down devices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/18/iphone-apple-users-turn-off-feature-battery-slow-down-devices-ios-tim-cook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/18/iphone-apple-users-turn-off-feature-battery-slow-down-devices-ios-tim-cook","fields":{"headline":"iPhone users to be given option to turn off feature that slows down devices","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Apple will give users the option to turn off a feature that temporarily slows down older iPhones in order to prevent unexpected shutdowns, chief executive Tim Cook has said. The new option is likely to arrive in March, as part of the next update to iOS 11. “If you don’t want it, you can turn it off,” Cook told ABC News. The CEO maintains, however, that Apple “don’t recommend” users take advantage of the ability to disable the slowdown. Alongside the option to turn off the slowdown, Apple will also introduce much more detailed monitoring of battery health for users. Currently, iOS will warn users if their battery is substantially decayed, but will not notify them of partial ageing – even if that ageing is severe enough to warrant the slowdown. With the update, Cook said, “We’re going to give people the visibility of the health of their battery so it’s very, very transparent … this hasn’t been done before.” Before Apple released iOS 10.2.1 in 2016, older iPhones were frequently hit with an issue that caused a spontaneous shutdown if the battery’s voltage output dropped below a certain threshold – which occurred more frequently when the battery got old, cold, or ran low on charge. In that update, the company tweaked the iPhones 6, 6s and SE to instead slow down the processor when the voltage dropped. For intensive use, this resulted in the phone as a whole slowing down, but prevented it from shutting down. In 2017, with iOS 11.2, Apple made the same update to iPhone7 devices. But the company did not notify users of the change, leaving it to be discovered by individuals running performance tests on their phone. The resulting uproar saw the company accused of deliberately slowing down older devices to encourage users to buy new ones, a practice known as “planned obsolescence”. In December, Apple released an open letter explaining the updates, and promised a number of changes, including the upcoming software update and a reduction in price of the company’s battery exchange programme to $29/£29 for users with affected models.

The Arsenal manager said Sánchez’s transfer to United was likely to happen and quickly, too – possibly in the next 24 to 48 hours. He also spoke candidly on Mkhitaryan, saying it was his understanding that the attacking midfielder would move in the opposite direction. Arsenal would still be in the market for another attacking player and they retain a strong interest in Borussia Dortmund’s Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang. But Wenger appeared to rule out a move for the Bordeaux winger Malcom. “I don’t think we are close to doing that,” he said. On Sánchez, Wenger said: “I’ve worked on transfers for 30 years, so it is likely to happen. But these kind of things are never guaranteed. It’s now in the next 24 to 48 hours that it will happen or not.” Wenger did not sell Sánchez last August to Manchester City – after accepting a £60m offer from them – because he was unable to sign a replacement. This time, Mkhitaryan is set to smooth the deal. Wenger was asked whether Mkhitaryan was primed to arrive as part of the Sánchez transfer. “It’s my understanding, yes,” he said. “The wages would not be a problem. This would be an exchange of players and I think one would replace the other. Are we still on the transfer market after that? Yes.” The Arsenal hierarchy would love to take Aubameyang and they are convinced that Dortmund are ready to sell for €60m. The big question is whether they will do so now or in the summer. Dortmund are desperate to qualify for the Champions League and they would need to source a replacement for their top scorer if they decided to accept the money for him in January. Wenger was unusually open on transfers and he talked about Aubameyang, including making complimentary remarks about his character. His willingness to address the subject went down badly at Dortmund. “We think it is a lack of respect when you get involved with players who are playing for another team,” the Dortmund sporting director, Michael Zorc, said. “There is no contact with Arsenal. We can only assume that Arsène Wenger has enough to think about when it comes to the performances of his own players.” Wenger did not rule out the use of Olivier Giroud as a makeweight in a move for Aubameyang. The German club were interested in the striker last summer and they also like Racing Club’s Lautaro Martínez. It was put to Wenger that if he were able to sign Aubameyang, he may not keep Giroud at Arsenal. “You started with an ‘if’,” he replied. “If can be many theories. At the moment, I cannot tell you much more.” Van Persie’s departure for United hurt everybody at Arsenal and he compounded matters by inspiring his new club to the title in his first season. Wenger sees the Sánchez situation as being different, mainly because the Chilean was an international star when he joined Arsenal. “We took Van Persie when he played in the reserve team at Feyenoord,” Wenger said. “And we made a long work with him. When you get them there to the level and, after, they leave – of course that is the most painful and, after that, they do well for the other club. “I would say our fans know Alexis will not extend his contract and they have accepted that idea. And the fact it will not be one-way traffic, it will be other way traffic as well [with Mkhitaryan] – that makes the whole thing a bit smoother, maybe, a bit less disappointing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/18/uks-richest-10-spend-more-on-wine-per-week-than-the-poorest-on-water","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T17:24:47Z","webTitle":"As inflation crushes wage rises, banks turn off lending taps to households","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/uks-richest-10-spend-more-on-wine-per-week-than-the-poorest-on-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/18/uks-richest-10-spend-more-on-wine-per-week-than-the-poorest-on-water","fields":{"headline":"As inflation crushes wage rises, banks turn off lending taps to households","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is little for the average household to cheer these days as inflation crushes paltry earnings increases. Inflation is running at 3% while wage rises can manage no more than 2.5%. Worse for the average household, the banks are beginning to turn off the lending taps that have allowed them to boost their incomes with cheap debt. Things were better in the year to April 2017, according to the number crunchers at the Office for National Statistics, who have lifted the lid on Britain’s spending habits in their annual family spending report. It shows that average weekly household spending clawed its way back from the depths of the 2009 recession to exceed the pre-crisis level for the first time. This slice of good news, albeit five or six years later than many economists thought it would happen, disguises how the better off have thrived compared to those on the bottom rung of the income ladder. For instance the richest 10% spent more on wine per week (£9.40) than the poorest 10% spent on water (£7.30). In the same vein, the richest 10% spent £59.40 on “furniture and furnishings, carpets and other floor coverings” to almost match how much the poorest 10% spent on rent (£62.70). Challenging the idea that the poorest waste their money on booze and cigarettes, the survey found that the richest 10% devote twice as much of the weekly shop (£17.50) to “alcoholic drinks, tobacco and narcotics” as the poorest. But it is the new rich, the 65- to 74-year-olds that really catch the eye. Their spending might not match that of the top 10%, yet it significantly powers ahead of anything the average 20-something can muster on areas like entertainment and recreation. The figures show that people in the 10 years from their 65th birthday go on a spending binge that means devoting nearly a fifth of their total expenditure on recreation and culture, double the 10% spent by the under-30s. This is the final salary pension bonanza that can only be described as a once in a generation spending boost. The same applies to those of all ages on below average incomes. They increased their spending by a startling 7% on the previous year, far more than the 1% increase across the richest half of households. Unfortunately they managed this largely by running down savings and taking on extra debt. As banks, under instruction from the financial regulator, rein in their lending, debt-fuelled spending should be considered a one-off boon, just like the final salary payout. However, that seems unlikely. Banks remain dependent for profit on lending. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/18/airbus-secures-a380-deal-emirates-gulf-airline-superjumbo","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T13:17:01Z","webTitle":"Airbus finally secures lifeline for A380 with Emirates deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/airbus-secures-a380-deal-emirates-gulf-airline-superjumbo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/18/airbus-secures-a380-deal-emirates-gulf-airline-superjumbo","fields":{"headline":"Airbus finally secures lifeline for A380 with Emirates deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The A380 superjumbo has been thrown a lifeline after its biggest customer, Emirates, agreed to buy up to 36 more planes from Airbus. The European airplane manufacturer had warned that without the deal, which had been long in the negotiation, it might have to close down its A380 production line. The deal is the first large order for the world’s biggest passenger aircraft in more than four years. Emirates has committed to buy 20 planes, with an option for 16 more, in a deal that would be worth up to $16bn (£11.5bn) at list prices, although the Gulf airline will have negotiated a substantial discount. Fears for the future of the A380 had intensified after an anticipated order failed to materialise at the Dubai air show in November, with Emirates instead signing a deal with Boeing for 40 of the US manufacturer’s 787 Dreamliners. Emirates has virtually single-handedly kept the A380 going: the latest deal means more than half of the planes ordered – 178 out of 353 – are operating in or destined for the Gulf. The airline firm took delivery of its first A380 in July 2008, and its 100th two months ago. Announcing the agreement on Thursday, Emirates’ chief executive and chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, said: “We’ve made no secret of the fact that the A380 has been a success for Emirates. Our customers love it, and we’ve been able to deploy it on different missions across our network, giving us flexibility in terms of range and passenger mix.” Emirates will replace some of its older A380s with the new planes. Airbus said the deal would allow it to continue producing the A380 for at least another decade. John Leahy, its long serving sales boss, who had been chasing one last big deal before retirement, said: “I’m personally convinced more orders will follow Emirates’ example and that this great aircraft will be built well into the 2030s.” The aircraft is built across Europe, with its wings manufactured in the UK at Broughton in Flintshire. Rolls-Royce is also a major supplier of engines, while landing gear and some of the avionics are also UK-built. While Thursday’s order will give some reassurance to Airbus and its suppliers, questions remain about its flagship plane. In the autumn one of its A380s was taken out of service and mothballed in the Pyrenees, with its owner, a German leasing company, unable to find an airline willing to operate it. It is still more than two years since an airline other than Emirates has purchased an A380. The capacity of the double-decker plane, which can typically accommodate 575 passengers, meant it was seen at its inception as a way of allowing congested hub airports to increase passenger numbers. But the growing range of smaller, alternative planes such as the Dreamliner or Airbus’s A350 has dented sales of the A380. Despite its popularity with many passengers who have travelled on it, only 13 airlines have so far flown the A380 and many have predicted its demise – not least, with some glee, Boeing. Airbus has twice cut the production rate of the plane in recent years, now down to eight planes annually, although executives recently indicated as few as six would be a sustainable rate. Overall, the European manufacturer has seen more success in the rapid sales of its smaller, single-aisle planes in the last year, particularly the A320neo. Airbus last week said that with a rush of December sales it had taken orders for 1,109 planes in total in 2017, again outstripping Boeing’s 912 orders. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/18/unions-call-denial-of-minimum-wage-to-north-sea-workers-national-disgrace","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T13:19:46Z","webTitle":"Unions call denial of minimum wage to North Sea workers ‘national disgrace’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/unions-call-denial-of-minimum-wage-to-north-sea-workers-national-disgrace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/18/unions-call-denial-of-minimum-wage-to-north-sea-workers-national-disgrace","fields":{"headline":"Unions call denial of minimum wage to North Sea workers ‘national disgrace’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Unions have said it is a “national disgrace” that workers dismantling old North Sea oil and gas rigs will be paid less than the minimum wage, despite new promises by ministers to protect people working in UK waters. The government issued guidance on Thursday that it said would ensure seafarers, people who are based on vessels as opposed to fixed installations such as oil platforms, receive the minimum wage. But the RMT union said the guidance only applied to UK waters out to a 12-mile limit, which would not cover most oil and gas activity. One firm decommissioning the BP Miller platform had workers on 12-hour shifts for $45, or about £2.70 an hour, the union said. A second contractor reportedly paid similar rates on Canadian Natural Resources’ Murchison platform. The minimum wage is £7.50 for over-25s. The concern is international crews are being paid unfairly low rates and undercutting opportunities for UK workers. “This is an issue which to my mind is a national disgrace,” said Jake Molloy, a regional organiser for the RMT. “This change [today] will do nothing to protect our members, or the exploitation of foreign nationals by the oil and gas industry, nothing,” he said. Labour said it was deplorable that workers were not getting the minimum wage. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “The government hasn’t done enough to stop employers denying workers their rightful pay, which is grossly unfair to workers but also unfair to the businesses that do play by the rules.” Under plans published on Thursday, UK Border Force will issue information to seafarers on their rights, in more than 50 languages. Andrew Griffiths, a business minister, said: “Today we are making it crystal clear that if you work in UK waters you are entitled to at least the minimum wage and all employers – no matter where they’re from – must pay it.” Saipem and Heerema Marine Contractors, which are carrying out the BP and Canadian Natural Resources rig work, said they paid in line with rules laid down by the International Transport Workers’ Federation. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/jan/19/put-the-kettle-on-does-a-cuppa-beat-writers-block","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Put the kettle on: does a cuppa beat writer’s block?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/19/put-the-kettle-on-does-a-cuppa-beat-writers-block","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/19/put-the-kettle-on-does-a-cuppa-beat-writers-block","fields":{"headline":"Put the kettle on: does a cuppa beat writer’s block?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Being British, we have all seized on a report about how drinking tea improves creativity. The researchers – led by Yan Huang, from the Psychological and Cognitive Sciences Department of Peking University – recruited 50 students, who were assigned to two groups and given either tea or water to drink. The students were then given tests, the first being to build an “attractive” design with toy blocks, the second to come up with a “cool and attractive” name for a new ramen noodle restaurant. (“An example of a name that received a low innovativeness score is Ramen Family, and an example of a name that received a high score is No Ramen Here.”) Those who drank tea performed better in both – and so the humble beverage has been hailed as a means to combat writers’ block by the Telegraph. The researchers don’t go that far – and indeed, the creativity of the participants is called somewhat into question by the detail that the academics had to delete more than 200 suggested restaurant names for containing only the word Ramen, or for including location names. Perhaps it was down to the kind of tea they gave them: it was black, and Lipton (the horror). But sitting drinking my fourth brew of the day (PG Tips, strongly brewed, quite milky), I was reminded of that quote from CS Lewis, much-loved by Etsy accessorisers: “You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.” So I asked a handful of writers if tea is, indeed, the answer to stalling creativity. It turns out that yes, for many it is – and they have tips for working it into the writing routine. Jenn Ashworth, author of The Friday Gospels and A Kind of Intimacy, says she drinks “hundreds of cups of tea, in a special mug that I rarely wash”. “It is warm and comforting and smoothing and the ritual of making it is a break from typing but not from thinking. I usually drink Yorkshire Tea (as a Lancastrian it pains me to admit this) until 4pm, then I switch to chai, because it’s sweet and comforting and I kid myself it has less caffeine,” she says. “Stuck for inspiration? Kettle on. Poke the fire a bit. Sweep a floor or hang the washing out. Some little task, not difficult, that involves movement. If there’s a blockage somewhere, getting up from the desk will shift it. I hear some writers go on walks, but I am too lazy for that and wouldn’t want to be so far from the kettle.” “You have judge it, so you don’t drink so much tea you spend all your time going to the loo, but I do think it helps,” says bestselling romance novelist Katie Fforde. “Otherwise, fresh air and exercise (could just be a wander round the garden, doesn’t need to be a 10K) or a little trashy TV.” Award-winning children’s novelist Frances Hardinge also admits to getting through “a lot of tea while I’m writing, but I’d rather assumed that was because I’m a craven caffeine addict”. She explains: “I can well believe that presenting oneself with tea creates a ‘positive mood’, a bit like giving oneself a small, brisk hug. Breaking up an intensive writing session and getting away from one’s desk for a few minutes probably doesn’t hurt either.” Tracy Chevalier has a different technique. “I drink coffee till noon, tea in the afternoon,” she says. “I doubt there’s anything in a cup of tea that actually helps the writing. Instead it’s the break and move away for a few minutes to boil the kettle that makes the difference. I come back to the page and sometimes the problem is solved without my consciously thinking about it.” Excuse me while I go and pop the kettle on right now. Let me leave you by pointing to another piece of research highlighted by the Peking University academics: apparently, “it has been found that people believe that those who drink tea have a particular set of personal characteristics such as ‘smart’, ‘innovative’, ‘elegant’, ‘self-confident’ and ‘steady’.” I wholeheartedly concur."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/18/john-lithgow-show-prompts-surge-in-demand-for-out-of-print-anthology","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T14:00:16Z","webTitle":"John Lithgow show prompts surge in demand for out-of-print anthology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/18/john-lithgow-show-prompts-surge-in-demand-for-out-of-print-anthology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/18/john-lithgow-show-prompts-surge-in-demand-for-out-of-print-anthology","fields":{"headline":"John Lithgow show prompts surge in demand for out-of-print anthology","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The actor John Lithgow has prompted a surge of interest in an out-of-print book of short stories first published in 1939, after featuring it in his new Broadway show. Stories By Heart sees Lithgow read aloud, and then act out, tales from British author W Somerset Maugham’s 1939 anthology Tellers of Tales. The book has been out of print for decades – hardcover copies are currently listed online for anywhere between £400 in the UK and more than $1,000 (£720) in the US – but used bookseller Abebooks has reported it has been inundated with demand for the title this week, selling all of the 24 copies it had listed in just the last seven days, for between $8 and $120. Abebooks said that it could have sold hundreds more had they been available. “Only a print-on-demand version of Maugham’s collection of stories is now available. Due to the book’s age and obscurity, it’s likely that only a small number of original copies still exist,” said spokesman Richard Davies. Edited by Maugham, Tellers of Tales is a 1,500-page compendium of stories by 96 authors and includes short works by the likes of Christopher Isherwood, Saki, Leo Tolstoy and Gustave Flaubert. Lithgow picked Maugham’s book for his show because his father, Arthur Lithgow, used to read it to him as a child. The Third Rock from the Sun actor told PBS: “We would pick the stories, and he would read them out loud, performing all the parts full-out. When I hold it in my hands now, my father comes back. I try to recreate the sort of period of discovery that I went through as a boy with my siblings, just listening to my father read great stories. It was probably the closest we ever felt to my father … bedtime stories with this big, fat book.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/18/chelsea-accused-fifa-breaking-rules-signings-25-minors","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T21:46:00Z","webTitle":"Chelsea accused in Fifa inquiry of breaking rules on signings of 25 minors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/18/chelsea-accused-fifa-breaking-rules-signings-25-minors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/18/chelsea-accused-fifa-breaking-rules-signings-25-minors","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea accused in Fifa inquiry of breaking rules on signings of 25 minors","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Chelsea have been accused, after an initial Fifa investigation, of breaking the rules on the signing of 25 foreign players under the age of 18. The number of cases could rise, with the matter now in the hands of the governing body’s disciplinary committee, which has the power to impose sanctions – chief among them a ban on transfers. Fifa announced last September that it was looking into alleged breaches at Chelsea when it came to the recruitment of youth players from overseas – making them the first English club to face such action. Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid were investigated for infringements related to the signing of minors and each was given a two-window transfer ban, although Real served only one after a successful appeal to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas). The initial investigation into Chelsea was carried out by the compliance unit of Fifa’s transfer matching system (TMS) and it is believed it was first alerted by the case of Bertrand Traoré, the Burkina Faso forward. He was signed to professional terms by Chelsea on 1 January 2014, the day the transfer window opened after his 18th birthday, but pictures would emerge of him playing for the club against Arsenal in a “non-competitive” game on 23 October 2011, when he was 16. The pictures came to Fifa’s attention in January 2016. Clubs are not permitted to sign players under the age of 18 from other countries unless their parents have emigrated for reasons not connected to football or both the player and club are based within 50km of a national border. Under Fifa’s Article 19, the only other exception is for transfers within either the European Union or European Economic Area where the player is aged between 16 and 18. Fifa was concerned that Traoré, who left Chelsea for Lyon last June, did not appear to fulfil any of the exemptions. TMS flagged a total of 25 player cases in which it thought Chelsea might have transgressed and it passed its findings to the disciplinary committee, which is searching for further examples in a forensic look at the club’s academy. It is within its remit to discard any of the original 25 cases. The disciplinary committee can examine any incoming transfer over a period of 10 years. It has requested information from Chelsea and is in contact with the Football Association. It wants the FA to provide facts and figures for the 25 players – and possibly others – such as the registration details and the matches in which they have played. The disciplinary committee’s investigation is at an early stage but it is expected to develop quickly over the coming months. When it has been completed it will submit its evidence to an independent panel within the disciplinary committee, who will reach a verdict. If found guilty, Chelsea would be entitled to appeal to Fifa and then to Cas. A Chelsea spokesman said: “Chelsea FC complies with all Fifa statutes and regulations when recruiting players.” Fifa deems there to be different levels of infringement on the regulations regarding minors, with the most serious being a breach of Article 19. Behind that there are less serious ones, some administrative, such as the failure to request authorisation through the correct channels. Fifa’s principle, which it has established, is that – irrespective of the number of minors involved – a systemic breach of the rules is so serious it should entail a transfer embargo. The amount of cases affects the severity of the sanction but, if a club has a low number, Fifa believes it should not mean it avoids a ban. It is also understood that Fifa worries that a one-window suspension does not create harmful consequences; it can be worked around with sufficient planning. Chelsea have argued that they had an option agreement, registered with and approved by the FA and Premier League, to secure Traoré’s registration after he turned 18 and which allowed them to play him in what were in effect considered trial games. In 2010 the club reached a settlement with Lens, which was ratified with Cas, to avoid a two-window transfer embargo that stemmed from the signing of Gaël Kakuta. Fifa says it does not comment on ongoing investigations nor can it confirm whether an investigation is ongoing. The Barcelona investigation was triggered by a newspaper article about the club’s signing of Lee Seung-woo – “the South Korean Messi” – aged 13. An employee at Fifa TMS read it and thought the deal might be in breach of the regulations. TMS would uncover 31 cases of potential transgressions and the independent panel would find Barcelona guilty on all 31. The club’s appeals failed and they were banned from two windows in 2015. Lee is now at Verona in Serie A. Real’s case started at Fifa TMS in October 2013 and in January 2016 they were found guilty of violating the rules on the registration of 39 minors. They had been investigated on 70. Cas would uphold 37 of the guilty verdicts but reduced the ban to one window – January 2017 – because the infringements were deemed to be less serious than those of Barcelona. Atlético’s numbers were the most startling in Spain, partly because of a partnership with Dalian Wanda Group, the Chinese property company. It saw many Chinese players coming to train at their academy. Fifa considered 183 cases in its final judgment; 153 would be confirmed. Atlético served their ban across both windows of last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"inequality/2018/jan/21/technology-widen-pay-gap-hit-womens-jobs-hardest-davos-report","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T12:20:42Z","webTitle":"Technology will widen pay gap and hit women hardest – Davos report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jan/21/technology-widen-pay-gap-hit-womens-jobs-hardest-davos-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2018/jan/21/technology-widen-pay-gap-hit-womens-jobs-hardest-davos-report","fields":{"headline":"Technology will widen pay gap and hit women hardest – Davos report","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The gulf between men and women at work – in both pay and status – is likely to widen unless action is taken to tackle inequality in high-growth sectors such as technology, say researchers at this week’s World Economic Forum summit in Davos. A new WEF report on the future of jobs finds the dominance of men in industries such as information and biotechnology, coupled with the enduring failure of women to rise to the top even in the health and education sectors, is helping to reverse gender equality after years of improvements. The report estimates that 57% of the jobs set to be displaced by technology between now and 2026 belong to women. According to Saadia Zahidi, the WEF’s head of education, gender and work, this underlines that global efforts to reduce gender inequality in business are stalling. “We’re really looking at a worsening of inequality, particularly in IT but across all sectors,” Zahidi said. “We are losing valuable opportunity to reduce gender inequality.” The warning comes at a historic moment in the 47-year history of Davos: for the first time, the annual gathering of the world’s political and financial leaders in the Swiss mountain resort will have all-female co-chairs, in an attempt to increase awareness of longstanding gender and other inequalities in business and wider society. The seven women chosen to lead the meeting come from all sectors of society: from the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, to Chetna Sinha, an Indian social entrepreneur focused on micro-finance for female entrepreneurs. Sharan Burrow, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation and another of the seven co-chairs, said the fact that no men have been appointed to any of the meeting’s strategic roles this year “sends a strong signal that all is not right with the world”. Burrow, an Australian union leader who described herself in her acceptance speech in 2010 as a “warrior for women”, said recent events had made it even more important to speak up for gender equality in the workplace and society at large. “We saw a wave of misogyny unleashed last year and it’s been allowed to escalate by government and corporations,” she told the Guardian. The US president Donald Trump, who is expected to attend Davos this week, was “partly responsible for unleashing” this wave, she added. Despite introducing a quota in 2011 designed to increase the number of female delegates attending, men continue to dominate Davos. Just 21% of some 3,000 delegates are women. The WEF’s annual gender gap report at the end of last year calculated that the gulf between male and female opportunity had widened for first time since it started gathering data in 2006. “The global economic model has failed working people and failed women more than most,” Burrow said. “In the world of work, using any set of indicators, progress for women has stagnated. This has been driven by corporate greed and profit, more than anything.” Chetna Sinha, the founder and chair of the Mann Deshi Foundation, believes that the all-female panel will bring gender inequality into “the heart of the corporate/business world, and that’s a really useful thing”. She is particularly keen to ensure that “voices of poor women” are heard, adding that the panel emphasises the diversity of experience at Davos, with non-governmental and grassroots organisations joining the political and business leaders. “At Davos, I see myself representing the fractured world,” she said. Zahidi, whose team’s report on the future of work is published on Monday, identified two potential causes for the stalled progression of women in business. First, the fact there are fewer women working in high-growth areas such as IT, biotech and infrastructure, leading to a “smaller pipeline” even as larger numbers of women are going into higher education to study the relevant subjects. Second, Zahidi said that even in high-growth sectors which typically employ lots of women – such as education, health and the care sector – the “leadership positions are still dominated by men”. Despite widespread warnings about increasing automation – robots (real and virtual) doing the work of human beings – hitting so-called blue collar jobs in manufacturing, less has been said about “pink collar” jobs in customer service and administration typically held by women. Zahidi said corporations needed to consider organisational change at all levels of the workplace. “It needs a holistic approach from companies when thinking about gender equality – not just board-level positions. Diversity leads to creativity, which is even more necessary in a world undergoing an industrial revolution,” she said. Each year, studies such as one from accountancy firm Grant Thornton in 2015, Women in business: the value of diversity, point out that companies perform better when they have at least one woman on the board. Yet change has been glacial and, after years of some improvement, is beginning to stall. Mervyn Davies, the former senior banker and minister whose 2011 report set a 25% target for women on FTSE-100 boards, is not attending Davos this year. He applauds efforts to increase participation at the meeting, and believes any future progress will be led by “upwardly focused activism” rather than the old model, exemplified by Davos, of “downward discussion”. “I think the mood of society is really changing very speedily. We are at a tipping point where the up-and-coming generation is going to say ‘we’re not going to tolerate this,’ ” Lord Davies said, adding, “We’ve got to get women back in all workplaces.” Two years after his final report on the issue, Davies talked about the entrenched opinions he faced even as a successful chairman of a leading bank, Standard Chartered. “I faced a huge amount of hostility from men. I was a member of their club and because I was an insider they accused me of being an agent provocateur from the inside.” His final report called for one third of all FTSE-350 boards to be held by women. Despite the signs of stagnation, both Davies and Zahidi, who last year authored a book about the impact of more women joining the workforce in the Muslim world, are optimistic, partly because of the next generation. “The fact there has been a very public conversation around sexual harassment, around the #MeToo and the Time’sUp movements – all of this reflects the fact that a much larger number of people care about the influence of power,” said Zahidi. “There is now positive momentum and we need to make sure material change is achieved.” Zahidi points out that among the younger people attending Davos, the so-called global leaders and global shapers, 54% are women. Arriving in Davos, Burrow said: “We have the power in our hands to really change. The question is, do we have the courage?” World-changing women? The seven Davos co-chairs Christine Lagarde Managing director of the IMF The French lawyer and former cabinet minister has been the head of the International Monetary Fund since 2011, when she replaced the scandal-hit Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Re-elected for a second five-year term in 2016, she is regularly ranked as one of the most powerful women in the world by Forbesmagazine. Ginni Rometty Chief executive of IBM Having started as a systems engineer in 1981, Rometty worked in sales, marketing and strategy before becoming the first woman to lead the head IBM in 2011. One of the best paid executives in the US – she earned $33m (nearly £24m) last year – she has faced mounting criticism for taking pay bonuses despite huge employee layoffs. Sharan Burrow General secretary of International Trade Union Confederation The Australian was the first woman to become general secretary of the Brussels-based ITUC, the world’s largest trade union federation with 180 million workers in 162 countries and territories. This self-styled “warrior for women” has worked on several campaigns for workers’ rights in the growing digital economy. Chetna Sinha Founder/chair of Mann Deshi Mahila Sahakari Bank The Mumbai-born social activist set up a bank that lends tiny sums to women in rural India after meeting a woman unable to save because other institutions thought her aim – to buy a tarpaulin to shelter her family during the monsoon – was too small. Singha’s bank, the first run for and by rural women to get a co-operative banking licence, has reached hundreds of thousands of women. Erna Solberg Prime minister of Norway Elected Norway’s second female prime minister in 2013 after serving as leader of the Conservative party since May 2004. As minister for local government, a tough stance on the country’s asylum policy earned her the nickname “Jern-Erna” (Iron Erna). Subsequently involved in the decision to reject a request for asylum by the Israeli nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu. Solberg was re-elected last year. Fabiola Gianotti Director general of Cern In 2016, the Italian particle physicist became the first woman to run Cern – the pan-European nuclear research organisation best known for its large hadron collider. Always ranks high on lists of global thinkers and most influential scientists – of either gender. Isabelle Kocher Chief executive of Engie The only female CEO in the CAC 40, the benchmark French stock market, Kocher has led a radical transformation of the energy group formerly known as GDF Suez since her appointment in 2016. Having decided Engie should “take its responsibility” over climate change, she has sold 20% of its assets, notably in coal power. She also set internal targets for at least a quarter of Engie executives, and 35% of “high-potential staff” to be women.

Every Saturday was by the far the most exciting, memorable day I recall as a young boy growing up with my dad, Leroy, being a professional footballer. My happiest memories as a child were waking up in our flat in Streatham, south London, putting on my West Ham shirt with my brother Daron (more often than not before we brushed our teeth) and sitting in awe with Dad as he ate his pre-match fry-up in preparation for his big game at Upton Park in the late 80s. We would then make the hour-long drive across London together as a family and as his sons we had the luxury of not only watching our dad play against the biggest teams in the country, we also had the opportunity to be in the dressing room warming up with household names such as Liam Brady, Paul Ince and Julian Dicks 20 minutes before kick-off. Those are memories that will stay with me for the rest of my life and they inspired me to become a professional footballer, but without your poise, class, bravery, skill and desire to break down barriers and play the game you love under immense pressure and scrutiny I doubt I would ever have had these precious times. You see, even though you were only six years older than him you were my dad’s hero. You were the man he based his game on – watching not only your world‑class, outstanding, centre-forward play and goals for West Brom as a teenager – but also the elegance, determination and drive to perform at the incredible level that you did in the face of cruel, inhumane abuse directed at you for the perceived “crime” of the colour of your skin. My father admits that the pain of vile racism in football had caused him to question his career choice but he had you as a reference point and an example and that helped convince him that you could be a successful, black footballer in the racially stereotyped climate of the 1970s and 80s in our country. If it wasn’t for you he may never have found the confidence, fortitude and self-belief to make a career in the game he loved so much and in turn, those lifelong memories and experiences that I gained as a young boy through my dad wouldn’t have happened so I too may never have enjoyed my own football career without your influence. With the racial prejudice that you and other players had to put up with and in turn break down I may never have had the luxury of lacing my boots up at 3pm every Saturday with thoughts of dealing with racism from the terraces or opponents the furthest thing from my mind. If it wasn’t for you pushing forward with fearlessness and pride through the time you received a bullet in the post after being selected to represent England, put up with chants of “nigger lick my boots” or bananas routinely being thrown on the pitch with the dignity that you did, the multicultural game that we now take for granted would have taken even longer to come about. Your immense presence and ability also forced our society to look in the mirror and challenge itself to be better and this is why I am compelled to write this letter to you out of respect, gratitude and honour for the true icon and pioneer of our game. Your goals gave millions of football supporters joy, but your kind-hearted, strong and courageous character gave the generation beneath you (including me) the belief to push forward and follow their dreams without the overt, sickening racism that you and other players had to contend with during your playing career. The best way that we as the younger generation can honour your legacy is to use the benefits that your struggle has afforded us and move this game and our society further forward. We have a duty to you to uphold your example of skill, humility, passion and respect for future generations to learn that no matter your race, gender, faith or creed, we all have a positive role to play in our society. We have a duty to you to follow your message that the best way to beat the bigots is to be ourselves, strive to be outstanding at what we do and smile while doing it. That’s exactly what you did. I had the immense pleasure of briefly meeting you on a few occasions and I regret that I didn’t take the opportunity to tell you how important you were in my father’s life and in mine and also those of countless professional players and supporters. Instead I smiled, nodded and shook your hand with a shy respect and awe which didn’t come close to articulating how you affected and inspired me. I pray this letter somehow reaches you in heaven. You truly were “The Man”. Thank you Cyrille. Rest in peace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/18/the-birthday-party-review-harold-pinter-jones-wanamaker-mangan-mackie","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T23:00:07Z","webTitle":"The Birthday Party review – Pinter's cryptic classic turns 60 with a starry cast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/18/the-birthday-party-review-harold-pinter-jones-wanamaker-mangan-mackie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/18/the-birthday-party-review-harold-pinter-jones-wanamaker-mangan-mackie","fields":{"headline":"The Birthday Party review – Pinter's cryptic classic turns 60 with a starry cast","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“The first test of any work of art,” claimed George Orwell, “is survival.” If that is true, it is one Harold Pinter’s play passes with flying colours. Derided on its debut in 1958, 60 years on The Birthday Party has lost none of its capacity to intrigue. In Ian Rickson’s starry production, it emerges not simply as a rep thriller filtered through a European sensibility – a cross between Agatha Christie and Kafka, as a German director once said – but as a play of intense psychological realism. It is well known that the action concerns the abduction from a seaside boarding house of a recalcitrant lodger, Stanley, by a pair of visitors. But Rickson immediately establishes the plausibility of the situation. Meg and Petey, who own the house, are often played as cartoon grotesques. Here, however, there is a key moment when Zoë Wanamaker’s trim, doting Meg and Peter Wight’s sturdily reliable Petey exchange wistful glances over the breakfast table about the son they never had. Instantly this establishes Stanley as their surrogate child, and explains why Wanamaker drops her shopping bags in terror on first encountering the visitors. Everything follows logically from this opening exchange. Watching Toby Jones’s excellent Stanley, I was reminded of the story of a respectable matron gazing at a portrait of Truman Capote in a bookstore window and saying to her companion: “Daisy, if that’s a child, he’s dangerous.” In the same way, Jones seems pampered and feral at the same time. He is given a drum as a birthday present and beats it like a baby before lapsing into a demonic rage. Far from submitting meekly to the intrusive visitors, Jones goes on to the front foot as if seeking to intimidate them. Jones is not the first actor to play Stanley as a defiant rebel rather than a passive victim: what he brings to the role is the air of a tantrum-filled child whose psychological development, like his physical freedom, is sadly arrested. Rickson extends this quest for realism to the Quay brothers’ design, which suggests the rising damp of second-rate digs, and to the surrounding performances. It is now commonplace to see the invasive Goldberg and McCann as symbols of the social and religious orthodoxy that Stanley rejects. But Stephen Mangan plays Goldberg brilliantly as a figure whose toothily smiling bonhomie conceals a profound insecurity. You see that in the final act, when Mangan becomes the classic organisation man terrified by the unpredictable. Tom Vaughan-Lawlor also brings out perfectly the paranoia of his Irish sidekick, as if to remind us of Pinter’s point that conformity to established values is no guarantee of inward peace. Pearl Mackie can’t do much with the neighbour, Lulu, who is chiefly there to remind us of Goldberg’s predatoriness; Pinter went on to write much more complex women. Once or twice I thought Stephen Warbeck’s music, with its nerve-jangling chords, was too insistently menacing, as if we were closer to Elm Street than a seaside esplanade. But this is a production that does rich justice to this strange, elusive play, and it is packed with illuminating detail. Even Petey’s final dismay at seeing Goldberg in a bourgeois homburg underscores the fact that Pinter is advocating active resistance to what he termed “the shit-stained strictures of centuries of tradition”. • At the Harold Pinter theatre, London, until 14 April.

The Metropolitan police have been told that a third man was allegedly sexually assaulted by the Oscar-winning actor, this time in Westminster, London, in 2005. “On December 13 we received an allegation that the man sexually assaulted a man (Victim 3) in 2005 in Westminster,” a Met police spokesman said on 18 January. The force did not directly link Spacey to the fresh allegation, but said the alleged perpetrator is the same as the subject of earlier complaints. Spacey is already being investigated over two complaints of sexual assault in the south London borough of Lambeth – one in 2005, the other in 2008. Spacey, 58, was one of the first Hollywood figures to face accusations in the fallout of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The actor was initially accused of making unwelcome sexual advances towards Anthony Rapp, when Rapp was 14. Spacey apologised to Rapp but said he did not remember the incident. Further allegations followed, many of which centred on Spacey’s tenure as artistic director of the Old Vic, in London. Spacey has denied some of the allegations, but has not responded to others. He is seeking “evaluation and treatment”, according to a statement he made in November. Following the allegations against him, the actor was fired by Netflix TV series House of Cards.

Built by German-born architect Henning Stummel in London, it has a “wing” for him and his partner, film producer Alice Dawson, and one for their teenage daughters, Justine and Ayesha. “The layout works really well for us,” Stummel says. “Our children are at an age where they like the idea of a private realm, and then we have a space in the middle where we can all come together.” With their pyramid-shaped roofs – topped with skylights – the buildings are reminiscent of English oast houses. But Stummel’s point of inspiration was in fact Hugh Casson’s elephant house at London Zoo, built in the early 60s, which has its own series of conical roofs. The breakers’ yard came with planning permission for a bungalow surrounded by a slim moat of a garden. But Stummel was determined to create something more ambitious, while dealing with the challenges raised by the irregular site. A brick “gatehouse” to the nearby street holds space for his architectural practice, which he founded in 2000 after time with Norman Foster and mentor David Chipperfield. The gate begins a purposefully processional journey down a cobbled pathway towards the central courtyard and those distinctive timber-framed pavilions, all different heights and sizes, each space connecting to the next. “We wanted a material that would tie the whole structure together without looking too drab or grey,” Stummel says. “We chanced upon a sheet metal coating called GreenCoat and loved this warm, earthy, burnt-orange colour.” The orange continues inside, in the form of joinery made from an orange-coloured engineered wood called Valchromat. Stummel even found an Eames rocking chair in a terracotta shade. A large dining room and kitchen, with a concrete floor and ceiling, is the home’s central point. It connects with a family sitting room, arranged around a wood-burning stove. Much of the furniture, including a dining table, master bed, plywood sofa and a coffee table, also by Stummel. The courtyard garden serves as a tranquil outdoor room. Here, it’s easy to forget the city beyond, says Stummel, particularly with the ever-present sound of water from the 6m-long (and 1.2m deep) lap pool. “You can hear the water wherever you are in the house,” Stummel says. “And its reflections bounce inside. It’s a wonderful, serene feeling.” House rules Biggest architectural challenge Dealing with sound: you don’t want echoing interiors.

Nurseries have long complained that the hourly rates paid by the government are too low and a poll by the Pre-school Learning Alliance has indicated they are clawing money back by charging for meals, nappies and trips, and in some cases raising fees for younger children. The survey, the first to be carried out since the policy came into force last September, found only a third (35%) of places under the scheme were completely free. A similar proportion of nurseries said they had increased fees for non-government funded hours (35%) and introduced or increased charges for goods and services (37%) as a consequence. Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: “It’s clear from these findings that the government’s flagship childcare policy is failing both providers and parents. “Respondents have laid out in black and white that the 30 hours policy is simply not working, with a continued lack of adequate funding leaving many with no option but to pass the funding shortfall on to parents. “This has left parents to pay the price for government underfunding through often unexpected charges for things like nappies, food and trips, while the government continues to claim that it’s delivering on its promise of ‘free’ childcare.” The children and families minister, Robert Goodwill, said last month that in the first term of the new policy, 202,800 children were in a 30 hours place and more than 305,000 signed up to access the offer in January. To be eligible for the scheme both parents must be working for at least 16 hours a week but each earn less than £100,000 a year. Parents of three- and four-year-olds were already entitled to 15 hours of free childcare before September but nurseries are under no obligation to provide the additional 15 hours. The survey of 1,662 nurseries, pre-schools and childminders found a fifth (21%) did not think they would be financially sustainable in a year, while 44% said that if the funding rate was not increased, it would have a significant negative impact. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are investing a record amount of around £6bn every year by 2020 in childcare and have doubled the free childcare available to working parents to 30 hours a week, saving them up to £5,000 a year per child. “Providers can choose whether to offer 30 hours and what pattern of days and hours they offer parents. We have always been clear that government funding is not intended to cover the costs of meals or additional services. “However, while providers can charge parents for additional extras, this cannot be a condition of the child’s place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jan/17/off-white-business-casual-paris-fashion-week-menswear-virgil-abloh","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T17:37:16Z","webTitle":"Off-White keeps it business casual at Paris fashion week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/17/off-white-business-casual-paris-fashion-week-menswear-virgil-abloh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jan/17/off-white-business-casual-paris-fashion-week-menswear-virgil-abloh","fields":{"headline":"Off-White keeps it business casual at Paris fashion week","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The autumn menswear shows in Paris began this week with shock and hype: shock that Kim Jones was stepping down as men’s artistic director at Louis Vuitton, and hype generated by Off-White fashion house, which caused a near-ruckus of bumbags outside the Pompidou Centre on Wednesday morning. Off-White was founded by Virgil Abloh, a 36-year-old architect, streetwear designer and DJ. Until recently, he was best known as the multi-hyphenate Instagram associate of Kanye West, for whom he has worked as an artistic director and cameo star in Keeping Up With The Kardashians. The theme of the collection was business casual and teenagers grappling with the idea of adulthood, with much of the clothing halfway between tailoring and streetwear. Highlights included models carrying jackets in dry cleaning bags and shirts not just buttoned incorrectly – something Balenciaga experimented with last season – but constructed that way, with buttons curving down to the right and edges poorly tucked in. Other shirts were deliberately creased, while lapels on blazers were popped to reveal fleece lining. To maximise the casual element, most of the models wore Nike trainers. Elsewhere suits were loose, in pinstripe or worn over hoodies. The models walked with a sulk and those with straight hair wore it lank and greasy. The music echoed the theme, so the show opened with Weezer and closed with Tyler, the Creator, two acts who, though 20 years apart, both spoke to a trucluent generation trying to belong. Abloh used business casual – which has been in the ether in fashion for the past 12 months – to communicate something wider about teenagers, role models and acceptance. Speaking to the Guardian during a model casting this week, he explained that his mood board was “dictated by how a young person sees themselves in a larger narrative of traditional menswear – what does a kid who is into sneakers wear if he needs to buy something formal?” The answer is probably not Off-White, which is catwalk-expensive: even a recently launched, more affordable diffusion line priced T-shirts at slightly shy of £100. It’s a conundrum Abloh is trying to answer, at least aesthetically if not financially. Rather than courting the traditional fashion world, Abloh designs for Instagram and for hypebeasts – and he clearly knows how to create a memorable image. His most recent ready-to-wear women’s show – a fun homage to Princess Diana in which Naomi Campbell walked the runway wearing cycling shorts – was one of the standout moments of the previous Paris fashion week. Despite Abloh’s striking show, news of the departure of Jones at Louis Vuitton will probably be the main talking point from Paris. Jones reinvigorated the brand’s menswear line for a younger, hipper generation while retaining some of the heritage elements (see last year’s collaboration with Supreme). Rumours are swirling that Jones may replace Bailey at Burberry. There is also speculation about who will replace Jones, with Abloh believed to be a key contender."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/17/the-myth-of-stokes-tory-turnaround","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T18:50:23Z","webTitle":"The myth of Stoke’s Tory turnaround | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/17/the-myth-of-stokes-tory-turnaround","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/17/the-myth-of-stokes-tory-turnaround","fields":{"headline":"The myth of Stoke’s Tory turnaround","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I think the Stoke-on-Trent South MP Jack Brereton was rather misleading in his dig at the Guardian (Letters, 15 January) for not mentioning that the recent so-called turnaround in the city was down to his Tory party locally and nationally. He neglected to mention that he was the cabinet member who oversaw deep cuts to Stoke-on-Trent’s local services, including our children’s centres, social care and homelessness support. It is the current Conservative administration that has wasted tens of millions of pounds of council reserves to the detriment of the city’s long-term financial security. Much of what Mr Brereton cited as improvements to the city are the legacy of Labour’s actions in power, including the creation of the central business district and cultural quarter, the district heating network, the relocation of Staffordshire University and the drive for better housing and jobs in the city. The Tories also have a legacy in Stoke-on-Trent, of course. It can be seen in the faces and the daily struggles of former miners and steelworkers left to fend for themselves by the Thatcher government, and now put in jeopardy by this government’s heartless reforms to social security. If Mr Brereton is really serious about improving the lives of people in our city, it is this legacy he should be seeking to come to terms with. Cllr Mohammed Pervez Leader of Stoke-on-Trent Labour group • Jack Brereton omitted to refer to the cuts which are “on the up” to the extent of £34m over the next two years, in addition to the £172m already inflicted on the city since 2010. Oddly, in mentioning the “positive impact” of the new administration, he fails to make reference to the £2.4m cut in adult care services, the £1.29m cut in children’s services or the £1m cut in provision for the homeless, which do not quite appear to bear out his claim of a “tremendous turnaround” in the city’s ambition – unless, of course, the “tremendous turnaround” is intended to be in a reverse direction.

Young epitomised the indomitable spirit of his era; after the space shuttle landing, he said: “We’re really not too far from going to the stars.” He was described by Lee Silver, the California Institute of Technology professor who trained many Apollo astronauts, as the “archetypical extraterrestrial”. Young’s career as an astronaut began in the early 1960s. The first astronauts had been recruited in 1959, with the Mercury Seven, a group that included the first American in space, Alan Shepard, and the first American in orbit, John Glenn. In 1962 came the New Nine, also known as Astronaut Group 2, among them the first man to walk on the moon, Neil Armstrong, and Young. Young’s relationship with the moon was lengthy, and he finally got to stand on its surface in April 1972. He shared three Apollo 16 moonwalks with Charles Duke, and deployed the lunar roving vehicle on only its second outing. “We wanted to see how the vehicle handled,” Young said. “We had the camera there to document it too, which nobody else had done before. It was like driving on ice when you cut the thing too sharp at about five or seven kilometres per hour. It would slide out and go backwards.”, But by then space flight was seen by many members of the public as boring and old hat. His previous voyage to the moon had attracted far more publicity. After a decade of waiting, in 1969 space flight was big news. Between 18 and 26 May that year, Young was one of the three-strong crew on Apollo 10, which circumnavigated the moon 31 times in the dress rehearsal for Apollo 11, the moon landing itself, which began on 16 July. On Apollo 10 he remained on the command module in orbit, while his two fellow crew members skimmed above the moon’s surface. Three types of spacecraft had paved the way. The initial Mercury programme was about getting a man into orbit around Earth, and the interim stage before the Apollo flights was the Gemini programme. Young flew in the two-person Gemini capsules; he shared Gemini 3, the first flight in 1965, with Gus Grissom, and in 1966 commanded Gemini 10. Twenty years later, in the wake of the Challenger space shuttle disaster of January 1986, in which seven crew members perished 73 seconds after takeoff, Young showed he was not afraid to criticise Nasa. As chief of the astronaut office, he told the presidential commission looking into the affair that there were many flaws in the design and “it’s not going to be a cheap quick fix”. The son of William Young, a civil engineer, and his wife, Wanda (nee Howland), John was born in San Francisco, California, 11 months after the Wall Street crash. Times were tough, and within 18 months the family had moved to Cartersville, Georgia. Soon they were moving again, to Orlando, Florida, where John completed his studies at the local high school in 1948. Back in Georgia, at the Institute of Technology, he trained with the US Navy reserve while taking a BSc in aeronautical engineering with the highest honours in 1952. By June of that year he had been commissioned as an ensign. He served on the USS Laws in the Sea of Japan during the closing stages of the Korean war. Training as a naval aviator led him from helicopters to fighters and on to service on the aircraft carrier Coral Sea, flying subsonic Grumman F-9 Cougars, before he joined the first “super carrier”, the USS Forrestal, flying supersonic Vought F-8s. Young spent three years in the early 60s at the US Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. Among his achievements there was establishing two world rate-of-climb records in a McDonnell-Douglas Phantom II fighter. He received several awards, including the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1981 for his role in the space shuttle programme. As well as commanding the space shuttle Columbia during its first orbital flight in 1981, he headed the Columbia mission in 1983 that carried the Spacelab module – a reusable laboratory – into orbit for the first time. He published his autobiography, Forever Young, in 2012. Young is survived by his second wife, Susy Feldman, and by the two children, Sandra and John, from his first marriage, to Barbara White, which ended in divorce. • John Watts Young, astronaut, naval aviator, test pilot and engineer, born 24 September 1930; died 5 January 2018 This article was amended on 18 January.

Carrie Gracie’s careful and clear explanation of her position in regard to equality in the institution (or the lack of it) was compelling. How profoundly depressing that she should then be ridiculed in a leaked exchange between the septuagenarian John Humphrys and Jon Sopel as his sycophantic sidekick. Carrie Gracie sends wonderful reports from China to BBC news services, working across two languages to explain to us a vast and important nation that we hardly know but desperately need to understand better. Her talent for explanation and expression was easily seen in her letter to the corporation, where she emphasised her position as someone who wants equality, not more money. As Purves says, many overweening news presenters need to realise that it is the BBC itself which is the star and propels them to the top of their pay grade. They should check their male, middle-class and egoistical privilege. Jane Owen Petersfield, Hampshire • Carrie Gracie is to be applauded for her stand against unequal pay (BBC editor quits over ‘illegal’ gender pay gap, 8 January). We should also spare a thought for the generic (but legal) unfairness of pay in other professions. This is most obvious in nursing, traditionally a female career, whose practitioners must expect inordinately lower salaries than (traditionally male) doctors, yet the lines between their activities and skills are being increasingly blurred, both in general practice and in hospitals. Such disparity is also apparent between the activities of domestic cleaners (usually women) and gardeners (most often men), the former commanding hourly rates that can be half that of the latter. Is it not time to end this kind of discrimination, too? Noël Riley Sudbury, Suffolk • The Newsnight presenter, Evan Davis, says the idea of equal pay for the same work in showbusiness makes little sense. Libby Purves says he is not in showbusiness but is “an economist who did a bit of Today”. I think, however, that he is an unusually skilled and engaging presenter and interviewer. But I also think that pricing human beings according to our rarity value treats us like commodities rather than as people. Pam Laurance London • Zoe Williams is generous in attributing to courtesy John Humphrys’ failure to ask serious questions of Henry Bolton (Ukip trivia that speaks volumes, 16 January). In fact, for a considerable time now, the default position adopted by Today’s often discourteously aggressive interviewing has been that of the cynical, reactionary Ukipper-in-the-street. Devil’s advocate? Maybe… or maybe not. Bravo Suzanne Moore for drawing attention to the serious impartiality problem posed by this so-called flagship programme.

Historically, they have ranged from a menagerie of exotic animals to fabulous jewels, but Emmanuel Macron – by first offering the Chinese a horse called Vesuvius, and now offering the British the loan of the Bayeux tapestry – has revealed himself this month as the modern master of the diplomatic gesture. Most contemporary diplomatic gifts reveal more vulgarity than thought. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman gave the former US president Barack Obama a silver-toned letter opener and pen priced at $56,729 (£41,000), while the president of Argentina brought the first family a black electric bicycle worth $1,499 and two signed Lionel Messi shirts worth $1,700. Other modern diplomatic gifts have come cheaper; in 2009, the then US secretary of state, Hilary Clinton, presented the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, with a large red “reset button” to represent a reboot in relations – except that the Russian word emblazoned on the button did not translate as “reset” but “overcharge”. Others are just best forgotten: Gordon Brown went home with a DVD box set hastily bought from the local store by Obama’s novice aides. Macron, by contrast, operates through loftier symbols. His official portrait is laden with more signals than a Renaissance court portrait; Donald Trump was invited to Bastille Day celebrations last year to see the military might of France and, by implication, the European contribution to Nato; and Macron chose to make his big speech on the refounding of European sovereignty in Greece in front of the Acropolis, the birthplace of democracy. Last week Macron promised to sign a “Quirinal Treaty” of friendship with Italy, seizing on the treaty idea when suggested by a journalist at a press conference. He would like the European parliamentary seats vacated by the British to be elected on a trans-Europe basis. Nationalism replaced by federalism. “Modern political life must rediscover a sense of symbolism,” Macron told the German Der Spiegel newspaper in October. “We need to develop a kind of political heroism. We need to be amenable again to creating grand narratives.” Behind the symbolism lies a frenetic activism and an opportunist’s eye. With Germany preoccupied by coalition talks, the US on the verge of a breakdown, and Theresa May lost in Brexit, the opportunity for France to be the transformative leader of Europe is unparalleled. Context has given him greater credibility. As a result, the roll call of power brokers beating a path to the Elysée is extraordinary. Equally, he travels. Since he became president Macron has visited Africa five times, helping to establish the G5 Sahel taskforce. He will go to Senegal next month. By contrast, no British prime minister has been to Africa since 2013 and the UK diplomatic footprint is diminishing. In Saudi Arabia, Macron engineered the release of the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, and in Iran he has supported the nuclear deal. Foreign Office ministers privy to ambassadorial cables from around the world say from August they started seeing the word France with increasing frequency. Macron himself says it is the duty of France to talk to everyone. There is also a mission to explain. In two marathon speeches on French foreign policy he has set out his determination to take France beyond the old debates between Atlanticism and Gaullism. Security, migration, optimism, multilateralism and unashamed support for a more integrated Europe emerged as the great themes. The extent to which his recent ubiquity will have been a substitute for impact will emerge in the years ahead. Both Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande started with overseas ambition. Ultimately, the fate of his European mission rests in Berlin, and the willingness of Angela Merkel to go along with a version of his plans for strengthening the eurozone with a minister and a budget. Merkel, more attuned to the resistance to such ideas in eastern Europe, is under pressure from her SPD partners to agree. Privately, Macron – at least before his election – was contemptuous of the Brexit decision. He will look for every possible national advantage on financial services, but his aides insist that however the talks end, he wants Britain, one of the world’s great military powers, to remain engaged in European security and foreign policy. After all, the Bayeux tapestry is an elegant warning to the French and the British of the consequences of falling out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/21/le-jeune-homme-et-la-mort-la-sylphide-tamara-rojo-coliseum-review","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T08:00:15Z","webTitle":"The week in dance: Le Jeune Homme et la Mort/La Sylphide review – darkly enjoyable","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/21/le-jeune-homme-et-la-mort-la-sylphide-tamara-rojo-coliseum-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/21/le-jeune-homme-et-la-mort-la-sylphide-tamara-rojo-coliseum-review","fields":{"headline":"The week in dance: Le Jeune Homme et la Mort/La Sylphide review – darkly enjoyable","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"English National Ballet, to borrow from TS Eliot, are much possessed by death. They see the skull beneath the skin. Their current season at the Coliseum opened two weeks ago with a double bill of Song of the Earth and La Sylphide, and last week replaced the former with Le Jeune Homme et la Mort. All three, in very different ways, examine notions of mortality. If Kenneth MacMillan’s spare, beautiful Song of the Earth is essentially uplifting in its message of life’s renewal, Roland Petit’s Jeune Homme was conceived in 1946 as a brutal and calculated exercise in despair. The 20-minute work is often described as existential, but this is to overstate its cerebral character. Which is not to say that it isn’t darkly enjoyable. In the right hands – and Tamara Rojo’s and Ivan Vasiliev’s are absolutely the right hands – the piece is a riot of histrionic overstatement. The ballet tells the story of a young painter who is tormented by his unrequited desire for a cruel muse. He lays his life at her feet, but she taunts him mercilessly and eventually persuades him to hang himself. With his pantherine leaps and blazing-eyed, silent-movie acting style, Vasiliev is terrific as the young man. As he struts and frets to Bach’s Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor, costumed in possibly the tightest jeans ever seen on the Coliseum stage, every sinew of his sculpted musculature is taut with angst. Rojo, meanwhile, her hair in a chic little bob, slinks around in a sulphur-yellow frock and black cocktail gloves. At intervals, she evinces her self-absorption through languid developpés à la seconde, presenting her exquisitely arched feet as fetishistic bait. Then, extraordinarily, she seems to change register, all staring eyes and juddering neck. Not so much femme fatale as zombie sex doll. At 43, Rojo remains the smartest operator on the UK ballet stage. Here, she pays amused homage to Petit’s creation, but subverts the piece’s fearful misogyny and gives it a blade-sharp contemporary edge. Watching Jeune Homme today, at a time when gender relations are being debated with unprecedented intensity, it’s impossible not to see its leads as 21st-century archetypes. He’s no longer the anguished victim of her vampiric soul-sucking, but a man infuriated to the point of self-destruction by a woman who mockingly refuses to recognise the sexual and psychic authority that he has always assumed to be his birthright. The skull that Rojo wears at the end of the ballet was always beneath her character’s skin. It represents the death of the old, masculine order. August Bournonville’s La Sylphide is a quintessential work of 19th-century gothic romanticism. James (Aitor Arrieta), the ballet’s hero, becomes infatuated with the beautiful but unattainable Sylphide (Alison McWhinney), but in forcibly capturing her – again, no small contemporary resonance here – he kills her. English National Ballet have not fully internalised the Bournonville style, but they dance with fetching sincerity, and Stina Quagebeur’s vengeful sorceress is as thrilling as she is mesmerising.

Why don’t you take that off my hand and weigh me again?’ “Reporters seemed kind of disappointed that there wasn’t more bad news,” Colbert went on, showing footage of a journalist asking the doctor how Trump, given his propensity for McDonald’s and lack of exercise, is in good health. The doctor also answered questions about the president’s mental fitness, claiming he is up to the job and sharp. “It is with the utmost confidence that I assure you the president has no cognitive issues,” Colbert quipped. “He’s just very, very stupid.” Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah also addressed Trump’s physical. “Remember how during the presidential campaign Trump’s personal doctor and secondhand speedboat salesman declared that Trump would be the healthiest individual ever elected president?” he began. “Well, Trump has just had his first physical examination by the official White House navy doctor, and it looks like we owe Dr Speedboat an apology.” In response to a clip in which the White House doctor extolls Trump’s good health, Noah replied: “No heart problems, no dementia, no dentures? But did you check for racism? “So it turns out, according to the official White House doctor, Trump is completely sane,” the host continued. “Which makes me more worried because that means he’s doing all of this shit on purpose.” Noah then showed Jackson telling the press, “I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old.” “My God: if you think Trump is racist at 71, imagine how racist he’ll be when he’s 200,” Noah joked. “I’m not really surprised. Donald Trump has dictator blood. We’re used to this in Africa and other places in the world. Castro, Mugabe, the queen. After the nuclear apocalypse, Trump is going to be the only one walking around, giving speeches to cockroaches. “‘Folks, we’re going to build a roach motel,’” Noah said in his best Trump impersonation. Seth Meyers focused his monologue on the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, which have been largely stymied by the administration’s insufficient response to Hurricane Irma almost four months ago. The host explained that Puerto Rico electrical operations are only at 65% capacity, and that in remote and rural areas matters are even worse. When asked how he’d grade his response to the crisis, Trump said he’d give himself a 10 out of 10. Meyers continued: “The president might not be on the case, but there’s still Ben Carson. He’s a brain surgeon, took a Hippocratic oath and he’s the secretary of housing and urban development. Surely, he had something a little more helpful to say about this crisis.” Meyers then showed Carson, asked how many years HUD would be in Puerto Rico, responding “between one and 100”. “Ben Carson might be the first brain surgeon in history to leave a sponge inside his own head,” the host cracked. “To give you a sense of the dysfunction in the recovery efforts, a contract for hundreds of millions of dollars was afforded to a small company in Whitefish, Montana, which also happens to be the hometown of interior secretary Ryan Zinke, to help restore Puerto Rico’s electrical grid.” The company, Meyers explained, had only two employees, and the contract was cancelled after much scrutiny. The host also noted that the White House requested $44bn in relief funds for Texas and Florida, but not Puerto Rico. “Even worse, Trump and the GOP passed a tax plan that disproportionately harms Puerto Ricans by treating the American territory as a foreign entity and imposing unfair and cruel taxes on them that could result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs there,” Meyers concluded."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jan/06/falcons-rams-nfl-wild-card-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T04:37:08Z","webTitle":"Atlanta Falcons 26-13 Los Angeles Rams: NFC wild card playoffs – as it happened!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jan/06/falcons-rams-nfl-wild-card-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jan/06/falcons-rams-nfl-wild-card-live","fields":{"headline":"Atlanta Falcons 26-13 Los Angeles Rams: NFC wild card playoffs – as it happened!","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The offense was solid, not spectacular for Atlanta, but their defense gets the gold star tonight. Next week they’ll head to Philadelphia for a compelling divisional round game in a challenging stadium, licking their chops, knowing that the Eagles don’t have their top man in the quarterback position. As for LA, it’s a disappointing climax to an encouraging, even breakthrough season. They’re a well coached outfit with a ton of upside: they’ll be back. And so will we, tomorrow, for more live coverage of this wild card round. Until then, wherever you are, good morning, afternoon and goodnight. The Rams offense fails to live up to its prolific regular season, while Atlanta buckle down and get a win on the road in a cozy, warm environment, which is very nice for a dome team. Falcons 26-13 Rams, 1:08 4th quarter Goff throws a knuckleball towards Woods who can’t make the play and Atlanta take over on downs. As they say...and that’ll do it. Falcons 26-13 Rams, 1:12 4th quarter LA call their final timeout facing a 4th &amp; 6. Falcons 26-13 Rams, 1:28 4th quarter LA nearly block the punt, and Cooper nearly muffs the catch. The Rams are at the 50. Now they sputter through two plays and face a 3rd &amp; 10. Falcons 26-13 Rams, 1:53 4th quarter NBC TV in the US show that Watkins was clearly held on that play, which means they shold have had more shots at the endszone, but alas. The Rams are about to get the ball back with one timeout left. Freeman runs for three yards and we head to the warning. LA have three timeouts that will drag it this game on for a bit as Rams fans move from one parking lot to 110, which is another parking lot. Falcons 26-13 Rams, 2:05 4th quarter Goff throws to Watkins in the endzone, but it’s broken up! Deion Jones got his hand in and made the play! Falcons take over and put a bow on it. So it’s 4th &amp; goal on the five yard line. Tight end Tyler Higbee made the catch in the middle of the endzone...but it doesn’t look like he kept control! Big decision from the officials - if it’s overturned it will be 4th &amp; goal. Falcons 26-13 Rams, 2:16 4th quarter Goff looking for Woods on the left side of the endzone - incomplete! Falcons 26-13 Rams, 2:22 4th quarter Big third down coming up. Goff has a man but he’s short and they have to go for it. Goff finds Woods who juggles for a bit before grabbing the ball and getting out of bounds. It’s 2nd &amp; goal... Falcons 26-13 Rams, 4:17 4th quarter On 2nd &amp; 10, Goff is in the shotgun: then we have whistles, a false start on LA. So now it’s 2nd &amp; 15, and bad mistakes here for the Rams... Now Goff finds Higbee, who makes a series of moves that equal a big gain and a first down...except there’s a blindside block that costs them 15 yards. It was Woods, who jumped offsides on the prior play. So, that’s a pity for LA, because it’s all piling up for the upstarts...until Goff finds Watkins for a first down! Big play there for LA. They’re on the Falcons 37. Ryan, throwing off his back foot, and nearly slipping, airs out a floater to Jones who makes the catch! Touchdown Atlanta, who are in a great spot to advance now! Falcons 19-13 Rams, 6:15 4th quarter Ryan, a screen to Sanu, who runs, and RUNS! Even though one Falcon misses a block Sanu goes 52 yards through open sapce and that is an enormous play in LA! 1st &amp; goal from the Rams 10! Falcons 19-13 Rams, 7:45 4th quarter Ryan moves left, pumps and throws complete to Hooper. Big play! Time ticks! Flacons on their 41. Falcons 19-13 Rams, 8:54 4th quarter Ryan finds Jones again, and a little head fake earns the wideout a first down. Super classy from Jones there. That’s his eighth catch of the night. Now Ryan is rolling right and finds Coleman, who falls down making the catch, gets up and gets a few more yards. The turf has obviously been an issue in LA. Coleman on 2nd &amp; 2 loses a yard trying to find space on the outside. Big 3rd &amp; 3 here. It’s good, and it’s a one score game again. So now LA needs to not let Atlanta hold onto the ball for a long possession, which has been the trend. Falcons 19-10 Rams, 10:54 4th quarter After Goff is sacked, it’s 3rd &amp; 14 and another key down here for LA. Goff waits for the snap, but they give it to Malcom Brown, who runs on an interesting call - 11 yards, setting up a 32-yard field goal attempt. Falcons 19-10 Rams, 12:53 4th quarter We begin the 4th quarter, and on 2nd &amp; 15, Goff misfires looking for Kupp. Then, there’s life, and it’s Woods again, who has saved the Rams’ bacon on many occasion tonight. Goff kept steady in the pocket, found his man, and that’s a huge conversion on 3rd &amp; long. Now Gurley, with feeling! He bursts to his left, in between tackles for 14 yards, and...MORE GURLEY! This time he runs left for 33 yards: huge swaths of space for the back to roam! Rams at the 17! Falcons 19-10 Rams, end of 3rd quarter The Rams start out their second possession of this quarter, right after Cooper fumbled the kickoff again. Lucky for him the play was blown dead. The quarter ends after Gurley makes a catch and is pushed back for five yards. Is it right to say LA need to start making some plays? How is that for analysis! Wow! It’s good! Three big points makes it a two score game. Ryan is 4/4 on field goals tonight: that was his longest, and he has 13 of Atlanta’s 19 points tonight (you can check the math). Falcons 16-10 Rams, 0:24 3rd quarter Ryan, in the shotgun - throws, incomplete, broken up by Hill, looking for Sanu. Ryan is on for a 54-yard attempt! Falcons 16-10 Rams, 0:38 3rd quarter Ryan, play-action, rolls right, throws and has a man. It’s Hardy for just three yards on a play that felt like a long journey. It’s now a big 3rd &amp; 6. Falcons 16-10 Rams, 2:38 3rd quarter Jones makes a catch over the middle and then wills himself for extra yards, dragging men with him. He’s up to 74 yards now, this catch is for 16, and Atlanta are on the move up to the Rams 40. Falcons 16-10 Rams, 5:11 3rd quarter On 3rd &amp; long: Gurley drops a screen pass that ends the Ram drive. That steam LA gathered towards the end of the first half has dissipated. Hekker kicks it away and Atlanta start on their 19. Falcons 16-10 Rams, 5:22 3rd quarter Cooper manages to hang on to the kickoff return and LA start at their 26. Goff looks for Kupp on the sideline, incomplete. Now Goff is in the shotgun, and has boatloads of time, but still can’t find a receiver as he throws to no one over the middle. It’s 3rd &amp; 10. Shotgun again, Goff steps up in a busy pocket and somehow hits Woods on the sideline over the outstretched hands of Desmond Trufant. Fantastic play with zero margin for error. That’s a huge play because it gives LA’s defense more time to rest. Rams at the Falcons 46. Bryant is good from 25, Atlanta extend their lead in a drive that kept LA’s diminished defense out there for some time. Falcons 13-10 Rams, 6:48 3rd quarter Play-action: Ryan fires to his left and has Jones but he is hit immediately by Countess! Great play. It’s 3rd &amp; goal. Ryan, has time but throws off his back foot, incomplete towards the back of the endzone. So 13 plays, 76 yards and 8:15 and no TD. Here’s comes Bryant. Falcons 13-10 Rams, 7:54 3rd quarter Coleman has a head of steam and a first down at LA’s nine-yard line. Now Freeman tries to go wide on the near side but is pushed out of bounds for little gain. Safety Lamarcus Joyner is banged up on the play, another key Rams player, this time in the secondary, is shaken up. Injury timeout. Second and goal. Falcons 13-10 Rams, 9:02 3rd quarter Coleman has it, barrels forward, and is wrapped up! He’s short of a first down and Atlanta will go for it! Ryan falls forward and converts, keeping the drive alive. Good possession for Atlanta, they’re on nine plays so far. Falcons 13-10 Rams, 10:50 3rd quarter Atlanta, perhaps because is Broackers out, are starting to punish on the ground. Freeman, 10 yards, then again for four. The Falcons are moving and it’s 3rd &amp; 1 on the Rams 21. Falcons 13-10 Rams, 12:22 3rd quarter On 3rd &amp; 9, Coleman has a screen pass from Ryan, then Alec Ogletree has an opportunity to shut down the play and misses the tackle! Coleman streaks ahead for a first down, and the Falcons drive is alive as they operate from their own 41. Brockers meanwhile, is out of this game, and that’s a substantial loss. The Falcons have the ball and start from their 17. Some quick numbers: Ryan, 11/16 for 86 yards, Goff 10/19 127 TD. Freeman, 10 carries for 42 yards, Gurley, eight carries for 45. Woods, five catches for 80, Jones, four catches for 44. Rams, two turnovers, or they might be up in this game! Email Travis Giblin writes: “Hey David, It looks like you’re in some serious need for companytonight. Well, I’m here for you. Should we discuss our favourite Christmas present? Mine was a cigar from my mother in law. Best Simpsons episode? Clearly it’s Homer the Great, also known as The Stonecutters. But we should probably discuss the feebleness of the Chiefs, shouldn’t we?...” Oh Andy Reid. He deserves his own Simpsons episode, doesn’t he? In case you missed it... That’s Marcus Mariota throwing a block that helped his Titans ice their comeback victory over the Chiefs. Not bad. That’ll do it for a half that actually became interesting as the Rams found their feet, held onto the ball and rediscovered their offense. That means we should have something to talk about when we resume, and that’s a good thing. Stick with us. So the kicker Ficken, who was apparently working at a brokerage firm a few weeks ago, at least according to NBC TV in the US, and I have no reason to not believe them, kicks the chip shot and the Rams are within three. Falcons 13-7 Rams, 0:14 2nd quarter So the pass to Gurley is ruled incomplete, which is actually good for LA. It pushes them to the seven but there’s 14 seconds on the clock now instead of five. I know, I know. So Goff rolls out and fires incomplete, but there’s offensive holding on the play. So now the Rams are probably going to kick a field goal and call it a half. The play stands - it’s seven consecutive completions for the Rams QB, this one to Woods was for 38 yards. LA are operating from the Falcons seven. Now Goff finds Gurley for a short gain but time is ticking. They stop the clock - there’s an offsides penalty on the defense. But wait...was the Gurley catch actually a catch? Now they’re reviewing that play. This is really happening. Oh boy. The NFL. Oh man. There are five seconds left and if the play stands, the Rams are on the two. Goff looks downfield, way downfield and links up with Woods - it’s a tremendous diving catch by the receiver....but was it a catch? To me it looks clean but who knows these days. Falcons 13-7 Rams, 0:43 2nd quarter Goff is looking for the tight end Everett, incomplete - he wants a flag and he gets it! That puts the Rams on their 45 but they have no timeouts! Falcons 13-7 Rams, 0:48 2nd quarter Offensive holding on the punt backs up the Rams to their 14. Meanwhile Ryan has a cut on the back of his head - a thigh pad to the back of his helmet. He’s being evaluated and we will watch that very closely. Back on the field: Goff has the Rams on their 31. Falcons 13-7 Rams, 1:15 2nd quarter Freeman is hit hard by linebacker Mark Barron on a four-yard gain, but then the Falcons go backwards. Ryan slips on the turf: an ugly, awkward fall that could have ended much worse for Atlanta after taking a hit by Fox. 3rd &amp; 16 and Ryan is on the run again - Fox, playing in place of Brockers has the second sack on this drive and that’s a huge shut down possession for the Rams defense. And this is what we call a momentum swing. We’re at the two minute warning. It’s 1st &amp; 10 at Atlanta’s 23 for the Falcons. Brockers The defensive tackle hurt his knee, which is better than his head for sure. But NBC TV here in the US say he’s got an ice pack on it, and his teammates are patting him on the back, which could mean anything. If he doesn’t return, that smarts for LA’s defense. Goff finds Kupp streaking to the corner of the endzone, has Goff’s offering and the Rams are on the board! The Rams finally have some fluidity on offense: seven plays, 79 yards in 3:05 if you’re keeping score at home. Game on. Falcons 13-0 Rams, 2:56 2nd quarter Brown powers ahead on second down, it’s for around three yards, and it sets up a huge 3rd &amp; 5. Falcons 13-0 Rams, 3:36 2nd quarter Goff, steps back, makes coffee, reads the paper, watches a film and then finds Kupp over the middle for 15 down to the 19 of Atlanta. Here come the Rams! Falcons 13-0 Rams, 4:36 2nd quarter Gurley is away, he springs free down the near sideline! It’s a 26-yard gain, by fair his biggest of the night. And there’s gravy for LA: a personal foul by Kazee! All in it is a 41-yard haul and it puts LA on Atlanta 34! Falcons 13-0 Rams, 5:39 2nd quarter Ryan, from the shotgun, under pressure, in trouble, and on the turf! Donald is involved, so is Brockers. LA holds. Brockers is shaken up on the play - it looked like a head collision between two defenders. He walks off on his own power. Bosher kicks, Cooper has it, buys some time, but can’t find the space to breakout and is down at the 21. Here comes Goff looking to make a bit of headway for the uncharacteristically offensively challenged Rams. Falcons 13-0 Rams, 6:35 2nd quarter Sanu has a quick reception on the near side for a first down as Atlanta’s offense continues to seek out that high gear we saw so much of last season. A two yard run by Coleman. A catch over the middle by Cooper, and it’s 3rd &amp; 3 from Atlanta’s 31. Falcons 13-0 Rams, 8:34 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 10 Gurely is stuffed once more...and then on third down, Goff, from the shotgun, is blitzed by Campbell, who makes soup out of the Rams QB. Goff is forced to rush his incomplete pass and LA’s drive stalls. Atlanta will start from their 13 after a fair catch call by McQuaide. Falcons 13-0 Rams, 9:10 2nd quarter It’s 3rd &amp; 12. Goff is back, fires, and has Woods again! This time it’s for 15 yards and another Rams first down! They’re across midfield, somehow. Falcons 13-0 Rams, 9:41 2nd quarter Gurley, right up the middle with feeling, is quickly wrapped up for no gain. Goff, in the shotgun has daylight! Robert Woods - a 17-yard reception on the far side, and that’s at least a little life for LA. And then Gurley slips in the backfield for a loss of three. And then Gurley drops a screen pass. Oh boy. Freeman is pushing hard, along with his center, Alex Mack who helps him seal the deal and find the endzone! So that fumble means Atlanta have 10 points directly attributed to Pharoh Cooper, who has been a plague for LA thus far. I’m here all night. Really. Considering Goff is 1/5 for three yards, 13-0 feels like a lot more. Falcons 6-0 Rams, 11:40 2nd quarter The Rams want to talk it over, calling for time after LA’s head coach Sean McVay streaked down the sideline, rather aggressively to make sure everyone knew what he wanted. Falcons 6-0 Rams, 11:59 2nd quarter On second down, Coleman has a screen pass and runs for six yards setting up a 3rd &amp; 4. Now Ryan has the tight end Hooper over the middle for a first down! It’s 1st &amp; goal at the Rams seven yard line. Falcons 6-0 Rams, 13:51 2nd quarter Ryan, quick pump, throw and completion to Sanu on the near side for a big first down! Falcons approaching the red zone here. Falcons 6-0 Rams, end of 1st quarter Freemen ends the quarter with a power run to his left for seven yards, setting up a third and short for Atlanta when we return. A little gut check time here for LA. Cooper loses the ball on the kickoff return and now has his hands in two Rams turnovers! Kazee popped the pill away from the pro-bowler and now Atlanta will start from LA’s 32! Bryant’s kick is good. The Falcons go 57 yards in nine plays over 4:12 to tack on another three points. Falcons 3-0 Rams, 1:29 1st quarter It’s 3rd &amp; 6 - Ryan momentarily buys some time with a step to his right before firing incomplete. It’ll be a 51-yard field goal attempt from Bryant. Falcons 3-0 Rams, 1:39 1st quarter Jones has it again, this time on an end around for 13 yards - a little razzle dazzle from Atlanta here who have opened it up on this drive. Now they’re at LA’s 33-yard line! Falcons 3-0 Rams, 2:53 1st quarter Freeman jiggles and wiggles, mostly straight ahead for four yards. Ryan hands off to Freeman again, ahead again, this time for three yards. It’s 3rd &amp; 3. Some life from the LA crowd. Ryan is in traffic, he jumps as he throws and threads the needle to Sanu who has it in the middle of the field for six yards and a first down. Now there’s more! Julio Jones out on the near sideline, open, has a 27-yard gain! Falcons 3-0 Rams, 5:41 1st quarter It’s 3rd &amp; 7, Goff has time, hangs in the pocket, looks for Kupp who is running a little post route over the middle and...fires incomplete. LA have to kick it away, again, and they do to, all the way down to the Atlanta 10 where McQuaide is calling for a fair catch. Ho hum. Anybody got any recipes? Falcons 3-0 Rams, 5:47 1st quarter A low block, personal foul by Kazee pushes the Rams up to their 32 to start their possession. Then a neutral zone penalty on first down makes it first and five, before, low-and-behold, Gurley fires up the middle for vive yards and a FIRST DOWN! Holy smokes! Matt Bryant, who must be 340 years old, is true on the 29-yard chip shot and the Rams turnover translates into three points, which tonight, feels like 73. Falcons 0-0 Rams, 7:22 1st quarter A short run by Coleman and an incomplete pass before Ryan is tackled after more Rams pressure on third down. No first down, again, but here comes the field goal unit. Atlanta have it! LaRoy Reynolds made the recovery and now that it’s finally official, after a very very long and totally unnecessary review, the Falcons start from LA’s 17-yard line! Will we see a first down? The punt looks to have hit the foot of Blake Countess, and the Falcons have pounced on the pill after the ensuing mayhem. If the review holds up the Falcons will have great field possession in what would be a huge early break for Atlanta! Stand by. Falcons 0-0 Rams, 8:56 1st quarter Devonta Freeman is going backwards, a loss of three. Then Ryan can’t find anyone open and runs back to the line of scrimmage. Third down, and Ryan is fighting for space in the pocket - he steps up and finds Freeman, who is hit immediately and crushed, ending another drive without a first down! Here comes the kicking unit. Falcons 0-0 Rams, 10:55 1st quarter Todd Gurley bursts outside, streaking towards the far sideline and streaking for seven yards to start the Rams out here. Then a play-action and Goff is looking for Cooper Kuff over the middle: it’s incomplete. Then on 3rd &amp; 2, Takk McKinley has LA’s QB in his grasp and throws him to the turf - it’s a five-yard sack for Atlanta! We’re first-down-less thus far, but I have hope! Atlanta start on their 10 after the punt. Falcons 0-0 Rams, 12:26 1st quarter All eyes on Aaron Donald, interior lineman who is heading to a fourth consecutive pro-bowl. Ryan can only find Julio Jones for a six-yard gain on third down, and the Falcons also have themselves a rough first possession, three and out. Matt Bosher kicks it away and LA will begin on their 46. Falcons 0-0 Rams, 13:16 1st quarter Todd Gurley pushes up the middle for four yards before Goff misfires to his running back on a play-action screen pass gone wrong. It’s 3rd &amp; 6. Blitz coming, Goff steps up, runs to his left and stumbles after losing a yard - a dud of a first possession for LA. The good news? Johnny Hekker’s punt pins down Atlanta who begin on their six-yard line. And away we go - a touchback gets us going as LA begin form their own 25-yard line. LA back in the NFL playoffs fold They must be pumped up out there in La La Land, getting set for their first post-season match-up since inside Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since 1994. Except that you could reportedly get tickets for below face value today, and as of yesterday, there were over 3000 tickets were available for about $78 a head. Now that’s a town starving for NFL football. That lack of enthusiasm however shouldn’t detract from what is truly a great NFL story - an afterthought of a team that flipped a 4-12 record a season ago into 11 wins and the franchises first postseason visit since 2004. Their face is Jared Goff, a big time draft bust of an NFL quarterback, until he wasn’t, until he emerged from a bag of well seasoned marinade and broght a rich winning flavor to LA, throwing 28 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. They are young, hungry, and seemingly going a different direction to the Falcons, sufferers of a sensational Super Bowl stumble at the hands of the Patriots a season ago. They haven’t been quite right since, and at the moment, are quite a contrast to their competition. Those are some telling numbers, which will mean zero if the Rams shrink in the spotlight as Atlanta recapture their lost magic in the coming hours. We’re about to find out together. The Olympic flame has been lit at the old yard, and we’re about to kickoff. Earlier Wow: Andy Reid has done it again! Or he hasn’t done it again, as in advancing his team in the NFL playoffs. In spectacular fashion, the Chiefs melted down inside their freezing Arrowhead Stadium, where some 76,000 of their fans watched their men blow a 21-3 lead to the Titans. Travis Kelce caught a touchdown pass from Alex Smith as the first half wound down, a play that brought them six points but cost them their ace tight end, lost for the game with a concussion. From there, the unraveling that led KC to their fifth consecutive home playoff defeat came to fruition with help from Marcus Mariota, who threw two TD passes, sandwiched by a 35-yard touchdown run by Derrick Henry. Mariota, asked by ESPN TV after the game, what changed at halftime in the locker room, the QB replied: nothing, that’s what’s so impressive about this team. And perhaps that’s right because they’ve ripped away what looked like a sure thing from the Chiefs. Now the Titans will travel to face the “united” Patriots, providing the Jaguars beat the Bills. Otherwise they’ll get the Steelers in Pittsburgh. So that’s a thriller to start us off on Wild Card Saturday, what will LA and Atlanta have for us? Kickoff is approaching. Welcome to our coverage of the Atlanta Falcons’ visit to the historic environs of Los Angeles Coliseum, home of the upstart Rams. If you love football, this is the crown jewel of your NFL season: eight high stakes playoff encounters in two weeks as we whittle through the remaining 12-pack of contenders. The goal? A trip to the cozy US Bank Stadium in frigid Minneapolis and Super Bowl LII, which my handy Roman numeral translator says will be the 52nd edition of the big game. Here’s another goal for these next few weeks: for the NFL to somehow start to salvage the spectacular disaster that has been their 2017-18 season. A sizzling series of post-season games won’t make people forget the mess: the next level of CTE controversies, to kneel or not to kneel, a pile on by the president, the commissioners would-be private jet for life, Papa John, and ratings that dropped to the lowest levels since 2008, just to name a few of the issues. But it could help. A solid playoffs and a feel good sendoff to the NFL’s annus horribilis, and maybe, just maybe, the league will start to feel a little bit like Jimmy Garoppolo’s San Francisco 49ers, whose sinking season flipped dramatically in its final weeks. What happens over the next 30 days could indeed help set the tone for a league in bad need of a bounce-back. Up second - and we’ll have more on what came first during this wild card weekend in a moment - are the Falcons and Rams who will kick off shortly. Until then feel free to make any and all predictions about this game, and really about anything you like. Tweet it out to @lengeldavid or email email me to your hearts content. Until then, please stand by. David will be here shortly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/07/sir-david-attenborough-creature-features-blue-planet-television-jungle-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T06:59:03Z","webTitle":"Attenborough’s creature features still dominate the television jungle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/07/sir-david-attenborough-creature-features-blue-planet-television-jungle-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/07/sir-david-attenborough-creature-features-blue-planet-television-jungle-bbc","fields":{"headline":"Attenborough’s creature features still dominate the television jungle","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Sir David Attenborough spoke about retirement for the first time last week, sparking dread amongst his many fans, and no doubt the BBC. The 91-year-old said that he would stop broadcasting if he felt that his work had become substandard (or if he could no longer walk up and down stairs). The success of Blue Planet 2 demonstrated why the BBC must be fearing the moment Attenborough stops work. Blue Planet 2 was the most-watched programme of 2017 in the UK; it has been sold to more than 30 countries and lauded by critics. The work of the camera crew who delivered the defining images of the series was extraordinary and the show was well produced – but Attenborough added stardust, gravitas and a warm familiarity to the natural history documentary. Thankfully, more Attenborough-helmed shows are on the way in 2018 – including Attenborough and the Sea Dragon this weekend. They are almost certain to attract huge audiences again for the BBC, demonstrating that Attenborough, even after more than 65 years with the corporation, could still be its most important broadcaster. There’s more where the Mash-up came from The pressure on British broadcasters to invest more time, energy and cash into original children’s programmes was cranked up again between Christmas and New Year with the launch of a £60m government fund to finance new content. This fund is the latest stage in efforts by the government and Ofcom to improve the genre; Ofcom has already launched a review of kids’ TV. A generation of young people in Britain are growing up on a diet of Netflix, Amazon and YouTube rather than domestic programmes. Expect the BBC, ITV, C4 and C5 to do more in 2018: the return of Saturday children’s shows to main BBC channels – through Saturday Mash-Up! on BBC2 – is just the start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/07/christians-holy-land-jerusalem-settlers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Christians are at risk of being driven out of the Holy Land | Patriarch Theophilos III","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/christians-holy-land-jerusalem-settlers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/christians-holy-land-jerusalem-settlers","fields":{"headline":"Christians are at risk of being driven out of the Holy Land","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Today, 7 January, is Christmas, according to the Orthodox Christian calendar. And Orthodox Christians are keeping the feast in the Holy Land, where Christmas – and Christianity – began. Much attention has been paid recently to political decisions recognising Jerusalem in one light or another. The media attention highlights the seemingly intractable political struggle here. But as well as the threat to the political status quo, there is a threat also to the religious status quo, a threat instigated by radical settlers in and around Jerusalem, the heart of Christianity. And one group that has always been a pillar of society in the Holy Land – Christians – seems to have been rendered invisible in this standoff. Christians have lived a history in the Holy Land that spans more than two millennia. We have survived countless invasions, and have flourished under many different forms of government. We know that our survival has depended on the principle that the holy places must be shared by and be accessible to all. For it is the holy places that have given meaning to the region for both inhabitants and conquerors of all faiths. The protection and accessibility of the holy places are understood through a set of rules called the “status quo”, which has been followed by all religious and governmental authorities of the region through the ages. When the successor of the prophet Muhammad, Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab, invaded Jerusalem in 637, he was greeted by Patriarch Sophronios, the then ethno-religious leader of Jerusalem. Together they signed a covenant that paved the way for an era of peace. This covenant was based on an understanding of shared custodianship of the holy places. Now various sides want to claim the Holy Land, including Jerusalem, as the exclusive possession of only one people. This treats with contempt the mechanism that has maintained peace and our multi-religious landscape for generations. Jerusalem is a sacred gift, hallowed ground, for the entire world. Attempts to possess the holy city, or to define it in terms of exclusivity, will betray its true nature. Recently Christian communities from the Holy Land came to the UK to seek support for our plight in the face of legal and land threats to the Christian church in the Holy Land. We were moved that church leaders from across the UK came to our support. In meetings with Prince Charles and government ministers, as well as with church leaders, we highlighted a proposed “church lands” bill signed by 40 members of Israel’s Knesset that would restrict the rights of churches to deal independently with their own land. We also discussed threats to church land around the Jaffa gate of the Old City of Jerusalem. The UK’s Catholic Cardinal Vincent Nichols summed up the view of many when he told us that the proposed bill represented “an intolerable infringement of the status quo and the legitimate rights of the churches, and should be recognised for what it is: an attack on the property rights of the Christian community”. In addition to the church lands bill, one of the foremost threats to Christians in the Holy Land is the unacceptable activities of radical settler groups, which are attempting to establish control over properties around the Jaffa gate. The properties in question are in the heart of Jerusalem’s Christian quarter, the seat of all the patriarchates and headquarters of the churches, and less than 500m from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The Patriarchate has lodged an appeal with the Israeli high court of justice, but if our efforts prove unsuccessful the result would be immensely damaging to the integrity of the Old City. If the settler groups were to gain control of the properties, they would be able to pursue their aggressive campaign of removing non-Jews from the City and from these strategic centres at the heart of the Christian quarter, threatening the very presence of Christians in the Holy Land. The Christian understanding of holy places is that all people have claims to the sanctity of their holy places, because holiness is a divine characteristic, not a human one. No party should ever be able to make an exclusive claim over a holy place – in this case, over the holy city of Jerusalem. We shall continue the fight for this cause because it is right and because it is our basic pastoral duty. • Theophilos III is the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/07/xi-jinping-eradicate-rural-poverty-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T00:05:07Z","webTitle":"From shacks to des res: one village’s great leap in China’s march to the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/07/xi-jinping-eradicate-rural-poverty-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/07/xi-jinping-eradicate-rural-poverty-china","fields":{"headline":"From shacks to des res: one village’s great leap in China’s march to the future","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Xiao Ercha lives in a tumbledown shanty beside a pigsty, thousands of miles and a world away from the awe-inspiring skyscrapers of Beijing and Shanghai. Tatty mosquito nets hang from the bamboo poles propping up the shack’s cracked asbestos roof; kittens and chickens scuttle across its earthen floor. Xiao, 57, shakes his head when asked to name the leader of his nation, the second largest economy on earth. “Xi Jinping who?” says Xiao. “I recognise his face from the television – but I don’t know his name.” That is about to change. Xiao, who was born and raised in this mountaintop hamlet near China’s southwestern borders with Myanmar and Laos, is one of millions of impoverished Chinese citizens being relocated as part of the government’s ambitious and politically-charged push to eradicate extreme poverty in the world’s most populous nation. Within the next three years Xi’s anti-poverty crusade – which the Communist party leader has declared one of the key themes of his second five-year term – will see millions of marginalised rural dwellers resettled in new, government-subsidised homes. Some are being moved to distant urban housing estates, others just to slightly less remote or unforgiving rural locations. Other tactics – including loans, promoting tourism and pairing impoverished families with local officials whose careers are tied to their plight – are also being used. By 2020, Beijing hopes to have helped 30 million people rise above its official poverty line of about 70p a day while simultaneously reinforcing the already considerable authority of Xi, now recognised by the Communist party as China’s most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong. China’s breathtaking economic ascent has helped hundreds of millions lift themselves from poverty since the 1980s but by the end of 2015 at least 5.7% of its rural population still lived in poverty, according to a recent UN report, with that number rising to as much as 10% in some western regions and 12% among some ethnic minorities. A recent propaganda profile of Xi by the official Xinhua news agency claimed hitting the 2020 target would represent “a step against poverty unprecedented in human history”. In his annual New Year address to the nation on 31 December, Xi made a “solemn commitment” to win his war on want. “Once made, a promise is as weighty as a thousand ounces of gold,” he said. The current wave of anti-poverty relocations – 9.81 million people to have been moved between 2016 and 2020 – is taking place across virtually the whole country, in 22 provinces. However, China’s western fringes, which still lag behind the prosperous east coast, are a focus. Last year Guizhou, one of China’s most deprived provinces, was aiming to move about 750,000 people from around 3,600 rural locations. More than 1 million people were set to be moved in Gansu, Sichuan and Guangxi, while Yunnan province hoped to move about 677,000 people to nearly 2,800 new villages. One such community is Padangshang, an isolated hilltop hamlet in Yunnan’s Xishuangbanna prefecture. Provincial officials describe Xishuangbanna, a tropical land of rolling, mist-shrouded hills and jaw-dropping amber sunsets, as one of four key anti-poverty battlefields. Padangshang’s 143 residents – tea, nut and coffee farmers from the Hani ethnic minority – began moving to their new, bright-pink homes in early November after abandoning a nearby hilltop where access to water was difficult. “We used to have to carry water up from the bottom of the hill … Now we’ve got running water at home,” enthused the community’s Communist party chief, Liu Hengde, interviewed in the lounge of his new home, which he had furnished with an L-shaped sofa and flat-screen TV. “The government is helping the ordinary folk to lead a good life,” Liu, 30, added, before fastening a machete to the back of his navy blue uniform and offering a tour of the newly-built village to which 13 families had already moved. “Xi Jinping always says that if we give the ordinary folk a better life, the whole country will be well off.” Relocated villagers gave Xi’s war on poverty – and their new two-storey homes – their backing. “When I was a boy I lived in a thick forest. There were insects and leeches, everywhere. Transport was bad. The water supply was bad. The power supply was bad,” said Li Ade, a 30-year-old farmer. “These days the Burmese [over the border in Myanmar] are living in the Mao era while the lives of Chinese people have improved.” Mark Wang, a University of Melbourne professor who studies Beijing’s use of resettlements to fight poverty, attributes Xi’s focus on the issue partly to the seven years he spent in the countryside during Mao’s Cultural Revolution. Xi was born into China’s “red aristocracy” – the son of the revolutionary elder Xi Zhongxun – but was exiled to the parched village of Liangjiahe in the 1960s after his father strayed to the wrong side of Mao. Wang claims those years of rural hardship continued to shape Xi’s political priorities: “From the bottom of his heart he knows the Chinese farmers … He understands what they want ... He even knows the dirty language the people use in the fields when they are farming.” But hard-nosed political calculations also explained Xi’s attempt to paint himself as a champion of the poor – an effort undermined by a recent crackdown on migrants in Beijing which has reportedly seen tens of thousands of poor workers forced from the capital. “How can you make sure a billion people trust you, and say: ‘This is our strong leader’?” says Wang. “This is something that will really make people say: ‘Oh, this is something new! At last somebody finally wants to fix this problem’.” The political function of resettlement is unmissable in Padangshang, where posters of Xi visiting another of Yunnan’s ethnic minorities are plastered on virtually every new home. “The government gave it to me. Every family got one,” said Xiao Ziluo,a 50-year-old builder, as he showed off his new home, which bore the slogan: “Build a Chinese dream with one heart.” Experts question Beijing’s definition of poverty – the World Bank defines it as someone who lives on less than $1.90 (£1.40) a day – and whether permanently vanquishing poverty is a realistic goal in such a short period. Others believe more emphasis should be placed on fighting urban deprivation. Wang said he doubted Beijing would manage to completely defeat poverty in so short a time. But given Xi’s daunting political stature, his decision to make the campaign a top political priority – and to make Communist party cadres individually responsible for the plight of poor families in their areas – would have bureaucrats across the country scrambling to succeed. “Every day local officials are thinking: ‘2020 is coming! Oh my God!’” says Wang. The resettlements are the latest chapter in a decades-old Chinese tradition of moving people. Countless millions have been asked – or ordered – to make way for major nation-building infrastructure projects such as the Three Gorges Dam, which displaced about 1.5 million, and the South-North water diversion, which dislodged at least 345,000. Development-related relocations have proved highly controversial, with villagers often forced out with little, if any, help or compensation. Wang said poverty-related relocations, while not uncomplicated, were generally “the most friendly”, as those moved away were mostly allowed to hang on to their old homes and farmlands for a period of time. “[With] all other resettlements they [the government] need something from you: ‘I need your land. I need you to move so I can build a reservoir. I need to convert your land into an industrial or urban [zone].’ For poverty alleviation resettlement, the government doesn’t want anything.” That may be overly generous. Xiao Ercha, however, is thrilled with his new concrete-floored home, even if, lacking the funds to furnish it, he has yet to move in. “It’s good, good, good!” beamed the farmer, who estimated his annual income at about 1,935 yuan (£220), as he guided the Observer up to the second-floor balcony of his recently completed abode, which boasts spectacular views over the surrounding countryside. “I’ve never seen a house like this before.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/blog/2018/jan/05/the-theatre-company-putting-victorian-sci-fi-centre-stage-hg-wells-crystal-egg-live","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T19:04:07Z","webTitle":"The theatre company putting Victorian sci-fi centre stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/jan/05/the-theatre-company-putting-victorian-sci-fi-centre-stage-hg-wells-crystal-egg-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/blog/2018/jan/05/the-theatre-company-putting-victorian-sci-fi-centre-stage-hg-wells-crystal-egg-live","fields":{"headline":"The theatre company putting Victorian sci-fi centre stage","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"HG Wells hold a special place in the hearts of many sci-fi enthusiasts and scientists alike. Best known for his novels The War of the Worlds, The Island of Doctor Moreau, and The Invisible Man, Wells’s work is renowned for its prescience and has been revisited and adapted many times, so modern do some of his fears and preoccupations seem. The Crystal Egg is a short story written 1897. Set in a grimily familiar depiction of Victorian London, it is a disturbing piece combining an almost Dickensian family-run curiosity shop, a pleasing account of scientific method and altogether more eerie references to portals into other worlds and alien beings. As we look towards missions to Mars and search the skies for signs of life, Wells’s preoccupation with the red planet and contact, benign or otherwise, with alien intelligence seems very much to speak to our time. It seems fitting, therefore, that one London theatre company have decided to start the new year with an immersive theatre adaptation of Wells’s short story, The Crystal Egg Live. I asked the show’s producer, Mike Archer, and director, Elif Knight to talk me through their interest in Wells, the challenges of adaptation and how Victorian sci-fi sits alongside more contemporary fiction, film and television. What drew you to HG Wells in general and this story in particular? Mike Archer: I have been a fan of Wells’s work since I was a boy. I encountered The Crystal Egg in 2005 and was drawn to the idea of it extending the mythos of the invasion from Mars in The War of the Worlds. Recently, I started to feel the story had something to say about things that are happening in the world right now. When we went back to the story, myself and my partner Luisa Guerreiro thought about how we could use The Crystal Egg as an inspiration, and wanted to adapt it into an invasion story for the now. Elif Knight: I was aware of HG Wells as a very prescient writer of science fiction. The fact that he had predicted many of the inventions and developments of the 20th century – not least manned flight and the internet – demonstrated that his imagination was not just wide-ranging but also accurate. But the question arose: how to show what an extraordinary piece of work The Crystal Egg is? And when the producers offered me the Vaults as a location, I had my answer – to recreate for the audience the atmosphere of the late nineteenth century, so that they could get a sense of how astonishing Wells’s vision was at that time. Wells articulates many fears about science and the future of civilization in his works. What does this piece say about his time or ours? MA: I think the message that the story conveys has changed as our social attitudes have changed. Wells wrote The Crystal Egg at the height of the Victorian interest in the possibility of intelligent life on Mars, and this is what gives the story its scientific viewpoint. The alien world Wells portrays is credible and feels real, because he was able to logically specualte on the way life might develop on another world. It was a more optimistic outlook than he portrayed in The War of the Worlds so I feel he was portraying a wondrous and pleasing vision of the society he saw. By the time of the 1950s television adaptation, the ideas had changed to something menacing. The effects of the cold war and fear of things like nuclear power, imbues the story with something more menacing. The view point had shifted from “what are they watching?” to “why are they watching?” So when it came to constructing a narrative for our adaptation, we couldn’t ignore the fact that a lot of invasion today is undertaken in a more covert manner. Just look at what is happening in the US with the Russia investigation. EK: In a time where there was a good deal of credulity about unseen worlds, ghosts and other spirits, HG Wells was able to tap into people’s fears. He imagined an access route to Mars through a lump of crystal – in a way he preconceived the worm-hole theory of the universe where one can move from one time and place in the universe through portals in the space-time continuum. Technology is constantly changing, and whether it’s AI or augmented reality, it’s changing our everyday lives in a way many see as threatening, because we, the foot-soldiers of life, have no control. The play also taps into our paranoia about being watched by another entity; surveillance is a key theme and it creates the same feelings of uncertainty we experience today. Were there any particular challenges in staging the story? MA: Yes, several. The biggest for me, was how to honour the source material whilst making it engaging on a relatable level and feeling somewhat fresh. The book is very scientific in its vision, but that scientific vision alone doesn’t necessarily translate to a two hour show. I like sci-fi to feel real. For me the best kind is when you have a world that is recognisable and believable and sci-fi just so happens to be a part of it. I think that is where the semi-immersive nature of part of the show came from. Bringing the audience, themselves aliens in a foreign world, face-to-face with the creation of Wells. This means you have to have a believable world in which to play. We did a lot of research into the Seven Dials area, the context of the story’s creation and began to extrapolate it out. EK: That was a challenge : to re-create the slums of Victorian London in the Vaults. For example, with a small cast we had to create a busy market day in the London of 1897. But that is where things get interesting; that’s where I have used other media and interesting sonic and filmic devices to bring the area to life. Which sci-fibook, film or series has most influenced/impressed you and why? MA: Honestly, it would have to be The War of the Worlds. It had such a huge impact on my imagination as a child and, even now, I still read it with the same feeling of excitement and fear. I watched the Spielberg movie, and the thing that struck me was the utterly fearsome vision of a three-legged machine laying waste to humanity – it is such a striking vision. But I think a lot of sci-fi films in the 70’s and 80’s were genre-defining in their own right. I wanted to live in Blade Runner’s vision of LA, because it always felt so visceral and interesting – growing up within sight of the very vision that inspired the movie’s opening probably helped – but it brought a more grounded reality. They were exciting and they broke new ground. EF: Shows like Quantum Leap, Red Dwarf and The X-Files was very much part of my childhood. But I would say Twin Peaks, which mixes several genres including sci-fi, has influenced and impressed me the most. I love the way David Lynch creates worlds within worlds.

At best, you will struggle to find time to practise, lack a support network and never really be able to experience the total immersion required to become fluent. Your woes may be compounded by a paper published in the journal Cognition, which suggests that those who start learning a language after the age of 10 are doomed to never achieve fluency – and that even basic learning abilities fade by 17 or 18. But, peer-reviewed journals be damned, I’m determined to prove the doubters wrong. And so, every morning for a little more than eight months, I have done the same thing: opened the Duolingo app and spent 40 minutes learning French and Japanese. The service, which asks you to finish 10 minutes of simple sentence construction and vocabulary-learning exercises each lesson, has become a fixture in my life. The basic principle of Duolingo is that language learning is best achieved by doing a little bit of work, frequently, and over a long period of time. Rather than having an hour-long lesson once or twice a week, it is far better to spend 10 or 20 minutes a day, sometimes learning something new, sometimes revising something old, and slowly but surely improving your abilities. At the heart of it all is the concept of the streak: logging on and fulfilling your stated goal of 10, 20, 30 or 50 minutes of lessons a day. Each day you meet your goal, you’re rewarded with a happy chime; if you don’t, your streak is over and you start again at zero. If, like me, you are a creature of habit, the app can feel like the best route to self-improvement you will ever find. By 6.30am every day, I’m sitting at my kitchen table with coffee and breakfast. I spend 20 minutes doing two French courses, 20 minutes doing two Japanese courses, and then I leave for work. A lot of the techniques the app uses are reminiscent of the sneaky methods that free-to-play games and social networking services use to keep users hooked. Encouraging you to return every day turns an idle experiment into a regular habit; push notifications keep you engaged with the game even if your daily grind is broken; a basic system of counters and rewards provides short- and long-term goals, helping you feel you’re progressing with every lesson. Duolingo was founded in 2011 by Luis von Ahn (who invented reCaptcha, a service, bought by Google, that transcribes library books while checking that website visitors are really human), and has raised more than $100m in venture capital funding since then. It makes money from users by selling advertising and some paid features (offline use, unlimited daily lessons, streak freezes), and it also has more academic-focused services, including a $49 remote English-language certification that universities can use instead of more expensive in-person testing. But how much of the language do you actually learn? According to the app, I have 56 “crowns” in French, and 49 in Japanese. I don’t know what that means, and I’m not certain Duolingo does either. It certainly doesn’t give me the ability to follow along with francophone films. Yet I am noticeably more confident speaking and reading French, and as for Japanese – well, I’ve gone from zero ability to a tiny, yet appreciably higher than zero, ability. The academics are probably right: even with the help of smart new technology, I’ll never be fluent in a foreign language if I started learning in my late 20s. But that’s no reason not to try – fluency is overrated anyway. Why not aim for a simpler goal, such as reading the signs on doors? After all, pushing a door marked “pull” looks stupid in any language."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/10/car-hire-bookings","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T07:00:41Z","webTitle":"Car hire firms’ double whammy strikes at both the young and the old","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/10/car-hire-bookings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/10/car-hire-bookings","fields":{"headline":"Car hire firms’ double whammy strikes at both the young and the old","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Readers were left out of pocket when car hire firms failed to honour their bookings, one because he was old and another because she was young. FH of Sheffield’s 24-year-old daughter lives in Italy and was returning to the UK for Christmas in December 2016 when she booked a hire car with Europcar via Orbitz. The fee was £156. “She noted that the booking terms stated that ‘additional charges/restrictions may apply to drivers under the age of 25’,” FH writes. “She followed the Europcar link on the Orbitz website where it clearly stated that drivers aged 18-23 would be charged surcharge which was not applicable to those aged 24 and over. “When she went to collect the car from Manchester airport the basic hire fee had risen to £336 and she was told she would also have to pay a surcharge of £32.50 a day. “She showed her passport as evidence that she was over the age threshold and the surcharge was removed. “A few days later I noticed that Europcar had applied £487 in surcharges to my credit card which had been used for the booking. “This was subsequently cancelled by Europcar and two additional charges of £586.59 and £210.56 were then applied. When I complained, they insisted the contract was with Expedia (no idea why). Expedia referred me to Orbitz which insisted that the surcharge was applicable. “I registered a dispute with my card issuer under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act and the claims team concluded that the transactions of £586.59 and £210.56 were invalid and should be rejected. “My bank notified Europcar of their decision, giving them 45 days to respond, but they did not. Eight months later I received two letters from a debt recovery company acting for Europcar demanding £586.59 and £210.56 within seven days. “Europcar told me that if I cancelled the section 75 chargeback they would be able to resolve the complaint. I’ve now received a further letter from the debt recovery firm, this time demanding £210.56 but not £586.59.” The most breathtaking aspect of this dismal saga is Europcar’s suggestion that it could resolve your complaint if you cancelled the chargeback made by your bank eight months previously and paid the disputed sum. Six days after I contacted them – and 11 months after you first complained – they acknowledged that the terms and conditions had not been “updated” on the Orbitz website and that your daughter had been misled. It also discovered the booking site had not included mandatory collision damage waiver (CDW) in the cost, which is why the basic hire charge more than doubled. It has now cancelled the surcharges and refunded the CDW as compensation. It is also removing her from its sinisterly named “watchlist” on which indebted customers are blacklisted just in case she should ever want to do business with Europcar again. Orbitz, which has merged with Expedia, hence that red herring, admits to the Observer that the surcharge details were incorrect on its post-booking webpage and says they have now been amended. JM of Sheffield had the opposite problem. The 76-year-old had to make an emergency trip to Northern Ireland with three elderly relatives when his brother-in-law became critically ill. He booked a car with Avis for collection at Belfast airport. “When we arrived I produced my valid driving licence and payment cardas required on the booking confirmation,” he writes. “However, I was told that, as I was over 75, I needed letters from my doctor and my insurance company stating that I was fit to drive. “There was been no mention of this in the booking confirmation or in the 44 pages of rental conditions. “We faced being left stranded 40 miles from our destination in the dark and pouring rain. “Fortunately, another company, Europcar, was prepared to hire us a car, but for £244 compared to the £43 we had paid to Avis.” Buried in the 14-page location specific conditions document is a paragraph stating that drivers who are over 75 should advise Avis of the fact before collection. This vital information is not flagged up on the confirmation summary or on the website. A month after you complained to Avis you were still awaiting a response and a refund. It was only after the Observer intervened that you were contacted with an apology. Avis accepts that the condition should be made clearer and says it is “taking steps to make this information clearer and easier to find”. It has now refunded you the £43 booking fee and agreed to pay the difference between that and the £244 charged by Europcar so that you are not left out of pocket. The lesson here is to plough through the small print, however tedious, for car hire firms have differing policies on all aspects of a rental, including how long they’ll hold a vehicle if you are delayed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/05/blair-milburn-and-adonis-have-important-things-to-say-on-brexit-and-britain-today","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T18:27:17Z","webTitle":"Blair, Milburn and Adonis have important things to say on Brexit and Britain today | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/05/blair-milburn-and-adonis-have-important-things-to-say-on-brexit-and-britain-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/05/blair-milburn-and-adonis-have-important-things-to-say-on-brexit-and-britain-today","fields":{"headline":"Blair, Milburn and Adonis have important things to say on Brexit and Britain today","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Martin Kettle (Blair’s a flawed messenger – who’s still worth listening to, 5 January) is right. We should also heed former Labour ministers who resigned from official commissions last month. Alan Milburn (Opinion, 2 December) argued that “whole communities and parts of Britain are being left behind economically and hollowed out socially”. Andrew Adonis (Report, 30 December) accused the government of “ignoring the crises of housing, education, the NHS and social and regional inequality which are undermining our nation and feeding a populist upsurge”. These inequalities turbo-charged the Brexit vote but will be made seriously worse by Brexit. The Brexit camp guiled voters by claiming that immigration was responsible for low wages and job losses. This fraud must be exposed. The goal of many Brexit leaders is a Singapore-style low-wage, low-benefit, low-regulation economy, dubbed “Empire 2.0”, whose offshore tax havens have been revealed in the Paradise Papers. Even more pain will be inflicted on the “left behind” and “left out”. Labour must campaign to stay in the single market to reboot economic confidence and announce a New Deal. Macron saw off Le Pen by saying he was for “a strong France in a Europe that protects”, not least workers’ rights. Corbyn fears losing the support of Labour Brexiters but he must lead a push-back campaign before it is too late.

Before its foundation stone was laid in a remote spot on the road to Famagusta barely four years ago, there was little else towering over the Mesoria plain that engulfs northern Nicosia. Now, its monumental domes and minarets are by far the biggest in the eastern Mediterranean. For many, the building symbolises Ankara’s tightening grip over the breakaway Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. “So much hangs on this election,” says Esra Aygin, a prominent Turkish Cypriot moderate and member of the bi-communal lobby group, Unite Cyprus Now. “The mosque represents the change in lifestyle and culture that Turkey would like to impose on us. It is very important that the forces of reconciliation do well if [President Mustafa] Akinci’s hand is not to be weakened and further mistrust avoided.” Turkish Cypriots are seen as being among the most liberal Muslims in the western world. Most enjoy alcohol – attributing their penchant for whisky to colonial rule under the British. The majority also abhor the idea of women wearing headscarves and frequently joke they would only go to a mosque to attend a funeral. In such circumstances, Islamisation has been met with trepidation. Like the outcome of the parliamentary election at stake, secular Turkish Cypriots worry that religion – and policies aimed at promoting a resurgence of Islam – could be the next big impediment to reconciling with Greek Cypriots in a united Cyprus. Increasingly, concerns have been voiced that Turkey – which launched an invasion in 1974 to protect the minority in response to an Athens-inspired coup to unite the island with Greece – is now bent on erasing a way of life that is not only cherished but central to their identity. Friction recently boiled over when the Turkish Cypriot daily, Afrika, ran a cartoon from an Athenian newspaper depicting a Greek statue urinating on the head of a grimacing image of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Turkish Cypriot nationalists, including the state’s deputy prime minister, Recep Akdag, denounced its publication as an insult to the “entire Turkish nation”. Sener Elcil, who heads the Turkish Cypriot teachers’ union and is a vocal critic of Ankara’s growing influence over his homeland, has watched the Hala Sultan mosque being built with a mix of fury and anxiety. “We don’t want Sunni Islam imposed on us but they are working systematically to radicalise the system and change the fate and culture of Turkish Cypriots,” he told the Guardian. “All this is alien because culturally, we are very close to the Greek Cypriots.” Under Erdoğan’s watch, Turkey has embarked on a mega mosque-building programme across five continents. When the Hula Sultan mosque in Nicosia opens its doors this year, it will be able to accommodate 3,000 worshippers. Many faithful will be settlers – mainland Turks brought in initially in the 1970s as part of efforts to “Turkify” the north. “It is not only that Turkish Cypriots have become a minority in their own country, they are now trying to replace the secular education system with religious schools,” said Elcil. “Over 400 imams have been sent here as missionaries to target the children of settlers. Instead of English, lessons in Arabic and the Qur’an are being taught. Religion has never been a point of conflict in Cyprus, nationalism, yes, but not this.” Mass rallies have taken place outside the Turkish Cypriot parliament, attended mostly by young people deploring Ankara’s attempt to mould their culture into one more in tune with Islamic norms. Among points of grievance were the attempts by Turkey’s ruling neo-Islamist AKP party to impose single sex swimming pools at universities. “In the past, there were efforts to make us more Turkish because it was felt we weren’t Turkish enough,” lamented Ersa Aygin. “Now we’re not Muslim enough and the answer is more mosques, more religious classes, more Qu’ran courses. The only thing we want, and can’t be, is Cypriot.” Religious leaders brush off the criticism as lefwing dissent. Cyprus’s vice grand mufti, Imam Shakir Alemdar, who is based in the island’s south, says inter-faith dialogue has been so successful it has helped lay the foundation for future hope. “Hala Sultan mosque and all matters of religion in the north has some criticism from leftist groups but they criticise anything and everything when it comes to religion, especially Islam,” he said. “There is not only criticism but also a lot of support.” Sunday’s election comes against a backdrop of mounting frustration with international isolation. Since unilaterally declaring independence 35 years ago, only Turkey has recognised the impoverished territory, bankrolling it annually to stay afloat. When Cyprus became the European Union’s most easterly member state in 2004, Turkish Cypriots were left out in the cold after the island’s majority Greek population rejected reunification in a controversial referendum. Following the collapse of peace talks in Switzerland last July – widely seen as the “best ever” chance of reunification – thousands of Turkish Cypriots have rushed to get EU citizenship by acquiring Republic of Cyprus passports. Others have simply voted with their feet, leaving the isolated republic for wealthier countries elsewhere in Europe. “Unless there is a solution soon, there will be no Turkish Cypriots to have a solution with,” said James Ker-Lindsay, a veteran Cyprus expert. “Northern Cyprus will simply become a Turkish province – a place of mosques and settlers. We are in a race against the clock.” • This article was amended on 7 January 2018 to correct the spelling of Ersa Aygin’s name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/08/open-banking-bank","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"‘Open banking’: radical shake-up, or a threat to your private data?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/08/open-banking-bank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/08/open-banking-bank","fields":{"headline":"‘Open banking’: radical shake-up, or a threat to your private data?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"This week sees the beginning of a quiet revolution in banking which some have championed as one of the greatest shake-ups in personal finance in years, while others have warned it could have serious implications for people’s private data. It’s the start of a new series of rules concerning “open banking”, where customers will be able to share their personal financial information with companies other than their bank, opening up opportunities to get better deals on mortgages, overdrafts and comparing insurance and broadband deals. For eager enthusiasts, it will revolutionise banking, make the system more competitive, and give consumers access to the best products for them. For the more sceptical, among them consumer groups, it could cause problems with the security of previously private data. The new rules, set to come in on current accounts from next Saturday, could result in a substantial opening up of the banking market – where just 3% of people switch accounts, according to research by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMI). But, so far, word of this quiet revolution seems to have eluded the public – a survey from consumer group Which? found that 92% of people had not even heard of open banking. So how will it affect customers? What is it? Financial data about how you spend your money, how often you are overdrawn and other details are currently held by your bank. Under the new rules, the ownership of this data will essentially be transferred to the consumer, meaning that account holders will be able to give companies, other than their own bank, permission to access their details. Underlying this new regulation, which will spread across Europe this month, are EU rules that mean financial institutions must let customers share their data easily and securely. Extra measures are being taken in the UK to push through the changes, with the setting up of standards so data can be shared securely. “The idea of ‘open banking’ is that it opens up data on your banking transactions. You’ll be able to share it with whoever you wish, the idea being that if companies know what you’re spending, they’ll be able to analyse the data and guide you to better deals, or better ways you can use your money,” says Helen Saxon, chief money analyst at MoneySavingExpert.com. Nine UK banks are required to comply with the new rules – Barclays, Lloyds, Santander, Danske, HSBC, RBS, Bank of Ireland, Nationwide and AIBG. Five of these have been given more time to comply. How will it affect consumers? In theory, people will be able to use the services of more banks and approved financial bodies in a much more straightforward manner. This could be opening your banking app and being able to see a list of all of your accounts, no matter the bank you are with – a process called “account aggregation”. It could also mean giving a company that analyses financial details your account data in order to offer budgeting advice, or showing alternative deals on the market – in essence, a comparison system but for financial products. Under “open banking”, users will be able to authorise third parties to access their banking details without having to provide login details, which is the case at the moment in order for apps that manage money to collect data. According to the Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE), the body set up to deliver open banking in the UK, the applications can only use the details for the purpose they have been given. Users decide what information they share and for how long. The process could result in one app or platform running all of your financial accounts. “There are a lot of unknowns. The law changes on 13 January, but that’s just the start. There are already a few apps, like those that aggregate all your financial accounts or scan your current account and work out how much you have spare to save, then save it for you, which will benefit,” explains Saxon. “This is because you’ll no longer be breaking your banks’ terms and conditions by sharing logon details with a third party, so the risk of you having to pay for any fraud resulting from this sharing is removed.” Victor Trokoudes, the chief executive of Plum, a financial assistant app that analyses how people are earning and spending, says that banking products will become commodities or utilities as a result of the changes. “People don’t know what the cost of an overdraft is ... something like 40% of people in the UK have an overdraft but it is completely vague as to what the cost of the overdraft is for these people,” he says. “The overdraft does not have to live within the current account. It could be from another provider and throw money in your bank account when it hits a low limit and, effectively, will replace the overdraft from the bank.” Sounds good? The moves have been welcomed by Which? as a way to bring more competition into the market and encourage switching. “Switching rates are still relatively low and that is because people have not been able to see what is in it for them, personally, and open banking has the potential to do that, to personalise your ability to compare current accounts and say, ‘I’m £1,500 into my overdraft two weeks in the month, I am not getting the best deal, I’ll switch to the bank that does give me the best deal’. Or, ‘I am in credit by £1,000 every month, I am not getting the best deal from my new provider, I will switch to a new provider’,” says Gareth Shaw from Which? Consumers should also be aware they are under no obligation to share their data, adds Saxon. “The most important thing to say, is: ‘This is just a thing you can do.’ No one will force you to share your data with anybody.” The downsides While consumers may feel empowered that their data is now in their own hands to do with as they please, with the potential to save money, it could also lead to unease, particularly when dealing with third parties that have brand names they might not recognise, says Shaw. “One of the things to be mindful of is that consumers could find themselves in a complicated chain of providers. If you authorise one third party to access your money, and if there are potential losses, where does that fall? “I think data regulators and financial regulators need to be really clear with consumers about how that is going to work. In order for consumers to really engage with this, they need to be confident that there are safeguards in place to protect them. There has been good progress on that.” Saxon also points out that consumers should be aware that the information they get from a third party app may not be impartial. “They may find you an energy deal that saves you money, but there’s no guarantee they’ve searched the whole of the energy market to find the cheapest tariff. They may just offer deals from companies who pay them for new business,” she says. A spokesman for the OBIE says third-party companies which use open banking will have to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and registered with them on a directory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/05/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T20:59:23Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/05/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/05/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• A review of Peggy Seeger’s memoir quotes her description of her early impressions of Ewan MacColl and how they fell in love, saying he had a “hairy, fat, naked belly poking out, and was clad in ill-fitting trousers, suspenders, no shirt, a ragged jacket and a filthy lid of stovepipe hat aslant like a garbage can”.

Did you expect the party’s luminaries to drop their collective head into their hands, or to crumple into a heap in despair at the state of the man they anointed as president of the United States? They’d certainly have had good reason. In the book Fire and Fury, which on Thursday received the greatest possible endorsement – namely a “cease and desist” order from Trump’s personal lawyers – the journalist Michael Wolff paints a picture of a man whose own closest aides, friends and even family believe is congenitally unfit to be president. The Trump depicted in the book is ignorant: the adviser who tried to teach him about the constitution could get no further than the fourth amendment before Trump’s eyes glazed over. He doesn’t read, or even skim, barely having the patience to take in a headline. Some allies try to persuade Wolff that attention deficit disorder is part of Trump’s populist genius: he is “post-literate – total television”. He is also loathsome: we read that a favourite sport of Trump’s was tricking friends’ wives to sleep with him. He is weird, especially in the bedroom: having clashed with his secret service bodyguard over his insistence that he be able to lock himself into his quarters (Melania has separate accommodation), he demanded the installation of two extra TV sets, so he could watch three cable news channels at once. He heads back under the covers as early as 6.30pm, munching a cheeseburger as he soaks up hours of Fox and CNN. If there are crumbs, the chambermaid can’t change the sheets: he insists that he strip the bed himself. We learn that Trump believes Saturday Night Live is damaging to the nation and that it is “fake comedy”; that daughter Ivanka wants to be president herself and that privately she mocks her father’s nature-defying combover. And, perhaps most amusingly, we get an answer to the question that has long enraged Trump: the identity of the mystery leaker behind the stream of stories of White House chaos and fratricidal dysfunction that have appeared since he took office. It turns out that the president rants endlessly on the phone to his billionaire friends, who feel no duty of confidentiality. In other words, the leaker Trump seeks is … himself. Given all this material, you’d forgive congressional Republicans for being glum. Alternatively, you’d understand if they tried to denounce the book, perhaps joining those who question Wolff’s methods, believing he too often strays from corroborated facts and cuts journalistic corners. But that has not been the reaction. Instead, the official campaign account for Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, tweeted a gif of McConnell grinning mightily. And that smirk captured the mood of many of his colleagues. What do they have to smile about? They’re pleased because they believe Fire and Fury marks the downfall of Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist to Trump and source of some of the book’s most scathing lines. It was Bannon who told Wolff that Trump had “lost it”, and Bannon who described the meeting Donald Trump Jr had with a Russian lawyer – convened for the express purpose of receiving dirt on Hillary Clinton – as “treasonous”. Trump’s response came in the form of a long and furious statement that loosely translates into New Yorkese as “You’re dead to me” – which delighted establishment Republicans who have long seen Bannon as the enemy within. It would be nice if this loathing were rooted in ideological principle, with Republicans despising Bannon as the apostle of an ultra-nationalist isolationism and xenophobia that could tip the US and the world towards a 1930s-style catastrophe. (Recall that Bannon once promised Wolff the Trump administration would be “as exciting as the 1930s”.) But the truth is that Bannon posed a threat to McConnell and his ilk, vowing to run insurgent, Trump-like candidates against establishment Republicans in primary contests (just as he did, in vain, in Alabama last year). If Bannon is broken, they can sleep more easily. Some go further, believing that, as Bannon dies, so does Bannonism. They speculate that, with the ties to his onetime evil genius severed, Trump might now moderate, becoming a more conventional, focused occupant of the Oval Office. This is delusional, twice over. First, it’s true that things look bad for Bannon now: he has apparently lost the financial backing of the billionaire Mercer family, and it’s possible he stands to lose control of his far-right Breitbart media empire. But he understands Trump and knows that, if you’re ready to grovel and flatter, a rapprochement is always possible. Hence Bannon’s declaration on Thursday that Trump is a “great man”. But the more enduring delusion is that Trump is poised to moderate. Republicans predicted he would change once the primaries of 2016 were under way. Then they said he would change once he’d won the party nomination. Or when the presidential election campaign proper began. Or when he’d won the election. Or once he’d taken the oath of office. They were wrong every time. He won’t change. Trump is Trump. The sheer persistence of this delusion points to another one: the hope that Republicans will finally decide enough is enough and do the right thing by ousting this unfit president. The Wolff book has prompted another flurry of that speculation, focused this time on the 25th amendment of the constitution, which allows for the removal of a president deemed “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. In an article this week, Wolff provides arresting evidence of mental deterioration. He writes that Trump would tell the same three stories, word-for-word, inside 30 minutes, unaware he was repeating himself. “Now it was within 10 minutes.” He adds: “At Mar-a-Lago, just before the new year, a heavily made-up Trump failed to recognise a succession of old friends.” But the 25th amendment requires the agreement of the vice-president, a majority of the cabinet and, ultimately, both houses of Congress. We are, once again, up against the sobering truth of the US constitution: it is only as strong as those willing to enforce it. And, today, that means the Republican party. These latest revelations prove – yet again – what a vile, narcissistic and dangerous man we have in the Oval Office, wielding, among other things, sole, unchecked authority over the world’s mightiest nuclear arsenal. But the reaction to them proves something else too. That he remains in place only thanks to the willing connivance of his Republican enablers. As culpable as he is, they share in his damnation. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2018/jan/08/rhinoceros-dna-database-successful-in-aiding-poaching-prosecutions","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T17:00:16Z","webTitle":"Rhinoceros DNA database successful in aiding poaching prosecutions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/08/rhinoceros-dna-database-successful-in-aiding-poaching-prosecutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jan/08/rhinoceros-dna-database-successful-in-aiding-poaching-prosecutions","fields":{"headline":"Rhinoceros DNA database successful in aiding poaching prosecutions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A large database of rhinoceros DNA is successfully being used to prosecute poachers and those trading rhino horns, new research has revealed. While numbers of the southern white rhino – the only wild subspecies of white rhino in Africa – have grown to about 20,000, fewer than 5,500 black rhinos are thought to exist in the wild, and both species are affected by poaching. The animals’ horns are traded for their use in traditional Asian medicines, and poaching is soaring – in part as a result of rumours that a former politician in Vietnam was “cured of cancer” using a rhino horn remedy. Figures for 2016 suggest that poachers killed more than 1,050 rhinos in South Africa alone. Now researchers working on DNA-based forensic testing have shown just how powerful the technique is in fighting the illegal trade and bringing criminals to justice. “Based on a really solid number of animals, both white and black rhinos, we can get solid match statistics to show ‘that’ horn is definitely from ‘that’ carcass,” said Dr Cindy Harper, a co-author of the study from the University of Pretoria in South Africa. The set-up, known as the Rhinoceros DNA index system or RhODIS, was established in 2010, and currently contains more than 20,000 rhino samples from living animals, stockpiled horns and forensic cases – such as poaching. The authors say the latest study shows just how powerful the database is in linking forensic evidence to particular animals. Published in the journal Current Biology, the researchers describe how they selected samples from 3,085 white rhinos and 883 black rhinos from the database and examined their DNA, comparing the number of times particular patterns are repeated at certain locations in their genomes. “It is similar to human DNA profiling for forensic cases now,” said Harper, pointing out that the team looked at repeated patterns at 23 locations in the genome. The results not only reveal that black rhinos fall, as currently thought, into three subspecies, and wild white rhinos into one, but also sheds light on the genetic variation within different populations. Moreover, the team were able to use the genetic data from the 3,986 rhinos to calculate the probability that a match between a forensic sample and a particular rhino could crop up by chance. So far more than 120 criminal investigations have included genetic evidence, based on the RhODIS system, as part of a court case. Looking at genetic data from nine of the cases, the team found while the probability of a chance match varies for each case, it is about one in several million for white rhinos and is even more remote for black rhinos, due to their higher genetic variability. “In a population of 20,000 [white rhinos], that is a pretty good match that you can be pretty certain of,” said Harper. That, she added, is vital for a prosecution. “That’s what we need to show, because one of the defence’s arguments [in court] could be ‘yeah, but it could have been another rhino that matched,’” she said. One criminal case in which a genetic match led to a prosecution was that of a Kenyan individual who in 2017 was sentenced to 11 years in jail after blood on a carpet was matched to the horn of a black rhinoceros. The team are continuing to work to increase the number of rhinos in the database and analyse the data for all samples currently collected, to improve the statistics even further. And after South Africa lifted its ban on domestic rhino horn trading last year, Harper says the forensic technique is more important than ever to prevent “blood horns” leaking onto the market. Dr Tanya Wyatt, an expert in the illegal wildlife trade from Northumbria University said conservation work was also vital. “This is helpful maybe for deterrents and prosecutions, [but] it shouldn’t be taken on its own,” she said. “We really still need to make a lot of effort in protecting the rhinoceros from being poached in the first place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/12/my-opposition-the-diary-of-friedrich-kellner-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T07:30:23Z","webTitle":"My Opposition: The Diary of Friedrich Kellner review – a German against the Nazis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/12/my-opposition-the-diary-of-friedrich-kellner-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/12/my-opposition-the-diary-of-friedrich-kellner-review","fields":{"headline":"My Opposition: The Diary of Friedrich Kellner review – a German against the Nazis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Adolf Hitler,” wrote Friedrich Kellner in his private diary on 17 December 1942, “is the most cunning criminal of all time … He is the bloodiest tyrant filled up with cruelty and unremitting hardness. He, who seduces, inveigles, lies to, and cheats the nation, has won millions of adherents and makes them into fanatical fighters for his heresies, which are nothing other than a conglomerate of ideas stolen from other fanatics.” Throughout the war, Kellner continued to confide to his diary his moral outrage at the crimes of the regime and his contempt for the gullible Germans who accepted them and believed in Hitler’s lies. Who was this remarkable man? Born in 1885, he was a junior court official and active Social Democrat in the Rhenish town of Mainz during the Weimar Republic. The Social Democrats were the real mainstay of German democracy during the 1920s, but despite their millions of adherents proved unable to resist the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. Thousands of their officials and representatives were arrested and imprisoned, and to escape persecution, Kellner moved to Laubach, a small town in Upper Hesse, scarcely more than a village, where he became administrator of the local courthouse. Here his socialist sympathies were not known. Laubach turned out to be a hotbed of nazism. No wonder Kellner thought all Germans were either knaves or fools. Had he lived in a working-class region such as the industrial Ruhr, with its legions of former communists and Social Democrats, he would doubtless have been able to record a more varied picture of people’s views. Kellner had no illusions about the Nazis’ use of terror and coercion to keep people in their place. “A harassed, tormented, intimidated and extremely subjugated people,” he wrote in September 1939, had to suffer “terror without equal … The decent German has hardly any courage left to think, let alone to speak.” Kellner himself felt he had to exercise “extreme caution” in voicing his own views. He was reprimanded by the town’s former mayor for greeting him on the street with a “Good Day!”: “You say ‘Heil Hitler’, young man!” Kellner’s opportunities for opposing the regime in any practical way were non-existent, though he did discourage his colleagues from joining the Nazi party, distribute leaflets dropped by allied planes during the war, and discreetly pass on what he heard on the BBC to selected colleagues. His opposition was of necessity almost entirely confined to the pages of his diary, which he kept to demonstrate to future generations the criminal nature of the Nazi regime during the war it had so wantonly unleashed. This is not a diary in the conventional sense of the word. What Kellner did was to take extracts from the press, stick them in his book and comment on them at length from his own point of view. This material is reproduced in the original German edition, making a volume of more than 1,000 pages. Meanwhile, the English translation keeps just enough of the extracts, together with Kellner’s handwritten notes, to give a flavour of the diary’s character. As a result the narrative is rather repetitive, as Kellner is constantly commenting on the stupidity of the Germans and the evil of the Nazis, and his moral indignation, admirable in itself, becomes rather tedious. His views on the war were certainly far from the naive optimism of the people among whom he lived. “My wife and I belong to the few Germans who, from the beginning, were convinced of a German defeat.” At the start of the war, people were declaring the British would be defeated in a few weeks. “In general,” he noted by August 1943, “the mood is not rosy”, though it was “difficult to assess how most feel because too few express their opinion unreservedly. Fear still guards the forest.” A few months later, indeed, he recorded the denunciation by an innkeeper’s wife of a former court bailiff in Laubach for making insulting remarks about Hitler, a crime for which he was sentenced to three years in prison. This was only one of the many injustices he was unable to prevent. Early in the war, he penned an 18-point list of the regime’s crimes, including “persecution and extermination of the Jews”, as well as massive corruption, the suppression of free speech, and disrespect for people’s religious convictions. Gleefully, he recorded the sentences meted out to party officials caught embezzling state or party funds. With disgust he captured the refusal of a shop assistant in a grocery store to serve an elderly Jewish woman: “I am a National Socialist and I do not sell to Jews.” By October 1941 he was noting reports from soldiers on leave of “inhuman atrocities” on the eastern front, “as naked Jewish men and women were placed in front of a long deep ditch and, upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians in the back of their heads, and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled in as screams kept coming from it!” He recorded the deportation of Laubach’s Jewish residents in September 1942 (“a dark chapter in the history of mankind”) alongside newspaper cuttings advocating the elimination of the Jews from south-eastern Europe. Nor did he remain in ignorance of the mass murder of people with mental health issues being carried out on the direct orders of Hitler: “Supposedly incurable patients,” he noted in June 1941, were being brought to the nearby psychiatric hospital at Hadamar to be murdered. He was rightly dismissive of the attempt to blow up Hitler at his field headquarters on 20 July 1944 (“an amateurish enterprise. A revolution can be promising only on the broadest basis. A revolution only of officers is a stillbirth”). With some justification Kellner considered that “for tactical reasons he must remain alive to the bitter end. It must not be possible for his death to be used as an excuse in the future.” At the end of the war, enough was known locally about Kellner’s political sympathies for him to be appointed deputy mayor of Laubach, and he played a leading role in reconstituting the Social Democratic party in the town. Before long, however, he withdrew from public life, resuming his career in the judicial administration until he retired. Before he died in 1970, he showed his diary to his American-born grandson Robert Scott Kellner, who has devoted a large part of his life to transcribing, publishing and translating it. How he did this is a fascinating story in itself, and the diary’s publication in English is a tribute to his persistence and dedication. Reading it is a reminder that not all Germans under the Third Reich were Nazis; some at least managed to retain a sense of decency and human values. • Richard J Evans’s The Third Reich in History and Memory is published by Little, Brown.

Over the next 12 months a new management team will make its mark, while the debate about whether the broadcaster moves outside London should also finally be resolved. As a result, Channel 4 could look a substantially different organisation at the end of 2018 compared to today. Alex Mahon began work as chief executive in the autumn, after joining from the special effects company behind the films Gravity and Guardians of the Galaxy. This month her team is being bolstered by the arrival of Ian Katz, the former editor of Newsnight and deputy editor of the Guardian, as director of programmes. So far Mahon and Katz, who left Newsnight in October, have revealed little about their ideas and plans. Mahon made comments last month that suggested she wanted Channel 4 to do more entertainment and comedy, and broadcast more original content in the late-night 11pm slot. Because Katz has never commissioned programmes for a broadcaster before it is difficult to predict what direction he could take. However, he became renowned at the Guardian and the BBC for generating ideas; when his appointment was announced, Channel 4 sources praised his “history of risk-taking” and “promoting new talent”. So expect some bold and original new shows to appear. Channel 4 starts 2018 in confident mood after the critical and commercial success of The Great British Bake Off, for which it paid £75m. The strong viewing figures for Bake Off have given Mahon and Katz a show that they can anchor their schedule around, and funds from advertising revenue they can spend elsewhere. The broadcaster already has a string of potential hits airing in January, commissioned by the previous management team. This includes the drama Kiri, starring Sarah Lancashire and written by Jack Thorne, who won a Bafta for his work on This Is England ’90. However, the most pressing issue facing Channel 4 and Mahon is the potential relocation of the organisation’s headquarters from central London. As 2017 wore on, it seemed that Channel 4 could reach a compromise agreement with the government about leaving the capital. The Conservatives pledged to move the broadcaster in their manifesto for last year’s general election, but by September, Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, was suggesting that “relocation may not mean the whole business”. Her preference was to “agree a way forward in concert with Channel 4”. Bradley and Mahon are understood to have held talks, and an announcement could arrive early in the year. All parties must be keen to end the uncertainty – it cannot be helpful for recruitment at Channel 4, while the government is under pressure to make a decision from those cities that have pitched to become the new home of the broadcaster. Some sort of compromise seems likely. Mahon has so far been less outspoken about the dangers of relocation than her predecessor, David Abraham. But she will have to offer something significant to appease MPs from across the House of Commons who have made it clear that they want Channel 4 to do more outside London. One potential outcome could be the relocation of all or some of the programme commissioning team – who decide what shows will be broadcast – while the sales department remains in London. By the end of the year the direction of travel for Channel 4’s headquarters – and Mahon and Katz’s strategy – should be clear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/07/battle-press-media-with-government-help-dcms-home-office","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T06:59:04Z","webTitle":"Battle the press – with the government’s help","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/07/battle-press-media-with-government-help-dcms-home-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/07/battle-press-media-with-government-help-dcms-home-office","fields":{"headline":"Battle the press – with the government’s help","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"An extraordinary article was published on the government’s website last week. “Handling media attention after a major incident” was released on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport and the Home Office, and offers advice to the general population about how to deal with media inquiries. There are a few points in the article that stand out. Firstly, there is this sentence: “You should remember that you do not have to answer any questions, but the media could use any information that you give them – even if you tell them something in confidence or off the record.” Other striking parts are the suggestion that “you might wish to consider seeking the advice of a lawyer” or hiring a PR agency if speaking about sensitive matters, or that dealing with the media can be “distressing and daunting”. The first sentence suggests that journalists behave dishonestly, while the others suggest professionals could be needed when dealing with the press. Now these may be fair points: but should they really be made by the DCMS and the Home Office? Newspapers are regulated and run independently from government, and the BBC and media watchdog Ofcom consider themselves standalone organisations. There is something unsettling about any government offering direct advice to its citizens about how to deal with the media. There’s more where the Mash-up came from The pressure on British broadcasters to invest more time, energy and cash into original children’s programmes was cranked up again between Christmas and New Year with the launch of a £60m government fund to finance new content. This fund is the latest stage in efforts by the government and Ofcom to improve the genre; Ofcom has already launched a review of kids’ TV. A generation of young people in Britain are growing up on a diet of Netflix, Amazon and YouTube rather than domestic programmes. Expect the BBC, ITV, C4 and C5 to do more in 2018: the return of Saturday children’s shows to main BBC channels – through Saturday Mash-Up! on BBC2 – is just the start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/07/ivanka-trump-wants-to-be-the-first-female-us-president-perhaps-she-already-is-","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T14:30:12Z","webTitle":"Ivanka Trump wants to be the first female US president.

Perhaps she already is","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are quite the adorable pair, aren’t they? Their relationship is truly something to aspire to. While other couples spend their evenings eating dinner and watching TV, Javanka, it would appear, bond over intimate strategy sessions where they draw up detailed plans for world domination. According to Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, Ivanka and Jared have their futures all figured out. Wolff writes that the couple have “made an earnest deal” that Ivanka will run for president before Jared. “The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump.” There has been much guffawing over Ivanka’s apparent political ambitions. Does a woman who sells strappy sandals and Instagrams motivational quotes while dabbling in an unpaid internship in the White House seriously think she deserves the highest office in the world? It’s almost as ludicrous an idea as a reality-TV star with no political experience becoming president! No chance. Republican strategist Rick Wilson told CNN, for example, that Ivanka “is much more likely to be driving a Volvo … to visit her husband in a correctional facility than she is to be president of the United States at some point”. While I would love to think that Ivanka’s future might consist of Volvos and orange jumpsuits rather than Air Force One and the White House, I’m not so sure that will be the case. Indeed, I think the First Daughter is probably right: if there is going to be a female president of the US anytime soon, it will be Ivanka Trump. One could even argue that Ivanka is already the first female president of America. Since entering the White House in a capacity no one seems to really understand, Ivanka has made herself a fixture on the world stage. She sat in at the G20, for example, discussing African migration with the Chinese, Russian and Turkish presidents, German chancellor and Theresa May. She travelled to India to co-host a Global Entrepreneurship Summit alongside Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. She launched a fund for female entrepreneurs with the World Bank. She is basically a part-time president and now she seems to be vying for the full-time gig. Ivanka may project a saccharine-sweet image –the doting daughter, nurturing mother, and loving wife – but she has proved herself to be more than a little ruthless when it comes to furthering her ambitions and ensuring that her brand is not tarnished by her father’s actions. Wolff’s book reports that Steve Bannon accused Ivanka, who he nicknamed “the queen of leaks”, of routinely leaking information from the White House to make herself and Jared look good. This would certainly seem to be the case. Every time Trump does something which might hurt his daughter’s reputation among the New York liberals from her social set, reports in the media from mysterious sources suddenly appear, detailing how Ivanka and Jared are valiantly working day and night to make things right. It was widely reported last year, for example, that Javanka were instrumental in stopping Trump from overturning an Obama-era order that protected LGBT rights in the workplace. The queen of leaks’ reputation control strategy seems to have successfully stopped her brand from sinking. While Ivanka has started to draw a lot more criticism from the liberal media now than she did during Trump’s campaign, she still appears to have bipartisan appeal. A Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted last July found that 44% of US voters view Ivanka favourably. And research published by YouGov late last year found that the perception of the Ivanka Trump clothing line among consumers who vote Democrat has been moving in a continuously positive direction since late spring 2017. As Ivanka’s clothing brand is intertwined with her personal brand, that would suggest her stock among Democrats seems to be going up. Of course, if Ivanka does run for president, it will likely be on a Republican ticket and she will have to abandon her current pretence at mild progressiveness. Just look at the UK: there is a reason the only two female prime ministers we have had have both been Tories. Electing a woman who is also liberal as leader seems to be far too much for the British establishment to handle. In the more religious, less tolerant US, it is even more of a challenge. Hillary Clinton may have won the popular vote in 2016, but the levels of misogyny directed against her made it clear that the US establishment still finds it near-impossible to stomach the idea of a female head of state. And certainly not one who is a Democrat. But perhaps Ivanka will not have to deal with tedious things such as democratic elections, as Clinton did. Perhaps Trump, in his typically innovative manner, will simply change the constitution and appoint Ivanka Empress of America via a 3am tweet. It’s not beyond the realm of possibility. After all, it’s still very early in an already exhausting 2018. Basically, anything could happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/06/women-john-worboys-paid-debt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Do forgive us women if we don’t agree John Worboys has paid his debt | Marina Hyde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/06/women-john-worboys-paid-debt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/06/women-john-worboys-paid-debt","fields":{"headline":"Do forgive us women if we don’t agree John Worboys has paid his debt","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In a faintly mirthless sort of way, I am enjoying the various people telling despairing women not to rush to judgment on the news that black-cab rapist John Worboys is to be released from prison after nine years inside. Rush? My darlings, it took us a lifetime to get here. You work for this skill, you acquire it, you hone it. Only by laying down a couple or more decades’ experience of being female can we be perfectly placed to judge, when such a revelation emerges, that we are Really Not Happy about it. Like Chuck Norris, we don’t sleep. We wait. Though we were never in the Boy Scouts, we know to be prepared. So that when the news drops, we are ready. Our performance can only be optimal. The training kicks in, and we are immediately able to offer an unimpeachable verdict along the lines of “Well, there you fucking go.” In some ways, an outcome such as the Worboys one is the yardstick you’ve been looking for. As a lady, you really know where you stand when society judges Worboys’ debt to it to be nine years. That’s if you didn’t know where you stood when you heard about the original police investigation, which was so useless that the Met has felt forced – forced! – to take two of Worboys’ victims to the Supreme Court to avoid having to pay them compensation. Judgment on that is still awaited. For now, the entire Worboys case puts a strain on most of the clichés about the law, except, perhaps, those relating to its asinine qualities. In technical terms Worboys has “paid his debt to society”. And yet, that doesn’t feel like quite the right analogy. I prefer to think that he’s been permitted to declare himself bankrupt to avoid paying said debt, and will be trading again in haste most unseemly to his creditors. Merely out of interest, I wonder which sex offender treatment programme Worboys could have undergone inside in a manner that would have satisfied the parole board? I mean, I don’t want to put a downer on his X Factor journey here, but the main one used in England and Wales was scrapped last year after prisoners who had completed it were more likely to offend again than those that hadn’t. Well … there you go. Whatever the programme, it will have had to effect a stunning turnaround in a comparatively short space of time. Worboys’ trial was marked by a total failure to face up to even the shores of his behaviour, let alone the vast depths of horror that stretched beyond them. As one of his victims put it: “I feel so angry that he pleaded not guilty and made us go through the pain of giving evidence in court.” Inevitably, the word upon which Worboys alighted in the dock to describe his shtick – lying about having won lots of money, and wishing to celebrate with women he was about to drug and rape or assault – was “banter”. Yup, that trusty old faithful. Even his defence was not averse to a bit of bantz to cast the former stripper as winsomely down on his luck. “One imagines,” opined his barrister at one point, “that a male stripper has a limited shelf life during which they can pursue their career.” (The women, of course, can go on and on.) Still, Worboys had a good innings – 12 years in the stripping game isn’t so bad for someone the jury were simultaneously being asked to think of as withdrawn and socially awkward. Perhaps prison has brought Worboys out of his shell, transforming him from the banter rapist into someone who poses no danger to the public. Parole experts evidently presume it worth the risk. My long-held view, incidentally, is that the UK’s prison population is absurd. There should be far fewer people in prison. And if that means a bigger cell and more room (and time) to kick around for the likes of John Worboys, he can thank me in one of the radioactively self-pitying letters chaps in his position are given to writing. “My mind is all over the place,” read one of his efforts to an ex-girlfriend’s mother. No doubt. Still, I see he’s somehow found the strength to get himself together and survive. The details of his transformation remain a mystery, alas. For all the bewilderment, we will not get the full reasons behind the parole board’s decision. For some, there is a troubling inconsistency there. The public can see the court process that leads to a sentence, but after that the shutters come down, and there is no visibility on the process that leads to the majority of offenders emerging after having served half of it. Would more transparency be worse? Lawyers may not want this for many of their more notorious parole clients, but many people in favour of greater openness in all aspects of public life might argue the long-term benefits. As things stand, we won’t get the full reasons on this case. Thus, for many, an injustice will appear to have been done. Across the airwaves and the internet since news of his release broke, a lot of chaps have taken the time to explain in small words why what has happened is perfectly reasonable. For my money, rather too many (though not all) of these teeter on the brink of finding many women’s reaction to the news “emotional”. Perhaps it takes a control to the experiment to remind them that it is possible to understand how a situation has been arrived at and still have rather strong feelings about it, and many will be grateful to the MP Anna Soubry for saying that even as a former criminal barrister, she feels “uneasy” at the Worboys release. Either way, to all the Great Explainers out there, allow me to return the favour. Allow me to explain this apparently irrational behaviour of women objecting to Worboys’ minibreak at Her Majesty’s Pleasure. For the avoidance of doubt, I and plenty of other women understand that Worboys was sentenced for 19 offences relating to 12 women, not for the 100 or more others police think he may have committed, nor for potential offences relating to any of the 75 women who came forward after his conviction. I and plenty of other women understand that those convictions – one count of rape, five counts of sexual assault, one count of attempted sexual assault, and 12 counts of drugging – secured him a so-called indeterminate sentence. I and plenty of other women understand that he was given a tariff of eight years. And amazingly, it is not even beyond us to understand that an eight-year tariff meant he must serve a minimum of eight years. In fact, if we take a big run-up at the thought, we are even capable of understanding that this meant he could be out having served half of the 16-year sentence he would have received had he not been given an indeterminate sentence for public protection. But the thing is – and the Great Explainers must prepare to have their minds blown by this – it is possible that we also have a problem with all this. We understand it, and we also disagree with it. I know it’s mad, but we don’t feel the automatic need to reflexively rationalise the status quo as if it’s all predetermined science, and you might as well argue against gravity as disagree with it. We even wonder – imagine! – whether getting angry about things is a step towards getting them changed. There are so many conversations to be had about rape law. From about 13% of reported rapes in England and Wales ending in a conviction to a complainant’s sexual history being admissible in court; from restorative justice to the scandal of how poor victims’ services are when the Ministry of Justice is paying £30m to consultants PwC to digitalise courts; from the ways in which early guilty pleas could be incentivised to an entire rethink of rape sentencing … Yes, there are so many conversations to be had about rape law, and this is us starting another one of them. Apologies if we’re not doing it in the right way, or in the way you would, or in a manner emotionally detached from the daily possibility of, you know, being raped. But do please consider your concerns about us duly noted, and we’ll see you on the other side. • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/my-boyfriend-kissed-another-man-annalisa-barbieri","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-20T09:00:47Z","webTitle":"My boyfriend kissed another man: does that mean he's gay?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/my-boyfriend-kissed-another-man-annalisa-barbieri","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/my-boyfriend-kissed-another-man-annalisa-barbieri","fields":{"headline":"My boyfriend kissed another man: does that mean he's gay?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I found out two weeks ago that my boyfriend had kissed another man. The next day, he texted the same man inappropriate messages, asking to meet again and proceed further than kissing (the messages were apparently sent while my boyfriend was very drunk). When we spoke about this, he said he did not enjoy the kiss, but wanted to see if he enjoyed other activities with men. I have always known he has been curious in this way and I’ve voiced my concerns about him wanting a man instead of me (a woman). He’s always responded that I am what he wants, insisting he loves me. But this encounter demonstrates that he is still not sure. He believes his bisexuality is a sign that he is undecided, so he wants to explore or rule out men – but continue in a relationship with me. I don’t think that’s fair, but I want to help him. When we discussed his cheating, he said he was planning on proposing within the next year, but was worried about committing to me when it may turn out that he would eventually prefer men. He doesn’t want to realise this 20 years down the line, when we are married with kids. His excuses for the kiss were weak at best: he was under incredible pressure and stress at work, and going through a family upheaval, all of which produced a cocktail of emotions that, when this man instigated a kiss, led to him kissing back. What do I do? If your boyfriend didn’t enjoy his kiss with this man, why would he want to do more? And, you know, lots of people cope with stress, and manage to get very, very drunk, without changing their sexuality. What would happen if you had a baby together, or had money problems? Would he go out and kiss an entire boyband? What you’re trying to do is ignore very clear evidence, to “make it OK”, thinking that if you can just get over this patch, everything will be fine. And that’s unlikely to happen. While many people have fantasies that don’t mirror their real-life choices, these don’t make them act differently. I like the way he says he doesn’t want to realise this 20 years down the line, with little thought of what impact that would actually have on a family situation. I consulted Kirstie McEwan, who is a sexual and relationship counsellor (cosrt.org.uk). “You’re obviously heartbroken,” she said, “but you’ve always known he was curious, haven’t you?” She wondered what’s keeping you together. “Is it more than just a relationship? Is there further entanglement, shared finances? Do you still want a relationship with this man and, if so, what sort?” She also pointed out that the ball is not in his court but in yours. You ask how trust can be rebuilt but, given that he’s very probably lying to himself, I think this is going to be a long, hard journey for you. It does seem you have had suspicions for a while (you don’t mention your ages, nor how long you’ve been together). “Some people,” McEwan says, “may suspect something but don’t want to see the truth. Now it’s squarely in front of you and you have to deal with it.” You may have been avoiding your suspicions because of insecurity: maybe you feel he is better than nothing, or better than other men out there. But what you’re doing is cheating on yourself if you put up with this. You’ll be forever wondering and suspicious, until you end up a shadow of yourself. There is nothing wrong with someone being bisexual, or exploring their sexuality – but not on your time, and not if it hasn’t been agreed. I think his claim that he’s going to ask you to marry him within the year is his way of trying to convince himself. Relationships, and marriages, are hard work. What you absolutely cannot do is enter into them with suspicions, or in a situation in which you are not someone’s number one. Yes, your boyfriend needs to work out his sexuality, but he needs to do it on his own. If you stick around to “help him” through this, you will see his actions as a reflection of you and define yourself by them. And really, this has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with him.

And those challenges are only magnified when you are a top sports star hoping to return to elite level. Which is why it is perhaps unsurprising that Serena Williams, who had her first child in September, has withdrawn from the Australian Open, saying her fitness isn’t yet at the level she wants. So, when is the right time to return to sport? As with almost every question relating to parenting, there’s no simple answer. It depends on many factors: how straightforward was the pregnancy, the level of physical activity through that period, how complicated the birth was, and the type of sport you are returning to. Give me a timeframe ... While recovering from birth can be relatively speedy, most experts recommend waiting until you have had your postnatal checkup (usually around six weeks) before embarking on vigorous exercise. A caesarean birth might require more time. But even if you are physically capable, exercising while you are bleary-eyed from the exhaustion of parenting a newborn is a different matter. While exercise is clearly beneficial, and indeed can help fend off the symptoms of postnatal depression, finding the energy and motivation – and indeed childcare – can be very hard. If I start again, how soon before I’m back to my best? If only there were a definite timeline. Some women might breeze back, particularly if they exercised throughout pregnancy. Others might take considerably longer. The good news is that for women in reasonable health, there’s no physiological reason not to expect quick progress. As Michelle Mottola, an exercise physiologist at the University of Western Ontario, says: “Of course, everything depends on the woman, the birth and her training regimen. But scientific evidence suggests that, in some ways, she may find performance a bit easier during this period because of the changes to her heart and her lungs.” Was Williams unrealistic to try to come back so soon? Not necessarily. Sure, it was ambitious, but when has Williams ever been anything else? That’s what makes her a great. And there are examples of other elite athletes returning to top form soon after giving birth. In 1991, Liz McColgan took gold at the 10,000m at the World Championships, seven months after her daughter Eilish was born. Meanwhile, Jo Pavey won the 10,000m at the 2014 European Championships aged 40, 10 months after the birth of her second child. However, the fact that both victories were greeted with astonishment shows that such speedy returns are relatively rare – and certainly shouldn’t be used as a stick to beat new mothers who are finding it hard enough to get to a weekly yoga class."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/05/radical-and-traditional-farmers-unite-in-oxford-over-an-uncertain-future","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T16:53:18Z","webTitle":"Radical ecologists v Big Agriculture: the rival factions fighting for the future of farming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/05/radical-and-traditional-farmers-unite-in-oxford-over-an-uncertain-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/05/radical-and-traditional-farmers-unite-in-oxford-over-an-uncertain-future","fields":{"headline":"Radical ecologists v Big Agriculture: the rival factions fighting for the future of farming","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s a brisk five minute stroll up the high street to get from the Oxford Farming Conference to its upstart younger sibling the Oxford Real Farming Conference – but a much longer mental leap. Stately, careful and well-connected, the OFC has been going for 80 years. Sponsored by Big Agriculture businesses such as chemistry multinational BASF and farm machinery specialists Massey Ferguson, the cloakroom creaks with waxed cotton and quilted Barbours, while the audience is overwhelmingly male, white and upwards of 40. The great and good – royalty, government ministers, international politicians – come to speak to a polite, attentive audience; this is the thoughtful end of commercial British farming, brought together over bacon baps and craft beer. The nine-year-old ORFC is a much less tidy, reverential affair: founded in order to talk about radical agricultural ideas – agro-ecology, permaculture, raw milk or community growing, for example – it has grown from 85 people in a library to 980 attendees this year, with more than 250 people turned away. It has seen some of its more radical ideas move from the fringe to the mainstream in a single decade. Though still mainly white, the audience is far younger with women equally represented; there is blue hair, tattoos, babies in slings and even the odd hipster moustache. As Zac Goldsmith, surveying the scene from the stage as he kicks off a Q&amp;A with environment secretary Michael Gove, comments: “This looks more like a movement. If this is the Real Farming Conference I don’t know what that makes the other one.” And yet, beneath the surface differences, both conferences are agonising over the same existential threats. Brexit is, of course, top of the agenda. Did farmers want Brexit in the first place? No one can agree. A poll by Farmers Weekly before the referendum suggested that 58% supported leave, but everyone thinks that was flawed. At the ORFC one farmer tells me that by his calculations only about 10% voted leave, while in the live poll at the OFC on the last morning, 71% vote in favour of remain. The lone two farmers who vote in another question that Brexit will be “plain sailing” are amiably ribbed by the entire audience. Last year, according to one ORFC attendee, all was gloom and doom and anxiety about what would replace the subsidies handed out by the EU. But this year the appointment of Gove and his promises of a new environmentally angled subsidy system have changed everything and progressive farmers express tempered optimism about the promises being made. Gove presents his own existential dilemma to many ORFC attendees – “I always hated him,” one tells the Guardian, “but now I pray for him not to be reshuffled.” “We’ve been calling for a public goods approach for years,” says ORFC co-founder Colin Tudge, “but I had little hope we’d ever actually see it.” The OFC farmers are relieved about promises around subsidies, but all still fear the trade department will trump Gove, or that he’ll be moved, or that it will all turn out to be an illusion. And behind the iceberg of Brexit and UK farming policy is lurking the even bigger iceberg of our changing relationship to meat. “This house proposes that by 2100 meat consumption will be a thing of the past,” is the evening OFC debate at the Oxford Union, with George Monbiot telling a packed house of animal farmers they’re a dying breed. “I imagine I’m about as welcome as a Jehovah’s witness during the world cup final,” he starts off to warm laughter, before laying out his argument that animal protein is the most inefficient way to consume protein in terms of land use and external costs in the form of pollution. The farmers bounce up with counter-arguments and a few jibes at “vegans” – a word that seems for some to be interchangeable with “militant anti-farming activist” – but their verbal missiles are deflected. At the beginning of the evening just 20 people voted for Monbiot’s proposal; by the end Monbiot has persuaded a stunning 120 farmers to vote for him. Beneath the jokes is a deep pulse of sadness. Certainly some of the farmers are dismissive of environmental and welfare “nonsense”, but there are also many who care passionately about the land and their work. Gareth Wyn Jones, opposing Monbiot, speaks from the depths of his heart about the land his family has farmed for 350 years: “I believe farming and nature can live as one,” he says. And over at the ORFC farmers such as Ian Boyd whose cattle is 100% pasture fed, or Tony Davies of the newly launched Nature Friendly Farming Network, echo his words, arguing that the meat they produce is totally sustainable. But there is a sense after the debate that the tide of history is turning away from these farmers. One sheep farmer I speak to voted with Monbiot because, as she says, “it feels inevitable. You can’t argue with his figures.” The farming of the future is exciting in some ways. OFC delegates sit looking both baffled and excited as the Small Robot Company explains how robots could do all the planting and weeding and spraying and save farmers thousands, while elsewhere there are discussions about genomics, peer-to-peer apps and millennial food trends. ORFC delegates contemplate mobile abattoirs, ecological land co-operatives, and incubator farm systems. But some see the future as terrifying: “a dystopian vision where one huge company provides cultured meat instead of thousands of small farmers,” says one delegate. In a world where farming is now being fingered for environmental disaster and where vegans sprout on every corner, what hope for farmers? In the face of these uncertainties, the two conferences – once very “us and them” as one of the OFC organisers puts it – are inevitably moving closer together. The issues that once were raised only at the ORFC now make an appearance on the OFC agenda as commercial farmers begin to suspect their scruffy green colleagues may have some ideas that need to be heard. Better, after all, Britain’s farmers seem to be concluding, to face the huge blank of the future as a united front."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/06/how-smart-speakers-stole-the-show-from-smartphones","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"How smart speakers stole the show from smartphones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/06/how-smart-speakers-stole-the-show-from-smartphones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/06/how-smart-speakers-stole-the-show-from-smartphones","fields":{"headline":"How smart speakers stole the show from smartphones","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Move over smartphones. The battle now raging between the big technology companies for consumer cash is focused on the voice-controlled smart speaker. Having already conquered the pocket with the ubiquitous smartphone, big tech has been struggling to come up with the next must-have gadget that will open up a potentially lucrative new market – the home. A pilot light was lit when Amazon’s Echo launched in 2014 and became a sleeper hit. Now the voice controlled smart speaker is rapidly becoming the next big thing, capable of answering questions, setting timers, playing music, controlling other devices about the home, or even potentially selling products. “The last 12 months have been explosive for smart speakers, which have surged into the mass market for two reasons. Firstly, smart speakers have become the central control hubs of the smart home ecosystem,” said Ben Stanton, an analyst for Canalys. “Secondly, and most importantly, the price of smart speakers has fallen drastically.” In the first nine months of 2017, 17.1m smart speakers shipped worldwide, according to Canalys’s data, but a further 16.1m were shipped in the last quarter of the year driven by Christmas present sales. The fierce competition between market-leader Amazon and Google with its Home devices resulted in the price of smart speakers being slashed from £50 to as little as £30, which some put at cost or below for the manufacture of the devices, making them loss-leaders. “This has not only brought in new first-time buyers, but also allowed tech enthusiasts to deck out their homes with several smart speakers,” said Stanton. The trend towards smart speakers becoming mainstream is expected to continue. Canalys is forecasting 70% year-on-year growth with shipments reaching over 56m units this year. But smart speakers are also seeing good attachment rates, meaning that people continue using them after the honeymoon period is over, not stashing them in a drawer never to be seen again like other passing fads in the gadget market. While Amazon and Google duke it out to secure a voice-enabled beachhead within homes, notable laggards to the smart speaker revolution are Apple and Microsoft. Apple, which has had a voice assistant in the form of Siri on its phone and computer devices for longer than anyone, announced its HomePod speaker in June. By November the company was forced to admit that it wouldn’t go on sale until “early 2018” because it needed “a little more time” before it was ready to ship. Apple is pitching the £350 HomePod as music first, smart speaker second, but experts have speculated that it is Siri that is holding the device back. Since launching Siri, Apple has only been able to make incremental improvements to its voice assistant, which most believe is due to its lack of usage data. Microsoft has partnered with Samsung to make a speaker containing its Cortana assistant, but has failed to make a notable impact. Where Google and Amazon have enormous troves of data to improve and refine their voice processing and interactions, Apple does not. The gap is evident even on the iPhone, where Google’s Assistant has near human-like natural language processing in the Google app, according to the company, while Apple’s Siri still struggles to understand people. Some analysts also question whether anyone will buy a speaker from Apple that’s as much as four times mid-range models from Amazon and Google. “Never write Apple off. Its base of loyal fans will flock to the HomePod,” said Stanton, adding that it is likely to make more profit than its rivals when it does launch HomePod. “But it will be a huge challenge to convince the average consumer to part with the cash required for a HomePod.” Where Apple will not come close to challenging Amazon and Google in terms of volume shipped in 2018, he added. While smart speakers are seen as the gateway to smart home gadgets and a potentially lucrative new market, profit from device sales are arguably not the primary driver for most of Amazon and Google’s smart speaker products. Instead, it’s about getting users into their ecosystem and making sure that it is their voice assistant that users interact with. Voice is seen as the next big computing paradigm, the next step on from the smartphone, which in turn overtook the desktop computer. Dave Limp, head of Amazon’s devices, said of the company’s Alexa, the intelligent personal voice assistant that provides voice interaction with its Echo devices: “We think of it as ambient computing, which is computer access that’s less dedicated personally to you but more ubiquitous.” But big leaps in voice interaction will be few and far between, requiring enormous amounts of data for machine learning systems to crunch over for constant incremental improvements. If you do not already have skin in the game you could be left for dust. In the immediate future device manufacturers are banking on voice-enabled devices ushering in a new era of smart homes controlled by the gadgets they sell. “It seems every technology company under the sun wants to launch their own speaker for Alexa or Google Assistant. Many of these will fail, but the category as a whole will get stronger,” Stanton said. At some point Amazon and Google will look to generate more revenue from their voice assistant user base, in the same way they might from smartphones or tablets. Amazon already allows users to buy things through Alexa on Echo devices. But straight retail is likely to form a small part of voice enabled revenue. “We will also see a more explicit attempt from Amazon and Google to monetise smart speakers, perhaps by allowing adverts, or requiring a subscription for advanced functionalities,” said Stanton. In love with Alexa I love my Alexas, both of them. I bought one in October, but soon realised I needed two because my flat is U-shaped and Alexa couldn’t always hear me when I walked in the door and wanted to listen to a Spotify station after a hard day at work. So now I have one within shouting distance of my bed and another near the front door. I used to reach for my iPhone first thing in the morning, but now I can order Alexa into action without having to lift my head from the pillow or even open my eyes. The first thing I say to her everyday is “turn the lights on and play BBC Radio 4”. I didn’t expect to get along with Alexa, in fact I still have the box in the kitchen as I had anticipated returning it. But Alexa fits into my life in ways that have surprised me, it’s hard to describe just how useful it is until you have one. Alexa helps me cook and, even sleep. While you’ve got your hands covered in pastry you can shout out questions like “how much is a cup of butter in grams (I’m American)” or ask Alexa to set cooking timers without having to stop and clean your hands. I sometimes have difficulty sleeping, and Alexa can provide soothing sounds at a simple command. Some night I ask for the sound of a rainstorm or wind or city noises – you can even request the sound of cats, dolphins or flutes if you feel like it. I’ve become a bit of an Alexa enthusiast, and can be heard singing her praises to family and friends. I bought one for my 59-year-old mom out of curiosity to see what she would do. I never expected she’d like it, but she’s almost a bigger fan of Alexa than I am. I’ve noticed she’s much more polite with Alexa than I am, she will say please and thank you to the speaker. I never do. I can see why my mum is friendly to Alexa, as it is much more human than Siri (Apple’s digital assistant) which is quite robotic. You can engage with Alexa, and she even tells jokes. This morning I asked her to tell me one: “What do you call a rooster being interrogated? Grilled chicken.” I’ve heard worse. By Feilding Cage Smart speakers Amazon Echo Price: £90 Good audio quality, an excellent ability to hear you over noise, and a solid feature set, with lots of third-party applications. Amazon Echo Dot Price: £50 The smarts of Alexa condensed into a smaller puck-sized device but with a small speaker. Amazon Echo Show Price: £200 An Echo with a screen, for showing videos, feeds from cameras and additional information for voice queries. Google Home Price: £129 Google’s voice recognition is better than Amazon’s but the Home doesn’t sound quite as good and is £39 more expensive than the Echo. Google Home Mini Price: £49 The best if you’re looking for a general knowledge machine, but not as good as a music speaker. Google Home Max Price: $399 Not available in the UK yet, but Google’s big premium smart speaker is both intelligent and sounds great. Apple HomePod Price: $350 (£350 expected in the UK) Coming in “early 2018” Apple is pitching the HomePod as music first, smart second, but doubts around Siri remain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/07/meaty-jammy-and-very-instagrammable-why-figs-are-having-a-moment","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T17:00:16Z","webTitle":"Meaty, jammy and very Instagrammable: why figs are having a moment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/07/meaty-jammy-and-very-instagrammable-why-figs-are-having-a-moment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/07/meaty-jammy-and-very-instagrammable-why-figs-are-having-a-moment","fields":{"headline":"Meaty, jammy and very Instagrammable: why figs are having a moment","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Is it because when pulled open, they look like the mouth of the demogorgon from Stranger Things? Is it because they are slightly sexual to touch? (The legend being that a ripe one feels like a perfect testicle …) Or is it because, like the avocado, the fruit that went before it as one of the most photographed foods on the planet, there’s an element of jeopardy to buying one: you’re never sure that it’s a good ’un until you get inside it? The fig is having a moment, which may turn into a permanent place in our hearts and on our plates (as well as our social media feeds). But if your experience is of a dried one, gritty and greyish, or wedged into a rather dry fig roll, the fresh fruit is a very different beast. In fact, as Nigel Slater informs us in his book Tender: Volume II, it is not a fruit at all, but an “inflorescence, where flowers and seeds have grown together to form one mass”. This pre-ice age Middle Eastern/Mediterranean plant has plenty of varieties, from blue-black to pale green, and the season lasts from July until October (although, should you want to jump on the fig trend, Waitrose is selling small Peruvian ones at £4 for six, while Tesco black figs and Asda Grower’s Selection are both four for £2). Figs are like avocados in more ways than one: they must be handled gently and they don’t respond well to fiddly preparation. (Does anyone really like cooked avos?) But while no one in their right mind would eat the black, gnarly skin of an avo, it’s absolutely disastrous to peel and/or discard the skin of the fig. The gentle chew of the skin yielding to jammy, soft flesh is quite the experience. What makes the fig favourite for food trend of the year is its photogenic look and its heritage. As the Swiss flavour company Firmenich describes figs, in naming them the flavour of the year, they are “artisanal” and complex – rather like our old friends pomegranates, figs speak of ancient times and a rustic, hand-farmed product that is just exotic enough. They are at once grainy and smooth, meaty and delicate – a bite into a ripe fig is extremely rewarding because it is more textured than, say, a strawberry or a peach. They are, of course, a favourite with the wellness crew for being packed with nutrients, antioxidants, fibre and their, uh, laxative properties, but don’t let that put you off. Figs are fantastic to eat, not worthy at all. The gritty inside can give you the same culinary hair-shirt effect as chia seeds, but oh so much tastier. Let’s get back to its good looks (after all, no food gets to be an Instagram star unless it looks good, like a pert #avocado – 7m Instagram posts – or oozy #eggs, 8.7m). #Figs, at 645,000 and counting, look best either cut halfway down lengthways and squeezed at the waist, to fan out, or sliced thinly with a fruit knife to fan over a tart or a slice of sourdough. Dark purple, milky white and all shades of red from blush to ruby … phwoar! Breakfast Figs on toast is a suitably vague title for an endlessly variable preparation. Per person, toast one large slice of dark sourdough bread. • If you like savoury, crumble some feta cheese on to each slice, top with thinly sliced figs and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and plenty of cracked black pepper, plus a few thyme leaves if you have them. For something more substantial, grill streaky bacon until crisp, whip feta until slightly creamy, then spread on each slice of toast and layer with bacon and sliced fig. Pop back under the grill to allow the figs to blister very slightly. • If you prefer sweet, spread each slice with ricotta, top with sliced fig and drizzle with honey. Add a few chopped pecans or almonds, if you wish. Place a few dollops of greek yoghurt in a bowl, trim the stem off one or two figs and cut vertically in four to halfway down, then squeeze to fan the sections. Top with drizzled honey or maple syrup, orange zest and some shredded mint leaves. Lunch A blob of creamy sauce on a fig does the same job as a soft poached egg on an avocado – makes it look seductive and enriches an already pretty luxurious flavour. Prepare with either sourdough toast or a handful of salad leaves, depending on your tastes. • Stir together 250g of very ripe gorgonzola cheese (all blue cheeses go well with figs) with about 120ml of double cream and a teaspoon of white wine vinegar. (I also think white balsamic works really well.) Add more or less cream to give you a dollop-able thickness; don’t overblend. Halve or quarter 2-3 figs for each person, arrange and top each with a scoop of the sauce. Adapted from Nigel Slater’s, Tender: Volume II • For each person, split a couple of figs in half, add a chunk of stilton to the middle and sandwich back together. Wrap in pancetta or prosciutto and grill or fry, turning from time to time until slightly crisp. Or a leaf of hips cabbage drizzled with a little oil for a vegetarian option. Serve as soon as cool enough to handle. • If you’ve got a few days, wedge small ripe figs into a jar, add a few strips of orange peel, a couple of star anise, a scraped-out vanilla pod if you keep them (it’s well worth keeping them once you’ve used the seeds for, say, ice-cream) and cover with the liqueur of your choice (I go for sloe gin) and leave for a week. Retrieved and sliced over ice-cream or natural yoghurt with a drizzle of the macerating liquid, it makes a fine pudding. Dinner Figs go superbly with dark, gamey meats and what they lose in firm, bright looks they more than make up for in jammy consistency and rich, even sweeter flavour. These recipes serve four. • For duck, score the skin of each duck breast in a grid pattern to help the fat render, add skin-side down to a cool frying pan and allow to heat up – the fat should melt and can be poured off from time to time. Once the skin is well coloured and crisp, turn the breasts over, fry for three minutes then add a glassful of good red wine and four quartered figs (more if small). Allow to bubble away. After five minutes, remove the duck and allow to rest for a further five minutes while you reduce the sauce; season to taste. Slice each breast into about six slices on the diagonal and serve with the sticky figs and their sauce. • For venison, allow about 750g cut of loin for each person, season it and sear on each side in a hot pan, transfer to the oven and cook for about 8-10 minutes at 200C (gas mark 6), for medium. Remove from pan to rest, then add red wine and figs to pan, bubble and reduce as above. Thickly slice to serve. If that’s all too much trouble, puree the fig with balsamic vinegar and a little extra virgin olive oil, warm through and serve with roast meats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/05/what-best-diet-losing-weight-dash-mediterranean","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T16:18:37Z","webTitle":"What’s the best diet for losing all the weight you put on over Christmas?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/05/what-best-diet-losing-weight-dash-mediterranean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/05/what-best-diet-losing-weight-dash-mediterranean","fields":{"headline":"What’s the best diet for losing all the weight you put on over Christmas?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Losing weight is a common new year’s resolution. Even when dressed up as a pledge to eat more healthily, it can be tinged with self-loathing. Those pigs in blankets, mince pies and Baileys. Why, oh why? But at least anyone who wants to improve their diet has a fantastic resource to help them. With perfect timing, a US panel of experts in diet, obesity, diabetes, heart disease and food psychology has scrutinised and ranked 40 diets. Its listings, which are produced annually, show which diets are best for short- and long-term weight loss, which are easiest to follow, which you are most likely to stick with – and which are unsafe because they don’t supply enough nutrients. The solution In the category of best diets overall, the Ketogenic diet, which increases fat intake and reduces carbohydrates and is reportedly followed by Kim Kardashian and Mick Jagger, comes in second to bottom. Experts were concerned at the health risks of such high levels of fat, especially for people with liver or kidney problems. The winning slot is shared between two understated diets – the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet. While you might be familiar with the Mediterranean diet, the former is less well known but has been topping the experts’ annual best diets leaderboard for eight years. But both – as well as some of the other top 10-ranked diets – have evidence that supports their effectiveness: people who follow them lose weight and reduce their risk of high blood pressure, diabetes and probably other conditions, too. DASH was invented by the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and promotes six to eight servings of grains, four to five of vegetables or fruits, six of lean meat (chicken or fish), nuts or seeds, and two to three servings of fats. Each serving is small; for example, 1oz (28gm) of meat or 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil. Sodium is capped at around half a teaspoon. Studies show that the diet, particularly when accompanied by exercise, reduces weight and blood pressure. The experts say it is easy to follow and you will feel full on it. The Mediterranean diet, full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, fish, nuts, poultry, eggs, and cheese and yogurt in moderation, is similar to DASH, but without the specific serving restrictions. Some studies show weight reduction while others are equivocal, but a Mediterranean diet is also thought to protect against diabetes and heart disease. It is also easy and even joyful to follow. Overall, the best-ranked diets are not too restrictive. So the Flexitarian diet – vegetarianism with the occasional addition of meat – scores more highly than a vegan diet. The WHOLE30 diet is ranked with the raw food diet as the least healthy – both are too restrictive to be the “best diet” for anyone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/05/late-night-tv-hosts-trump-dumb-watermelon","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T16:08:54Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts: 'Trump's own people think he's dumb as a watermelon'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/05/late-night-tv-hosts-trump-dumb-watermelon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/05/late-night-tv-hosts-trump-dumb-watermelon","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts: 'Trump's own people think he's dumb as a watermelon'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Late-night hosts returned to the discussion of Michael Wolff’s White House exposé and its many damning revelations. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about how many of Steve Bannon’s supporters have distanced themselves from him after his input, criticizing both the president and his family. It’s been reported that many members of the far right are also following suit. “It’s true, they are so embarrassed of Steve Bannon that a lot of the alt-right have started covering their faces with hoods,” he joked. The book also claims that the first couple have separate bedrooms, and most nights Trump is in bed by 6.30pm with a cheeseburger. “I’m gonna hope … eating it?” Colbert said. At Thursday’s press briefing, Sarah Sanders brought on a “special guest” in the shape of a video screen with words from Trump, despite the fact that he lives and works mere yards away. “The call is coming from inside the house: get outta there!” he said. He continued: “I’m dizzy from the stupid … Isn’t it bad enough that we have to watch him on TV? Now we have to watch him on TVs on TV!” On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also spoke about Wolff’s book Fire and Fury. “It sounds like the Real Housewives of Pennsylvania Avenue,” he said. Noah then aired a montage of the many people within the president’s administration that have criticized his intelligence. “Trump’s own people think that he’s dumb as a watermelon,” he said. “I guess the country isn’t as divided as it seems.” He also returned to the fact about the president being in bed early with food. “He’s in bed by 6.30?” he asked. “I mean, it makes sense in a way. You need to get your 11 hours in before your 5am rage tweets – but still.” Wolff has also claimed that Melania Trump cried after her husband won. “It’s so crazy to think that both campaigns were crying on election night,” he said. The official response from the White House is that the book is all lurid fabrication. “Someone who tweeted ‘check out sex tape’ can’t complain about tabloid gossip,” he said. “The truth is, Mr President, you made your bed. Now eat your cheeseburger in it.” Jimmy Kimmel also spoke about the book. “It’s bringing back some of the ghosts of Trumpstmas past,” he said. He then listed all of the many reasons that Trump’s lawyers are using to claim that publishing the book is problematic – AKA “legal terms for ‘Wah wah wah, stop writing mean things about me’”. Kimmel also spoke about the strange assertion that Trump uses secret recordings to try to have sex with the wives of his friends. “Like Fifty Shades of Orange or something,” he said. “No wonder his only friends are Fox &amp; Friends.” But the host was most surprised by Wolff’s section about how he got all of this information: by gaining official access. “Why did these idiots let him into the White House in the first place? That alone indicated poor decision-making.” Kimmel also believes that the legal attempts by Trump to block the book have had an adverse effect. “I wasn’t going to buy the book,” he said. “I was just going to read the excerpts in magazines and move on but now that Trump’s lawyers are going all-out to try and stop it from being published, I’m buying 20 copies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/05/antonio-conte-jose-mourinho-chelsea-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T00:21:34Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho hits back at Antonio Conte in escalating war of words","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/05/antonio-conte-jose-mourinho-chelsea-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/05/antonio-conte-jose-mourinho-chelsea-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho hits back at Antonio Conte in escalating war of words","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"José Mourinho has raised the ante on Antonio Conte, appearing to reference the Chelsea manager’s four-month ban for failing to report alleged match-fixing by stating he would never be banned for the practice. Manchester United’s manager was responding to his Chelsea counterpart’s suggestion that Mourinho is acting as if he has “demenza senile”, which in turn was a response to Mourinho saying he did not have to “behave as a clown on the touchline” to prove his passion for United – which was interpreted as an attack on Conte. In August 2012 Conte, then in charge of Juventus, began a four-month ban for failing to report the alleged match-fixing when head coach of Siena during the 2010-11 season. The Italian was completely exonerated in May 2016. When asked about Conte’s comments earlier on Friday, Mourinho said: “I don’t blame him. Honestly. I don’t blame him. I think the press should apologise to me and him. Because the question that comes to him is completely wrong and because of that he had that out-of-control reaction. “I was asked about my passion and you know I was speaking about myself and then the question to the Chelsea manager was that I said he behaved like a clown. Probably the journalist wanted to say that but didn’t have the courage so he said Mourinho said you behaved like a clown. “I understand his reaction. I was speaking about myself saying I don’t need to behave like a clown to show passion. I control my emotions in a better way. Everybody knows, I don’t need the Chelsea manager to say I made mistakes in the past. And I will make in the future hopefully. I celebrated goals running 50 metres, I celebrated goals sliding on my knees, celebrations jumping in the crowd. I’m not free of that, especially if we score a winning goal in a specific moment I am not free to have an out of control reaction. “What I was trying to say is that I behave bad a few times and this moment I control myself better. It doesn’t mean my passion is not the same. So wrong question and obviously a strong answer and I don’t blame. The only way I want to end the story is: yes, I made mistakes in the past on the touchline and yes, I will make less but I’ll still make a few. What has never happened to me and will never happen is to be suspended for match-fixing. That never happened to me and it will never happen.” During the case Conte continually denied the allegation and in May 2016 Judge Pierpaolo Beluzzi said Conte had been acquitted because the accusations of sporting fraud were baseless. Asked to clarify if it was Conte who he referred to, Mourinho said: “Sorry?” Put to him again that he mentioned match-fixing and that Conte was charged with failing to report it, the Portuguese said: “Did he? Not me.” Earlier on Friday Conte had launched a fierce attack on his rival. The Chelsea manager has never been so outspoken at a press conference in England and he warned Mourinho to watch his words in future. Otherwise, as Conte made plain, he was ready to fight with him. There is no love lost between the pair and Conte felt his patience snap after hearing Mourinho’s “clown” comments on Thursday. Conte bit back strongly, reminding Mourinho that he could be similarly animated during his younger days. Mourinho famously ran along the Old Trafford touchline in 2004 to celebrate his Porto team’s Champions League winner against United. “I think that he has to see himself in the past – maybe he was speaking about himself in the past, yeah?” Conte said. “Maybe sometimes I think that someone forgets what they said in the past or which is his behaviours and sometimes I think there is, I don’t know the name, demenza senile, when you are a bit [Conte taps his temple] – when you forget what you do in the past.” Conte switched to his native Italian to find the phrase he wanted – it translates into English as senile dementia, although Chelsea later insisted he meant to say amnesia. Conte continued: “It’s when you forgot what you say in the past, your behaviours, when you totally forgot. You must be worried when this happens because it means you are becoming old and you need a [medical] check.” Conte clashed with Mourinho last season, after Chelsea’s 4-0 win over United at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho had taken issue with Conte’s attempts to gee up the crowd when the result was long settled and there have since been a few instances of back-and-forth between them. “You must have respect and I think I do but, at the same time, I am starting to be a bit annoyed,” Conte said. “The people who know me very well in Italy [would say], for this reason, you must pay great attention when you speak because, if you want to go to fight with me, I am ready. I have zero problems. I am improving a bit my English because this is the real problem for me. Otherwise we can go to fight. I’m ready to fight for me, my players, the club – with everyone. I have no problem.” Conte brought up how some managers were synonymous with turning their press conferences into grand shows and how this was not his style; it was easy to consider this as a dig at Mourinho. “I am not prepared, like other persons, to make a cinema because there are other persons who prepare to have a cinema in the press conference, before the game and during the game,” Conte said. “I am not this type of person. At the same time, when I start to listen with regularity to this situation, it is right to answer because it is funny and I laugh a lot.” It was put to Conte that dramatic press conference performances might be a means of diverting attention from disappointing results. “I don’t know – now it is very difficult to do only cinema,” Conte replied. “Maybe in the past with the cinema, it was enough. Now you have to show football knowledge and the cinema is not enough for the coach.” Conte also turned his fire on Arsène Wenger, who had said on Friday that Eden Hazard ought to have been booked for diving in the 2-2 Premier League draw at Arsenal on Wednesday night. Instead, Hazard was awarded a penalty, from which he scored. “I think if Arsène Wenger watched the game again, [he should] understand that he was very lucky during the game for refereeing decisions,” Conte said. In addition, Conte would reference Arsenal’s fortune with refereeing decisions in last season’s FA Cup final. Arsenal beat 10-man Chelsea 2-1 and Alexis Sánchez’s opening goal came after he had got away with a handball. Conte was asked whether it irritated him when rival managers talked about him or his players. “It is very strange,” he replied. “Because I don’t like to speak about the other coach, the other players. I think that is a form of respect you must have and, I repeat, sometimes, for example, Wenger forgets that in our last few games [against Arsenal], we finish with 10 men. When they won the FA Cup and Community Shield, the referee decisions were a bit strange, you understand? “I can talk, if I want, about referee decisions for one month but I don’t want to do this because we must have respect for the decision. Also, Wenger tries to find this way like other coaches and it is not good. You have to accept the decision. He is an old coach, he has experience, he won a lot and he has to continue to do what he did in the past. “For the other situation [with Mourinho], I am repeating – there is a person who continues to look here. He went away but continues to look here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/05/a-very-good-chance-they-will-never-ever-concede-another-goal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T16:08:59Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | A very good chance they will never, ever concede another goal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/05/a-very-good-chance-they-will-never-ever-concede-another-goal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/05/a-very-good-chance-they-will-never-ever-concede-another-goal","fields":{"headline":"A very good chance they will never, ever concede another goal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION Do Liverpool wingers Sadio Mané and Mo Salah like each other? Is Everton midfielder Ross Barkley going to sign for Chelsea on the cheap? Are Liverpool going to buy a spanking new goalkeeper? Who’s upset Sam Allardyce with rumours about fit-again Yannick Bolasie’s future? What’s the latest on Philippe Coutinho’s move to Barcelona? And with so much behind-the-scenes intrigue bubbling around Merseyside’s two top-flight clubs, which numpty decided it would be a good idea to schedule a distracting FA Cup third-round match between the pair tonight, when stressed out supporters of both teams have so many more important things to worry about. In a month when watching football seems to have been relegated to the status of largely second-rate entertainment behind tedious speculation about the buying and selling of those who play it, tonight’s Merseyside derby at Anfield should throw up some interesting talking points. Having finally secured the services of Virgil van Dijk from Southampton, Liverpool’s defence has now developed an air of impregnability that suggests there is a very good chance they will never, ever concede another goal. The giant Dutch portcullis has yet to make his Liverpool debut since signing for £75m and may do so tonight. With Liverpool having paid top dollar, expectations are high and Virgil will be expected to add some much-needed steel to a porous defence … much like highly regarded central defenders Dejan Lovren, Ragnar Klavan and Joël Matip were before him. That worked well. Meanwhile, at Everton, Sam Allardyce has announced he’ll field the best side available to him, despite admitting that he doesn’t yet know what it is. Sadly for the few football fans among us who don’t pretend to watch Besiktas’s every game and are hoping to get our first look at new striker Cenk Tosun, the Turkey international will not be available for selection as he has not yet finalised his £27m move to Everton. “You can’t not go with your strongest side to Anfield,” said Allardyce. “We want to pick the best team we can to compete against Liverpool, but I can’t honestly tell you what my best team is yet.” Despite escaping with a point after being hammered 1-1 at Anfield in one of Allardyce’s first matches in charge, Everton have not beaten their city rivals in more than seven years and can hardly rely on the rope-a-dope tactics they just about got away with four weeks ago. Such an approach would almost certainly see their hosts advance to the fourth round, while Big Sam and his squad advance to the now customary Allardyce-ian mid-winter warm-weather team-bonding session in Dubai.

In an exclusive interview, the 80-year-old director explains how he acted as soon as allegations of Spacey’s sexual misconduct came to light, last October. “My decision was almost immediate. I said, ‘We need to redo this,’” he recalls. “I didn’t agonise. I never dwell on a problem, only the solution.” Scott said the commercial impact the revelations against Spacey could have had on the $40m film were uppermost in his mind. The film had been completed and was set for release in December, and Scott was happy with Spacey’s performance, he says: “I got on very well with him. He’s a very good actor, great fun to work with.” But when other actors came forward with allegations of sexual abuse and inappropriate behaviour by the Oscar winner, Scott feared toxic publicity could kill the film. “At some point, somebody will say, ‘Let’s not put the film out,’” Scott says. “It would infect the movie to the extent that we’d eventually decide not to sell it.” Spacey has not denied the accusations, two of which are being investigated by UK police, though he has apologised for some claims not to remember others, and is seeking “evaluation and treatment”, according to a statement he made in November. Scott quickly asked Christopher Plummer to step in and replace Spacey, and they met in New York the same night. Plummer had been Scott’s first choice for the role of John Paul Getty, the billionaire oil tycoon at the heart of All the Money in the World, which details the kidnapping of Getty’s grandson in 1973. But he feared the role would be too challenging for Plummer, who turned 88 in December. Instead Scott opted for Spacey, who is 58 and required extensive prosthetics and makeup to artificially age him. Plummer filmed all of his scenes in nine days, after key cast and crew members, including Michelle Williams and Mark Wahlberg, reconvened in the UK and Italy for no extra fee. The reshoots added approximately $10m (£7.37m) to the budget, but were completed in time to meet the original release date, and to qualify for this year’s awards season. All the Money in the World is nominated for three Golden Globes on 7 January, including best director for Scott and best supporting actor for Plummer. In his interview with the Guardian, Scott does not refer to the #MeToo campaign or the current climate of protest against sexual abuse in the film industry, but says he thinks a reckoning is long overdue. Scott maintains he has not witnessed any such misconduct in the industry, although he expresses amazement that other forthcoming Hollywood films (which he declines to name) have not been cancelled. The Durham-born film-maker started out in advertising, and has worked in Hollywood for almost four decades, directing hits such as Blade Runner, Gladiator, The Martian and last year’s Alien: Covenant, and running a busy production company. Despite his success as an artist (Gladiator won four Oscars and Scott has received three Oscar nominations for best director and one for best picture), Scott’s commercial instincts have never deserted him. “Business is always highly linked with the creative process,” he says. His work ethic has never allowed time for the party lifestyle. “Whatever you do in private is not my business,” he says. “It only becomes my business if it infects the business that I’m in. Then it’s my duty to do something about it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/05/buddhist-monk-cleaning-good-for-you","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T16:42:07Z","webTitle":"Take it from me, a Buddhist monk: cleaning is good for you | Shoukei Matsumoto","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/buddhist-monk-cleaning-good-for-you","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/buddhist-monk-cleaning-good-for-you","fields":{"headline":"Take it from me, a Buddhist monk: cleaning is good for you","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mental health counsellors often recommend that clients clean their home environments every day. Dirt and squalor can be symptoms of unhappiness or illness. But cleanliness is not only about mental health. It is the most basic practice that all forms of Japanese Buddhism have in common. In Japanese Buddhism, it is said that what you must do in the pursuit of your spirituality is clean, clean, clean. This is because the practice of cleaning is powerful. Of course, as a monk who is dedicated to spiritual life, I recommend Buddhist concepts and practices. But you don’t have to convert to a new religion to learn from it. Many people’s associations with the word “religion” may include a set of rules to regulate people’s values and actions; the creation of an irrational transcendent entity; or the idea of a crutch for people who cannot think for themselves. In my view, though, a respectable religion does not exist to bind one’s values or actions. It is there to free people from the systems and standards that order society. In Japanese characters, the word “freedom” is written as “caused by oneself”. Cleaning practice, by which I mean the routines whereby we sweep, wipe, polish, wash and tidy, is one step on this path towards inner peace. In Japanese Buddhism, we don’t separate a self from its environment, and cleaning expresses our respect for and sense of wholeness with the world that surrounds us. You can see the presence of nature in the Japanese traditions of sado (tea ceremonies) or kado (flower arranging), which were both originally born from Buddhism. But the idea of “nature” in Japan has been strongly influenced by western culture. Pronounced “shizen”, the characters reflect a human-centred version of the world in which humans stand at the top of a hierarchy as the agent or messenger of the creator. But there is another sense of “nature” derived from ancient Japanese. Pronounced “jinen”, the same characters once meant “let it go” or “it is as it is” – a definition much closer to Buddhist philosophy, with its links to animism and the worship of nature. After Buddhism and the other philosophies were introduced to the Japanese people, they began to see nature not only in humans, but also in all sentient beings, and even in mountains, rivers, plants and trees. This view of nature persists in modern Japanese culture – for example in Pokémon’s characters or Studio Ghibli films such as Arrietty, with their environmentalist messages. As a result, even when we pronounce the characters for nature as “shizen”, the term still carries with it the Japanese idea that humans are not excluded from nature, but are part of it. Buddhism says the notion that you have your own personality is an illusion that your ego creates – and cleaning is a means to let go of this. The characters for “human being” in Japanese mean “person” and “between”. Human being is “a person in between”. Thus, you as a human being only exist through your relations with others – people such as friends, colleagues and family. You as a person have some particular words, facial expressions and behaviours, but these arise only through your interaction and connections with other people. This is the Buddhist concept “en” or interdependence. Buddhist cleaning practice provides each of us with an opportunity to understand this concept. You don’t have to acquire special techniques, hire a professional cleaning consultant, or perform the special rituals used by senior monks. The basics are very simple. Sweep from the top to the bottom of your home, wipe along the stream of objects and handle everything with care. After you start cleaning your home, you can extend cleaning practice to other things, including your body. How you can apply cleaning practice to your mind is a question I want to leave unanswered, but if you practise cleaning, cleaning and more cleaning, you will eventually know that you have been cleaning your inner world along with the outer one. Of course Japanese temples sometimes employ cleaners when they are short of hands. But Buddhist monks also clean by themselves. This is because the cleaning practice is not a tool but a purpose in itself. Would you outsource your meditation practice to others? As with meditation practice, there is no endpoint of the cleaning practice. Right after I am satisfied with the cleanliness of the garden I have swept, fallen leaves and dust begin to accumulate. Similarly, right after I feel peaceful with my ego-less mindfulness, anger or anxiety begin once again to emerge in my mind. The ego endlessly arises in my mind, so I keep cleaning for my inner peace. No cleaning, no life. • Shoukei Matsumoto is a Buddhist monk at the Komyoji temple in Tokyo.

They refused to cook, clean or look after their children. Basically, they went on strike. And that day, the shops in Iceland ran out of the only convenience food available at the time: sausages. Call it symbolism, but by going on strike the women of Iceland were calling for men to respect their work and demanding equal pay. This week Iceland became the first country in the world to make companies prove they are not paying women less than men for the same work. Employers are rushing to comply with the new rules to avoid fines. Companies and government agencies with more than 25 staff must obtain government certification of their equal pay policies. Iceland has long been deemed the best place in the world to be a woman. For the past nine years, the country has topped the World Economic Forum’s gender equality index; the UK comes in at 15th. In Iceland men get at least three months’ paternity leave, and 90% of them take it. This gives them time to become comfortable with child-rearing, encouraging them to share the workload with their partners. Women in Iceland are highly educated, a high percentage hold managerial positions and they don’t give up their careers to have children: they do both – like the country’s new prime minister. At the end of 2017 Iceland got its second female prime minister, a 41-year-old with three young sons. Many in Iceland see the women’s strike of 1975 as a defining moment in the gender equality struggle. On the “women’s day off”, as it’s known, 90% of women stopped work and refused to do any household chores. Schools and nurseries were closed. Many shops, factories and theatres had to close their doors. Fathers were left with no choice but to bring their kids to work, stocking up on sweets and colouring pencils to keep them occupied. On the radio, children could be heard playing in the background while the newsreaders read the news. After work, the children needed to be fed and the whole thing ended up as the day the men of Iceland ran out of sausages. I am the daughter of a woman called Vigdís Finnbogadóttir. Not literally. She’s not my biological mother, and I’ve never even met her. In the summer of 1980, Vigdís, a divorced single mother, became one of the first women in the world to be democratically elected as a head of state. I was not yet two years old when she became the president of Iceland and, at the same time, Europe’s first female president. It turned out to be an election result that shaped a generation of Icelandic women. Vigdís (we go by our first names, even the president) was a popular president. She held the position for 16 years. Seeing a woman in a position of power had a profound effect on me and my female contemporaries when we were growing up. Surprisingly, however, it wasn’t the uniqueness of a woman being president that shaped our worldview but the mundanity of it. We weren’t looking at her and thinking, “Yes! There’s our proof women can be leaders”: we were just looking at her thinking that she was the norm. To us, a woman being president was nothing out of the ordinary. Vigdís, now in her late 80s, places much importance on the women’s strike in 1975 and insists that she would not have been elected president if it hadn’t been for that symbolic act. “What happened that day was the first step for women’s emancipation in Iceland,” she told the BBC in 2015. “It completely paralysed the country and opened the eyes of many men.” But my generation’s future didn’t exactly turn out to be the promised land of equality that we thought awaited us. Not a single woman has served as president of Iceland since Vigdís. After a general election in 2017, the percentage of women in parliament dropped by almost 10%, from 47.6% to 38.1%. And recently we have not moved the needle significantly on the gender pay gap, which has remained stubbornly at around 16% for years. Yes, Iceland is the best place in the world to be a woman. But there is still room for improvement. When it comes to the fight for equality, symbolic acts such as the women’s day off can achieve great things, but sometimes more drastic measures are needed. According to the WEF’s latest predictions, women will have to wait 217 years for the gender pay gap to close. The daughters of Vigdís, the girls who grew up in Iceland in the 80s and 90s, are now grown up and raising daughters of their own. They do not want to wait that long. And they certainly do not want their daughters to have to fight the same fight their mothers and grandmothers fought before them. Maybe thanks to Iceland’s new law, the vision of equal pay for men and women can finally be achieved. In the UK, 2018 marks 100 years since (some) women were granted the right to vote.

Set in the fictional northern town of Royston Vasey, the sketch show was a weekly parade of monsters, tragicomic oddballs and one-off grotesques. Its most outrageous characters stuck most firmly in the popular imagination: Tubbs and Edward, serial-killing proprietors of the “local shop for local people”; Harvey Denton and his wife Val, urine-drinking toad breeders obsessed with the prevention of masturbation; sadistic Jobstart adviser and hater of “dole scum” Pauline. There was also poignancy in the form of failed musician Les McQueen, ex-rhythm guitarist of Crème Brulee (Eurovision heats finalists, 1981), and the cavern tour guide who suffers from PTSD in the most deadpan fashion. Freak, murderer, social misfit or reluctant swinger, even the show’s most eccentric creations were rooted in reality, as experienced by the writing team of Jeremy Dyson, Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. Papa Lazarou, the blacked-up ringmaster who calls everybody Dave, was inspired by an old landlord of Pemberton and Shearsmith. Like Basil Fawlty, Tubbs and Edward came from a real-life experience of dreadful customer service. Speaking of Basil, The League would go on to break Fawlty Towers’ “two series only” rule for TV comedy. Feeling they had already jumped the shark in the second run by delving ever deeper into horror territory with Tubbs and Edward’s diabolical antics and the town-wide nosebleed epidemic, The League shook things up for series three. Edward and Tubbs were killed off at the outset. The laughter track was removed. The atmospheric theme tune was given a funky overhaul. There were guest spots from Christopher Eccleston and Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. Each week, a different main character took the spotlight, with the episodes forming part of an elaborate narrative arc all leading up to the same point in time. It was an ambitious concept, albeit more clever than humorous. If the horror and laughs had been reined in, so too had at least one point of plausibility. We could buy into The League’s local universe of cursed vets, implied cannibalism and gun-toting salesmen. But imaginations were stretched too far in the first episode of series three, when Pauline engaged in a toxic carnal relationship with her prior nemesis Ross and Mickey the unhygienic simpleton. Less believable and more disturbing than witnessing a toad melt on a radiator or a schoolboy buried alive by a sexual predator was the scene in which Ross pumped Pauline from behind, complete with groans and squelch noises. An adequate feature film followed before the members split off to embark on various film, TV, theatre and literary projects. The reunion episodes which aired last month showcased an even grimmer Royston Vasey, ravaged further by the austerity that has infected many real towns. And, despite that definite shark jump – which even Gatiss described as having “one foot on the water ski in terms of what the public were expecting” – this Brexit Britain outing was fairly decent. At the very least, it suggested that The League’s upcoming live dates could have a little more edge than a Crème Brulee tour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/05/us-economy-jobs-growth-employment-december","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T17:18:16Z","webTitle":"Stock market extends surge despite slowing US job growth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/05/us-economy-jobs-growth-employment-december","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/05/us-economy-jobs-growth-employment-december","fields":{"headline":"Stock market extends surge despite slowing US job growth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Wall Street has shrugged off slowing growth in US jobs, extending a surge in the stock market as the world’s largest economy comes closer to reaching full employment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 0.2% in New York on Thursday morning, adding more than 50 points to reach 25,123, despite the weaker readings for job creation last month. Figures from the US labor department showed 148,000 new positions were created in December, below the forecasts of economists, as the retail sector shed 20,000 jobs over the holiday season. The headline numbers suggest that the jobs market remains strong. The labor department announced that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% in December, close to a 17-year low. Economists expect jobs growth to slow this year as the US labour market comes closer to full employment. The US economy has now added more than 2m jobs annually for seven straight years, a run last seen in the 1990s. But the pace of hiring has slowed, the recovery remains uneven, and wages continue to lag behind growth. Analysts had expected the US to add 180,000 jobs over the month. The labor department also cut its hiring figures for October and November, with a net downward revision of 9,000 jobs. The troubled retail sector lost 20,000 jobs over the month as the shift to online shopping took its toll even over the holiday season. The economy added new jobs in healthcare (up 31,000), construction (up 30,000) and manufacturing (up 25,000). Wages continued their sluggish recovery, rising 2.5% in December from a year earlier, despite expectations that lower unemployment would add to the bargaining power of workers to demand higher wages. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve will have been looking for signs of wage growth as they prepare to nudge interest rates higher. Stronger growth in pay typically leads to inflation – as companies raise prices offered to consumers to compensate for their higher wage bills – which can be kept in check using higher interest rates. Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, noted that December marked the 10th anniversary of the start of the last recession. “While by some measures the economy has recovered, the topline numbers mask important differences in the experiences of working people,” she said. “Employers should be lining up for workers – instead of workers competing for jobs.” On Wednesday ADP, the US’s largest payroll processor, said private employers had added 250,000 jobs over December. Anticipation of a more positive government jobs report had already driven stock markets to record highs. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, which helps compile the report, said: “The job market ended the year strongly. Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls. The tight labor market will get even tighter, raising the specter that it will overheat.” The news from ADP sent stock markets soaring with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 25,000 for the first time. The Dow rose by more than 25% last year, driven up by low interest rates, expectation of tax cuts and a rebounding global economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/the-secret-to-surviving-affair-your-fault","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-27T09:30:46Z","webTitle":"The secret to surviving an affair (when it’s your fault)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/the-secret-to-surviving-affair-your-fault","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/the-secret-to-surviving-affair-your-fault","fields":{"headline":"The secret to surviving an affair (when it’s your fault)","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Accept you can never lie again, no matter how white the fib.

You did something dreadful but you both want to try again, so there has to be a limit to punishment. You can’t get angry but you can be sorrowful: “Why are you saying this?

Hunt said a small number of specialist doctors were charging exorbitant fees and that some patients were unaware of the scale of these fees at the time of their referral to the specialist. For some patients, these fees were resulting in financial hardship, he said. The CEO of the Consumers Health Forum, Leanne Wells, welcomed the committee’s inquiry, which will be chaired by the chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy. The committee will investigate options to ensure consumers are better informed of fees before agreeing to treatment. “The Consumers Health Forum has for some time been calling for the public listing of individual medical fees on an authoritative website so that consumers can quickly ascertain what fees they might face and compare them if possible with those of other specialists,” Wells said. “The Senate committee into health insurance and out-of-pocket costs has recently also called for fees to be published on a searchable database which would also include details about the specialist’s experience and complication and error rates to enable consumers to weigh the relative skill of a given surgeon or doctor. “That step towards greater transparency has the potential to make specialists, private insurance and the health sector generally, more responsive to community needs.” The committee investigation into out-of-pocket costs is part of the package of reforms to private health insurance announced in October following a Senate inquiry into the private health insurance industry. But the president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Michael Gannon, said patients experiencing unexpected or hidden fees was not common. He said it would be difficult to compare specialist fees and compel doctors to publish their fees given the range of services they provided. “Eighty-six per cent of times people see a GP they know the fee and they know it’s zero dollars when they’re bulk-billed,” he told the ABC on Wednesday. “If we look at the Medicare Benefits Schedule, for the average specialty there could easily be 300 different items. There’s between 15 and 20 different private health insurance companies and they have a bewildering array of products.” Do you know more?

A former employee, Heidi Lamar, is alleging in a complaint that female teachers were paid lower salaries than men with fewer qualifications doing the same job. Lamar, who worked at Google for four years before quitting in 2017, alleged that the technology company employed roughly 147 women and three men as pre-school teachers, but that two of those men were granted higher starting salaries than nearly all of the women. “I didn’t want to work for a company that I can’t trust, that makes me feel like my values of gender equality are being compromised,” Lamar, 31, told the Guardian. Lamar’s complaint, filed on Wednesday in San Francisco, suggests that Google’s alleged pattern of denying women equal pay extends to one of the few female-dominated sectors of the Mountain View company. Google declined to comment on Lamar’s claims, but the company has repeatedly insisted that there is no gender pay gap and that it has conducted rigorous analyses to ensure that women are fairly compensated. Lamar, however, said that Google brushed aside her concerns despite what she said was clear evidence of discrimination. The teacher, who left Google last summer, has joined a class-action lawsuit, which alleges that Google “segregated” women into lower-paying jobs and included accounts from a former engineer, manager and sales worker. Lamar joined the class-action case this week after a judge dismissed an initial complaint in December, saying it was overly broad. A narrower version filed on Wednesday has proposed a class that includes workers in engineering, research, management, sales and teaching. The suit, filed amid a wave of discrimination and sexual harassment scandals in the tech industry in 2017, followed an investigation by the US Department of Labor, which sued Google for pay records and alleged “extreme” pay discrimination. When Lamar was hired in 2013 as a preschool teacher at Google’s children’s center, which provides daycare and classes to employees’ children, she had five years experience in similar jobs and a master’s in teaching at the early childhood level. “I was definitely very excited to work at Google,” Lamar said. “I found the environment and the educators and everyone I met there to be really inspiring.” She said she was surprised when Google classified her as a Level 1 employee, the lowest possible category, offering her $18.51 an hour, which was the same as her previous salary. Despite her qualifications and her move to one of the most expensive housing markets in the country, Google declined to negotiate her starting salary, records show. Lamar loved the job, which involved teaching four- and five-year-olds and working with infants and toddlers, and she was eventually promoted. But in March 2017, in a conversation with colleagues inspired by International Women’s Day, Lamar said she was stunned when a male colleague revealed he was hired at Level 2 at the same time as her and offered $21 per hour. That meant his salary was 13% higher than hers even though, she alleged, he had only three years’ experience and no master’s degree in teaching. “The biggest difference was that he’s a man,” she said. “My first reaction was to immediately feel angry and insulted.” She was further upset to later learn that another male teacher had also been hired at Level 2, she said. Lamar said she knew of only one woman hired during her time at Google who started at the higher rate, and she had over 10 years of experience. Lamar said the discovery was particularly frustrating given that educators, a traditionally female profession, already tend to be underpaid across the US. Lamar said she brought her concerns to a supervisor and human resources, and that an HR representative eventually told her that there was no bias in the hiring practices, but declined to provide any data on the gender breakdown of Level 1 and 2 teachers. She said she was also told that some people could get higher placement due to their performance at job interviews, which made Lamar further concerned that the hiring process could be biased. Disappointed in Google’s response, she resigned: “It was very, very sad to leave.” Presented with details of Lamar’s allegations, Google spokeswoman Gina Scigliano said in an email: “We work really hard to create a great workplace for everyone, and to give everyone the chance to thrive here. Job levels and promotions are determined through rigorous hiring and promotion committees, and must pass multiple levels of review, including checks to make sure there is no bias in these decisions.” Google did not respond to the Guardian’s request for data on its hiring practices of teachers. Across Google, women make up only 31% of employees. Lamar’s case demonstrates that when employers base salary on a new employee’s prior pay, it perpetuates discrimination, said Lamar’s attorney, Jim Finberg. “That policy and practice caused women to be paid less than men who are doing the same work and had the same qualifications.” Lamar said: “It feels really scary to speak up, but I do it for the women I work with and the women who are still at Google. We deserve to make livable wages.” Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/03/labor-says-nick-xenophon-teams-welfare-deal-targets-australias-poorest-people","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T02:52:16Z","webTitle":"Labor says Nick Xenophon Team's welfare deal targets Australia's 'poorest people'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/03/labor-says-nick-xenophon-teams-welfare-deal-targets-australias-poorest-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/03/labor-says-nick-xenophon-teams-welfare-deal-targets-australias-poorest-people","fields":{"headline":"Labor says Nick Xenophon Team's welfare deal targets Australia's 'poorest people'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor and welfare groups have expressed concern about a reported deal to push through the Coalition’s overhaul of the welfare system, warning it will be bad news for the nation’s most disadvantaged. The Australian reported on Wednesday that the Nick Xenophon Team had almost reached a deal with the government on the bulk of its proposed welfare changes, which does not include support for the controversial drug testing plan. The proposed changes include a major overhaul of the existing compliance regime for jobseekers, which would use a demerit points system to punish welfare recipients who fail, for example, to make appointments or job interviews. The Coalition wants to abolish wife pension payments for about 200 women living overseas and remove “intent to claim provisions”, which protect people who are entitled to welfare but are unable to lodge a full claim due to personal circumstances. The legislation will simplify and consolidate a range of jobseeker payments and make it more difficult for welfare recipients to use drug and alcohol addiction as a reason for failing to meet mutual obligation requirements. Planned cuts to a bereavement allowance could also leave grieving families about $1,300 worse off. The Labor senator Doug Cameron said the changes targeted “the poorest people in the country, the most vulnerable people in the country”. He said Labor was not interested in negotiating with the Coalition. “I’m not very keen to be doing any trading with the Coalition, whose position has been to attack the most vulnerable in the community ever since the 14-15 budget,” Cameron told the ABC. “We need to make sure we build a good society in this country, that we look after those that are falling through the cracks.” Last year, the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) said the changes represented an attempt to “dismantle an already inadequate social security system”. “There is no question, in our view, that life will be made much harder for people who are already in the bottom 20% of the socioeconomic circumstances of the population if this bill goes through,” the Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said in August. Acoss tweeted on Wednesday that the reported agreement reached between NXT and the government “looks like a bad deal for people struggling on income support payments”. The passage of the legislation has been held up by opposition to the trial of drug testing welfare recipients, which was opposed by Labor, the Greens and NXT. The former social services minister Christian Porter has previously said the bill was likely to be split to carve out the drug testing measure. The remainder of the measures now look to have the support of the NXT party. The NXT social services spokeswoman, Rebekha Sharkie, told the Australian that NXT would vote for the legislation if the government committed to $40m for rehabilitation services and to train regional GPs in drug and alcohol addiction. There was also reportedly a commitment to review the new compliance regime within two years. She said the government had agreed to the deal. “[The deal] strikes a good balance. I think taxpayers quite rightly expect people to look for work or address barriers to look for work,” Sharkie told the Australian. “But if somebody does have an addiction and puts their hand up and says ‘I need some support’, we’re a country that has the capacity to provide that support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/03/mcmafia-tv-bbc-russian-organised-crime-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"McMafia makes chilling TV.

But the reality is even worse","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are many gripping moments in McMafia, the BBC’s lavish new television drama featuring Russian oligarchs and organised crime. Who knew that a caviar knife could be so deadly? Or that hired killers could run amok in the Home Counties, leaving a bloody message from Moscow all over the tasteful furnishings? For Russia purists, there are a few quibbles. Would Alex Godman – the British-educated son of a Russian gangster, played by James Norton – really talk to Dad in accent-free English? And where exactly are the bodyguards? They are an obligatory feature of life for any self-respecting Moscow businessman but strangely missing here when their tough-guy skills might come in handy. But the ideas underlying McMafia – taken from the nonfiction book by the journalist Misha Glenny – are surely right. International crime syndicates are able to shift huge sums of money around the world, still. This is thanks to a financial and banking system that allows them to hide behind anonymous company structures, and asks few questions. Investigative journalists have been busy peeling back these layers of offshore secrecy. In 2016, the Guardian and media partners published the Panama Papers, based on records from the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. Mossack specialised in setting up opaque shell companies. As Bastian Obermayer, the German reporter who got the leaked data, put it, its clients were frequently “scumbags”. We found drug dealers who might have sprung from McMafia. And arms smugglers, oligarchs, defence contractors, gambling fraudsters and kleptocrats. Plus politicians, sports stars and prime ministers. Vladimir Putin’s old friend – a St Petersburg cellist called Sergei Roldugin – was linked to the flow of billions of dollars from offshore accounts. The cash went from Russia, to Panama, the British Virgin Islands, and back to Russia again. In one telling scene from Monday’s opening McMafia episode, Alex Godman discusses how he might magic funds to Mumbai “without leaving a trace”. His answer: by setting up an elaborate chain of companies in different tax havens. A “special purpose vehicle” in the Caymans would lend money to another similar vehicle in the Bahamas. And so on. This is classic money laundering. It may sound like fiction. Depressingly enough, it’s real. Not everyone who uses offshore vehicles is a crook. But the main takeaway from the Panama and the Paradise Papers, published again by the Guardian and media partners in November, is that the offshore industry is not a minor, shadowy part of our economic system: it is the system. The burden of taxation has moved away from multinational corporations and the rich to ordinary people. Offshore has made this happen. We – those of us who pay our taxes – are the dupes. Glenny is right about something else: the central role of the UK, and London, in facilitating the flow of money. We flatter ourselves by thinking that this takes place somewhere far away. Much of it happens on our doorstep, among the manicured terraces of Belgravia and Kensington, where much of McMafia is lusciously shot. British law firms, estate agents and company formation agents are the chief enablers. Take one micro-example. The London solicitors’ firm of Child &amp; Child looks respectable enough: an office overlooking Buckingham Palace gardens, a website featuring neoclassical Georgian mansions and a lot of fluted columns. In 2015, Child &amp; Child set up a secretive offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, a leading UK tax haven. The firm’s beneficiaries were Leyla and Arzu Aliyeva, the daughters of the president of Azerbaijan. Like children from other ruling post-Soviet dynasties, the Aliyevas own extensive property in London, worth many millions of pounds. The new offshore company, Exaltation Ltd, was set up to hold their real estate assets. Child &amp; Child was supposed to identify the Aliyevas as “politically exposed” individuals. This would have triggered extra banking checks into the family’s wealth. It didn’t. Nothing happened to the firm. It wouldn’t comment. Meanwhile, international money launderers have a distinct preference for the kind of companies they like to use: UK ones, with posh-sounding names. Between 2010 and 2014, Russian insiders moved at least $20bn of dirty money from Moscow into the western financial system. The scheme was ingenious. It involved Moldovan judges, a Latvian bank and a series of hub-companies, incorporated at Companies House in London. These were “managed” by firms sitting in remote tax havens. Before writing our first report on this, I posted letters to the Marshall Islands, a sunny atoll nation in the Pacific. I never received a reply. This wasn’t a surprise: these “managers” were brass-plate entities, with no meaningful existence. (I could, I reflected, have put my right to reply letters in a bottle and chucked them into the sea.) The UK National Crime Agency expressed interest in our findings but said there was little it could do. The perpetrators were far away. It was all a bit difficult. Banks too shrugged their shoulders. High-street banks and foreign subsidiaries with offices in London processed $738m in transactions from what was called the Global Laundromat. All of them had sophisticated units dedicated to rooting out financial crime. The problem was volume: billions worth of payments each day. “If you are on the back end, you are kind of playing whack-a-mole trying to pick this up,” one bank source told me. What then can be done about the McMafia culture, thrillingly brought to life on our TV screens, and doubtless featuring more violence and gore in the episodes to come? In May 2016, David Cameron promised a new public register that would for the first time identify the “significant” person behind a UK company. It was a start. Two months later Cameron exited as prime minister. Theresa May’s government has shown no interest in taking these modest reforms further. One measure would be a game-changer: for the UK to compel its overseas territories to bring in similar public registers, which would disclose who owned what. More than half of all companies from the Panama Papers were set up in the British Virgin Islands. True, Russian oligarchs like McMafia’s Dimitri Godman might get round this by using nephews, friends or chauffeurs as proxies. Or by simply lying. Nevertheless, the reform would bring new transparency. It would curtail the culture of anonymous ownership that has blighted London’s property market. It might show that the UK is serious about tackling organised crime. The consequences of McMafia are all around us: a divided society, and a capital that has become a playground for the internationally dodgy. They steal at home and enjoy legal protections here. • Luke Harding is a former Guardian Moscow correspondent, and author of Mafia State and Collusion"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/relationship-mot-new-year-what-others-think-healthy","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T06:44:06Z","webTitle":"It’s time for your annual relationship MOT.

Losing my dad in 2015 to cancer (and almost two years later losing my mind when I found out we were not biologically related), unsurprisingly, took its toll on the way I viewed myself and the relationships I had with everyone I knew. As the stanchions of a once-secure life tumbled around me, I became angry, irrational and depressed. I’ve heard that some people manage to grieve gracefully, but I do not. My family situation spiralled out of control and so did my ability to keep anything together; jobs, friendships and relationships turned to ashes before me. Last year was the year in which I started to reconstruct myself. I’ve since wondered whether my unpredictable mood swings and scream-crying down the phone to mates like a banshee dented the overall picture they’d built up of me over the years. After all, I didn’t think I’d always been that way. Then I realised I’d never stopped to ask them what they thought of me … I wanted to know how true my “meta-accuracy” was, which is how other people’s impressions of your personality match up to your own assessment. A 2013 German study of 65 students and their friends and family suggested that the average person is not fully aware of all the ways in which they are perceived by others. It turns out that the more socially anxious and depressed you are, the more realistic your self-assessment is – those who are happy and confident in themselves are often a little more deluded as to what others think of them. Some of what I learned from my close mates hit me like a glass of cold water to the face. Apparently, in my friendships, I have very high expectations of others and can be quite intense. This isn’t just because I’ve had a rough couple of years peppered with grief and confusion – I’ve always been that way, they say. One great friend, however, also reassured me that this was also one of my best qualities: “You’re in it for the long haul. You expect a lot, but you give a lot, too.” Some of what was said to me I knew. I am open, extrovert, generous, stubborn. I lack self-discipline and over the past few years, I have become more laid-back and a little kinder. Checking in with friends and family to see how you’re all getting along should be de rigueur at the start of each year; call it a relationship MOT, if you will. It’s especially useful if you’ve been muddling along in a lukewarm, middle ground with someone for years without depth or discussion, or if your friendship is in post-trauma recovery mode. It’s normal for social connections to ebb and flow in strength and intensity, but sitting down with someone you love over coffee and just asking “How are we doing?” could be the key to ensuring you stay in each other’s lives a lot longer. @GeorginaLawton"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/03/morning-mail-facts-melbourne-youth-crime","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T20:44:26Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: the facts behind Melbourne's youth crime alarm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/03/morning-mail-facts-melbourne-youth-crime","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/03/morning-mail-facts-melbourne-youth-crime","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: the facts behind Melbourne's youth crime alarm","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 3 January. Top stories Is Victoria experiencing a crimewave involving African gangs? Media coverage led by the News Corp tabloid the Herald Sun has dubbed Victoria “a state of fear” and reported that it could undermine the incumbent Labor government’s chances in the November state election. Then the prime minister weighed in, saying that “growing gang violence and lawlessness in Victoria” was “a failure of the Andrews government”. However, police say that crime from African “street gangs” is not a growing problem, and that calling these groups “gangs” might be overstating the issue. Calla Wahlquist delves into the facts behind the hysteria, and looks at why the recent slew of stories has prompted such fear. Pakistan has summoned the US ambassador, David Hale, to explain Donald Trump’s inflammatory New Year’s Day tweet, when he threatened to cut aid over Islamabad’s “lies and deceit”. On Tuesday Pakistan’s prime minister, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, chaired a national security committee (NSC) meeting of civilian and military chiefs, focusing on Trump’s tweet and how his country would respond. In a statement the prime minister said: “Recent statements and articulation by the American leadership were completely incomprehensible as they contradicted facts manifestly, struck with great insensitivity at the trust between two nations built over generations, and negated the decades of sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation.” Relations between the US and Pakistan have been strained for years over Islamabad’s alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban. Leonie Sheedy was a vocal and visible presence outside the public hearings of the child abuse royal commission, confronting politicians and holding placards. For five years Sheedy travelled around Australia urging survivors of childhood sexual abuse in orphanages and foster care to tell their stories. And then, in the final weeks of the commission’s work, she told her own story of abuse to the commission’s chair, Justice Peter McClellan. “I said to Peter: ‘I’m not going to cry.’ And he said: ‘Well if you’re not going to cry I’m not going to cry either’.” In this exclusive interview with the Guardian, Sheedy reflects on her family’s experience of the care system and her next challenge as an advocate for people who grew up in state care. “I feel that there is so much work to be done,” she said. Iran’s supreme leader has blamed the Islamic Republic’s enemies for nationwide unrest, as authorities cracked down with increasing intensity on protesters, leading to nine deaths overnight. “In the events of the past few days, the enemies of Iran are deploying every means at their disposal including money, arms and political and intelligence support to coordinate making troubles for the Islamic establishment,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in his first public remarks since protests began on Thursday. Videos posted on social networks suggested confrontations between riot police and protesters were escalating, with at least 450 arrested in Tehran alone since Saturday. American YouTube star Logan Paul has caused outrage after posting images of a dead body he came across in Japan, thought to be that of a suicide victim. The 22-year-old American, who has 15 million subscribers on YouTube, was labelled “disrespectful” and “disgusting” after he joked with friends about discovering the body in Aokigahara forest, a notorious suicide spot at the base of Mount Fuji. The video, which Paul posted on Sunday, received millions of views before it was removed and Paul apologised. Aokigahara has gained worldwide notoriety as a suicide spot, with a record 105 bodies reportedly discovered there in 2003. Sport Surfer Mark Mathews suffered horrific leg injuries in an excruciating wipeout on the New South Wales south coast in 2016, fracturing his right shin, snapping his anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, and tearing an artery and nerve. Astonishingly, he his now back on his board and almost ready to ride the big waves again, as he tells Gareth Hutchens. Andy Murray has reluctantly withdrawn from the Brisbane Open after being plagued by a hip injury, and is unlikely to compete in the Australian Open either. The Scot posted a picture of himself as a small boy on Instagram, with a heartfelt message saying he desperately missed competing and might need an operation to save his career. “I genuinely miss it [tennis] so much and I would give anything to be back out there.” Thinking time Steven Spielberg’s new movie, The Post, is disturbingly relevant, says Peter Greste in light of Donald Trump’s continued attacks on the press. The movie recalls the Nixon government’s attempt in 1971 to stop the Washington Post and the New York Times publishing a secret report about the Vietnam war that became known as the Pentagon Papers. The fundamental issue the film raises – the role of the media in a healthy, functioning democracy – is now more important than ever. “Amid the persistent attacks on media credibility today, growing government intrusions on media freedom, and the struggle for news organisations to survive in a digital world, it is easy to lose sight of that most fundamental principle,” Greste writes. When Muslim women speak out against the patriarchal oppressions and violence they face, they are often subject to a backlash ranging from Islamophobia to the accusation that they promote anti-Muslim racism by speaking up, writes Maliha Aqueel. “The prevalent patriarchal order dictates which forms of violence against Muslims are more urgent and demand activism on our part. Under this order, anti-Muslim racism wins many times over before patriarchal oppressions are even discussed. The system that protects male privilege and gender hierarchies goes into overdrive when the reputation at stake is that of prominent Muslim men, such as clerics.” Prowling panthers, paranormal spies and vengeful ice-skaters feature in the must-see movies of 2018. Veteran director Ridley Scott joined the #metoo movement when he fired Kevin Spacey in the upcoming All the Money in the World, replacing him with Christopher Plummer, who plays ageing oil tycoon J Paul Getty in this true story from the 70s. In Coco, Pixar shows a determination to move away from the white-bread world of middle America and move into other cultural contexts. And in The Final Year, documentary maker Greg Barker embedded himself with the White House for this behind-the-scenes study in the final year of the Obama administration – among many other gems in this exhaustive list. What’s he done now? Donald Trump has greeted the new publisher of the New York Times in a string of vitriolic tweets. “The Failing New York Times has a new publisher, A.G. Sulzberger. Congratulations!” Trump tweeted. “Get impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent ‘sources,’ and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!” Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald splashes with the news that the city’s house prices are tipped to drop by 10% over the next 12 to 18 months. The median house price in the harbour city is now $1,058,306, with a median apartment value of $774,124. The Hobart Mercury has a slimy front page, reporting sales of eel are booming on the island and overseas, with more than a tonne of eel served at the Tasmania Taste festival. And the ABC reports on a grassroots initiative to provide free self-defence classes to hundreds of women who have experienced violence in or outside the home.

Her name was Ahed Tamimi, and I was interviewing her for a magazine article, Children of the Occupation: Growing up in Palestine. We talked about her life in the village, the constant presence of soldiers, the demolition order on her home, mermaids, football and hopscotch. She was elfin, with an uneasy mix of worldliness and naivety. Of the many children I met in the West Bank and Gaza over almost four years of covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the Guardian, I found Ahed one of the most disturbing. By then, she was well known in pro-Palestinian circles. In 2012 a video showing her angrily confronting an Israeli soldier had gone viral; Ahed was feted. Now, another video of her slapping and kicking an Israeli soldier has led to her being charged with assaulting security forces, incitement and throwing stones. The teenager is in custody awaiting trial. The video and the charges have polarised opinion. To many pro-Palestinian activists, Ahed is a symbol of resistance, a child hero, a freedom fighter. Comparisons have been drawn to Malala Yousafzai and Joan of Arc. She has been lionised on social media, and publicly praised by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. On the Israeli side, some have said she is a puppet of political parents, she has been, schooled in violence, and that she deserves stiff punishment. As usual, it is a little more complicated. Ahed is a member of the second generation of Palestinians to grow up under occupation. Her father, Bassem, was born in 1967 – the year Israel seized the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Golan Heights in the six-day war. He and his children have known only a life of checkpoints, identity papers, detentions, house demolitions, intimidation, humiliation and violence. This is their normality. The family home is in Area C, the 62% of the West Bank that is under Israeli military control. Their village, Nabi Saleh, has been the scene of frequent protests since Israeli settlers appropriated the local spring a decade ago. Bassem and his wife, Nariman, and other members of the family have often been at the forefront. Stones have been thrown by the protesters; Israeli forces have responded with teargas, rubber bullets, water cannon and sometimes live ammunition. At least two villagers, including Ahed’s uncle Rushdie, have been killed, hundreds injured, and at least 140 people detained or imprisoned – among them Bassem and Nariman, several times. Ahed has grown up in this environment. When I asked her how often she had experienced teargas, she laughed, saying she couldn’t count the times. She described military raids on the family home. I observed Ahed and her brothers as, over and over again, they watched footage of their parents being arrested and their uncle writhing on the ground after being shot. Many of her answers to my questions appeared rehearsed. “We want to liberate Palestine. We want to live as free people. The soldiers are here to protect the settlers and prevent us reaching our land,” she told me. Her parents seemed proud of her profile among anti-occupation activists, a perspective reinforced this week when Bassem described his daughter as “a representative of a new generation of our people, of young freedom fighters … [She] is one of many young women who in the coming years will lead the resistance to Israeli rule.” Suggestions that Ahed’s recent interaction with the soldiers was partly for the benefit of the rolling camera, that her mother apparently had no qualms about streaming it live on social media, and (according to the Israel indictment) that the teenager suggested that “whether it is a stabbing attack or suicide bombing or throwing rocks, everyone needs to do something and unite in order for our message to reach those who want to liberate Palestine”, reinforce a sense that the Tamimis are a highly politicised family. Four years ago, alongside the fledgling activist who insisted to me she was not frightened of the armed soldiers she passed every day, there was a little girl anxious about being photographed near a military watchtower, and who – according to her parents – sometimes shouted out in her sleep or woke up sobbing. Ahed’s experiences are echoed in the lives of hundreds of thousands of children in the West Bank and Gaza. Such a brutal context for childhood can shape attitudes for a lifetime. Frank Roni, a former child protection specialist for Unicef in the Palestinian territories, said he had observed the “intergenerational trauma” of those growing up under occupation. “The ongoing conflict, the deterioration of the economy and social environment, the increase in violence – this all impacts heavily on children. Children form a ghetto mentality and lose hope for the future, which fuels a cycle of despair,” he said in 2013. At 12, Ahed told me she wanted to become a lawyer when she grew up so she could fight for Palestinian rights. At 16 she could be facing a long prison sentence. Whatever the outcome of the Israeli judicial process, she looks certain to spend the next formative months of her life in prison, rather than studying for exams. Her story is not just about one child, but a generation – two generations – without hope and security. Tragically and unforgivably, the same bleak prospects could await a third. • Harriet Sherwood is the Guardian’s religion correspondent, and former Jerusalem correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/02/is-anti-zionism-really-a-new-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T18:36:18Z","webTitle":"Is anti-Zionism really a new antisemitism? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/02/is-anti-zionism-really-a-new-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/02/is-anti-zionism-really-a-new-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Is anti-Zionism really a new antisemitism?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Joseph Pearlman responds thoughtfully (Why anti-Zionism is seen as antisemitism, 1 January) to my letter (29 December) about freedom of speech on Israel in universities. The excellent Yachad survey of Jewish attitudes on Israel did indeed find that 90% of respondents supported Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. But his conclusion that therefore “current anti-Zionism will be experienced as antisemitism” won’t stand up. In answer to the Yachad survey question “Do you consider yourself to be a Zionist?” 31% responded “No”, with a further 10% “Not sure”. So there we have 41% of British Jews who surely do not regard anti-Zionism as antisemitic. And the trend is also against him: those saying “Yes” dropped by 13% over the previous five years. He also asserts that the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism is not discredited, as I stated, but simply “disputed”. The document, adopted by our government in December 2016, consists of a quite vague two-sentence statement followed by a “guidance” page of examples of criticisms of Israel that could be antisemitic. It is now known that IHRA itself only adopted those two sentences, not the guidance that has been pumped out alongside it. The Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn had the good sense not to fall for this scam.

SA Health says nine people, including two children, have been hospitalised after eating products from the Gawler South bakery, which has two outlets in Gawler, about 40km north of central Adelaide. The link to the bakery was first revealed late last month. “We’ve now seen cases in people aged two years to 70 years old and we are anticipating more cases as further test results come through,” SA Health’s director of public health Kevin Buckett said. The source of the contamination had been linked to sandwiches, wraps, rolls and focaccias with chicken and other fillings. “While salmonella wasn’t detected in the food and environmental samples taken from the bakery last week, this isn’t unusual, as the source of the contamination has often passed by the time we identify a common link between cases,” Buckett said. He said the bakery’s management was cooperating with authorities and had made improvements to food safety practices. In a statement posted on social media the bakery’s management said it was no longer cooking chicken on the premises and SA Health officials were happy with its food handling processes. Management also apologised to anyone who had become sick. “We hope this apology is received to be genuine and in good faith,” the statement said. According to the ABC, the bakery was also struck by a salmonella outbreak in October 2016 which affected eight people. The symptoms of salmonella infection include diarrhoea, fever, vomiting, headaches, stomach cramps and loss of appetite. Symptoms typically appear 12 to 36 hours after exposure, but can appear as soon as six hours and up to 72 hours afterwards. Infection is usually the result of ingesting bacteria from contaminated food, water or hands. High-risk foods include poultry, meat, eggs and milk.

The government is exploring becoming a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership to stimulate exports after Brexit next March and has held informal discussions with the group. If the proposals go ahead Britain would be the first member of the trade agreement which does not have borders on the Pacific Ocean or the South China Sea. Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade is believed to be developing the proposals to join the group which is regrouping after it lost the United States, its largest member, when President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement last year. The 11 remaining member states include Australia, Mexico, Singapore and Canada. Trade minister Greg Hands told the Financial Times there was no geographical restriction on Britain joining trade groups. “Nothing is excluded in all of this,” he said. “With these kind of plurilateral relationships, there doesn’t have to be any geographical restriction.” A Department for International Trade spokeswoman said: “We have set up 14 trade working groups across 21 countries to explore the best ways of progressing our trade and investment relationships across the world. It is early days, but as our trade policy minister has pointed out, we are not excluding future talks on plurilateral relationships.” However it is likely that any agreement would have to wait until TPP has been revised after the US left and following the UK settling its Brexit departure with the EU. The UK is not allowed to make trade deals before it formally leaves the EU. One TPP official said it was too early to discuss any UK plans to join it, according to the FT. Combined spending from the 11 TPP countries make up less than 8% of the UK’s export market, with Japan taking just 1.6% of UK exports, compared with the 11% bought by Germany. The plan was criticised by the shadow trade minister Barry Gardiner. He said: “It is not the main event and at the moment the government is making a hash of that.” Lib Dem Tim Farron said: “This plan smacks of desperation. These people want us to leave a market on our doorstep and join a different, smaller one on the other side of the world. It’s all pie in the sky thinking.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/03/as-south-sudanese-community-leaders-we-must-give-our-youth-a-sense-of-belonging","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T02:51:25Z","webTitle":"As South Sudanese community leaders we must give our youth a sense of belonging | Andrew Gai","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/03/as-south-sudanese-community-leaders-we-must-give-our-youth-a-sense-of-belonging","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/03/as-south-sudanese-community-leaders-we-must-give-our-youth-a-sense-of-belonging","fields":{"headline":"As South Sudanese community leaders we must give our youth a sense of belonging","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It seems that the easiest solution to address the issue of violent youth crime in Australia is to either imprison or deport those young people who continually break the law. Eliminating the “bad apples” from the Australian society is seen by many as the quick-fix solution to youth crime which is creating widespread fear and cementing stereotypes. However I question whether this approach will stand the moral test of time. Like many refugees around the world, South Sudanese left their home country in search of a peaceful and safe place to live and to raise their families. The majority of South Sudanese have made Australia their home and are prospering peacefully. There are however some young people from South Sudan who don’t feel they belong in Australia, nor do they belong in South Sudan. There are many reasons for their struggle to belong – adjusting to new culture, freedoms and expectations, learning difficulties, obstacles in the job market, negative media portrayal, and difficulty with some police officers who are culturally incompetent. Issues like these can make young people feel isolated and separated from the community. Some of those young people who have gone off the rails are simply rebelling against a society that they feel is rejecting them. This is creating a cycle of fear and rejection which, if left unchecked, will continue to grow out of control. Most, if not all of the Apex gang members were not born in South Sudan or the Sudan. Some of them are as young as 12 years and the group leader is only 20 years old. Sudanese and South Sudanese started settling in Australia in early 1990s, which means that some of these young people were born in Australia or came from refugee camps at a very young age. These young people are more Australian than they are South Sudanese or African. If the government deports these young offenders, it will be sending them to a country they did not come from, and for many, they will be permanently separated from their family, who are living in Australia, not South Sudan. Furthermore, it would be to their detriment as South Sudan is currently being ravaged by internal civil war and also experiencing severe famine. The suggestion that South Sudanese young people behave the way they do “because of their exposure to war” is simplifying the complexity of this issue and actually incorrect, as the majority have never been exposed to war. The same conclusion could be drawn for young people from Middle Eastern background, and not all Middle Eastern youth have experienced war personally either. It does not explain why with no exposure to war, people from other cultural backgrounds also engage in similar criminal activities. A lot of the South Sudanese diaspora are women and their children as many men were killed in the war leaving their wives as widows. Most of these mothers spoke little or no English when they arrived and had limited knowledge about living in Australia. Any migrant parents from a non-English-speaking background would understand how hard it is to raise a child who speaks another language. South Sudanese parents soon realised after arriving in Australia that they were no longer living in a village situation and were isolated from other family and friends. Many South Sudanese youth have become disillusioned and believe education is no longer the key to success here in Australia because of the difficulty in finding a job once you are qualified. There are many young people whose parents, cousins, aunts and uncles have successfully completed university in various fields but cannot find jobs. There is a growing sense of frustration and hopelessness among the disengaged youth. It is needless to say that the South Sudanese community is just like any other community in which there are good and bad apples. It is blatantly absurd to think that every South Sudanese wants to join the so-called Apex gang. “Are you a member of Apex?” and “Do you know anyone involved in Apex?” are now the two most commonly asked questions by members of the Victoria police when they stop a South Sudanese young person. Unfortunately, approaching young people as suspects can lead to confrontation, resulting in young people being charged with assault. Once again, the cycle of mistrust and suspicion continues to grow and build. We all have a role to play in addressing youth crime in general. Governments need to focus more on investing in families and their young people, rather than investing in building more high-security prisons. Media outlets need to be more balanced in their reporting and highlight inspiring South Sudanese youth stories so that the coverage is not always negative. Community services and statutory departments such as child protection and the police need to work collaboratively with community leaders and parents to ensure that appropriate support is provided to the young people and their families. We need to engage our South Sudanese youth with sporting clubs, youth groups and community groups to build a positive sense of belonging. As South Sudanese parents and community leaders we need to accept our children as they are rather than disowning them. Accepting them does not mean condoning what they are doing but rather making sure that they have a home, a family and a community to come back to when they get out of prison or stop engaging in criminal behaviours. Parents need to accept the fact that their children are Australians and they need to be brought up in an Australian way. This involves putting the interests of the children first and being there for your children when they need you. Let’s step back and ask ourselves: have we as a society helped these young people enough before we give up on them and deport them? It is one thing to open our door for someone to come into our house but it is another to make them feel welcome and at home. • Andrew Gai is a youth and family support worker at Anglicare Victoria.

Tosun is understood to be confident the deal will go through and will soon sign a four-and-a-half-year contract at Goodison Park."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/jan/03/blakes-7-40-years-on-the-dystopian-sci-fi-drama-still-packs-a-punch","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T10:54:17Z","webTitle":"Blake's 7: 40 years on, the dystopian sci-fi drama still packs a punch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/jan/03/blakes-7-40-years-on-the-dystopian-sci-fi-drama-still-packs-a-punch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/jan/03/blakes-7-40-years-on-the-dystopian-sci-fi-drama-still-packs-a-punch","fields":{"headline":"Blake's 7: 40 years on, the dystopian sci-fi drama still packs a punch","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was 40 years ago this week that my parents sat their seven-year-old son down to watch a new BBC One show about spaceships. “It will be like Doctor Who,” they no doubt told me. Instead, broadcast at 6pm on a Bank Holiday Monday, the first episode of Blake’s 7 was a procedural drama about a fascist state framing a political dissident for child molestation. By the end of that 45 minutes, Roj Blake, played by Gareth Thomas, had been sentenced to exile, and nearly every other sympathetic character had been murdered by the state. “A mix of olde-worlde space jargon, ray guns, Western-style goodies and baddies, and punch-ups straight out of The Sweeney,” said Peter Fiddick in his Guardian review at the time.While Roj Blake was the innocent man fighting against the system, the rest of his crew upon the stolen alien spaceship Liberator were bona fide villains and outlaws. None more so than Paul Darrow’s Avon. In one episode Avon weighs up the pros and cons of leaving most of the crew stranded on a planet below to die while he makes off alone with the ship. Blake, the revolutionary, wanted to bring the whole system crashing down. You suspected that more than a few of the crew would have been much happier stealing a couple of million credits and retiring to a backwater planet that had nice weather. “People forget the series was a big mainstream hit,” says Jonathan Helm, who runs @MakingBlakes7, a Twitter account dedicated to documenting the production of the show. “It was getting huge viewing figures, despite going up against Coronation Street. It definitely rode on the Star Wars wave – there was a real thirst for sci-fi in 1978 – but there was something for everyone. Action and adventure for the kids and teens, and mature themes, humour and sex appeal for the adults.” A lot of that sex appeal came from the always glamorous Jacqueline Pearce’s Servalan, the series’ exceptional villain. Her androgynous cropped hair set her apart from the usual stereotypes of women in power on 70s TV. British Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson, a fan as a child, remembers her vividly: “She wasn’t this insipid female character waiting to be ‘saved’ by some bloke.” While she could never quite get the better of Blake, in story after story she ran rings round the buffoonish bureaucrats at the highest levels of the state. She was utterly evil, but delightfully watchable. “It felt really hi-tech,” says Grey-Thompson. “A step up from Doctor Who in terms of technology. I remember reading about computers the size of a room, and here you had Zen and Orac. I really wanted one of the teleporter bracelets, and tried to make one.” We are perhaps more demanding of story arcs in sci-fi/fantasy TV drama now. While re-watching some of the series over the past couple of years, I found it bizarre, for example, that one episode – Shadow – sets up the concept of a drug-pushing, all-powerful space mafia organisation that is financially propping up the evil Federation, but which is never mentioned again. And while BBC budgets could deliver a decent-looking costume drama in the 70s, the programme sometimes struggles to convince that the action is really taking place on the far side of the galaxy. But Blake’s 7 was a bold show that wasn’t afraid to break formulas, which helps to explain why it is still so fondly remembered 40 years on. Originally pitched by creator Terry Nation as “the Dirty Dozen in space”, the show dispatched or changed major characters at regular intervals – including the lead. There have been numerous attempts to get the series rebooted or re-made for TV over the years – the Guardian has reported on positive announcements in the past decade by both Sky One and the SyFy channel – but none have come to fruition. But like many a slice of cult TV, new audio dramas with the original cast are still being made. Those stories are now sadly without the central protagonist of the first two series, after Gareth Thomas died in 2016 aged 71. While there remain elements that date it to the time it was made and the budget it was made on, Blake’s 7 stands out among British television science fiction and fantasy shows. It wasn’t simply superhero good against evil. Forced together by circumstance, a group of uneasy criminals who you never quite believe trust each other, are made to work together for a greater good – with the addition of futuristic weapons, a beautifully designed spaceship and a sarcastic talking computer in a box who found speaking to humans tiresome.

If you fancy getting political, read this first","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Give us today our daily outrage: the pop star Lorde has decided – after much consideration – to cancel her concert in Israel after a letter from BDS (boycott, divest, sanction) supporters. Cut to a rightwing American rabbi taking out a full-page advert in the Washington Post to denounce her as antisemitic, and also hold her responsible for New Zealand’s entire foreign policy. All of this seems a bit harsh – expecting a 21-year-old to have a fully formed opinion on something she readily admitted to not knowing much about. This is a woman who sang on her first album about never having been on a plane. This is a woman who also made one of the best albums of 2017, so probably didn’t have a lot of time to refresh her news app every time something happened in global politics (and that would have been a lot of times). This is a woman who thought about something for a while, sought some advice, and then made a decision she thought was best. I am not sure Lorde should be the flashpoint for people’s anger here. And yet popsters seem to get it in the neck a lot of the time. So here are some tips for besieged entertainers who enter the arena of geopolitical or social issues. Middle Eastern conflicts “The Middle East” in itself is a weird term because that’s not even where it is on a map (BRITISH EMPIRE KLAXON), but when the US president is referring to a country called “Nambia”, the bar for geographic accuracy has been set low. Firstly there’s the Israel-Palestine conflict, which is best avoided if you don’t know too much about it. Do not, as Vox once did, write an “explainer” of the conflict that got virtually everything wrong and invented a non-existent bridge. Then there’s the situation in Syria and neighbouring states. There are a lot of factions and sub-factions across territories: PKK, YPG, SDF, PYD, KCK, pretty much the entire alphabet is covered, and sometimes it is hard to keep track of the “good guys” and the “bad guys”. This is because, you know, this conflict is more complex than that and quite difficult to make a slogan out of for some tour merchandise. Totalitarians So many pop stars seem to have a blind spot when it comes to agreeing to perform at birthday parties, weddings, ket raves (maybe not that last one) of the relatives of dictators. Out-and-out dictators. Not even low-key dictators, but full-on unmitigated tyrants. I have no idea why singers are so drawn to the equivalent of, say, jumping out of a cake at Pol Pot’s summer bash, but they are. Nicki Minaj, Jennifer Lopez, Sting and Kanye West (serial offender) have all performed for dubious characters. If you mess up, do the decent thing and donate the proceeds to charity. (As Beyoncé, Usher, Mariah Carey and Nelly Furtado all said they did when they performed for the Gaddafi family). Party politics One of the most glaring discrepancies between the Obama and Trump presidential inaugurations, except, obviously for crowd size, was the quality of the performing talent. Obama had: Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Usher and too many others to mention. Trump had some dude in a cowboy hat I had never heard of. There’s actually been a cheering number of pop stars calling out politicians for using their tracks without permission at events, but I also rather enjoy the pop stars who take the Brenda from Bristol approach (“there’s too much politics!”). See Girls Aloud, one of the best girl groups of all time: “David Cameron said he fancied me. He was just trying to be cool ... Do I fancy him? No! Politicians should stop trying to be cool and get on with running the country.” Exactly, Cheryl. Terrorism Remember when Ariana Grande, a then 23-year-old pop star, became a target for opprobrium after her concert was hit by a terrorist attack? Because apparently going home for a few days to spend time with family was not the done thing after being caught up in a terrifying bombing, even though she had already made a statement about how devastated she was? Those people (Piers Morgan, obviously) quickly had to bite their tongue when Grande organised a free benefit concert two weeks later. Too soon! others said. It’s funny that Grande attracted so much negative attention for handling it all as well as one could, while the Eagles of Death Metal lead singer’s comments about Muslims celebrating in the streets and Bataclan employees being in cahoots with the terrorists went under the radar. Either way, I can’t offer much advice on this one, because it’s all just horrible. Sexual politics Your role model here (and in all things) is Beyoncé. Beyoncé who sampled a feminist essay from the author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in Flawless, and performed that song at an awards ceremony with a huge neon FEMINIST sign behind her. She did all this and was still criticised for wearing a skimpy outfit, because, men. In 2017, Taylor Swift took a break from recording the musical equivalent of a voodoo doll to bring a douche who groped her to justice, suing him for a symbolic $1. This is good too. When it comes to LGBT stances, early allies such as Madonna and Cyndi Lauper provide good examples; also the rapper Macklemore who, though straight, has been a consistent LGBT rights campaigner, and wrote the quite lovely same-sex marriage anthem Same Love, performing it in Australia just before a postal vote on that issue. Race issues Taylor Swift is a great example of a pop star who is particularly woke in one area and less so in another (unlike Beyoncé, who as well as her FEMINIST sign inserted a Black Panthers vignette into her Super Bowl performance, watched by an audience of millions). Swift got into hot water when she defensively reacted to a Nicki Minaj tweet which accurately pointed out the lack of black women nominated for music video awards. Swift took it as a personal insult, but the two have since made up. In truth the whole thing was blown out of all proportion, but is a good example of white people panicking during discussions about race. Someone who goes out of their way to learn is Katy Perry, who, after some real clangers, went on a journey to “educate herself”. She hasn’t always got it right (see also: model Bella Hadid talking about sneakers, which remains one of the funniest things), but at least she is trying. NB to pop stars: racism does still exist, as Sam Smith was shocked to find out in 2016. It’s not like it has been around for centuries and society is built on it though, so can you really blame him for not knowing? Charity Are you even a pop star if you don’t have a charitable foundation bearing your name? The best are celebs who make it to number 19 in the charts once, and assume Grimsby’s comps are crying out for their help funding bongo drums. The main advice here is to avoid the sort of “poverty porn” that Ed Sheeran and Tom Hardy were recently criticised for, which was de rigueur in the 80s. As for charity singles, please, please, can we have videos other than the finger-clicking stars in sound booths. Be like George Michael, who used to organise free concerts for NHS nurses. In fact, be like George Michael in everything. Brexit Ringo Starr, just knighted, came out for Brexit, which apparently is a popular position among mega-rich people who don’t actually live in the UK. See also: Morrissey. In fact, the best piece of overall advice to give to pop stars on political issues is that whatever Morrissey’s position on it, take the opposite. (This advice works from about 2000 onwards).

Well, no worries. Yoga can be done by the laziest of the laziest. Just stay where you are and do this routine; I guarantee that you will be abuzz with positive energy afterwards. 1 Surya Bheda (single-nostril breath) 1 Sit up straight in a comfortable, relaxed posture. 2 Close the eyes. Rest your left hand on your knee, with thumb and forefinger together. On the right hand, bend the index and middle fingers, and gently apply pressure to your right nostril with your thumb or fourth finger. 3 Inhale through the left nostril, retain the breath for a moment, remove your hand from your right nostril, cover your left nostril and exhale through the right. 4 Repeat, inhaling through the left nostril and exhaling through the right. Do this for two minutes. 2 Dolasana (pendulum pose) 1 Stand up straight with feet hip-width apart and the arms on either side of the body. 2 Inhale, raising the arms, clasping them just above the head. 3 Exhale and bend over at the waist, keeping hands together. 4 Retain the breath as you swing from side to side, with the forehead tapping first one knee and then the other. 5 Exhale and return to a standing position. Repeat a few more times. 3 Vajrasana (diamond pose) 1 Rest in a seated position with the legs tucked under the body (so your bottom is on your feet). 2 The spine should be straight and the knees close to each other. Sit for one minute. 4 Padmasana (lotus pose) 1 My favourite asana: sit up straight in a comfortable, relaxed posture, with legs extended in front of you. 2 Bend the right knee, placing the right foot on the left thigh. The sole of the foot should be turned upwards and the heel close to the abdomen. 3 If you are able, repeat on the left side. 4 With legs crossed, bring thumbs and index fingers together. 5 Close the eyes and breathe mindfully, remaining here for a few minutes. 5 Simha Garjana (roaring lion pose) 1 Kneel in a seated position with legs under the body. 2 The spine should be straight and the knees slightly apart. 3 Place palms on knees, keeping arms relaxed. 4 Open the mouth and relax the jaw, allowing the tongue to hang loosely. 5 Breathe through the nose and mouth. 6 Engaging the core and contracting the abdominal muscles, retain the breath for a few seconds. 7 Exhale and relax. 8 Repeat for two minutes. 6 Sarpasana (snake pose) 1 Lie on your stomach with legs straight and feet together. 2 Interlace the fingers behind the back and place chin on the ground. 3 Inhale and raise the chest, keeping the gaze straight ahead. 4 Imagine the hands are being pulled from behind. 5 Stay here and breathe. Hold this for as long as you are comfortable, even if just a few seconds. 6 Come down, take a few breaths and come up again. 7 Shavasana (corpse pose) 1 This is a lazy person’s favourite asana. Lie flat on your back with arms relaxed on either side of the body, palms facing up. 2 The legs should be sprawled outward with the feet apart; the head and neck should be aligned. 3 Inhale and exhale, and relax the entire body. 4 To deepen the relaxation further, contract and relax different parts of the body: feet, calves and thighs, pelvic muscles, buttocks. Clench the fists, contract the arms and relax. Contract the back, the neck, the shoulders, and relax. Lift the head off the ground and relax. Contract the entire body. Contract, contract, contract, and relax. Recite this mentally. 5 Inhale and exhale deeply, counting backwards from 10 gradually down to one. • The 10 Minute Yoga Solution is published by HarperCollins at £8.99.

Phil Taylor left the sport he dominated since the early 90s admitting he could no longer maintain the “dedication” necessary to succeed. The Power lost his last match as a professional to Rob Cross, who enjoyed a comfortable 7-2 victory in Sunday’s PWC final, but he exits darts with his legacy intact. He was magnanimous towards Cross and used his valedictory remarks to offer his thoughts on the future of the game, as well as directing a small jibe at the next generation. “Everybody kept saying to me: ‘You’ll have a tear in your eye when you leave,’” said Taylor, who ended his career with 83 major titles including 16 world championships. “But the only tear in my eye is tears of joy. I’m ready to move on. “Rob is dedicated, he does everything right. That was me a few years ago but I can’t do that now. I haven’t got the energy levels to compete against these players. The schedule [PDC promoter] Barry Hearn has set out now is absolutely fantastic. He earns them a fortune, he’s a genius for what he does, but it’s five, six, seven days a week and I can’t do that. “I’m nearly 58. I’ve outlived my dad, believe it or not. I asked to go off the stage to Coldplay’s Viva La Vida, because I used to rule the world and I don’t any more. I’m just going to pass it over, let them do it. I don’t think Rob Cross will dominate but I do I think he and Michael van Gerwen are going to rule it for the next five years. “The game’s going to change, of course it is. It’s like every football team, every Formula One team. If the change is good, fair play. There’s a few players in the future where I’d sit down and watch them. Then there’s a few players where, would I go to the back garden and watch them? No. I wouldn’t.” Taylor flies out to Australia to begin the first of what is likely to be many lucrative exhibition tours. Cross took home £400,000 from the world championship. It is likely to be just the beginning as the 27-year-old takes centre stage in a sport that now spends most of the year touring the world. “If you’d have asked me two years ago if this would happen today, definitely not,” Cross said, giving an insight into the approach Taylor admits he can no longer keep up with. “A couple of years ago I was playing really well, I was consistent. But I never dedicated myself and obviously the change comes when you dedicate yourself to the sport. With a disappointment or a success I go back, I change things, I try to make myself better. “My target has always been world No1, I want that. I’m going to have to work very hard for it. Don’t get me wrong I’ve not had a bad start but I’ve still got to improve. Just because you win one doesn’t mean you’re going to win again, so you’ve got to keep moving with the times. You’ve got to keep improving.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/what-can-elite-sports-referees-teach-parents","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T06:15:05Z","webTitle":"What can elite sports referees teach parents?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/what-can-elite-sports-referees-teach-parents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/what-can-elite-sports-referees-teach-parents","fields":{"headline":"What can elite sports referees teach parents?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On a football pitch carved into a hillside in the Sussex Downs, tempers are flaring. The opposition under-12s have scored against the run of play, and their coaches are at loggerheads over whether there was a foul in the build-up. The “home” parents, meanwhile, howl their unhappiness at the referee’s decision. The official at the centre of the controversy is barely three years older – and hardly any taller – than the players he is officiating. But he is by a distance – at this precise moment on this bright winter morning – the most mature person present. At half-time, he beckons the coaches over, then calmly addresses these supposed grownups. “Unless you cut this out right now,” he informs us, “you won’t have a referee for the second half.” Being an umpire or ref at any level of sport seems a thankless task. But watching my son’s 15-year-old referee defuse the tension that day made me wonder: are there techniques officials use to control a match, and discipline unruly players (and spectators), that parents would benefit from adopting? Can tactics employed by Premier League referees to control stroppy millionaire players also work on the stroppy children over whom we are forced to officiate every day? Mike Riley is head of Professional Game Match Officials – which looks after all the Premier League’s match officials. He’s officiated for 13 stressful seasons in the top flight, but his sense of humour is still very much in evidence as we discuss the mutual skills required for refereeing and parenting (Riley has an 18-year-old daughter whose passion is music, not football). “One of the key elements to being a successful official at this level is the ability to maintain professional detachment,” he says. “When I was refereeing, my wife would often complain: ‘You never get emotional on the pitch, but you do at home!’ Of course, with your own child you have that emotional involvement, whereas you train over a long time as a ref to stay detached in any situation. There again, if I’d shown more emotion on the pitch, perhaps I’d have had fewer rows at home …” Riley explains that the organisation employs two full-time psychologists to work closely with the Premier League officials, as well as helping referees all the way down the football pyramid. So what’s the trick for maintaining that sense of detachment when it’s all kicking off around you – on the pitch or in the playroom? “There are a lot of common principles in sport psychology,” he says. “For example, thought-stopping processes. Our referees learn to concentrate on what they can control, and ignore what they can’t. This helps to create that sense of professional detachment.” Sian Massey-Ellis is particularly well-placed to draw parallels between elite-level sports stars and children – as a Premier League assistant referee, longtime PE teacher, and mother of a two-year-old. She advises that the secret to staying calm in all situations is “to focus on your next decision; don’t keep thinking about your last one. With players, it’s about knowing when to walk away from a conversation – and as a parent, that’s important too sometimes.” According to Massey-Ellis, her parenting, teaching and refereeing experiences complement each other very well. “During matches, you’re working with different personalities in different ways – you get the player who wants to be your best friend, and the player who doesn’t want to talk to you for the entire game. It’s the same with teaching: you have those children in the classroom for whom you need eyes in the back of your head!” I can’t resist asking whether today’s ever-more pampered footballers bear any resemblance to spoilt children. But Riley is quick to counter the suggestion that on-pitch behaviour is getting worse because of all the money and attention thrown at today’s players. “In the classroom, you aren’t being scrutinised by the world’s media. On the field of play you’ve got up to 30 cameras, so people have a view of every element of your behaviour. It’s a passionate sport played at 100mph – and yet the behaviour is usually very good. I think players ought to get a lot of credit for that.” Tom Webb is an academic based at the University of Portsmouth who has researched referees and umpires in different sports and is author of Elite Soccer Referees. He has a nine-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter and says he is “definitely aware of the crossover” between officiating and parenting. “Children and players in all sports are reading you all the time, trying to gain an advantage. As a parent, if you are uncertain in your decision-making, that can make things harder. Similarly, if a referee has any doubts about a decision, then players – certainly at the elite level – will know and take advantage.” He adds: “If a player commits an offence, they must know what the outcome is going to be. That’s not dissimilar to how you behave as a parent: the child has to know what the consequence of their action is.” Alison Hughes, Britain’s most experienced tennis umpire, credits her parents for the advice that keeps her cool in the most stressful match situations. “Mum and Dad always told me: ‘Take three deep breaths before you make a decision.’ They brought me up to be respectful and have good manners – and I hope that comes across when I’m in the chair. If you respect the players, I think they will respect you in return. Good communication is vital.” Hughes, a veteran of many grand slam finals, offers other lessons from the umpire’s chair that could apply to parents. “Don’t think about what might be about to happen when you make a decision – that puts extra pressure on yourself. And if someone gets into an argument with you, try to remember it’s nothing personal. The players are passionate about something they love – in that respect, it’s just like dealing with a child.” Massey-Ellis shares Hughes’s view about the importance of communication, at work and at home. “On the pitch,” she says, “I’ve got to be clear about what I’m saying and what decisions I’m making, and communicate that with the players. Then at home, it’s ‘How do I communicate with a toddler?’ In both cases it’s not just verbal explaining: body language and eye contact are really important too.” According to Mike Riley, who spends a lot of time listening in on the conversations of Premier League officials: “No matter how many games you go to, or how many games you watch on TV, you never fully understand the amount of communication that goes on on a pitch. Referees and players are in constant dialogue – and the vast majority of those conversations are really positive. That’s how you build a common understanding and respect for each other.” It’s all about setting boundaries, Riley says: “Our job as match officials is to take the laws of the game, with their clear boundaries, then apply them in any circumstances that gets the respect of both sets of players – in much the same way as parenting. “As parents, you set out with a way you want to bring your children up – but then in any set of circumstances, your boundaries have to move slightly. And that’s the skill of refereeing: no two matches are the same, no two situations are the same. But you want boundaries that players respect, because that makes your job easier.” Webb concedes that referees have certain advantages over parents. “At least with match officials, they’ve got a clear set of codes as guidance,” he observes. “As parents, we don’t have that. You’ll sometimes think: ‘How do I put that across without sounding too authoritarian, and keeping the children onside?’ But really, that’s what referees are trying to do as well.” • The Premier League’s Primary Stars programme is available to every primary school in England and Wales, for girls and boys aged 5-11 in the classroom, the playground and on the sports field"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/02/the-middle-class-who-got-rich-on-peps-and-isas","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T18:36:54Z","webTitle":"The middle class who got rich on Peps and Isas | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/02/the-middle-class-who-got-rich-on-peps-and-isas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/02/the-middle-class-who-got-rich-on-peps-and-isas","fields":{"headline":"The middle class who got rich on Peps and Isas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Your year-end editorial exploring the iniquities of a society increasingly characterised by a growing new class of rentiers is timely (Redistribute the gains now hoarded by owners of capital, 30 December) but fails to name a single concrete measure that will effectively halt and reverse the trend. In this you are far from alone, as even John McDonnell shows not the slightest sign of grasping how the UK tax system has been stealthily tilted to create a tax haven for owners of capital under the falsehoods of “encouraging saving” and “taking the low paid out of tax”. Here is how it works: anyone who has taken up the annual personal equity plan (Pep) and then individual savings account (Isa) allowance every year from its inception under Nigel Lawson at £2,400 in 1988 to £20,000 under Philip Hammond today will have accumulated, assuming an extremely conservative average total return of 5% pa, a completely tax-free investment portfolio of £508,000 today, which will yield an annual tax-free income of over £25,000 pa without having put any of this capital at substantial risk of loss through real risk capital investment in start-up businesses or volatile emerging markets. When combined with a personal allowance of £11,500 and a standard rate of tax on taxable income up to £33,500, this means it is easy for a middle-class taxpayer in their late 50s to enjoy a gross income, all from onshore and legitimate sources, exceeding £100,000 pa and still not even incur an effective 20% tax rate on total income. To add to this feather-bedded luxury, the same taxpayer is likely to have benefited from tax relief on occupational pension contributions – despite the middle-class squeals of having been robbed of higher pensions by the taxman and pension fund managers – and can not only pass on windfall gains on property largely tax-free to children, but unspent tax-sheltered pension pots too. It is no wonder the OECD has previously said the UK enjoys many of the characteristics of a tax haven. Stemming the growth of this new rentier class will require abolition of these wholly unwarranted tax-free investment schemes, which all the evidence shows merely divert savings that would be made by those with surplus income anyway into tax-sheltered schemes, plus more radical taxation of land value. This will cause squeals of pain and moral outrage from those who want to politically divide the society into “good” savers and an “undeserving” poor, but is the only way to break the poisonous economic division that has become entrenched in UK society since Nigel Lawson’s social wrecking budget of 1988.

It ticked every box for fans of the venerable space saga, without ever really pushing the envelope; a movie that eventually made the Kessel Run, but 40 years or so after Han Solo and Chewie had already achieved that legendary feat. The Last Jedi, like Spider-Man: Homecoming, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 and Wonder Woman before it in 2017, proved that Hollywood probably has the tools and talent to keep churning out episodic blockbuster fantasy until at least 2050. To complain at this state of affairs would be churlish, especially when studios are delivering substandard and ill-considered material such as Justice League. But it does feel as if the Hollywood zeitgeist has crystallised in recent times, and we are in an era of fabulously made yet increasingly homogenous Marvel and Star Wars flicks that leave us only semi satisfied. Perhaps this is why the year’s greatest celluloid treasure, Blade Runner 2049, failed to gain traction with modern audiences who had perhaps never seen anything like it. In that spirit, here’s a guide to upcoming films that might just move things on this year. Sequels, remakes and mega-franchise fare are therefore largely banned as we go looking for the films with the best chance of leading us into a brave new world of sci-fi and fantasy in 2018. First up is Alex Garland’s Annihilation, due out in February, which would merit a place solely because the British film-maker’s last effort, Ex Machina, was a singular example of a cerebral, gripping futuristic think piece. Annihilation’s premise, on the face of it, is not all that exceptional, with Garland adapting Jeff VanderMeer’s novel about a biologist (Natalie Portman) who heads into an environmental disaster zone in search of answers after her soldier husband (Oscar Isaac) returns alone injured and close to death from a mission there. A quick dip into the book, however, suggests a discombobulating trip into the heart of darkness, where unknown, unearthly horrors lurk. Could Garland’s movie be the Alien on Earth movie we were promised as far back as 1992, but have so far never got to see? Garland has perhaps taken the mantle of Duncan Jones as the coming man of sci-fi. After the disaster that was Jones’ adaptation of World of Warcraft, the Moon director is returning to more intimate territory with the futuristic mystery thriller Mute. Described as a “spiritual successor” to Moon, it is also said to be inspired by the original Blade Runner, which can never be a bad thing and might sate the appetites of those of us longing for yet more mesmeric visions of the android-strewn dystopian future. Word is that Sam Rockwell will return as Moon’s Sam Bell (or perhaps one of his clones) but the main storyline centres on a mute bartender with a violent past (Alexander Skarsgård) searching for his lost lover in mid 21st-century Berlin. Next up is Captive State, in August, from Rise of the Planet of the Apes’ Rupert Wyatt, the British director’s first science fiction movie since leaving the man-versus-simians saga. With a budget of just $25m, it will be fascinating to see how Wyatt delivers a story set 10 years after an alien invasion of Chicago. Neill Blomkamp’s District 9 was shot for $30m in 2009, while Gareth Edwards completed Monsters a year later for $500,000, so it can be done. Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, due out in March, has the unenviable task of trying to convince us to get excited all over again about virtual reality worlds, the best part of two decades after The Matrix gave us the definitive inner digital wonderland on the big screen. Based on Ernest Cline’s hugely popular novel, early trailers suggest this means swapping out Trinity, Morpheus et al for pop culture stalwarts such as Freddy Krueger, Lord of the Rings orcs, The Iron Giant and Deadpool, which all seems a little corporate. And yet if anyone is due a late-career renaissance it is Spielberg. If he proves he can still cut it in this realm, others will surely follow the three-time Oscar-winner back down the digital rabbit hole. On to another long-lost subgenre: steampunk. Not since Chris Weitz’s ill-fated The Golden Compass a decade ago have we seen a memorable big budget example of the mode in cinemas, unless one counts Martin Scorsese’s splendid Hugo. Is it time for a renaissance? If so, Christian Rivers’ Mortal Engines, about a world in which technology has regressed to Victorian levels and wheel-mounted carnivorous cities chase each other across the plains might be the answer. Based on an adaptation of Philip Reeve’s post-apocalyptic novel by the Lord of the Rings team of Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Peter Jackson, it stars Irish actor Robert Sheehan alongside Rings alumnus Hugo Weaving. Avatar’s Stephen Lang plays the film’s main baddie, a murderous cyborg known as Shrike, and there are three more books in Reeve’s series if audiences get a taste for this future-retro blend. Finally,only only one superhero flick looks like it will break new ground: 20th Century Fox’s The New Mutants. With a fine cast including The Witch’s Anya Taylor-Joy and Game of Thrones’ Maisie Williams, Josh Boone’s comic book tale will dip its toe into the resurgent horror genre. It’s set in a secret facility where several future X-Men types find themselves imprisoned and in imminent danger, and is being talked up as the first in a potential trilogy. With Deadpool and Logan emerged as two of the livelier comic book entries of the past few years, it seems that Fox is finally carving out a place for the X-Men at the more mature end of the superhero spectrum. If we have any hope that 2018 will mark the beginning of a new era in fantasy film-making, this could be a very welcome mutation indeed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/03/inside-no-9-review-steve-pemberton-reece-shearsmith","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Inside No 9 review – a gleeful dismemberment of Shakespearean farce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/03/inside-no-9-review-steve-pemberton-reece-shearsmith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/03/inside-no-9-review-steve-pemberton-reece-shearsmith","fields":{"headline":"Inside No 9 review – a gleeful dismemberment of Shakespearean farce","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Like a selection box you have lost the little paper menu for, Inside No 9 (BBC Two) is full of surprises. Behind every shiny wrapper is a new take on an old genre, and no two are alike. One minute, writers and stars Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are clowning around, giving it the full spinning bow tie, the next they’re scaring the life out of you or plumbing the depths of utter turpitude. Or just skilfully and cruelly breaking your heart, as they did in series two’s astonishing episode, The 12 Days of Christine: still one of the finest half-hours of television ever made. Seek it out. I approach every series with the same gluttony I do the festive chocolates, but also the apprehension that one of the lovely packages will contain a severed thumb. They do love to pick at the frayed edges of humanity and yank mercilessly on the thread. This time, they begin with a deft party trick of an episode, in which the pair toy with Shakespeare’s verse and narrative tropes. The mix of a Comedy of Errors-style plot, a bit of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, some Macbeth, a dash of Hamlet and large hammy helpings of high farce is very silly and extremely good fun. And not at all as easy as they make it look. Rory Kinnear plays identical twins who unwittingly check into the Hotel Zanzibar (floor nine, of course) on the same day, one being pursued by a murderous protection officer (Shearsmith), the other with his unhappy girlfriend (Hattie Morahan). Jaygann Ayeh is the accommodating bell-hop-cum-narrator who can procure his wealthy guests anything, from bespoke baked goods to specialist sex services. Helen Monks is Colette, the cheeky chambermaid whose efforts to help the above-mentioned lovelorn Morahan go awry when a hypnotism (standing in here for A Midsummer Night’s Dream-style love juice) backfires and causes her to fall in love with the wrong man. Kevin Eldon makes a delicious cameo as the mesmerist. Every trick in Shakespeare’s armoury is deployed, including mistaken identity, a murderous plot complete with “Now might I do it” malevolent monologue-ing and the eventual making of amends all round. It is so enjoyably far-fetched and encompasses tragedy, comedy and resolution in 30 packed minutes. Kinnear, particularly, is having a splendid time as a louche member of the royal family with a specific taste in erotic relief, and Ayeh holds the whole thing together nicely, setting the tone at the start so you’re in no doubt as to how much salt to take this with. Show me another current writing duo who would attempt high farce in iambic pentameter. On television! You might think them smug; a couple of show-offs with clever winks at the audience. But I just sit back and wonder at the restless, resourceful brains that keep coming up with this stuff. Shearsmith and Pemberton are like two school boys prodding at a dead frog; inquisitive but also a bit sick. They can rarely hide their glee at taking apart another variety of story. In a more gratuitous autopsy, Prince: Last Year of a Legend (Channel 4) takes us back to the events leading up to the music legend’s death, aged 57, in April 2016. Without mobile phone footage, this documentary would have very little to go on, and the producers are lucky so many of Prince’s fans ignored his direction not to film performances. Some of the amateur footage gives glimpses of his spontaneous generosity, such as his hastily organised peace rally in Baltimore after the 2015 riots. However, even someone with a passing awareness of Prince’s work may have been put off this doc by the opening, in which Zawe Ashton’s voiceover informs us: “Prince could sing, dance and play all the instruments on his songs.” We could have skipped this thudding exposition and moved straight on to the memories. After a bit more stating of the bleeding obvious, we have some interesting material about the private man behind the jaw-dropping stage shows. The interviews with former collaborators, lovers and friends painted a picture of someone moving into a new phase of his career. He had begun his first tour without a band just a few months before the fatal overdose of painkillers that so suddenly took him. What began as prosaic ended up close to poetry when the fans, and Prince himself, were given the space to speak."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
