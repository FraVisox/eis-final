On the second day, while we were out walking with only minimal belongings, our hotel was engulfed by a huge forest fire. We were unable to return as the police had closed the roads, or to contact the hotel by phone (the line was down). We managed to get through to the hotel group headquarters in Madrid, which told us to go to another hotel. They were unable to say if our luggage had survived the fire, and our plans had to change significantly. As we had nothing with us we had to buy essentials – underwear, hairbrush, phone charger. After three days we got our smoky and dirty, but unharmed, luggage back. We tried to reclaim the £167 extra costs from our travel insurer Allianz’s Gold policy, but it says we do not have a claim and there is no point. If our luggage had been delayed by an airline it would have paid out apparently. AH, by email Given that forest fires have become a common sight in Europe over the last few summers, you might think insurers would have revised their policies accordingly. Allianz’s policy terms and conditions do not include an obvious way for you to claim. However, a bit of common sense could have prevailed. Insurers now appear to automatically deny claims unless the circumstances fit a strictly pre-defined set of events. Happily, Allianz now says it will look at paying your pretty modest claim. “We should have made it clearer that the claim for essential items will be considered as a gesture of goodwill upon receipt of a claims form and original receipts,” it says.

Its contention was that there was a malignant force in the universe, undermining humanity at every turn, which the authors attempted to delineate using a variety of sources. It was said that The Dark Gods influenced the Stranglers in the making of their 1981 concept album The Gospel According to the Meninblack. Geoff was born in Pembury, Kent, and educated at Berkhamsted school, Hertfordshire. His father, John, a linguist who spoke more than 30 German dialects, had served at Bletchley Park during the second world war. He died early and Geoff and his two older sisters, Isolde and Mary, and his twin sister, Jill, were brought up by their mother, Nanette (nee Ponder), who struggled with a debilitating physical condition. When Geoff “dropped out” and became a hippy, he was considered the black sheep of the family. But to his young nephews, he was the embodiment of an alternative lifestyle, doing things on his own terms. He was always travelling and lived all over the UK and at one point in France. Geoff blamed the illness that dogged his later years on the writing of The Dark Gods, telling friends he came under sustained psychic attack after its publication. He had a minor breakdown, and spent time recuperating in a monastery. Later he told people he no longer believed many of the things he had written. In the 90s he became a website designer and was also involved at Megatripolis, the underground London nightclub that flourished at the height of the rave era. There was something vulnerable about Geoff; he was always in love with someone, and would often find himself being ripped off. One friend described him as being entirely devoid of protective armour. After a major breakdown he ended up in a psychiatric hospital in London, after being found vagrant in France. He became infantilised and spoke in a strange, high-pitched voice. When Geoff was diagnosed with cancer, in 2016, he declined treatment, saying, “Well I’ve got to go some time.”He remained cheerful, visiting a friend’s house days before his death and offering to help her carry her bags up the stairs. He is survived by Isolde."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/10/better-watch-out-review-like-malicious-spin-on-home-alone-levi-miller","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Better Watch Out review – like a malicious spin on Home Alone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/10/better-watch-out-review-like-malicious-spin-on-home-alone-levi-miller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/10/better-watch-out-review-like-malicious-spin-on-home-alone-levi-miller","fields":{"headline":"Better Watch Out review – like a malicious spin on Home Alone","bodyText":"A Yule-themed comedy horror that is neither funny, nor particularly horrifying, Better Watch Out feels like a malicious spin on Home Alone.

Since the 26 November vote, at least 11 people have died in clashes with security forces, and tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest over an electoral process marked by suspicious delays, inexplicable irregularities – and opposition claims that the ruling party is trying to steal the election. The standoff pits the opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla against the rightwing incumbent, Juan Orlando Hernández, but Hondurans say the race isn’t just about who will run the country for the next four years. For many, what is at stake is the credibility of Honduran democracy, which is still reeling from a 2009 military coup against the populist president Manuel Zelaya. The political turmoil will probably have far-reaching consequences, and the United States, which wields considerable influence in the country, shares some responsibility for creating the political landscape that laid the ground for the crisis. “Many countries around the world are struggling with building representative democracies and fighting against corruption and crime,” said Eric Olson, the director of the Latin American Program at the Wilson Center. “Honduras is definitely one of these, and what happens there will offer the world some important lessons. So far, the lessons have been more of the painful variety: the kinds of crisis and violence that can emerge when transparency is undermined to guarantee political favour.” As well as calling for an end to the electoral crisis, Honduran protesters have expressed outrage over a string of scandals including the murder of the environmental activist Berta Cáceres, the pilfering of the country’s social security agency and allegations that associates of Hernández are involved in the drug trade. Protesters often describe Hernández’s bid for re-election as an unconstitutional power grab – a charge given added irony by the fact that the current president justified the 2009 coup because of questionable allegations that Zelaya was plotting to seek re-election. After his election in 2013, Hernández changed the constitution to eliminate term limits. Shortly after the coup, the US froze aid to the Honduran government, but it was restored shortly thereafter, and Hernández has enjoyed continuing support from Washington. And whatever happens with elections will have direct implications for the US, said Adam Isacson, senior program associate at the Washington Office on Latin America. “Americans should care about the current chaos in Honduras because of cocaine and migrants,” he said. “After the 2009 coup, the government essentially stopped functioning in rural areas where organized crime took hold and cocaine shipments started arriving in larger numbers. This prompted even more US anti-drug assistance. Then, as institutions hollowed out and became corrupted, gang activity increased and the United States got a wave of migrants. An unstable Honduras will mean more of this.” Honduras has long been a strategic partner for Washington: since 2009, the US has invested nearly $114m in security assistance to establish elite military and police units, ratchet up border security, and carry out counternarcotics operations as part of Hernández’s crackdown on gangs. All this has considerably broadened the military’s influence. While the security push appeared to cut Honduras’s murder rate in half, the country still ranks among the most violent places in the world and remains a key corridor for drug smuggling to the US. And despite corruption scandals implicating the government, Hernández is still regarded as a reliable US ally. But the US government has barely commented on the current crisis, beyond a few embassy statements praising a partial recount and “lamenting” the violence. The US Democratic senator Patrick Leahy said he had yet to receive information he had requested from the US embassy in Tegucigalpa about the electoral irregularities and the violence that followed. “This lack of responsiveness in such a time of crisis is troubling,” he said. A way out of the current impasse remains unclear. Negotiations over a possible recount have dragged on for days, and some opposition leaders have even called for a new runoff election. Despite the crisis, however, Reuters reported this week that the US had quietly certified Honduras for making progress in fighting corruption and improving human rights, freeing up millions in US assistance. As one of the US’s closest allies in Central America, Honduras will probably serve as a litmus test for how the US will treat other allies with similar stained reputations. “The certification and the weak embassy statements so far tell us how low a priority democracy and human rights are on this administration’s list of US interests,” said Isacson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/06/iter-nuclear-fusion-project-reaches-key-halfway-milestone","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T17:00:22Z","webTitle":"Iter nuclear fusion project reaches key halfway milestone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/06/iter-nuclear-fusion-project-reaches-key-halfway-milestone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/06/iter-nuclear-fusion-project-reaches-key-halfway-milestone","fields":{"headline":"Iter nuclear fusion project reaches key halfway milestone","bodyText":"An international project to generate energy from nuclear fusion has reached a key milestone, with half of the infrastructure required now built. Bernard Bigot, the director-general of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter), the main facility of which is based in southern France, said the completion of half of the project meant the effort was back on track, after a series of difficulties. This would mean that power could be produced from the experimental site from 2025. The effort to bring nuclear fusion power closer to operation is backed by some of the world’s biggest developed and emerging economies, including the EU, the US, China, India, Japan, Korea and Russia. However, a review of the long-running project in 2013 found problems with its running and organisation. This led to the appointment of Bigot, and a reorganisation that subsequent reviews have broadly endorsed. Fusion power is one of the most sought-after technological goals in the pursuit of clean energy. Nuclear fusion is the natural phenomenon that powers the sun, converting hydrogen into helium atoms through a process that occurs at extreme temperatures. Replicating that process on earth at sufficient scale could unleash more energy than is likely to be needed by humanity, but the problem is creating the extreme conditions necessary for such reactions to occur, harnessing the resulting energy in a useful way, and controlling the reactions once they have been induced. For these reasons, fusion power was long ago abandoned by nuclear physicists as a potential source of commercial energy in favour of fission reactors, using processes by which radioactive materials release energy as they are induced to decay. The Iter project aims to use hydrogen fusion, controlled by large superconducting magnets, to produce massive heat energy which would drive turbines – in a similar way to the coal-fired and gas-fired power stations of today – that would produce electricity. This would produce power free from carbon emissions, and potentially at low cost, if the technology can be made to work at a large scale. For instance, according to Iter scientists, an amount of hydrogen the size of a pineapple could be used to produce as much energy as 10,000 tonnes of coal. However, while fusion has been the subject of intermittent scientific research projects since the 1940s, no means has yet been found to make it work in controllable conditions at the scale needed to produce the power of a fossil fuel power station. The extreme conditions driving the sun require temperatures of millions of degrees, and mimicking those conditions has proved elusive. Iter has been described as the most complex scientific endeavour in human history. The project requires hydrogen plasma to be heated to 150 million C – 10 times hotter than at the sun’s core. A doughnut-shaped reactor called a tokamak would be surrounded by giant magnets that take the superheated plasma away from the metal walls of the container. This requires the magnets to be cooled to -269C. Getting to this stage of the project has already required remarkable feats of engineering, such as the manufacturer of more than 100,000km of niobium-tin superconducting strands of metal, produced by nine suppliers over seven years, to make the magnets. Bigot said the milestone of building half of the project indicated that the rest of the project was now technically feasible. However, there are still political difficulties. One is that US president Donald Trump’s administration is notably cooler on clean energy research than its predecessor, and the US budgetary contribution, of nearly 10%, or more than $1bn, is now partially in doubt. The EU is providing 45% of the cost of the project, with the rest provided by the other main partners. Bigot, currently in Washington DC holding meetings to try to break the impasse, told the Guardian he was confident the conflict could be resolved. He said the project was on track to reach “first plasma” in December 2025, proving the concept. If successful, the Iter machine would produce 500MW of power, enough to study a self-heating plasma, which has never been produced in a controlled way on earth. That could in turn lead to the development of power plants to harness the energy produced. Google is also now working on fusion power, in the first major private sector try-out of the technology. This summer, the internet giant announced it had formed a partnership with Tri Alpha Energy, backed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, to generate new computer algorithms that could help test the concepts behind nuclear fusion engineering efforts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/10/the-dinner-review-disappointingly-distracted-drama-richard-gere-steve-coogan-laura-linney","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T07:59:30Z","webTitle":"The Dinner review – disappointingly distracted drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/10/the-dinner-review-disappointingly-distracted-drama-richard-gere-steve-coogan-laura-linney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/10/the-dinner-review-disappointingly-distracted-drama-richard-gere-steve-coogan-laura-linney","fields":{"headline":"The Dinner review – disappointingly distracted drama","bodyText":"An absolutely first-rate cast is cut adrift in a sea of laboured, overwritten dialogue in this disappointing drama. Adapted by director Oren Moverman (Oscar-nominated for the screenplay of The Messenger) from a novel by Herman Koch, the film is laboured and theatrical to the point of indigestion. The dinner itself is crisply toxic – a tense meeting between political rising star Stan Lohman (Richard Gere) and his virtually estranged brother, Paul (Steve Coogan), and their respective wives, Katelyn (Rebecca Hall) and Claire (Laura Linney). The fawning of the staff only serves to heighten the tensions at the table as they skirt around the subject they need to discuss – the violent crime committed by their children. If the focus had remained in the restaurant, as a savage four-hander, it might have been more potent. But the film is diluted by indulgent flashbacks both to the crime and, somewhat redundantly, to Stan and Paul taking a trip to Gettysburg. A story strand that explores Paul’s deteriorating mental health gives Coogan the chance to stretch his legs into a challenging role, but slows an already plodding story to a near standstill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/06/late-night-tv-hosts-roy-moore-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T16:47:39Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts on Trump's 'morally degenerate' support of Roy Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/06/late-night-tv-hosts-roy-moore-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/06/late-night-tv-hosts-roy-moore-trump","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts on Trump's 'morally degenerate' support of Roy Moore","bodyText":"Late-night hosts discussed the increased Republican support of Roy Moore, including from the president himself. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert brought up Donald Trump’s vocal support of Moore. The president has stressed the importance of having a Republican over a Democrat in the Senate, regardless of the sexual misconduct allegations. In response, Moore tweeted that he wants to help Trump #MAGA. Colbert quipped: “Of course, that’s the sound teenage girls make when they see Roy Moore at the mall.” Further allegations of impropriety emerged this week as a woman came forward to prove Moore dated her when he was 34 and she was 17, “or, as Roy Moore called her, a mature honey”, Colbert said. She released a letter from Moore, and stated that she remembers dating him when her braces had been taken off. “Roy Moore would never date someone young enough to wear braces,” Colbert said. “He’s more of a retainer man.” One of Moore’s supporters appeared on CNN to say that not enough time is being spent thinking about the women who haven’t accused Moore of any wrongdoing. “Everyone was so quick to call Jeffrey Dahmer a serial killer and a cannibal – but we forget about all the people he didn’t eat,” Colbert joked. But not all Republicans have continued to support Moore, and on Tuesday Senator Jeff Flake tweeted an image of a check that he was sending to Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones. “Wow, I can’t believe that,” he said. “Someone still uses checks. Remind me not to get behind Jeff Flake at the grocery store.” On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah questioned what kind of “morally degenerate” person would support someone like Roy Moore. Noah quickly answered his question with news reports of Trump coming forward to endorse him. In a tweet aimed at Moore, Trump said “Go get ’em, Roy” to which Noah replied: “I feel like that’s the one thing you don’t want to say to a man who chases young girls.” Noah then unveiled a rather strange analogy comparing Trump to the sado-masochistic character from Fifty Shades of Grey. “You know what I realized?” he said. “I realized that essentially Donald Trump has set the Republican party free. He’s basically their Christian Grey, that’s what he is. He’s the playboy billionaire who came along and said, ‘I’m going to show you Republicans who you really are deep down on the inside’.” On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host decided to look at Rick Perry, Trump’s controversial choice to head up the department of energy. Meyers first went back to find footage of Trump criticizing Perry, who was not a fan of the ex-reality star. “The list of reasons to dislike Trump is long, I know,” he said. “But I’m going to add the laziness of his impressions.” Meyers then went back through the archives to find examples of Perry’s many gaffes, including a presidential debate where he forgot the name of a department he wanted to destroy. “That should have been the last time anyone saw Rick Perry,” he said. “Once you Bill-Buckner a debate like that, you should be the answer to a trivia question at best.” Reports suggest that Perry took on the job, thinking he would be a global ambassador for the US oil industry but was surprised to hear what it actually entailed. “Imagine finding out after you accepted a job, that the job description included managing nuclear weapons,” Meyers said. “I got pissed when I found out mine included animal segments.” It’s been alleged that Perry’s decisions in the role have been affected by his desire to help Trump backer and “litigious coal tycoon” Bob Murray, whose business depends on such support. “Imagine finding out your whole livelihood came down to Rick Perry,” he said. “It’s like when the Vietnam war came down to Forrest Gump.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/10/gorillaz-live-review-last-night-humanz-tour-damon-albarn","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T09:00:31Z","webTitle":"Gorillaz review – all stars blurred into one","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/10/gorillaz-live-review-last-night-humanz-tour-damon-albarn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/10/gorillaz-live-review-last-night-humanz-tour-damon-albarn","fields":{"headline":"Gorillaz review – all stars blurred into one","bodyText":"The last night of a tour often has a reckless, demob flavour to it, and the denouement to Gorillaz’s live rendering of Humanz – an album already cast as “a party for the end of the world” – is no exception. During an all-star rendition of We Got the Power, Blur guitarist Graham Coxon tosses his guitar high into the air, narrowly avoiding clouting Noel Gallagher, inches away from him. Albarn and his former Oasis arch-rival have been pals for some time, of course – abetted, perhaps, by their shared guitarist, Jeff Wootton, a manic mohicanned presence at the right of the stage tonight. But the frisson of seeing bits of Oasis and Blur plying their wares in unison on the “Hollywood ending” – as Albarn has called it – from Humanz’s “dark dystopian fantasy” remains just one of the many draws of this monumental live undertaking. (A Liam-esque Murdoc occasionally glares down from above.) As two drummers, six gospel singers, a string section, two keyboard players and a core band grind it out on stage, you can only imagine the watercooler moments going on backstage: The Selecter’s Pauline Black potentially gargling prosecco with MC Little Simz, arguably the star of the night with her Garage Palace; Gallagher trading witticisms with Shaun Ryder (later on Dare), as the American hip-hop contingent compare notes across coasts and generations. De La Soul are tour mainstays, as is 2017 man of the moment Vince Staples. The latter is on savage form on Ascension, one of the more explicitly political songs tonight. “This the land of the free,” Staples rhymes of the US, “where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap/ Where you can live your dreams as long as you don’t look like me.” Ice-cold former Clipse rapper Pusha T is equally coruscating on the doom-laden Let Me Out, assisted by Mavis Staples on the big screen. With a Kanye-produced album on the way, Pusha is now also a record company exec, who might be in a position to get Chicago’s Hypnotic Brass Ensemble on to a project. Not long after Coxon throws caution to the wind, Albarn goes walkabout in the crowd on the menacing oldie Kids With Guns. Performers can safely slap some arena palm from the shelter of the photographer’s pit, but the sweaty Albarn goes through the middle of the standing crush – a level of fluid exchange rare with stars of this magnitude. Here, the frontman is Damon-from-Blur, who emerged from Britpop as a renaissance man, juggling bands (there is another the Good, the Bad and the Queen album in the works), operas about medieval magicians and Chinese monkeys, and collaborative west African supergroups. If anything, tonight’s huge rotating cast recalls Albarn’s Africa Express live free-for-alls, with Albarn frequently on keytars and haunting 2 Tone-era melodica. To the rest of the world, however, Albarn is the mastermind behind a cartoon conceit that hit the US hard. In their primary guise, Gorillaz – drawn by Jamie Hewlett – began as a dystopian squad whose pointedly mixed ethnicities and genders, and engrossing visual universe, appealed to multiple sectors of the listening public. (Another ensemble graphic undertaking, the reinvigorated Marvel Universe films, was not far away.) Avatars allowed Albarn – a white guy from Colchester – to make hip-hop and funk without being sneered at. It helped immensely that they could summon huge names (Snoop Dogg, passim) and cult figures to front the songs, and that Gorillaz’s tunes were often monstrous. Stylo, from 2010’s Plastic Beach, is reliably gargantuan, with veteran dance music vocalist Peven Everett bawling in the late Bobby Womack’s stead. Humanz marked the reunion of Albarn and Hewlett after a bromantic bust-up and, if there is one downside to this otherwise triumphal night out, it is that the visual side of Gorillaz is strong, but somehow underwhelming. New-ish pixelated versions of 2D, Murdoc, Noodle and Russel appear on a tilting disc overhead. But as stunning as Hewlett’s animations are, projecting videos on screens is commonplace nowadays. You do wonder why Hewlett doesn’t even get to play the triangle, or take a bow, in this vast rogues’ gallery of creativity. Tonight, in a massive set that spans lesser-heard moments from their four albums and bangers, it’s the funk that really stuns. The magnificent Strobelite is one of the tracks that travels the furthest from Colchester. Featuring Albarn on the melodica, and lines like “Are we obsidian?” delivered in the soulful tones of Everett, it rocks the house."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/10/lin-manuel-miranda-hamilton-is-an-insane-idea-london-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T09:00:31Z","webTitle":"Lin-Manuel Miranda: ‘Hamilton is an insane idea, but the story works’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/10/lin-manuel-miranda-hamilton-is-an-insane-idea-london-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/10/lin-manuel-miranda-hamilton-is-an-insane-idea-london-trump","fields":{"headline":"Lin-Manuel Miranda: ‘Hamilton is an insane idea, but the story works’","bodyText":"Lin-Manuel Miranda, the America-born, Puerto Rico-infused lyricist-performer-megastar, has a deep streak of Anglophilia. This reveals itself most conspicuously in his fondness for quoting Monty Python and The Office. On one of his first trips to Britain, he landed at Heathrow and had his driver take him directly to Slough, so that he could pay homage to the milieu that inspired Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. So when Hamilton, the musical he created and starred in, began doing well off Broadway in 2015, Miranda’s mind drifted beyond the inevitable Broadway transfer to whether it might play in London one day. There was a problem though, a couple really. The show was a telling of the life and times of Alexander Hamilton, a bureaucrat in the second half of the 18th century and one of the founding fathers of the United States. Would anyone over here care about his (admittedly juicy) travails? Even more, the only British character in the musical, which is performed mostly in rap verse, is George III, whom Miranda has written as a jumped-up, flamboyant fop. “Helen Mirren was one of the first people to see Hamilton,” recalls the 37-year-old Miranda, his voice urgent, conspiratorial. “She saw it very early and I said, ‘If we’re lucky enough to go to London, are they going to be bothered by King George?’ And she said, ‘Nahhh! We love it when you take the piss!’” Miranda cracks up. “So I’m not worried,” he goes on. “I’m excited.” Two years on, Hamilton is most definitely coming. Previews at the Victoria Palace theatre in London began on Wednesday, with the main run starting on 21 December. And the question now is not will British audiences be interested in a hip-hop reimagining of the birth of modern America? But, rather, is there any possible way that this cultural behemoth can live up to the hype? To start with the silverware: Hamilton has, to date, won 11 Tony awards, a Grammy for best musical theatre album and the 2016 Pulitzer prize for drama for Miranda’s writing; he has also been given a MacArthur “genius grant”. Somehow more telling, though, are the breathless testimonies from those who have seen the show. “I am loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit Broadway show,” wrote Ben Brantley in the New York Times. “But Hamilton… might just about be worth it.” Michelle Obama described it as “the best piece of art in any form I have ever seen in my life”. Miranda, meanwhile, is personally most gratified by Hamilton’s reach in other ways. He always wanted a multicultural cast and he is thrilled no one blinks an eye that the old and middle-aged white guys who created America are played by young black and Latino performers. He is also beyond pleased at the affirmation he has received from his musical heroes: last year, the Hamilton Mixtape was released and the contributors included Busta Rhymes, Alicia Keys, Queen Latifah and Usher. It’s not easy to find negative notices for Hamilton, but there are some. In November 2016, the president-elect Donald Trump described it as “highly overrated”. He hadn’t actually seen the show, but was reacting in 140 characters to a story that had blown up when Vice-President Mike Pence attended a performance the week after the election. Pence was roundly booed as he took his seat and during the curtain call one of the actors read a speech written by Miranda, Hamilton’s director Thomas Kail, and Jeffrey Seller, the lead producer. Unusually for a theatre, a request was made for phones to be turned on, so the message could be circulated more widely. “We, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir,” the statement read. “But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.” Trump claimed the speech was “harassing” Pence; the vice-president, for his part, said that the jeers were “what freedom sounds like” and that he had enjoyed the show. Either way, it has become clear that Hamilton is much more than just a night at the theatre. When Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination for president, she lifted lines from the musical to finish her speech. After Trump’s victory, the historian Niall Ferguson asked whether the election was “a vote against Hamilton”. Hamilton is already a hit in London; the tickets were sold out almost instantly for the first run until June next year, though there is a daily lottery for £10 seats. But will we love it more than we love our own children? How desperate will people get to snaffle a ticket? If Miranda is feeling any pressure about the transfer, he isn’t showing it. On the morning we meet, in the offices of theatrical producer Cameron Mackintosh in Bloomsbury, he bounces into the room, wearing a T-shirt, jeans and running shoes, all blue. The ponytail and goatee he had on stage in New York have been clipped and it has the effect of making him look two centuries younger. Miranda is a prolific tweeter and he has provided regular updates on the new production since arriving in the UK in late November. After the first run-through, he wrote: “London, gird your heart. This company is not playing around.” A couple of days earlier, he gushed: “This company is so fuhuuucking good.” None of the cast is a household name: Jamael Westman, one of a pair of Alexander Hamiltons, graduated from Rada last year and this is just his fourth credit. “It’s a similar mix of vets and newcomers as we had in our original company on Broadway,” says Miranda, who has no plans to step into Hamilton’s blouse and breeches in this run. “I can’t wait for London audiences to get in front of this show. I’m curious how certain things will play: there’s a couple of New Jersey jokes and I’m like, ‘That’s going to be huge…’” Miranda rolls his eyes. “Right now, I’m really just faffing about! The director has a job to do, the music supervisor is making sure it sounds right and the choreographer is making sure it’s as precise as the other companies. And I’m like, ‘Hey, the show’s written!’ I’m giving notes here or there if I see something, but I’m basically like a proud grandparent.” Many of the reasons given now for Hamilton’s unimaginable success were, in advance, used as predictors for why it might sink without trace. When the show first opened in New York, Miranda and his team scrupulously avoided the description “hip-hop musical”. This was, in essence, because those two forms had never been credibly fused before. A musical based on the lyrics of Tupac Shakur, Holler If Ya Hear Me, had been a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it opening the previous year. Likewise, historical adaptations didn’t have a great precedent either: Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, a musical about the seventh US president, was critically approved in 2010 but only lasted four months. Hamilton, though, has become an umbrella for just about every niche interest. “People who don’t ordinarily like musicals can get in, because they are fans of hip-hop,” says Miranda. “Or because they are fans of history and we treat the history with respect, as much as a two-and-a-half-hour musical can. And there’s just as many Easter eggs for musical theatre fans as there are for hip-hop fans. For every Biggie or Mobb Deep quote, we’ve also got Rodgers and Hammerstein and Jason Robert Brown. “So it is my love letter to all of these things,” he continues. “You know, popular music and theatre music used to be friends, they used to be the same thing. And Hamilton is my attempt to do that by hook or by crook, wedging these things together.” Miranda believes that audiences respond to Hamilton for exactly the same reason he did. He was in Borders bookshop – that’s how long ago it was – looking for some holiday reading when he stumbled across Ron Chernow’s doorstop biography of Hamilton. “What I knew about Hamilton prior to picking up that book was that he was the dead white guy on the 10,” says Miranda, referring to the $10 bill. “I knew his son had died in a duel and he died in a duel. I think that’s what took it off the shelf and into my hand, because I’d written a paper on that in high school. But I didn’t know he was born in Nevis, I didn’t know he grew up in the Caribbean. I didn’t know his Dickensian childhood; it sort of out-Dickens Dickens. Then I got to the part where he writes about a hurricane that destroys his island and they take up a collection to get him his education on the mainland. I just thought, ‘He’s a hip-hop artist.’ He’s a guy who writes about his struggle so well that he transcends it. And once I had that insight, it kept proving me right.” As much as Miranda made the link to hip-hop, he also, reading the book on holiday in Mexico, floating in a lounger in the pool, began to see parallels with his own life. His father was born in Puerto Rico, but came to America in his late teens to study at New York University. He was smart and had a ferocious work ethic and he would become a special adviser on Hispanic affairs to Ed Koch, the Democrat mayor of New York for much of the 80s. Miranda’s mother came to America from Puerto Rico as a child and was a clinical psychologist. “I just recognised that guy,” says Miranda of Hamilton. “When you see Hamilton as an immigrant story, it becomes universal to me because I grew up in a largely immigrant neighbourhood in New York and we just knew the deal was: we have to work three times as hard. I don’t remember a time when my parents had less than three jobs each. That is just the immigrant story and in Hamilton’s case, he ends up shaping the nation. He gains the trust of George Washington and he ends up shaping our financial system, inventing the coast guard, creating the New York Post and a million other things. You could write five more musicals about that guy. It’s the classic bootstraps story.” From the beginning, Hamilton has had a political agenda if you scratch the surface. The first time Miranda performed any material from the musical in public was in May 2009, when he was asked by the Obamas to participate in an evening celebrating “the American experience” at the White House. When the approach was made, the expectation was that Miranda would sing something from his debut musical, In the Heights. This was a semi-autobiographical tale of growing up on a multicultural block in New York that had won four Tony awards, best musical among them. Instead, Miranda tried out “16 hot bars about Alexander Hamilton”. There’s YouTube evidence of the performance and it’s clear that Miranda, who’d never met the president before, is nervous; well, as nervous as Miranda ever gets, which is not especially. Still, in his introduction to the song, there’s more “ums” than usual and even a little stammering. When he explains the concept, people, including the Obamas, giggle, not sure if they should take him seriously. “Yeah, it was really scary and it’s a little bit like showing the ultrasound at five weeks,” says Miranda. “I had a lot of people look at me like I was crazy for a very long time. I mean, you can kind of see the reaction in miniature at the White House. I state what I’m going to do and everyone just laughs at me. And I go, ‘You laugh but it’s true!’ Just trying to keep my cool, because I’m also performing in front of the leader of the free world for the first time in my life. And then you see people get sucked into the story. Then their heads start bobbing. And that’s been the story of Hamilton: it’s been an insane idea but the story works. The story is compelling, it’s a human one. And yeah, that’s that.” For a piece of art that was “the musical of the Obama era”, according to the New Yorker, the Trump years were always going to present some challenges. The aftermath of the statement to Mike Pence was especially uncomfortable. “When the president sends a tweet he’s also sending trolls and bots your way,” says Miranda. “It is a way of targeting, so we had to deal with death threats for several weeks and we had to wait for that kerfuffle to blow over. So we lived through it. There was a bit of a pendulum swing, right; we were beloved by the Obama administration; we’re really not beloved by the current administration.” Did Miranda consider putting “Highly overrated: Donald Trump” on the Hamilton poster? “Haha!” he replies. “There are certainly those who would wear that with a badge of pride, but I would not trade it for the stress of those weeks. These are just not normal times. We have a president who targets people and goes after them and that’s really without precedent and scary, but that’s where we are.” Miranda, though, does not shy away from a fight, either. When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September, killing at least 500 people and destroying the electrical grid, he was furious at Trump for his inaction. While the president quickly offered reassurance and funds to Texas and Florida after the natural disasters that affected those states, he was much quieter about Puerto Rico, which is an unincorporated US territory. Nearly three months on, a third of the island remains without power. Miranda’s response was to tweet Trump: “You’re going straight to hell.” “What does that tell the people of Puerto Rico about the person who is supposedly in charge?” he asks. “Those are 3.5m American citizens. So that’s when the rhetoric is heartbreaking: you know relief could come with one signing of the pen and it’s just not. Because he doesn’t care.” Miranda, who has raised $2.5m for the relief effort from a charity song, also recently announced that he would be taking a production of Hamilton to Puerto Rico in early 2019. He did a similar tour in 2010 with In the Heights and it remains one of his proudest achievements. “I find it hard to talk about it without tearing up,” he says and it’s true, he looks like he might cry. “Growing up, I’d get sent to Puerto Rico for a month a year where I was the kid with a fucked-up Spanish accent who couldn’t really speak it well enough to hang with kids my age. I was like the weird exchange kid. I loved Puerto Rico, but I never felt at home with it. Then to have In the Heights be embraced in English, the way I wrote it, it closed some hole in me that I didn’t know was open.” These are manic, sometimes confounding times for Miranda. Hamilton took the best part of six years to write but now life seems to be happening in fast-forward. So far, he has only been accepting offers “that are just so bonkers that you’d kick yourself forever if you didn’t jump at the chance to do them”. These have included a pivotal cameo in the new season of Curb Your Enthusiasm and a six-month spell in London to shoot a lead role in Mary Poppins Returns, which will be released Christmas next year. The film is directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago) and stars Emily Blunt as the umbrella-wielding hero, as well as Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Ben Whishaw and Emily Mortimer. “Poppins was both incredibly hard work and sort of this joyous vacation,” says Miranda. “Because I had just been in Hamilton-mania in the States, it was starting to get to the point where I couldn’t ride the train without having a conversation about Hamilton. So the only sane response is to chop off all your hair and leave the country. I was really very anonymous here and that was a wonderful thing to reclaim, to ride the tube around and take my kid to Lady Di park. To sort of do normal things was wonderful, because it was getting weird. Like, famous-person weird.” This is just the tip of it. The Weinstein Company had optioned the film rights to In the Heights, so Miranda is endeavouring to extricate himself from that. (“So monstrous,” he says. “I met Harvey several times. I knew he was never going to win a nice-guy competition, but I didn’t know about all of this other stuff.”) Miranda’s first child, Sebastian, was born two weeks before rehearsals for Hamilton started in 2014 and he revealed last week that his wife Vanessa Nadal, a corporate lawyer, is expecting their second. He would also like to start work on a new musical, but he probably just needs to lie in a pool to figure out what the subject is. “You’re right,” he exclaims, “I should take more vacations, thank you! Yeah, that is the hardest lesson to take hold of: the good idea comes when you are walking your dog or in the shower or resting. And waking up from sleep. I don’t believe it’s an accident that on my first vacation from In the Heights, the best idea of my life shows up. So I have a couple of ideas, but I’m waiting to see which one grabs hold and doesn’t let go.” Until then, Miranda will keep on doing what he’s done every day since Hamilton opened in New York in early 2015: field requests for tickets for the show. In London, it is sure not to be any different. Miranda made some good friends here when he was filming Mary Poppins Returns – Whishaw and the chef Yotam Ottolenghi among them – and he is excited for them to see the show. Otherwise, there’s only so much he can do. “People tweeting me, ‘I can’t believe I paid $2,000,’” he says. “I didn’t charge you $2,000! I don’t know why you paid that.” What about the royal family? “Oh, I’ll give Prince Harry some engagement tickets, that would be an absolute treat,” Miranda smiles. “Obviously that would be an honour for us.” Let’s just hope he isn’t too offended by the portrayal of his great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather. Hamilton is in previews at the Victoria Palace theatre, London. Press night is 21 December, and the show is booking until 30 June 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/17/sara-pascoe-vegan-boyfriends-food-ethics-dieting","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T11:30:29Z","webTitle":"Sara Pascoe: ‘All my ex-boyfriends become vegan, and it’s really annoying’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/17/sara-pascoe-vegan-boyfriends-food-ethics-dieting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/17/sara-pascoe-vegan-boyfriends-food-ethics-dieting","fields":{"headline":"Sara Pascoe: ‘All my ex-boyfriends become vegan, and it’s really annoying’","bodyText":"My earliest food memory is being starving hungry after swimming. I think that’s quite common with children: the second you’re out of the water you want to have a Twix, a cup of tea and chips and salty stuff. There’s a big pool in Dagenham and a fish and chip shop called The Golden Fish opposite and you can have bread and margarine while waiting for your chips, and I really loved that. I became a vegetarian at seven. I went on a school trip to a farm and loved the animals. I told Dad I was going to be a farmer because I wanted to look after animals and show them to children, but he said that’s what we eat, chopped up. I was aghast. My early memories of my mother are all of her dieting. She had me when she was 18, so she was pretty young and I remember SlimFast in cans and “lean cuisine” for her dinner. Working all the time and a single mother of three, she didn’t learn to cook or have any time to cook. We had a terrible diet and she wouldn’t mind me saying that. My youngest sister Kristyna, spelt after a Polish woman in the credits of Schindler’s List, is diabetic and a parent now and she is very conscientious about eating at table and having no phones present. We’ve all found ways of rebelling from our childhoods. I ran away to see Take That. I took the same packed lunch I would have taken to school – sandwiches Mum made on a Sunday night and froze, so we could take a set out every day, hoping they had defrosted by lunchtime. It was usually cheese or cheese paste, or some kind of spread like mayonnaise with vegetable bits in it. I get terrible hate mail from other vegans. I made a vegan bread and “butter” pudding on Bake Off: Extra Slice and they said I should have boycotted the show because other guests used eggs and butter. I got emails telling me to kill myself. They’re much angrier at people who are supposed to be on their side. I understand how some young women use veganism as a way of being both ethical and keeping weight down. I wrote on my website that veganism isn’t right for everyone and the first thing you have to consider is nutrition. I was saying that some use veganism as a form of eating disorder and that careful vegans replace what they cut out of their diet. I’ll tell you why so many comediennes have polycystic ovaries. The pancreas releases insulin to make you ready for fight or flight when you’re scared. So if you don’t fight or flight – if you stay onstage, telling jokes – then your body stores more fat in your tummy which makes you insulin resistant. All comedians have fat bellies, even if they exercise. Even the skinny ones have big bellies. My current show LadsLadsLads reflects on the relationship and aftermath of my time with my ex, John Robins. He became pescetarian and is actually vegan now. All my former boyfriends become vegan and it’s really annoying. I plan to write standup about it because they’re never vegan when I’m with them. I feel they think about it more after breaking up. My friend says, ‘Maybe you’ve got pamphlets in your vagina, but willies aren’t fast at reading’. I’d prefer no animals were eaten but I understand that some people don’t like the taste of soya, that some people want their cheese, butter and cereals in the morning and that some people feed so many different meals to different people that they don’t adhere themselves. The idea of making those people feel guilty is a bit like giving people an eating disorder – because they eat more cheese they then feel bad about eating more cheese and on it goes. Also, vegetarianism comes in phases. I’ve met lots of people who were veggie up until university, or became vegetarian at university, or got pregnant and their bodies needed different foods. I would never argue with a pregnant woman. I took part in a hunger strike to support Reprieve, who campaign for those who are on death row or are illegally imprisoned in other countries. I undertook 24 hours of the hunger strike. It takes a lot of concentration, because occasionally you think “Oooh, I’ll eat now” and then remember you can’t. It gnaws at the stomach after 15 or so hours. I’ve recently moved into a rented flat in Finsbury Park. The tiles in the kitchen are pale green and I’ve used the shelves to display my stepmum’s work. She is a brilliant potter called Kirsten Coelho who sometimes gives me cups or bowls that I live in fear of breaking. I have a plant-based diet, mostly unprocessed foods, but I also drink quite a lot of alcohol, so I am not completely healthy.

Disputes that had lain dormant – not least the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne delineating the borders between the two nations – were prised open with brutal force on Thursday by Erdoğan on the first day of a historic visit dominated by the leader’s unpredictability. Within an hour of stepping off his plane, the pugilistic politician was sparring with the Greek head of state, Prokopis Pavlopoulos. Athens, he said imperiously, would never have entered Nato had it not been for Ankara’s support. As an ally, it should seek to improve the religious rights of the Muslim minority in Thrace which were enshrined in the Lausanne treaty, he insisted, sitting stony-faced in the inner sanctum of the presidential palace. “It needs to be modernised,” he said of the treaty, which has long governed Greek-Turkish relations and is seen as a cornerstone of regional peace. A visibly stunned Pavlopoulos hit back, calling the treaty non-negotiable. “The Treaty of Lausanne defines the territory and the sovereignty of Greece, and of the European Union, and this treaty is non-negotiable. It has no flaws, it does not need to be reviewed, or updated.” With tensions running high between the two long-time Nato rivals and neighbours, Athens had hoped the 48-hour sojourn would put fraught bilateral relations on a new footing. International condemnation of Erdoğan’s crackdown on democratic institutions, following a foiled coup against him last year, has strained relations with Europe and the US and meant that the Turkish leader has made fewer trips to the west. Greek officials thought he would use the visit to strike a conciliatory note. The red carpet was duly rolled out with military bands and Greece’s ornately dressed presidential guard doing the honours. In what will be remembered as one of the biggest security operations in living memory – with 2,800 police deployed around the capital, snipers posted on rooftops, and commandos, sniffer dogs, bomb disposal experts and bodyguards drafted in – the visit brought Athens to a standstill. But the 63-year-old Turkish leader, while thanking his hosts for the welcome, continued to ratchet up the rhetoric. In subsequent talks with the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, he chastised the Greeks for failing to look after Ottoman sites and provide a proper place of worship for Muslims. Cyprus, he argued, had not been reunified because Greek Cypriots kept turning down a “just and sustainable” settlement. He also attacked the “economic chasm” between Greeks, who earned on average €15,000 a year, and the Turkish-speaking Muslim minority in northern Thrace who earned around €2,200 a year. Athens, he continued, should also return the eight Turkish officers who had escaped to Greece as the coup unfolded even if the country’s judicial system had blocked their repatriation on the grounds that they would not be given a fair trial. “It is possible to return them to Turkey, which is a country that has abolished the death penalty and is not a country of torture,” he told a press conference in the prime minister’s office. Looking on in dismay – Greek ministers exchanging knowing smiles around him – Tsipras repeated that as the birthplace of democracy, where executive power was separate from the law, Greece respected decisions made by the country’s justice system. Earlier, the 43-year-old had attempted to ameliorate the frosty atmosphere, telling his guest that respect for international law was the basis of solid ties between the two neighbours. “Differences have always existed and [they exist] today,” the leftist leader said. “It is important … that we express our disagreements in a constructive way, without being provocative.” The visit follows the arrests in Athens of nine Turkish nationals charged last week with being members of DHKP-C, a militant Marxist group that has claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Turkey. “The visit comes at an especially delicate time, diplomatically, given mounting criticism of his crackdown on perceived and real participants in the coup and other domestic opponents,” said Hubert Faustmann, professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia. Relations between Turkey and Greece have long been strained. Hostility can be traced back to the subjugation of Greeks under Ottoman rule before a bloody war of independence initiated in 1821 led to the creation of the modern Greek state in 1830. Successive conflicts followed, most notably in 1922 when the Greek army suffered a disastrous defeat in Asia Minor, prompting a massive exchange of populations – widely seen as the first experiment in ethnic cleansing – and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. The two countries came close to war again in 1996 over a pair of uninhabited isles in the Aegean Sea. Most recently, tensions have resurfaced over Greece’s frontier role in the refugee crisis, failed talks to reunify Cyprus and, according to officials in Athens, Turkey’s repeated violations of Greek air and naval space in the Aegean. The defence ministry claims more than 3,000 airspace violations have occurred this year, more than at any other time since 2003. Erdoğan’s open questioning of the peace treaty that forged the boundaries of the two states has exacerbated friction even further. The Greeks are also acutely aware that geography means they must coexist with Turkey and stand to benefit most if Ankara remains anchored to Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/06/vladimir-putin-russian-president-running-re-election-march","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T16:03:26Z","webTitle":"Vladimir Putin makes it official – he's running for re-election in 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/06/vladimir-putin-russian-president-running-re-election-march","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/06/vladimir-putin-russian-president-running-re-election-march","fields":{"headline":"Vladimir Putin makes it official – he's running for re-election in 2018","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has made the long-expected announcement that he will seek a new six-year presidential term at elections in March. If he wins, which he almost certainly will, Putin will have spent 24 years as Russian leader by the end of his term in 2024, including four years when he was prime minister but still called the shots. “I will put forward my candidacy for the post of president of the Russian Federation,” said Putin during a meeting with factory workers in the city of Nizhny Novgorod on Wednesday afternoon. “Russia will continue moving forwards, and nobody will ever be able to stop this forward movement,” he said, in what may be an early sign that the campaign would invoke nationalist rhetoric of a Russia facing off against a hostile west. Putin has spent a year dodging the question about whether he would run in the elections. Even earlier on Wednesday the Russian president was coy about seeking re-election when he took to the stage at a youth volunteer forum in Moscow and was asked the question directly. “I want to ask, do you trust and support me?” Putin asked the audience, which prompted a resounding chorus of “Yes!” “The decision will be taken and announced in the near future,” said Putin, without making it clear just how soon. Putin’s participation is entirely unsurprising and for a long time has been taken as a given, with the only intrigue over when exactly he would announce his campaign and what kind of issues he would run on. Western sanctions and this week’s International Olympic Committee decision to ban the Russian team from the 2018 Winter Games are likely to boost a potential campaign message of Putin and Russia against the world. The election date was moved to 18 March to coincide with the anniversary of the annexation of Crimea in an attempt to boost patriotic spirits in the absence of real political intrigue. Putin is likely to face little real competition, with the other candidates mainly ageing pocket opposition characters who are content to play their assigned roles. The socialite turned opposition journalist Ksenia Sobchak, daughter of Putin’s political mentor, has said she will stand on an “against all” ticket, but she is widely seen as running with Kremlin approval to provide an outlet for the disgruntled liberal minority. The only politician who has been carrying out a real grassroots campaign, with offices in regions across Russia, and countrywide campaign rallies, is the opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny. He is not likely to be allowed on to the ballot due to a criminal conviction, which many observers believe came about as a result of a politicised case designed for exactly that reason. Navalny has said he will call for an “active boycott” of the elections if he is not allowed to stand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/06/europe-should-have-its-own-minister-of-economy-and-finance-says-ec","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T18:35:20Z","webTitle":"Europe should have its own economy and finance minister, says EC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/06/europe-should-have-its-own-minister-of-economy-and-finance-says-ec","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/06/europe-should-have-its-own-minister-of-economy-and-finance-says-ec","fields":{"headline":"Europe should have its own economy and finance minister, says EC","bodyText":"Europe should have its own economy and finance minister, the European commission said, as it presented ideas aimed at making the eurozone more democratic and resilient to economic shocks. In a bulky set of proposals published on Wednesday, the commission said the EU could have a dedicated minister of economy and finance by 2019. The plans are the latest sketch of the EU’s future, as Britain prepares to leave the bloc and European leaders aim to shore up common policies on economy, migration and defence. Also on the table is a plan to make the European bailout fund an EU institution, supervised by the European parliament, rather than a body run by national governments, an idea certain to meet resistance from governments such as Germany’s. Under the commission plan, the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone bailout fund which takes decisions by unanimity, would become the European Monetary Fund, which would take decisions often by majority votes. In theory, the EMF, which would have a war chest of €500bn, the same as the current ESM, would be able to act faster in a crisis. But governments are likely to resist giving up their vetoes on the purse strings. The measures are aimed at shoring up the 19-member currency zone but also at encouraging EU countries outside the bloc to join. Currently, all EU member states have an obligation to join the eurozone, except the UK and Denmark, which have negotiated opt-outs. After Brexit, the eurozone will represent 85% of the EU’s economic output and 76% of the population, which has raised fears that the outsiders will become second-class members without clout in the EU. Under the latest proposals, non euro members, such as Poland and Hungary, will be able to apply for technical help and EU funds worth €300m to help them carry out reforms to prepare for joining the currency. But Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commission vice-president in charge of the euro, stressed that no country would be brought into the eurozone by force and all could join in their own time. “It is a treaty obligation but there are no strict deadlines,” he said. According to the commission job description, the European minister of economy and finance would be a European commissioner but would also chair the monthly meetings of eurozone finance ministers, the body that took many of the critical decisions during the eurozone crisis. The job could be created as soon as November 2019, when a new European commission takes office. The person would police EU member states’ fiscal policies, making sure governments stick to the rules of the stability and growth pact, which sets limits on debts and deficits. The minister would also have to report to the European parliament and could represent Europe on the international economic stage, such as the International Monetary Fund. The departing eurozone chair, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has been criticised for rarely going to the European parliament, which has fed into a wider critique of the opaque decision making of the eurozone council. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic affairs, insisted the proposals would be better for democratic accountability. “If an intergovernmental group decides without any report to the outside world, that decision would not automatically be the same [as one] monitored by the European parliament.” Significantly the ministerial role would be a pan-European job, rather than a eurozone-only one, a sign that Brussels puts the stress on unity, rather than the more exclusive vision championed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Macron had called for a eurozone finance minister and parliament. Since the recession, the EU has been debating how to reform the eurozone to prevent a repeat of the multiple debt crises that plunged Europe into turmoil. European leaders hope that an upturn in eurozone economic growth and a mood of unity engendered by the Brexit vote will add momentum to agree long-debated reforms. European leaders, minus the UK, will discuss the plans at a special summit next week, but little progress is expected in the absence of a new German government. Donald Tusk, head of the European council, has called on leaders to take “concrete decisions” in June 2018. But that means reconciling the visions of France and Germany, which represent two different schools of thought in the eurozone.

Germany, backed by northern European countries, has long been wary of a large common budget or common pooling of debt.

On the one hand, the picture explores the emotional toll on everyman Jeff Bauman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who finds himself celebrated as a figure of hope, simply by virtue of having survived. On the other, with its swelling score and obligatory shots of noble, fluttering US flags, the film buys into the hero narrative wholesale. With his huge haunted eyes, Gyllenhaal does a decent job of capturing the conflict of a man who can’t admit that he is struggling for fear of letting down his family and the city that supports him. Headed by Miranda Richardson as his boozy mother, the family itself is more problematic – a kind of Punch and Judy caricature of a Boston blue-collar community, all whiplash tempers and high-octane swearing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/09/best-radio-this-week-laura-ingalls-wilder-little-house-on-the-prairie-samira-ahmed","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T12:00:06Z","webTitle":"The best radio this week: Laura Ingalls Wilder and Little House on the Prairie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/09/best-radio-this-week-laura-ingalls-wilder-little-house-on-the-prairie-samira-ahmed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/09/best-radio-this-week-laura-ingalls-wilder-little-house-on-the-prairie-samira-ahmed","fields":{"headline":"The best radio this week: Laura Ingalls Wilder and Little House on the Prairie","bodyText":"In Sunday Feature: Laura Ingalls Wilder (10 December, 6.45pm, Radio 3) Samira Ahmed travels to the Missouri home of the pioneer-girl author who gave us the books from which sprang Little House on the Prairie. Back in the 80s, this was Ronald Reagan’s favourite TV show. On the 150th anniversary of Ingalls Wilder’s birth, Ahmed finds her work is still central to the self-reliance that remains vital to the United States’s self-image. Her legacy is still squabbled over by both sides of the present cultural divide. Since hearing Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine (Weekdays, 10.45pm, Radio 4) I’ve learned the Gail Honeyman book this quirky story comes from is a bestseller. After one hearing I wasn’t in the least surprised. In this version, Tracy Wiles relates the routine of the young woman who works in Accounts Payable, wears the same clothes to work every day, plots a fuddled path through her lonely weekends with the help of two bottles of vodka, living out a life of quiet desperation until exposure to a local singer brings her into unexpected contact with the world of intimate waxing and thrusts her towards the madness that is normal life for her workmates. Brilliant in its way. This entire Saturday morning is given over to Great Lives: Four Hundred and Counting (9 December, 9am, Radio 4 Extra). Here, Matthew Parris looks back over such highlights as Penelope Keith celebrating Morecambe and Wise, Michael Sheen on Philip K Dick and a grumpy Christopher Hitchens cutting up rough on the presenter. My favourite bit comes at the beginning where you hear Parris give the guests what is presumably his regular pre-record chat. This makes me curious to hear what they say before the red light goes on when recording other favourites. Thinking Outside the Boxset: How Technology Changed the Story (Thursdays, 11.30am, Radio 4) is an overdue look at how the new ways in which TV and film are distributed in these binge-watching days makes their creators rethink narrative. Because he’s as interested in how people consume as what they consume, Mark Lawson is well qualified to tell this story. Karina Longworth, the genius behind You Must Remember This, has quite correctly spun off her series about the Sharon Tate murders as a separate podcast called You Must Remember Manson to mark the passing of the man who unleashed hell because he couldn’t get a recording contract. Longworth’s unhurried approach ensures that no matter how much you think you know about the story there’s still a great deal to learn. She does a whole episode about Dennis Wilson’s contacts with the family. You could say something similar about Slow Burn, a podcast about Watergate. This will be aimed at people who weren’t born when those events took place.

Labour said the firm should be barred from bidding again, amid warnings that the effective bailout on its Virgin Trains East Coast franchise could cause a crisis across the rail industry. The government has waived the majority of payments due under the Scottish transport group’s £3.3bn contract to run the London to Edinburgh route, agreeing to replace it with a less onerous partnership model at the end of the decade. Stagecoach, which could pay only £1bn to the Treasury under the current deal, indicated it would bid to run the line once more. Martin Griffiths, chief executive of Stagecoach, said: “The secretary of state has said [East Coast Partnership] would be a more joined-up railway between the public and private sector. From our point of view being the operator would be important.” Announcing increased group profits on Wednesday, the transport company said it also expects to be given further direct awards, without competition, to continue operating two more franchises – East Midland and West Coast – after 2019. A rail strategy published by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, last week revealed that from 2020 an East Coast Partnership would replace the Stagecoach-Virgin franchise contract, which was due to expire in 2023. Stagecoach is also seeking to renegotiate terms and payments of its contract until 2020, after admitting having overbid to run a line that had been in public sector operation for six years before reprivatisation in 2015. Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “The idea that Stagecoach may again bid for rail contracts following the company’s failure on the East Coast line shows that the rail franchising system is truly broken beyond repair. “Labour would ban Stagecoach from running passenger rail operations in the UK. Grayling should commit to doing the same and come clean about the taxpayer bailout to the company he signed off last week.” Stagecoach said it would honour its financial commitments, which would see it forfeiting a £165m guarantee. Griffiths said the firm wwas likely to bid to continue running the East Coast under Grayling’s proposed partnership model. “We are a big operator in UK rail,” Griffiths said. “We are looking at Southeastern and the West Coast partnership. We’ll assess them on their merits. “[Grayling] has announced that he’s got a different vision for railway post 2020, part of that includes the East Coast. In the intervening period, while the revenue growth has been lower and the franchises has been loss-making, there is significant investment in the stations and upgrading the fleet, the technology and the customer experience. These are all significant benefits to the passenger today and to the franchise in the long term.” However, Lord Adonis, chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission and former transport secretary, said the bailout was sparking a crisis in rail. He claimed that FirstGroup – which was shortlisted for the East Coast line – could use the precedent to seek a way out of another struggling franchise. He said on Twitter that FirstGroup was “losing big money” on TransPennine Express after overbidding, adding that he had been told FirstGroup’s lawyers were “looking very carefully” at the bailout of Stagecoach-Virgin. A spokesman for FirstGroup denied Adonis’s claims, adding that revenue growth was running slightly lower than the group’s projections but most growth would come from new trains due in 2018. Stagecoach’s pre-tax profits for the first half of 2017-18 were up 8% to £96.7m. The group’s share price rose another 5% on Wednesday morning, following a 15% leap last week on news of the bailout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/06/most-wanted-trafficker-brazil-rogerio-da-silva-in-rio-arrested-3000-strong-operation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T14:23:02Z","webTitle":"Rio police hail arrest of drug kingpin in 3,000-strong favela operation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/06/most-wanted-trafficker-brazil-rogerio-da-silva-in-rio-arrested-3000-strong-operation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/06/most-wanted-trafficker-brazil-rogerio-da-silva-in-rio-arrested-3000-strong-operation","fields":{"headline":"Rio police hail arrest of drug kingpin in 3,000-strong favela operation","bodyText":"Security forces in Rio de Janeiro have arrested a drug kingpin blamed for a war between rival gangs in Brazil’s biggest favela. Rogério da Silva, 36, also known as Rogério 157, was seized Wednesday morning in an operation involving 3,000 Brazilian military and police. He was wanted for homicide, extortion and drug trafficking, and a $15,000 reward had been offered for his arrest. “He was arrested by the police in an integrated operation by police and armed forces in the Arará Park favela,” a spokesman for the security forces said. “He did not resist. He was surrounded.” Rio’s O Globo newspaper said he was caught hiding under a duvet after jumping the wall of his safe house. His arrest marks a rare success for police in a city where violent crime is soaring, and where a much heralded pre-Olympic plan, to pacify favelas with armed police bases, has fallen apart as drug gangs have reoccupied territory. Cristiana Bento, a detective who coordinated the arrest, said da Silva was responsible for the gang war which exploded in Rocinha favela, which is strategically situated between famous beach areas such as Ipanema and the city’s Olympic Park. The conflict reached new heights in September, and led to a military operation which failed to quell the violence. A month later a Spanish tourist was shot by police, who said the car she was travelling in went past a roadblock. “Rogério is one of the most wanted traffickers in Rio de Janeiro,” Bento said. “The arrest was very important to dismantle organised crime.” In recent months local media published photographs of da Silva wearing heavy jewellery. The Rio tabloid Extra said he had earned his nickname carrying out armed street robberies – 157 is the penal code article for the crime – before joining the drug gang led by Antônio Francisco Bonfim Lopes, aka Nem, a Rocinha gang leader immortalised in the bestselling book Nemesis by Misha Glenny. Nem was arrested fleeing the favela, hiding in the boot of a car, after the area was occupied in a military operation in 2011. He is still in prison. Rocinha residents and local media reports said Nem’s former lieutenant broke ranks and stopped obeying orders. He began charging a tax on items such as water and demanding protection money from local businesses. In September open warfare broke out in Rocinha after Nem was reported to have teamed up with gang members from three other favelas to retake the territory. A military operation was launched to retake control but had few concrete results. As violence continued to flare up, da Silva kept moving from one favela to another. He switched allegiances, Bento said, leaving the Amigos dos Amigos (Friends of Friends, known as ADA) gang, associated with Nem, to join the Comando Vermelho (the Red Command, or CV), one of Rio’s most powerful drug mafias with operations across Brazil. In October a Spanish tourist María Jiménez, 67, was shot dead by police while on a favela tour. Police said the car she and other tourists were in went through a roadblock, a version contested by some people. Following da Silva’s arrest, gunfire was heard in Rocinha. “It was a sequence of shots that sounded like a commemoration or a protest,” said one resident, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals. “When these guys are jailed there is no interruption to their command. People are worried because the war in Rocinha has not ended with 157’s arrest. And the unfolding of this arrest will be more confrontation, more dispute for territory.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/06/tell-us-about-the-childhood-christmas-gifts-you-asked-for-but-never-received","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T14:55:44Z","webTitle":"Tell us about the childhood Christmas gifts you asked for but never received","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/06/tell-us-about-the-childhood-christmas-gifts-you-asked-for-but-never-received","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/06/tell-us-about-the-childhood-christmas-gifts-you-asked-for-but-never-received","fields":{"headline":"Tell us about the childhood Christmas gifts you asked for but never received","bodyText":"We’ve all been there as a child - asking for the latest toy, or a trip into space, hoping and wishing that we’d find it under the tree on Christmas day, only to be bitterly disappointed to find it wasn’t meant to be.

In fact, that’s what its sensible wing wants","bodyText":"Arlene Foster and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), are notionally full of pro-Brexit fervour. Yet there is a striking contradiction in the DUP’s political rhetoric: Brexit will be a resounding success but there cannot be a hard border. Like the character of Prince Tancredi in Lampedusa’s The Leopard, Arlene Foster has decided that: “If we want things to stay the same, things will have to change.” The DUP will always insist on the closest possible union between Northern Ireland and Britain, but London’s Brexit ambitions must be tempered by Irish realities. The DUP’s intervention on Monday – preventing Prime Minister Theresa May signing off on a deal that promised no regulatory divergence on the island of Ireland – is a decisive moment in Brexit negotiations. Hard Brexiteers, including some within her own party, hailed Foster’s move as having “saved Brexit”. This is a fundamental misreading of the current situation: the DUP’s leaders actions may ultimately lead to a situation where the whole of the UK remains either in, or closely aligned to, the EU’s single market and customs union. The UK has to find a way to reassure the EU that there will not be a hard border in Ireland after Brexit if it wishes to progress to the next stage of talks. The open secret of Northern Irish politics is that the DUP is deeply divided over Brexit. Some, such as Foster, who represents the border constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the Northern Irish assembly, know the value of the EU to cross-border trade and services. Others, including Nigel Dodds, the party’s leader at Westminster are genuine Brexit believers: they view June’s referendum as providing a unique opportunity to make the UK more prosperous by negotiating its own trade deals around the world. It is telling that the DUP has not produced any detailed policies on Brexit; their approach has been entirely reactive. In a joint letter with the late Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin in October 2016, Foster argued that the border should not become “an impediment” to the current flow of goods and services after Brexit. Last week Foster restated her desire for the UK to negotiate “a comprehensive trade and customs agreement”, one that would avoid the need for a “hard border”. None of the concerns shared by Foster and others on the more pragmatic wing of the DUP mean that they will accept a border in the Irish Sea. Foster’s own family has sacrificed much to preserve the closest possible union with Great Britain. Before the Anglo-Irish conflict of 1916-21, Foster’s paternal grandfather, Nathaniel Kelly, was a mid-sized farmer near Dernawilt, Roslea. The centre of his commercial world was the nearby town of Clones in County Monaghan. After the imposition of the border in 1922, Clones was no longer a viable market. The Kelly family turned to other activities – mostly state employment, including in the police and the electricity board. Economic arguments carry some weight, but deeper political considerations have a visceral grip on the DUP’s soul. The DUP may have given May an opportunity to tack to a better strategy: keep the UK aligned with the customs union and the single market for a period of five years or more. Meanwhile, London can weigh up options for the comprehensive trade and customs deal that Foster wants, if this offers an improvement on the status quo. Brexit is poisoning efforts to re-establish a power-sharing executive in Belfast. Instead of working together on committees, unionists and nationalists rely on separate information silos, one via London and the other through Dublin. Resolving or opting for the long-term parking of Brexit will give Northern Ireland’s political leaders space to focus on other pressing problems such as dealing with the legacy of the Troubles. Foster, like May, needs to find a way out: a hard Brexit will not do. Foster would probably like the UK to stay in the customs union. However, she cannot state that without giving Sinn Féin a further opportunity to argue that Northern Ireland, at least, should stay in the customs union even if Great Britain does not. And she faces a challenge in her own party from a group of hard Brexiteers led by Dodds. Foster needs Conservative allies to make all the running. The collapse of talks on completing phase one of Brexit negotiations will still lead to the same inevitable conclusion – the UK staying in, or aligned to the customs union, but through a more arduous route. The economic uncertainty over the UK’s future relationship with the EU and an ensuing political crisis in the Conservative party would not play well with the financial markets. Foster should quietly remind Theresa May of the wisdom of a certain Sicilian prince. • Edward Burke is assistant professor in international relations at the University of Nottingham"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/12/guardian-observer-british-journalism-awards-press-gazette","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T00:02:31Z","webTitle":"Guardian and Observer scoop three prizes in British Journalism Awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/12/guardian-observer-british-journalism-awards-press-gazette","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/12/guardian-observer-british-journalism-awards-press-gazette","fields":{"headline":"Guardian and Observer scoop three prizes in British Journalism Awards","bodyText":"The Guardian and the Observer have won three British Journalism Awards, including sports journalism of the year for Daniel Taylor for exposing sexual abuse in football.

The UK foreign secretary said he hoped the presence of Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s three-year-old daughter in Tehran awaiting her mother’s release, would be uppermost in the Iranian’s minds. Reporting back to the House of Commons on his visit to senior Iranian leaders, including the president, Hassan Rouhani, Johnson offered a shift in tone, saying Iran had a legitimate role in resolving the civil war in Yemen. He also implied Saudi Arabia ran the risk of being judged by history as using starvation as weapon of war. Johnson said had raised the plight of UK dual nationals in all his meetings, adding that those talks had been worthwhile, but he did not wish to raise false hopes about any individual release. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been in prison for nearly two years after being sentenced for espionage. Her fate became entwined with Johnson’s political career when last month he said wrongly she had been in Tehran to train journalists. An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday that the ministry was going to follow up her case on humanitarian grounds, but stressed she had been found guilty by the judiciary. Insisting it was not in the interest of her release to give a running commentary, Johnson said: “The Iranians had been clear to me that none of my remarks in any context had any bearing on any judicial proceedings in any UK consular case.” He disclosed that he had not sought to meet Zaghari-Ratcliffe personally since the Iranian government does not recognise dual nationality and therefore would not have granted him access. But he effectively confirmed he had met with her family in private. In a broader shift of political tone that is likely to be warmly welcomed in Tehran, he said peace in Yemen required engagement with Iran, adding there was no military solution to the civil war. He appeared to warn Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that history may judge them to have sought victory in Yemen through starvation. The Saudi coalition has imposed a blockade on Yemeni ports held by Houthi rebel forces, such as Hodeydah, in response to a missile fired at Riyadh airport last month. Huge international pressure has led to the partial lifting of the blockade on humanitarian aid, but not commercial aid, leaving tens of thousands facing starvation and having to drink impure water. Johnson met UAE and Saudi leaders in Abu Dhabi alongside US representatives on Sunday after his Tehran visit to discuss the war in Yemen. He said: “What I said to our friends in the region, that is the risk we are running - that ... people will deem that starvation has been used as as instrument for the prosecution of a war. That is not something that anybody wants to see, least of all the coalition forces.” Johnson stressed the Saudis had a legitimate role in defending their country, adding that in some feisty meetings he had repeatedly pressed the Iranians to reveal whether they had supplied the missile that had been fired on Riyadh by the Houthis.

Allardyce admits his first signing “has to be correct for Everton and for my future here – make bad signings and you get the sack, it’s that simple”. But with 31 players in the first-team pool when fit, the 63-year-old is prepared to sell assets who consider themselves surplus to requirements. All will be asked directly in face-to-face meetings with the manager. “If every player is honest enough when I finally get through the one-on-ones they will tell me if they want to stay or they don’t,” Allardyce said. “If you are going to be honest with the manager, or if they want to leave it a bit longer and see how it goes to January, then I’ll deal with it. “I don’t want anyone here who doesn’t want to be here. By the same token there’s always a price to pay and the club accepts we are not going to be mugs and let people leave under value in today’s market. People might want to move because it hasn’t quite worked or they have not settled as well as they thought. Up until then all these guys have a chance.” Davy Klaassen, the £23.6m signing from Ajax, and the former Málaga striker Sandro Ramírez both fall into that category having struggled to make an impact since arriving in the summer. But Allardyce insists every player has an opportunity to shape his transfer strategyover the coming weeks. “At the moment we would look to add a goalscorer. Dominic [Calvert-Lewin] has done well, [Oumar] Niasse has scored a few. It is the hardest thing to recruit players who score goals and hopefully there is somebody that can be brought in. If not, we will have to try to get Sandro to contribute a bit more. “When everybody is fit we have a 31-man squad. At this early stage adding more players to that would mean thinking ‘Who is going to come in for one of our players and am I prepared to sell them or rotate the squad a little bit?’ I don’t want to be in a desperate position in January. I want the players to show me that I don’t desperately need to sign anyone and that we are going to be OK for this season. Then it would be a key element of next pre-season. The hardest time of the year to recruit the players, and the most expensive time, is January.” Allardyce, who hopes to appoint a psychologist at Everton in the next week, saw Yannick Bolasie return from a long-term knee injury on Monday as a substitute in the under-23s’ defeat by Leicester City. Jonjoe Kenny is close to signing a new contract that will tie him to the club until 2022. Dominic Calvert-Lewin could be next in line for a new deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/11/new-york-subway-explosion-commuter-train-rail","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T21:26:10Z","webTitle":"New York subway attack reveals security challenge for transport systems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/11/new-york-subway-explosion-commuter-train-rail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/11/new-york-subway-explosion-commuter-train-rail","fields":{"headline":"New York subway attack reveals security challenge for transport systems","bodyText":"Every weekday, nearly 5.7 million people move through New York City’s subway system, commuting through 472 subway stations and across 662 miles of track. Monday’s attempted bomb attack struck at the heart of the commuter network in the Monday morning rush hour. Officials said the bomb detonated in a subway passageway in midtown Manhattan, between Port Authority bus terminal, which itself serves 65 million passengers each year, and the Times Square subway station at 42nd Street. What New York’s mayor dubbed an “attempted terrorist attack” comes nearly three months after a morning attack on the London Tube in September, which left 29 people injured after a bomb inside a train carriage partially detonated. New York police commissioner James O’Neill said after Monday’s attack: “We have almost 3,000 transit cops. All parts of the system are patrolled.” However, a highly visible security presence cannot provide absolute protection. American counter-terrorism experts have long warned that, compared to the heavy security and screening regimens at airports, trains and commuter rail systems are comparatively vulnerable to attack. This summer, an al-Qaida propaganda outlet reportedly released a guide to derailing trains and attacking rail systems, which included a list of popular American train routes, including the Acela Express line through Boston, New York, and Washington. Commuter rail lines and long-distance trains are “both vulnerable,” said Colin Clarke, a political scientist and counter-terrorism expert at the Rand Corporation. “You don’t get searched getting on to either. There’s no screening system.” Train commuters have long been terror targets. The 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway left 13 people dead and injured 6,000 others. The terror attack was carried out by a doomsday cult. In 2004, jihadists carried out a series of coordinated bombings on Madrid’s crowded commuter trains, which left 191 people dead and nearly 2000 injured. In 2005, suicide bombers in London killed 52 people and injured hundreds. In 2015, an attacker wielding an AK-47 opened fire on a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris, but was disarmed by three US citizens, two of them soldiers, before killing anyone. It’s unlikely that daily commuters would accept more intensive, airport-style screening procedures unless there was another major, successful attack, Clarke, the counter-terrorism expert, said, and even then, searching every single person before they boarded public transit systems would likely be unrealistic. Some public metro system are moving towards mass screening. Shanghai’s metro now screens passenger bags and other carry-ons, said Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, a transit security expert at the urban planning department of the University of California Los Angeles. “There was not much of a delay,” she said. Shanghai’s metro system serves 3.4 billion riders a year compared with New York City’s 1.8 billion, according to statistics compiled by New York’s transit system. High-speed rail lines in Europe do similar baggage screening, Loukaitou-Sideris said. Since transit operators often argue that intensive screenings will lead to unacceptable delays, officials have instead pursued better security through environmental design, like choosing construction materials that are shatter-resistant and non-combustible, or removing trash cans where bombs might be stored, as Tokyo did after its attack, she said. Researchers also found that information-sharing between different American agencies to prevent attacks improved in the decade since the London bombings, Loukaitou-Sideris said. In the United States, the deadliest attack on public transit was carried out not by jihadists with bombs, but by a mass shooter, “a mentally disturbed individual who killed six and wounded another 19 passengers aboard a Long Island commuter train in 1993,” according to a January 2016 report by the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University in California. “ ‘Lone loons’ rather than ‘lone wolves’ continue to be the threat in North America,” the report’s authors wrote. Recent attacks have left commuters on edge. In November, a fight between two men at London’s Oxford Circus tube station sparked a mass panic among riders after they heard screams and saw others running and thought an attack was taking place. Patrons hiding in a basement at an Italian restaurant near the station burst into applause when a waiter announced there had been no terrorist incident."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/dec/21/refugee-migrants-berlin-walking-tours-neukolln-sonnenallee","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T07:30:00Z","webTitle":"Breaking down the new Berlin wall: refugee guides show their side of city","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/dec/21/refugee-migrants-berlin-walking-tours-neukolln-sonnenallee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/dec/21/refugee-migrants-berlin-walking-tours-neukolln-sonnenallee","fields":{"headline":"Breaking down the new Berlin wall: refugee guides show their side of city","bodyText":"Shaam is an otherwise unremarkable-looking Middle Eastern restaurant. There’s a menu on the wall showing pixelated images of falafel and kibbeh; a hunk of doner meat rotates slowly by the window. But the restaurant has become a place for new arrivals from Syria to congregate. “The name feels like home,” says Mahmoud, a warm and chatty 28-year-old. “It introduces Berlin, away from your family and friends.” Mahmoud is a Syrian of Palestinian heritage who fled the war in Aleppo in 2014 after being imprisoned and tortured by government forces. He is now a guide with Querstadtein, a group organising tours of Berlin, led by refugees. The tours use the context of Berlin’s urban landscape to explain to tourists and locals alike the experience of being a refugee in Germany. Querstadtein, which now has eight guides, was the second refugee tour to crop up in Berlin as the city reacted to the mass influx of migrants that began two years ago. Refugee Voices was co-founded in early 2015 by Lorna Cannon, a British tour guide living in Berlin, and her two friends, both refugees who now volunteer as guides. The tours are a way for “people to meet somebody who is experiencing this life as a refugee, and understand what that means”, Cannon says. The idea is catching on. Refugee Voices has since launched a tour in Copenhagen, run by an Eritrean woman and an Iraqi Kurd, and there are plans to spread to London and Paris in early 2018. It is volunteer-based and free. Querstadtein’s concept is similar, but it pays guides a wage of €200 a month and charges €13 per tour. The cobbled streets of Neukölln, one of Berlin’s most diverse districts, hold a special significance for Mahmoud. “When you talk about the refugee crisis, then you have to talk about meeting points for these people,” he says. “There are always difficulties regarding the procedures and the linguistic barriers when you first arrive. So you have to find a person or place who can help you.” For him, that was Neukölln. More than 40% of the neighbourhood’s residents have an immigrant background, and it is “one of most energetic areas in Berlin”, he says. “It’s the most demanded area for living, simply because it’s full of foreigners. If you are a migrant or come from outside of Berlin, you can find comfort here.” Nearby Sonnenallee is a large thoroughfare bustling with loud shoppers and the hum of traffic. The street, once bisected by the Berlin wall, now represents a different kind of segregation. Home to Lebanese immigrants in the 1970s, Sonnenallee has become a hub for the city’s Middle Eastern communities, and is known locally as “Arab Street”. “This is the meeting point for all refugees and Arabs in the city. It makes them feel at home,” says Mahmoud. In Cafe Sabah, just off the main road, Mahmoud calls for tea and coffee and jokes with the staff in Arabic. I ask if he knows them. “Can you believe that we’re related? He’s my cousin,” he laughs. “Arabs are overly sociable. That person I got to know is the grandson of the cousin of my grandmother. I had never met him before in Syria, even though I knew his father. But here we got to know that he’s a relative of mine.” Since more than a million refugees crossed Germany’s borders, the city’s ethnic makeup has changed: Syrians are now the fourth-largest group of foreigners, behind Turks, Poles and Italians. New, refugee-owned businesses, such as the restaurants Alagami and Yasmin Alsham, have opened up as these new communities gradually establish themselves. “It’s easy to say, ‘Ich bin ein Berliner.’ It’s a very multicultural place – you feel like it’s your city,” says Mahmoud. Though Berlin may be multicultural, it remains polarised. The diverse areas of Neukölln and Kreuzberg are a far cry from the far-right hotbeds of Marzahn-Hellersdorf, which are “no-go areas for refugees who look visibly ‘different’”, says Dr Sina Arnold, a researcher at the Berlin Institute for Migration. “It creates a climate of fear for people who thought they had arrived in a safe place.” These fears have become even more prominent in the wake of September’s federal elections, when the far-right AfD won 12.6% of the vote. In the districts where AfD increased its share, “there is generally only a small percentage of migrant population, which also results in a lack of solidarity structures for refugees and migrants”, Arnold says. “It means that some refugees are afraid to leave the shelter after dark, or to walk outside alone, or be visibly identifiable as a Muslim.” There were around 3,500 attacks on refugees or refugee shelters in Germany in 2016. Arnold witnessed an assault in March last year in Marzhan, when a man poured vodka on a young Syrian, spat on him and gave a Nazi salute. Walid, a guide with Refugee Voices who asked for his name to be changed, says he’s afraid of what might happen. “[The far right] are getting more powerful; lots of people are believing them and starting to be more afraid,” he says. The tours aim to offer a space for reconciliation, with the guides hoping that presenting their own views and experiences of Berlin will help cross the barriers of perceived “otherness”. “It’s really rare to find a normal way of interacting, because people have a stereotype,” Walid adds. “There’s a huge misunderstanding of what a refugee is. If people understand the context and history of what made people come here, they will start to deal with them differently.” Do the tours also risk becoming what the Germans call Elendstourismus, or “misery tourism”? “If I felt that people were giving that sense of ‘poor people’, I wouldn’t continue,” says Mohamad, co-founder of Refugee Voices. “This is not the point of the tour.” Instead, he says, it is about forming a connection between experiences. Outside Berlin’s finance ministry on the corner of Leipziger Straße, Walid describes the June 1953 demonstrations here that were brutally suppressed by Soviet forces. Hundreds of people died “just asking for their basic rights”, Walid says. In Leipziger Straße’s scarred buildings Walid sees the streets of Hama, Syria, where half a million people gathered to protest against the government in 2011, an uprising that was violently crushed. “It’s a similar story of people trying to get their freedom, their rights, what they should have,” he says. Walid left Syria with his brother Mohamad, also a guide with Refugee Voices, after he was blacklisted by the Assad government for being active on social media. “We got a tip from somebody that his name was on a list that if the government catches him at any checkpoint it will be very bad for him,” his brother says. Upon arriving in Berlin, they stayed in a student dorm in Lichtenberg in the east of the city, which was converted into a temporary refugee shelter. While this area, like Marzhan, has a reputation for hostility to foreigners, Walid says the main problem was being in the limbo of shelters, not having your own place to live and socialise. “It’s hard to settle if you’re being moved to another camp.” He eventually found a home in Wedding, a few U-Bahn stops north of the city centre, where he ends his tour at his favourite family-run Syrian restaurant, Mandi. “Berlin gives me hope,” says Walid. “This city was heavily damaged in the second world war, and in a few years it was rebuilt and there was democracy. That’s what gives me hope for Syria now: that one day we might be able to build it again.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/11/the-guardian-view-on-nhs-funding-hospitals-are-hurting","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T19:11:27Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on NHS funding: hospitals are hurting | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/the-guardian-view-on-nhs-funding-hospitals-are-hurting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/the-guardian-view-on-nhs-funding-hospitals-are-hurting","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on NHS funding: hospitals are hurting","bodyText":"Bob Kerslake has been a big figure in public service for most of the past 20 years. He was a successful chief executive of Sheffield city council, before he was enticed to Whitehall where he became permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government, and for a time head of the civil service. In 2014 he left Whitehall to run King’s College hospital foundation trust in south London, and in 2015 he was made a member of the House of Lords. His public image is of a combative man who is not afraid to speak his mind and who is passionate about public service. It is little surprise that the opposition have sought his advice. On Sunday night, Lord Kerslake announced in these pages that he was resigning from King’s in protest at what he called – correctly – the failure of government to face up to the depth of underfunding in the health service. Such a high-profile resignation by a well-respected figure is profoundly embarrassing, and he correctly anticipated a counter-attack. On Monday morning it was widely reported that he was expecting to be asked to step down by NHS Improvement, the regulator created by the Conservatives to monitors trusts’ financial management, because King’s is spending way over its budget, and has been since before he took over. King’s is now a hospital in special measures, adding to the impression that Lord Kerslake jumped before he was pushed. This is not the whole story. He was immediately backed by NHS England and the organisation that represents all hospitals, the NHS Confederation. On the other hand, the newly departed chief executive of NHS Improvement, Jim Mackey, used an interview marking his departure with the specialist NHS publication, Health Service Journal, to denounce King’s failure to meet, as Mr Mackey put it, “any of the numbers it had put to us” in the two years he was at the NHSI. He suggested the problem was less underfunding than the “comply and lie” culture that is quite often used in the NHS as an alternative to making the sums add up. Mr Mackey was also critical of the way NHS bosses had demanded more money – a call echoed by all the leading health policy thinktanks – in the run up to the autumn budget, and then collectively criticised the chancellor’s failure to deliver. He warned that in difficult times the extra £2.8bn for revenue spending that Philip Hammond had announced was a significant amount, and criticising it would only confirm the Downing Street poor opinion of the health service’s serial ingratitude. Mr Mackey appears be attacking not just the management of King’s but the decision by the boss of NHS England, Simon Stevens, and his board, to try to start a public debate about rationing care in a time of cuts. The NHS England board, which met in public at the end of November, is courting confrontation with ministers when it suggested the obligation on waiting times that is enshrined in the NHS constitution might not be met if other priorities – for example on accident and emergency – were to be fully funded. In response, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, reiterated his commitment to waiting times. This is the kind of damaging ferrets-in-a-sack row between parts of the health service that would do better to stay on the same side (as Chris Ham of the Kings Fund argues). The truth is that London hospitals in general, and King’s in particular, have historic funding challenges and also face particular difficulties in recruiting and retaining top-class managers. But this should not disguise the other truth: that the health services across the UK are facing the worst squeeze they have ever endured as demand and costs both increase sharply. Rather than criticise each other, it would be much wiser to try to present a clear, coherent argument about what can and can’t be done that unites all NHS leaders. In effect, the Treasury is imposing a brutal decline on the health service. Unless there’s a change of heart, the only real argument is whether that decline will be managed – or, in a recipe for greater disaster, left unmanaged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/connecting-communities-the-gardens-that-offer-more-than-plants-and-soil","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T23:55:37Z","webTitle":"Connecting communities: the gardens that offer more than plants and soil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/connecting-communities-the-gardens-that-offer-more-than-plants-and-soil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/connecting-communities-the-gardens-that-offer-more-than-plants-and-soil","fields":{"headline":"Connecting communities: the gardens that offer more than plants and soil","bodyText":"Two men in black come into the garden. They lurk near Kati’s coriander, then move on, briefly obscured by Kathy’s towering fennel fronds, reappearing near Joe’s bed over which, yesterday, he showered worm wee with almost baptismal tenderness while lamenting the theft of his corn seedlings. One of the men points out something in the bed. The other replies. I’m suspicious. I too have lost much in these past months. The thieves like salad: several Saturdays ago I knelt in my dirt and planted out punnets of lettuce seedlings, a bit of basil, and flowers – sweet alyssum for the bees and yellow ranunculus for me because they looked so fine and because, let me loose in a nursery, I lose all sense of reason. On the Sunday, I returned to my patch. Only the sweet alyssum remained. In the place of the seedlings were multiple neat little holes. The infants had been removed with military precision. I swore and seethed and sulked and stayed away for a week. The following Saturday I returned with more lettuce seedlings. I would not be defeated. The taste of lettuce that has been grown in soil is incomparable. I had in mind green salads stretching into my future, in the French style, the bowl rubbed with garlic, a light dressing. On the Sunday after the second Saturday, I returned to my patch. Again, the seedlings were gone, the dark craters from which each had been lifted so tidily, remained to mock me. The men in black are moving towards me now. There’s a pitchfork in our shed. I’d like to have it in my hand, in the manner of that stern and bespectacled American Gothic farmer; it is the intimidatory effect I’m after. Instead, I’m clutching a handful of weeds, wandering jew, chickweed. Even wandering jew, the slithering tentacles of which can strangle a garden faster than you can say Stranger Things, won’t be helpful in the event of an argument. “Wonderful,” says the taller of the two men, waving his arm to take in the garden. The other smiles broadly and, in a thick accent, makes a comment I don’t quite understand but take to mean that our system is pathetic and everything will soon die. But it’s clear their intentions are not malevolent. The men and I start a conversation. This wild little community garden in the backstreets of Redfern in inner Sydney, which in the past six months has come to feel as essential to me as air and water, is a powerful conversation starter. Merely having a residential address in an upwardly mobile urban neighbourhood where gentrification and developers have yet to push out public housing does not guarantee connection with the community. The fortunate and the dispossessed might brush close in the street, shopping centre or bus, but headphones, screens, superiority, disinterest or fear keep them apart. This garden though, a microcosm of Australian inner-urban life where old meets new and the professional and affluent meet the lonely, the despairing, the mentally ill and the intoxicated, is a connector. I’ll be aerating compost or weeding or have the hose out and one person or another will wander in. And soon they’ll be remembering something – a home far away, the taste of something, how their grandfather grew potatoes or eggplants or tomatoes – or exclaiming over the pomegranates swelling on the tree, the almond, coffee or olive trees. The conversations are no less significant when there is little language in common. One day, a woman in a hijab points out the seed pods on a broccoli plant that has bolted; she understands my question – are the seeds ready? – but barely has the words for her answer. She shakes her head. “No … yellow,” she replies, and it’s enough for me, a rookie gardener, to understand that I must wait for the pod to dry and turn brown. Another day I chat with an excitable old Italian man. I don’t pick up much of what he says but he points out one thing, then another, and then something I’d thought was a weed, perhaps dandelion, and tells me it’s good for the kidneys. Sometimes though, even the magic garden fails in its role as translator. A stout middle-aged woman, a bohemian vision trailing bold colours and untold stories, occasionally takes regal ownership of a bench at morning-tea time. She lays her things out around her, then fishes in her bag and produces a petite porcelain cup into which she pours her booze. She’s a regular chatterbox: she talks and talks and talks and, although every word she utters is in clear English, her sentences are mostly incomprehensible, as though a mischievous elf has picked up each of her words and put them back down in the wrong places. Other visitors just make me cross. Like the unruly bloke who dashed past me one day while I watered. He did his watering behind the coffee tree next to the shed. “It’s not a toilet, mate,” I said as he passed me more slowly, sheepishly, on the way back to the pocket-sized park next to the garden where his mates and his alcohol waited. * The allegories of the garden are as rich as its compost. One day I plant some camomile seedlings in our medicinal bed. A fellow member, Con, a gentle Greek-Australian jack of all trades, watches as I do so and, when I say I’m worried about whether the delicate plant will live, he says: “They want to survive, they’re hungry, they’re fighting towards the light.” The good days (a harvest of this or that, soaking rains, a good working bee) are followed by the bad. The maturing almonds vanish overnight, lemongrass and aloe vera disappear, the bay tree is lopped. Sometimes plants are ripped out and hurled aside; when that happens, there’ll sometimes be a simultaneous harvest of syringes or empties and a miasma of rage or despair lingers. I rail against the sense of entitlement that surely leads to much of the looting and pillaging but longer-term members of the garden are resigned. One member, an architect, says she originally joined the garden to grow vegetables but she’s stayed, despite the losses, because the garden grows community. Of all the conversations I’ve had here, one stands out for what it says about the changes in this community over the past decades. I arrive at the garden one day to hear a woman point to a bed and tell a second woman, “You should take the silverbeet.” She has a plastic bag over her arm filled with green things. “They’re just cuttings,” she says to me as I approach. She’s defensive. I conceal my irritation and say, sure, cuttings are fine. I explain that anyone can become a member of the garden (it’s on City of Sydney land) and it’s only $20 a year, but that the members who work it are volunteers and the policy is that, if you haven’t helped grow something, it’s not yours to take. “We lived in Redfern as kids,” one of the women says. “Can’t believe how it’s changed.” (It’s outrageous, she adds, that her children can’t afford to buy in the area.) It’s true – even in my eight years here, the changes have been extraordinary. Cafe society has come to an area that once made cabbies nervous. Plans are on drawing boards for the daggy local shopping centre to be razed and in its place a new mall with several stories of apartments on top will be built. Public housing towers will topple to make way for the NSW government’s “urban renewal projects”, a 21st century form of slum clearance. In such a context, the garden’s role as a point of connection between the old and the new, the haves and have-nots, seems more crucial than ever. For me though, beyond connection, the garden has provided a bountiful harvest in forms other than produce. It has been a balm through a difficult period in which I made the decision to abandon an institutionalised life as an on-staff journalist to become a member of the freelance economy. Spending time in the garden has helped bring shape to my days and given me forms of procrastination to explore I had no clue existed. It has also led me towards what the American writer Joseph Campbell offered as a life philosophy – “follow your bliss”. My year was filled with career and personal successes, yet none gave me quite the same thrill as unearthing potatoes I’d grown myself, or seeing broccoli and lettuce shoots grown from the seeds of last year’s crop emerge. I am dazzled daily by my plot, now dense with lettuce, silverbeet, purslane, coriander, kale and a cucumber vine climbing up its junkyard-chic frame – an old bicycle wheel. I pluck dangling purple beans from my vine and later watch them turn green as I blanch them for dinner. When friends visit, I serve Korean-style bo ssäm (wraps) using the garden’s perilla leaves. It’s an elemental joy to eat a potato (with butter and salt) on the day it emerges from the soil. I have learned much from the garden but not just about soil or seeds or plants; it has given me lessons about managing frustration and disappointment and success and failure. And for someone with a solitary occupation, lone-wolf tendencies and a preference for neatness, the garden has taught me about coping with approaches that differ from mine and accepting some disorder. A founding member, a horticulturalist, talks about the garden’s chaos, its crazy-quilt-like demeanour. It is, he says, a reflection of the inner city in which it resides. There are no straight lines here or neat rows of evenly spaced plants. To deter thieves, most of us now crowd our beds and let a little wilderness conceal the crops. Weeds grow, plants go to seed, pumpkins and zucchinis self-sow and sprawl languidly. And visitors have views on our little wilderness. On that day in the garden, the men in black and I continued our conversation. They were, they said, on a break from their jobs as security guards at the shopping centre. One is Egyptian, the other Palestinian. Neither has family in Australia. “I don’t know where I belong,” says the Egyptian man. Sometimes, they tell me, they come to the community garden during their breaks – their fathers were gardeners and it reminds them of home. But they find some fault with our work. One of the men outlines their concerns: the garden is too messy, he says. There is too much here; instead we should devote whole beds to one item of produce to increase our yield. And, he says, it’s just not big enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/16/dickens-victorian-meals-clean-eating","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T11:58:01Z","webTitle":"Gruel, gin and mystery meat: Dickens’s Victorian meals in the age of ‘clean eating’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/16/dickens-victorian-meals-clean-eating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/16/dickens-victorian-meals-clean-eating","fields":{"headline":"Gruel, gin and mystery meat: Dickens’s Victorian meals in the age of ‘clean eating’","bodyText":"If Charles Dickens is thought of as a food writer at all, it is as the Man Who Invented Christmas Dinner. And there is some truth in the idea that he anchored the seasonal food to the day itself; plum pudding was called “Christmas pudding” for the first time by Eliza Acton, shortly after publication of A Christmas Carol; and goose was upgraded to the more expensive turkey by the reformed Scrooge. In terms of what we eat, though, Dickens’s most abiding influence is his conviction that everybody has the right to sit down together and enjoy the same food. Crucially, the Cratchits’ Christmas was not part of any ecclesiastical or charitable space but enjoyed by a poor family in their own home. Dickens was challenging a culture that regarded food as necessarily exclusive. These are conflicts in a war for status and control, in which food is deployed to show that “you are what you eat”. “Clean eating” is the latest iteration, only now that once-prestigious foods such as meat and white bread are common, it distinguishes the glowing and glossy “well” by what they don’t eat. Companionship (etymolocially “with bread”) gives way to differentiation when the bread on our shared table is seen by some to be “unclean”. Here is Dickens describing Jo, the crossing sweeper in Bleak House: “Jo comes out of Tom-all-Alone’s, meeting the tardy morning which is always late in getting down there, and munches his dirty bit of bread as he comes along. His way lying through many streets, and the houses not yet being open, he sits down to breakfast on the door-step of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts ...” This is what “unclean” food really is: something discarded, literally dirty, eaten by an unloved, unfed and illiterate child at the door of an organisation whose charitable gaze skips over him to rest on “the precious souls among the coco-nuts and bread-fruit”. Dirty bread and bread-fruit. One of Dickens’s devices for directing his readers’ gaze to the injustices on their own threshold was to counter images of hunger with those of plenty. There are a lot of hungry children in Dickens: Oliver Twist asking the workhouse master, a “fat, healthy man”, for more gruel; the grisly schoolmaster’s charges in Nicholas Nickleby having watered down milk, as he tucks into his breakfast of beef and toast while he justifies himself with the popular Victorian self-delusion that depriving children was to their moral good. Hungry grown men, such as Magwitch, are dangerous; prone to crime, riot and rebellion. It is not that Dickens doesn’t feel for them – his descriptions of hunger in A Tale of Two Cities are visceral: “Hunger was the inscription on the baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale.” But children are easier to pity; pity is a route to empathy; and empathy a route to changing how we, and Dickens’s contemporary readers, feel about the poor. He knew the gnaw of the belly first-hand, when his father was sent to the Marshalsea debtors’ prison, and the 12-year-old Charles was catapulted into fending for himself. He could never forget that, even when the family were reunited, his mother “was warm” for him to continue to work rather than be sent back to school. His semi-autobiographical novel, David Copperfield, shows not just the desperation of having an empty stomach, but also the ache for the consolation and security of being nourished by a loving parent. Becoming part of a Victorian movement of reformers, Dickens worked with the heiress and philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts, setting up a home to teach fallen women cookery and other domestic virtues; he admired Henry Mayhew whose reports in London Labour and the London Poor show how grinding such a lack of comforts was for the poorest and weakest in society. Dickens was sure, though, that they were just as entitled to enjoy a drink as the idle wealthy and that alcohol abuse was a symptom rather than a cause of poverty. Hogarthian disapproval of working-class drinking is rare in Dickens but he is not blind to its problems; in “Seven Dials” (Sketches by Boz), he describes a brawl between ladies drunk on “gin-and-bitters”. Dickens’s magazine, Household Words, amplified the campaigns of the day against bad food, spearheaded by the medical journal the Lancet, which found every one of 49 bread samples to be adulterated with at best inferior flour, at worst sulphate of lime and alum. Even after the Food Adulteration Acts of 1872 and 1875, the cookbook writer Theodore Garrett was warning readers against an alphabet of horrors, from the relatively benign, such as mustard husks in allspice, to the life-threatening sulphuric acid and lead in vinegar. Mayhew reported that out-of-date “Newcastle pickled salmon” was often flogged at public houses to the “Lushingtons” who, pickled themselves, wouldn’t notice its taint, just as the oft-pickled Mrs Gamp in Martin Chuzzlewit, invites her friend, Betsey Prig, to a tea of “two pounds of Newcastle salmon, intensely pickled”. Meat could be anything. As Sam Weller says, unpacking a picnic: “Wery good thing is weal pie, when you know the lady as made it, and is quite sure it ain’t kittens.” Dickens was appalled by the way livestock was treated and the corruption of dealers who sold the flesh of diseased animals. He wrote for Household Words on the cruelty, noise and filth of Britain’s urban livestock markets. For the ironically titled essay “A Monument of French Folly” he visited the suburban slaughter houses in Paris to report on the more humane, quiet and clean arrangements where the work was done with “plenty of room; plenty of time”. Good, cruelty-free food is a right for everybody, whatever their income or status. It was a radical message to many of his Victorian readers. Do we still need to listen to it? In a country of food banks, children going breakfastless to school, and lifestyle diets that separate rather than unite, perhaps we do. • Pen Vogler is the author of Dinner with Dickens, published by Cico."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/11/alvaro-morata-chelsea-antonio-conte-problems-huddersfield","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T22:30:16Z","webTitle":"Álvaro Morata absence for Chelsea adds to Antonio Conte’s problems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/11/alvaro-morata-chelsea-antonio-conte-problems-huddersfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/11/alvaro-morata-chelsea-antonio-conte-problems-huddersfield","fields":{"headline":"Álvaro Morata absence for Chelsea adds to Antonio Conte’s problems","bodyText":"Álvaro Morata will miss Chelsea’s match at Huddersfield Town on Tuesday night because of a mixture of injury and fatigue, with Antonio Conte increasingly concerned by the strain a hectic schedule is placing on his first-team resources. The striker was distinctly off-colour during the 1-0 defeat at West Ham United on Saturday, having struggled in the preceding week through illness and a knock sustained in training. Chelsea’s top scorer, with 10 goals, has had to shoulder a heavy burden up front during his first Premier League season in the absence of alternatives Conte trusts, but is now in line for an enforced rest that will inconvenience his manager. “Morata is out, because he’s a bit tired and there is a problem in his back,” said Conte, who was at least able to welcome Danny Drinkwater back into the squad when Chelsea travelled north on Monday afternoon for the fourth of nine fixtures this month. Conte has become increasingly candid about the tiredness he believes is dogging his squad; the January window presents a chance to ease the load but he appeared to suggest he has limited influence in transfer dealings when asked whether conversations had taken place. “We can have an idea but you can have an idea in summer [too],” he said. “But the final decision is always the club’s. That will be the same in January. It is right to do this: I’m only the coach, not the sporting director or manager.” Conte bemoaned the fact that the players who faced West Ham had been able to spend only 50 minutes preparing to face a Huddersfield side that beat Brighton 2-0 at the weekend. “It is normal that you play with the same players and then they also lose some physical condition,” he said. Chelsea have used 20 different players in the Premier League this season although, for context, it is the same number called upon by Manchester City. “I think we have to face the reality and will try to do our best,” Conte continued. “If I stay here to complain it is not the right way. For sure, it is difficult because to face a game every three days is not simple, especially if your squad is not big, but at the same time we have to face this situation. We have to find more rotations. I’m doing this, we will try and do our best with hunger and desire.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"theguardian/2017/dec/20/rhik-samadders-tasty-food-quiz-of-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T15:00:17Z","webTitle":"Rhik Samadder’s tasty food quiz of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2017/dec/20/rhik-samadders-tasty-food-quiz-of-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2017/dec/20/rhik-samadders-tasty-food-quiz-of-2017","fields":{"headline":"Rhik Samadder’s tasty food quiz of 2017","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/11/arsenal-fan-ronald-mukiibi-confronting-arsene-wenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T17:43:26Z","webTitle":"Ostersund’s Arsenal fan Ronald Mukiibi plans ‘a few words’ with Arsène Wenger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/11/arsenal-fan-ronald-mukiibi-confronting-arsene-wenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/11/arsenal-fan-ronald-mukiibi-confronting-arsene-wenger","fields":{"headline":"Ostersund’s Arsenal fan Ronald Mukiibi plans ‘a few words’ with Arsène Wenger","bodyText":"It is a measure of how far Ostersund have come that the Swedish side who will face Arsenal in the last 32 of the Europa League were formed a month after Arsène Wenger’s arrival in north London. But having already eliminated Galatasaray and Hertha Berlin on their way to this stage of the competition under their English manager Graham Potter, a visit to the Emirates Stadium will also represent an opportunity for defender Ronald Mukiibi to get a few questions off his chest. A lifelong Arsenal fan who joined Ostersund on a permanent deal last summer as the club completed their astonishing rise from Sweden’s fourth division to the top-ranked Allsvenska in just six seasons, the 26-year-old intends to use the opportunity to speak to Wenger about some of the Frenchman’s team selections that have left Arsenal trailing Premier League leaders Manchester City by 17 points before the halfway point of the season. “I want to exchange a few words with Wenger and ask him why he sets his team up as he does. That would be fun,” Mukiibi told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. “I want to talk with him about why he makes certain decisions. Maybe we can talk about my own future during the conversation? If I have a good match then…” Asked if he was in favour of Wenger standing down after more than 20 years in the hotseat, he added: “No, he can stay. But I still need to talk to him about those starting line-ups.” Potter, who had spells as a player at Birmingham, West Bromwich Albion, Stoke, Southampton and York before being handed his opportunity in Sweden six years ago, led Ostersund to the Swedish Cup last year and has been linked with a potential return to English football one day. Yet even he would have had to pinch himself when they were paired with Arsenal, with Mukiibi admitting he could not believe his eyes. “I started laughing to myself. I sent messages to the guys while just yelling out. It’s sick,” he said. “We will play the team I’ve followed for my whole life. Who could have predicted it? It’s a dream. It’s about hitting your targets as a football player. I had hoped to play for Arsenal at the Emirates, but now I can play against them in the same stadium. Life works in mysterious ways.” With the first leg taking place in Sweden on 15 February before the return leg a week later, Mukiibi is confident his side are capable of coming away with a lead, despite the tie taking place several weeks before the start of the new domestic season. “We are going there to try and win the match and to enjoy the experience,” he said. “We’ve achieved this for Ostersund and for all of Sweden. I don’t even want to take a break over the winter – I want to work out all the time! “In my opinion we’re facing one of the best teams in the world, but we’ve played our best matches against the strongest opposition. Graham Potter can probably find some weaknesses in Arsenal and at home we are strong.” The draw also paired Celtic with Zenit St Petersburg after Brendan Rodgers’ side finished third in their Champions League group, with the first leg in Glasgow on 15 February and the Russian side to host the second leg a week later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/11/saracens-clermont-auvergne-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T19:47:50Z","webTitle":"Alivereti Raka grabs hat-trick as Clermont Auvergne maul Saracens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/11/saracens-clermont-auvergne-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/11/saracens-clermont-auvergne-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Alivereti Raka grabs hat-trick as Clermont Auvergne maul Saracens","bodyText":"Perhaps Saracens will wish the doors stayed closed after all. The European champions have swept all before them on the continent in recent years but this was a record thrashing at the hands of Clermont, irate that this contest was not played on Sunday, every bit as resounding as the scoreline suggests. Alivereti Raka scored three of their six tries and was near untouchable on the left wing, Morgan Parra imperious at scrum-half and Fritz Lee a colossus despite his yellow card. But Saracens simply could not shake the snow off the roof. Defensively they were dreadful, missing a staggering 37 tackles and they played nothing like a side who were unbeaten in their previous 20 European matches – a run that dates back to the 2015 semi-final defeat by Clermont. In fact, they looked far more like a side who have now lost six matches in a row – everyone involved at the club dismissed talk of crisis last week but that may need to be reconsidered after Clermont cruised to the top of the pool and went some way to avenging last season’s defeat in the final. It also goes down as a worst European Cup weekend for English clubs with all seven defeated but it is perhaps Saracens who nurse the largest wounds. “We didn’t see it coming,” the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, said. “[The postponement] did not feel like it affected us. It’s not really relevant but it’s amazing what a couple of early tries for the opposition can do for your confidence. We missed so many tackles, which is unlike us. By the end of January we hope we can be proud of ourselves at how we respond to this situation we are in.” Clermont meanwhile, played like the caged animals that we thought they might, having spent Sunday stranded at their hotel, unsure of when the match would be rearranged. They made bold statements beforehand about how they felt they had been treated but none rings louder than inflicting a record European defeat on the champions. And that they did so with three fly-halves on the injured list should not be forgotten, either. It did not feel right that these two European heavyweights slugged it out in front of about 2,000 hardy souls who braved the elements for this rearranged fixture, but that the 80 or so Clermont supporters were the most audible, told plenty about their determination in the face of adversity and no little about just how poor Saracens were throughout. Their defence is heralded as the Wolfpack – for the most part they tackled more like wallflowers. The departure of Brad Barritt after just three minutes, and all the organisational qualities he brings, undoubtedly contributed but it is unheard of for Saracens to miss 16 tackles within half an hour. It cost them three tries, all of them taken smartly by Clermont’s flying Fijian winger Raka – who we are likely to see turning out for France in the Six Nations – in the second quickest hat-trick in European Cup history. Wesley Fofana, meanwhile, was absent from the final in May with injury but he began in a manner intent of making up for it. Saracens had been given plenty of warning before his inside ball put Raka away for his first score, Jamie George slipping off the tackle all too easily. Damian Penaud was a late introduction to the starting XV but even at 21 the diminutive centre has a burgeoning reputation and his slippery running was evidence of why. It was his initial break that yielded Raka’s second try, with Fofana again playing a key role, carving inside from the left wing. The third was the lowest ebb hit in the first half by Saracens. Their scrum was marmalised, the Clermont penalty kicked to the corner before Parra ghosted through the defence and fed Raka inside him to cruise under the posts. Saracens needed a swift response and it came just before the half-hour – a penalty kicked to the corner resulting in a penalty try with Lee sent to the sin-bin. A chance then, for Saracens to make back ground before the interval but their cause was hampered by Richard Wigglesworth’s departure to injury. Parra added a penalty before three Saracens penalties were kicked to the corner, yet each opportunity was wasted. Clermont were not without their injury problems themselves – Sitaleki Timani and Judicael Cancoriet both making way – but when Raka set off on a stunning 60-metre run, beating four Saracens defenders before putting the replacement Flip van der Merwe over for a wondrous try soon after the break, the visitors had the bonus point and a commanding 24-point lead. Another penalty from the flawless Parra further twisted the knife – as did the try Fofana deserved that came in between them. George Kruis’s late try at least took the home side into double figures but Isaia Toeava’s late score ensured the margin of Clermont’s victory eclipsed Saracens’ 2006 defeat by Biarritz. In addition, it is Saracens’ first European defeat at Allianz Park and the most points they have ever conceded in the competition. They do not need reminding that they face Clermont away on Sunday.

Children will be allowed to bring their phones to school, but not allowed to get them out at any time until they leave, even during breaks. A proposed ban was included in Emmanuel Macron’s successful presidential election campaign this year. Jean-Michel Blanquer, the French education minister, said the measure would come into effect from the start of the next school year in September 2018. It will apply to all pupils from the time they start school at age of six – up to about 15 when they start secondary school. Blanquer said some education establishments already prohibited pupils from using their mobiles. “Sometimes you need a mobile for teaching reasons … for urgent situations, but their use has to be somehow controlled,” he told RTL radio. The minister said the ban was also a “public health message to families”, adding: “It’s good that children are not too often, or even at all, in front of a screen before the age of seven.” The French headteachers’ union was skeptical that the ban could be enforced. “This new announcement from the [education] ministry leaves us dubious because we’re having trouble understanding what is the real issue here. In general, we’re used to them being logical and pragmatic about things, and here, we can’t find the logic or the pragmatism in the announcements,” said Philippe Vincent, the union’s deputy general secretary. Outside one middle school in the centre of Paris, pupils asked about the measure seemed unimpressed. “I don’t understand how it will work. Who will take the phones, where will they put them … how will we get them back?” said one 13-year-old boy. At another school, Mathilde, 12, said: “It’s ridiculous. At my school, we don’t use them in class or during recess, so what’s the problem? If anyone’s caught using one in the toilets or at lunchtime, the phones are confiscated immediately and the person is given detention.” Parents seemed uncertain too. “It’s probably a good idea when the kids are in school, but they can’t ban them bringing them to school,” said Sabine. “My daughter goes to school and comes home on her own, and at this time of year it’s dark so early, so I want her to have a phone with her. It’s reassuring.” She added: “But rather than a ban, wouldn’t it be better to install a signal blocker in schools?” Blanquer has already suggested schools could install lockers for phones, though many city centre schools have little room for them. “Are we going to transform a school into a giant locker?” said Vincent. “I’ve done a little calculation myself: 5,300 state schools with an average 500 pupils each, that makes around 3 million lockers.” Parents’ organisations say any ban would pose a significant logistical problem. “How is the school going to stock them? And how are they going to make sure they’re given back to the owner at the end of school?” Gérard Pommier, head of the Federation of Parents in State Schools. Education officials are now studying how the mobile ban can be put into effect. “In ministerial meetings, we leave our phones in lockers before going in. It seems to me that this as doable for any human group, including a class,” Blanquer said in September. The minister has also supported the introduction of school uniforms, but has said he is opposed to the measure being obligatory throughout the country. He has also announced that each school must set up a choir before January 2019. Le Parisien newspaper said the government had set aside €20m for the measure. Government officials said joining the choir would be voluntary and a “complement to obligatory music lessons” that exist already"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/11/astronomers-to-check-interstellar-body-for-signs-of-alien-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T19:51:50Z","webTitle":"Astronomers to check interstellar body for signs of alien technology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/11/astronomers-to-check-interstellar-body-for-signs-of-alien-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/11/astronomers-to-check-interstellar-body-for-signs-of-alien-technology","fields":{"headline":"Astronomers to check interstellar body for signs of alien technology","bodyText":"Astronomers are to use one of the world’s largest telescopes to check a mysterious object that is speeding through the solar system for signs of alien technology. The Green Bank telescope in West Virginia will listen for radio signals being broadcast from a cigar-shaped body which was first spotted in the solar system in October. The body arrived from interstellar space and reached a peak speed of 196,000 mph as it swept past the sun. Scientists on the Breakthrough Listen project, which searches for evidence of alien civilisations, said the Green Bank telescope would monitor the object, named ‘Oumuamua, from Wednesday. The first phase of observations is expected to last 10 hours and will tune in to four different radio transmission bands. “Most likely it is of natural origin, but because it is so peculiar, we would like to check if it has any sign of artificial origin, such as radio emissions,” said Avi Loeb, professor of astronomy at Harvard University and an adviser to the Breakthrough Listen project. “If we do detect a signal that appears artificial in origin, we’ll know immediately.” The interstellar body, the first to be seen in the solar system, was initially spotted by researchers on the Pan-Starrs telescope, which the University of Hawaii uses to scan the heavens for killer asteroids. Named after the Hawaiian word for “messenger”, the body was picked up as it swept past Earth at 85 times the distance to the moon. While many astronomers believe the object is an interstellar asteroid, its elongated shape is unlike anything seen in the asteroid belt in our own solar system. Early observations of ‘Oumuamua show that it is about 400m long but only one tenth as wide. “It’s curious that the first object we see from outside the solar system looks like that,” said Loeb. The body is now about twice as far from Earth as the sun, but from that distance the Green Bank telescope can still detect transmissions as weak as those produced by a mobile phone. Loeb said that while he did not expect Green Bank to detect an alien transmission, it was worth checking. “The chances that we’ll hear something are very small, but if we do, we will report it immediately and then try to interpret it,” Loeb said. “It would be prudent just to check and look for signals. Even if we find an artefact that was left over and there are no signs of life on it, that would be the greatest thrill I can imagine having in my lifetime. It’s really one of the fundamental questions in science, perhaps the most fundamental: are we alone?” The Breakthrough Listen project was launched at the Royal Society in London in 2015, when the Cambridge cosmologist Stephen Hawking announced the effort to listen for signs of life on planets that orbit the million stars closest to Earth. The $100m project is funded by the internet billionaire Yuri Milner, and has secured time on telescopes in the US and Australia to search for alien civilisations. Astronomers do not have good ideas about how such elongated objects could be created in asteroid belts. By studying ‘Oumuamua more closely, they hope to learn how they might form and whether there are others in the solar system that have so far gone unnoticed. “If it’s of natural origin, there should be many more of them,” Loeb said. Previous work on the body found it to be extremely dark red, absorbing about 96% of light that falls on it. The colour is associated with carbon-based molecules on comets and asteroids. If, as expected, the telescope fails to pick up any intelligent broadcasts from ‘Oumuamua, the observations are still expected to aid scientists in understanding the body. Other signals detected by the Green Bank telescope could shed light on whether the object is shrouded in a comet-like cloud of gas, and reveal whether it is carrying water and ice through the solar system. • This article was amended on 12 December 2017.

The platform’s list of the most often geotagged cities in 2017 did not differ significantly to that of 2016. In this year’s statistics, London fell one position to third place, Barcelona entered the top 10 and 2016’s No 8, Rio de Janeiro, dropped off the list entirely after it fell out of the spotlight after the Olympic Games. Only the US and Russia – thought to have the largest Instagram audiences of any country worldwide – were represented twice. Los Angeles is in sixth place and New York City once again at No 1, ahead of Moscow in second-place and St Petersburg in seventh. Europe was also represented by London (#3), Paris (#5), Istanbul (#9) and Barcelona (#10). Other lists from Instagram revealed hotspots within them. All but one of the 10 most often tagged museums were in New York, Los Angeles or London: the Musée du Louvre, in the top spot. (In 10th place was Los Angeles’ Museum of Ice Cream, an attraction specifically geared “to look good on Instagram”.) The Louvre came in at No 7 of “the most-Instagrammed locations” of the year, overwhelmingly dominated by those in the US. Disneyland in Anaheim, California, was top – ahead of Times Square and Central Park in New York. The only featured location in Asia was a US import: Tokyo Disneyland. In fact, neither Asia nor South America featured prominently on any list from Instagram. Both continents were represented by just two cities: São Paulo (#4) and Jakarta (#8, up from #10 in 2016).

My partner has caught our son’s chicken pox and her symptoms are frightening me. Vice-like headache. Aversion to light. Brain fog. Also, I am pregnant and my habit of catastrophising has sprouted horns, and, pumped up on hormones, my heart is working twice as hard as usual. Nausea is now approaching something more … cataclysmic. My phone starts autocorrecting “morning” to “meningitis”. I become convinced that my partner has developed brain swelling, a rare complication of chicken pox. From here, it is a short step to picturing her dying and me giving birth alone, letting the worst case scenario in like an old friend. The thing is, this time I am right. Sort of. She does have meningitis. The GP takes one look at her and sends her up to the infectious diseases ward in a taxi. I feel a tiny bit triumphant in the way only catastrophisers can. See? I told you. The worst has happened! But I’m also wrong: a tiny wad of catastrophe may have been fired at us, but my partner does not die and I do not give birth alone. She recovers. The baby is born. We are lucky again. Time and again during the hardest year of my life (to date, the catastrophiser in me would like to qualify), my habit of fearing that the worst will happen got, well, worse. I don’t know when it began, so peculiarly subtle is the feeling that the most likely outcome is the really bad one. But this year some of my most calamitous predictions came true, at least in part. The realisation that I needed to do something about it came when my partner, who is a psychotherapist, arrived home with a book. “I saw this and thought of you,” she said. It was called Why Does Everything Always Go Wrong?. I laughed a bit too hard. The truth is, there was a lot to catastrophise about this year, on a global, national and personal level. Just before the meningitis episode I discovered that the baby I was carrying was high risk for Down’s syndrome. While we awaited more results, my pregnancy was reduced to a series of statistics – one-in-58 chance of Down’s, one-in-100 risk of miscarriage with amniocentesis – and I grappled with the fact that someone has to be the “one”. In fact, I already knew what it was to be the one, because my son is autistic and, actually, we are all coping brilliantly; being the one is not a catastrophe once you are living it. But catastrophising does not give a damn about hard evidence and I remained terrified. A fortnight later, the results came in: the chance of the baby having Down’s was vastly reduced, to one in 10,000. It occurred to me that catastrophising is more than just a destructive habit: sometimes it is a reasonable response to what is happening, a kind of mental preparation. In April, my mother, who is incurably ill with breast cancer, got pneumonia and ended up in A&amp;E. She asked to see my sister and I, so I rushed to London from Edinburgh, five months pregnant, with a daughter (and dread) somersaulting in my belly. I feared the distress would make me lose the baby and I thought my mother was going to die. Catastrophisers have a habit of thinking a person is dead if they are half an hour late, so a situation like this suits our sense of drama perfectly. My mother recovered. We continued to live with the deep uncertainty that comes with scans every three months and the neverending wait for results. Each time, I prepared myself for the worst. Maybe this is not a habit to be broken, but a coping mechanism. By June, I had to make a major decision that provided an opportunity to see whether I could nix the catastrophising: how to have my baby. My son, who is four, was born by emergency C-section and so I was offered an elective caesarean. I saw a consultant who ran through the risks I faced if I attempted a natural birth without constant foetal monitoring and a cannula in my hand. I decided to laugh – or, at least, get off my head on laughing gas – in the face of potential catastrophe and attempted a natural birth on my own terms. I hired a doula to support me in hospital and – here is a first – hoped for the best. In August, my daughter was born 45 minutes after I arrived in hospital. It was a short, fierce and mind-blowing natural labour. It was not perfect – I had an episiotomy and there was a minor Strep B scare that meant we ended up in A&amp;E twice in the first week after her birth – but it was one of the best days of my life (to date, the optimist in me would like to qualify). How am I trying to break my habit of catastrophising? Not by deep breathing, yoga, therapy, drugs or imagining all the catastrophes I fear floating away down a river. Talking and thinking have helped in the daily maintenance of perspective, which is catastrophising’s greatest enemy. Has this year been about the worst happening (and I write this a week after my beloved dog has had four tumours removed from her powerful, young body) or about a series of narrow escapes? Is it about bad luck or survival? After all, my partner recovered. The baby is perfect. My mother is still here. The dog is walking off the lead again. We are lucky. Catastrophising is dependent on you never being in the moment: it constantly shoves you up against an unknowable, uncontrollable future. Once you go there, you are lost. Parenting, so often a source of anxiety, has been the best antidote to this. The hard graft and small, pure joys of looking after a baby and a little boy with autism anchor me to the present. The baby keeps me healthy, makes me feel lucky and gives me a constant dose of perspective. She is also exhausting: I am too tired and busy to catastrophise with as much fervour as the habit demands. Then there is my brilliantly singular, loving and brave son. Before he was diagnosed with autism (that happened this year, too) I feared this moment: how will we manage? What will we do about school? How will he develop? Is everything going to be OK? The mystery and idiosyncrasy of autism can be frustrating, but it is also a visceral reminder that none of us knows what lies ahead and that compassion is the most powerful weapon against anxiety. So, here I am, living and thriving in the future over which I once catastrophised. And you know what? It is not so scary after all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/20/the-tv-quiz-of-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T16:00:18Z","webTitle":"The TV quiz of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/20/the-tv-quiz-of-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/20/the-tv-quiz-of-2017","fields":{"headline":"The TV quiz of 2017","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2017/dec/20/hadley-freemans-style-quiz-of-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T16:00:18Z","webTitle":"Hadley Freeman's style quiz of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/dec/20/hadley-freemans-style-quiz-of-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/dec/20/hadley-freemans-style-quiz-of-2017","fields":{"headline":"Hadley Freeman's style quiz of 2017","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/12/syrian-opposition-urges-russia-to-rescue-un-peace-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"Syrian opposition urges Russia to rescue UN peace talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/syrian-opposition-urges-russia-to-rescue-un-peace-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/12/syrian-opposition-urges-russia-to-rescue-un-peace-talks","fields":{"headline":"Syrian opposition urges Russia to rescue UN peace talks","bodyText":"Russia has been urged by the Syrian opposition to salvage the UN’s peace talks in Geneva this week by persuading the Syrian government delegation finally to begin direct face-to-face discussions. Basma Kodami, a leading member of the Syrian opposition negotiating team, urged the Russians to show they wanted to capitalise on the end of military operations in Syria by building a lasting peace. The opposition was not seeking President Bashar al-Assad’s removal from office as a precondition for talks, she said, but his departure remained its objective. She said she could not see how Assad could ever be regarded as a legitimate candidate in freshpresidential elections overseen by the UN. She said the focus of the talks this week should be a new constitutional process and arrangements for a presidential election, not Assad’s future. Kodami said she believed Russia was putting pressure on the Syrian government delegation to negotiate seriously at Geneva in what is the eighth round of painfully slow talks. On Monday the government delegation returned to Geneva for a meeting with the UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura. It had left the city prematurely last week, claiming there was no point talking to an opposition that demanded Assad’s withdrawal, a stance that prompted De Mistura to warn he would judge this week whether any party was seeking to sabotage the process. In a sign that Syria is under some political pressure from Moscow, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said: “The parties must begin direct talks on issues of a new constitution and preparations for elections.” It is not clear whether Vladimir Putin underlined the message when he briefly visited Syria on Monday for a meeting with Assad, where he claimed a military victory and announced a partial troop drawdown. Many western diplomats are sceptical that Putin is willing to put pressure on Assad to start serious talks. Kodami said: “Our assumption is what is new about this round of talks is that Russia will be interested in finding, and help broker, a peaceful settlement because it has declared the end of military confrontation and so this time it wants a peace agreement in Syria so it can can claim it helped resolve the conflict. But it needs legitimate partners with which to have contact. “We need the Russians to weigh in on the Syrian government and they have the means to do so. This is the best moment for Russia to get a peaceful settlement and a final exit strategy.” Russia continues to discuss with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, an additional and possibly separate peace process to that of the UN. His aides on Monday again raised the idea of a Syrian congress on national dialogue – probably in February in Sochi, the Russian Black Sea resort. Russia officials have suggested the Sochi talks might lead to a more representative opposition than the negotiating team sent to Geneva. Kodami warned: “If Sochi is to support the UN process, it can be considered, but there is absolutely no clarity on what the Russians want to achieve. As a substitute for the UN it is a non-starter for us. We will not consider that in any shape or form.” She also urged the west not to leave the peace process to Russia: “The vast bulk of Syrian refugees in Europe will not return to Syria unless the country is safe. That does not mean no bombs falling from the sky, but a a country free from fear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/11/christian-benteke-apologises-crystal-palace-team-mates-penalty-miss-farce","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T22:32:46Z","webTitle":"Christian Benteke apologises to Crystal Palace team-mates for penalty farce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/11/christian-benteke-apologises-crystal-palace-team-mates-penalty-miss-farce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/11/christian-benteke-apologises-crystal-palace-team-mates-penalty-miss-farce","fields":{"headline":"Christian Benteke apologises to Crystal Palace team-mates for penalty farce","bodyText":"Christian Benteke has apologised to his Crystal Palace team-mates after wrestling the ball from the side’s regular penalty taker, Luka Milivojevic, and insisting on taking Saturday’s stoppage-time spot-kick against Bournemouth, with his weak attempt duly saved. The Belgium international, without a goal since May, was denied by Asmir Begovic as Palace slipped back to the bottom of the Premier League. Roy Hodgson and his players were furious at the diversion from protocol, with Milivojevic – who had scored a first-half equaliser from the spot – very much the team’s first-choice penalty taker, but Benteke apologised before training on Monday and will start against Watford on Tuesday attempting to make amends. “After the game I didn’t say much to him – it was a raw moment and he was disappointed,” said Hodgson. “I have spoken to him today and he has spoken to the rest of the players. I am happy with the way he’s reacted to it, and happy with how he explained that to the rest of the team. He had the courage to talk in front of the rest of the team, and basically apologise for not following instructions. “Sometimes you don’t need to kick someone when they are down. You just hope the player does what Benteke has done. At the first real opportunity – not in the dressing room afterwards but this morning – he said his piece. That is strong and the correct thing to do: he makes it clear he was wrong and disobeying ranks, and apologises for that, but now he will get on with it. He played very well on Saturday, let’s not forget.” Palace will seek to add a striker in January with Hodgson also targeting a goalkeeper to challenge Wayne Hennessey and Julián Speroni. Interest has been expressed in Espanyol’s Diego López, 36, who made his loan move a permanent switch from Milan only over the summer. But, having initially suffered from a knee injury, he lost his place to Pau López and has only played twice, in the Copa del Rey, this season. Scans on Mamadou Sakho’s calf have confirmed the Frenchman suffered a tear against Bournemouth which will rule him out until the new year. “It’s a serious muscle tear in his calf, so it’s weeks not days,” said Hodgson. “We’ll miss him. When you lose a player like that, you can’t be anything other than disappointed and sad.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/28/joy-relief-saying-no-how-learned-stop-worrying-turn-people-down","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T06:00:38Z","webTitle":"The joy and relief of saying no: how I learned to stop worrying and turn people down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/28/joy-relief-saying-no-how-learned-stop-worrying-turn-people-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/28/joy-relief-saying-no-how-learned-stop-worrying-turn-people-down","fields":{"headline":"The joy and relief of saying no: how I learned to stop worrying and turn people down","bodyText":"Throughout my life, I have revelled in saying yes. I should qualify that straight away by saying that, for the first half of my life, the only offers I got were social; saying yes to those was a joy. Doors were opened and my mind was stretched and then blown. I was lucky enough at the time to have a place to live and the means to put food on the table, so, no matter what went wrong, nothing could really hurt me. “Want to take part in a summer-long water pistol shootout in London?” “Sure.” “Would you like to play a 7ft red crocodile for a photo shoot with Julie Walters?” “Yes, please.” “Will you fly to Istanbul tomorrow and take 40 drunk businessmen to the Champions League final?” “You bet.” As I became a freelance writer, then a company director, some of the offers became career opportunities. Again, saying yes by default worked like a dream. It put me in rooms I could never have imagined being in and won me contracts I had no right to win. Even having no money was kind of liberating – it meant I couldn’t lose anything. The mantra that you should say yes to everything is nothing new (much like the cliche about asking for forgiveness, not permission, although that doesn’t sound so good in the post-Weinstein era). “If someone offers you an amazing opportunity and you are not sure you can do it, say yes. Then learn how to do it later,” Richard Branson once said. At first, this approach worked for me. It was great to collaborate towards a joint end and to feel genuinely that I was adding value to lots of projects. I have never been very good at asking people for favours, because I always assume people will be too busy to help me, but I have learned that not everyone has this hangup. Long-lost relatives got in touch asking me to help with their court cases; friends of friends enlisted my help to write their communications strategies; total strangers wanted to pick my brains about their new ideas. My workload soon started to get out of hand. I was making so many promises that I couldn’t remember who I was letting down from one day to the next. Every time the phone rang or my inbox pinged, it was another person asking for help or chasing up the help they had already solicited. My wonderful portfolio career, filled with interesting and engaging projects, had turned into a roll call of accusations. All the individual projects seemed to merge into a ball of pain. I realised I had developed a subconscious animosity towards the people for whom I was working. Instead of being clients or colleagues, they had become an annoyance. To make matters worse, much of the work I was struggling to do was unpaid. I was getting into debt because my to-do list was so full that I was turning down paid work. About three years ago, I realised the only way to stop saying sorry was to start saying no. At first, this was incredibly hard. People had come to expect my compliance and it took time for them to get used to the hard-nosed version of me. I was racked with guilt and felt self-centred and mean. But, to my surprise, most people seemed to understand. I would explain that I was simply too busy to help – and that turned out to be OK. We are all at the centre of our own lives, so it is understandable that we think we are at the centre of everyone else’s; in reality, we are nowhere near as vital as we think. If you are not around to help, people will find another solution. I realised quickly that there was no need to complicate things or to make excuses. My time is mine; I don’t need to apologise for using it as I wish. If you are tired of being a yes person, honesty is the best way to go. Making up excuses about sick relatives or imaginary immovable appointments only creates a web of lies to negotiate. I am also learning not to talk myself into more work. Just because I can do something doesn’t mean I should. It is great to be helpful, but there is a value in sitting on your hands and biting your lip. The aim of all this is to reduce the complexity of my life. Now, I try to work on no more than three projects in a day. Splitting attention between multiple tasks can leave you feeling out of control. We are social beasts. No matter what the capitalists tell you, life is a dance, not a race. We are hardwired to want to help each other, so saying no doesn’t always come naturally. I still say yes way too often. But I am getting much better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/11/apple-buys-shazam-music-app","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T19:42:26Z","webTitle":"Game that tune: Apple snaps up Shazam for reported $400m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/11/apple-buys-shazam-music-app","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/11/apple-buys-shazam-music-app","fields":{"headline":"Game that tune: Apple snaps up Shazam for reported $400m","bodyText":"Apple has bought Shazam, a London-based app that allows smartphone users to identify music, for a reported $400m (£300m). The US company, which revolutionised music with the introduction of the the iPod and iPhone, said Shazam was a natural fit for its Apple Music streaming service. “Apple Music and Shazam are a natural fit, sharing a passion for music discovery and delivering great music experiences to our users,” said Apple. Neither side would officially say how much Apple had paid, but a figure of about $400m has been reported, less than half the $1bn the app was last valued at when it tapped investors for cash in 2015. A spokesman for Shazam, which was founded in 1999, said: “ Shazam is one of the highest rated apps in the world and loved by hundreds of millions of users and we can’t imagine a better home for Shazam to enable us to continue innovating and delivering magic for our users.” The purchase is Apple’s biggest acquisition since it bought rapper Dr Dre’s headphones company Beats Electronics for $3bn in 2014. Shazam is the latest in a string of British tech firms to be snapped up by overseas companies since the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote. Microchip designer ARM Holdings was sold to Japan’s Softbank for £24bn last year. Hertfordshire-based Chipmaker Imagination Technologies was sold to China-backed private equity firm Canyon Bridge for £550m earlier this year. Shazam, which creates “acoustic fingerprints” of music and returns song information and links for smartphone owners to buy or listen the tune, has been downloaded more than 1bn times. The app is already used by Apple’s assistant Siri, allowing users to ask: “What song is playing?” Although Shazam is popular with smartphone users it has struggled to make much money, with revenues of $54m in 2016. Shazam was formed in Hammersmith, west London, by a group of friends frustrated that they often had trouble identifying the names of songs they liked on the radio. Shazam started before smartphones and iTunes, so to use the service people had to call a number, put their phone up to the radio, then receive a text identifying the song. Dhiraj Mukherjee, one of its co-founders, has complained in an interview with the Guardian that the invention was too ahead of its time. “People even now say, ‘Oh, it’s a great idea.’ In the end, that was not necessarily an advantage [for me]. Being ahead of the market has consequences as well.” Mukherjee, who has left the company, said he could not cope with stress of working at a startup. “I used to work 16- to 18-hour days and I would honestly not have had the stamina over 15 or 16 years [to stay with Shazam]. I have a wife and three kids and they test my stamina in different ways. “When you’ve been an entrepreneur, you seek opportunity in a situation, whereas if you’re not you see obstacles or risk or challenges. The rule of thumb is: don’t go bankrupt, live to fight one more day.” Of the original team behind the app, Mukherjee, Chris Barton, Philip Inghelbrecht and Avery Wang, only Wang remains. It took 14 years before Shazam crossed over into profitability last year, largely thanks to advertising revenues. The company had earlier planned to float on the stock market at a suggested valuation of $1bn. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/11/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T21:00:15Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/11/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/11/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A photo caption that referred to “the lighthouse at Whitburn, Sunderland” lost its way: the lighthouse pictured is in Roker, Sunderland, more than a mile south of Whitburn, which itself is not in Sunderland but over the borough border in South Tyneside (Cold snap brings a blanket of snow across the north, 1 December, page 10). • Homophone corner: “I went to concerts … I was enthralled by the velvet base of the African American Paul Robeson at the city’s Hippodrome” (Recalling Coventry’s great cultural heyday, 11 December, page 28). • Other recently corrected articles include: After snakes and grubs, Kezia Dugdale steps out of the jungle into the bearpit Blue Planet II: from octopus v shark to fish that crawl, the series’s biggest discoveries Coventry named UK city of culture 2021 Senate strikes tax exemption for college linked to Betsy DeVos"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/11/nhs-trust-will-greatly-miss-bob-kerslake","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T19:18:06Z","webTitle":"NHS trust will greatly miss Bob Kerslake | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/11/nhs-trust-will-greatly-miss-bob-kerslake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/11/nhs-trust-will-greatly-miss-bob-kerslake","fields":{"headline":"NHS trust will greatly miss Bob Kerslake","bodyText":"Your report on Lord Kerslake’s resignation as chair of King’s College Hospital, London (Head of top NHS trust quits over cash squeeze, 11 December) finishes with a statement from NHS Improvement saying “We will replace him with a highly experienced chair to take charge of the trust’s position”.

Is it time we moved on?","bodyText":"Here’s a phrase you don’t hear very often: last week, a short story went viral. Cat Person by Kristen Roupenian was published in the New Yorker and I heard so many people arguing about it I briefly felt like a member of the Dickensian public in the heady days of The Pickwick Papers. It’s easy to see why this story caught fire: it shows, with heartbreaking control, how two people can see a relationship completely differently, telling themselves their own narratives. Relationships, as the cliche goes, are complicated. I’ve been hearing variations of this phrase a lot recently. Last week JK Rowling issued a statement defending the casting of Johnny Depp in the upcoming Fantastic Beasts. Rowling, who is clearly A Good Thing, has spoken out frequently in defence of women. Depp, on the other hand, is decidedly A Debatable Thing, given that his now ex-wife, Amber Heard, said in a sworn declaration, “During the entirety of our relationship, Johnny Depp has been verbally and physically abusive to me.” Photos of Heard’s bruised face, bruises she said were caused by Depp, and a video of him smashing things and shouting at her, were posted online. Rowling suggested that she was doing what Heard and Depp said they wanted, in a joint statement released last year after their divorce was finalised: letting them “get on with their lives”. “Based on our understanding of the circumstances, the film-makers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies,” Rowling wrote. Her statement was reminiscent of the one made by Lena Dunham and her Girls co-writer Jenni Konner last month, after their colleague, writer Murray Miller, was accused of sexual assault: “While our first instinct is to listen to every woman’s story, our insider knowledge of Murray’s situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year,” they wrote. Relationships are complicated, but apparently Rowling, Konner and Dunham have a special insight. Konner and Dunham later apologised, though Miller still denies the claims, but Rowling is standing firm. You don’t need to #believeallwomen, as the unhelpfully simplistic hashtag has it. But you should not dismiss them either just because it’s more convenient or comfortable to do so. Despite the new wave of wokeness about sexual assault, attitudes towards domestic abuse remain stubbornly retrograde: women lie, you know – and hey, even if it’s true, it’s not like he was grabbing women off the street, right? Relationships can be volatile, and we all know that a woman really knows how to push her boyfriend’s buttons. As Fantastic Beasts’ director David Yates put it: “With Johnny, it seems to me there was one person who took a pop at him and claimed something. I can only tell you about the man I see every day: he’s full of decency and kindness, and that’s all I see.” Much like the (not Jewish) Kens Loach and Livingstone insisting they never saw any antisemitism in the Labour party, therefore it’s not a problem; Depp never hit Yates, so clearly he can’t be a wife batterer. Personally, I don’t understand why anyone would cast Depp in anything, given he hasn’t looked more than half-awake on screen in a decade. If you’re going to spend $20m on an actor, why not hire Brad Pitt or George Clooney, or literally anyone else? Then you wouldn’t have to issue all those word-salad statements defending his casting. Think of all the salad you’d save! Two women a week in England and Wales are killed by their partner or ex-partner. Yes, women do hit their male partners, too, sometimes; but the numbers pale by comparison and the fight is not equal. A woman can be at serious risk of death; these deaths are so common they only make the news if the man also kills himself, their children, or both. Maybe one day domestic abusers will be treated as pariahs in the way sexual harassers currently are – although given how many beloved men in the public eye that would rule out, from Geoffrey Boycott to Mike Tyson, maybe that would just leave too many job openings. Cat Person stayed with me because it showed how resistant people can be to ominous signs in a male partner, even those apparent right from the get-go. You’re being paranoid, women tell themselves. You’re the horrible one, not him! But in the end, what was always right in front of you is revealed to be all there is.

If you’re primarily a laptop user, who occasionally wants to take just the screen with you and needs some brawn for your processing duties, the Surface Book 2 is the machine for you. But getting your head around what the machine can do is the first challenge. With the screen attached like a laptop it behaves just like any other Windows 10 laptop with an interesting hinge. Press the detach key and the screen pops off, turning into a full tablet PC with up to five hours of battery life. But you can also turn the screen over and re-attach it to the base to either have the screen facing away from the keyboard, or folded down to make an angled drawing pad. It means you can go from a laptop one minute to a note-taking tablet the next to a graphics tablet thereafter. In every situation the Surface Book 2 excels, thanks to some accessories, including the excellent Surface Pen and Dial. There are a few caveats. The screen on its own is thin and light for a PC tablet, but I would not be comfortable taking it out and about on its own as it doesn’t feel as robust as the Surface Pro or similar. As a laptop, the fulcrum hinge extends out further away from the user than a traditional laptop hinge would, meaning the base of the laptop is quite long and I struggled to fit it between my gut and the back of the seat in front of me on a train. On a desk, though, the Surface Book 2 is arguably the best Windows laptop available. The keyboard is brilliant – better than most dedicated keyboards. The trackpad is a bit clicky but smooth and precise, while the screen is crisp, beautiful and bright. The machine also runs cool. The only time I could detect the fans going was when playing XCOM 2, and even then they weren’t very loud. Most of the time the Surface Book 2 was completely silent. Battery life was solid, but not as spectacular as Microsoft’s quoted 17 hours might suggest. With 10 or so tabs open in Chrome and with Spotify, NextgenReader, Windows Mail, Typora and Affinity Photo open at different times, as well as 45 minutes of watching video on Netflix with the tablet detached (and all with recommended brightness and recommended power mode active), the Surface Book 2 lasted around nine hours before powering down. The tablet alone would easily last around three hours of movie watching, or more with the brightness turned down. Specifications Screen: 13.5in LCD 3000 x 2000 (267 ppi) Processor: Intel Core i5 or i7 (7 or 8th generation) RAM: 8 or 16GB Storage: 256, 512 or 1TB Operating system: Windows 10 Camera: 8MP rear, 5MP front-facing Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, USB 3.0, USB-C, SD, Surface Connector Laptop dimensions: 232 x 312 x 23mm Laptop weight: 1.533 or 1.642Kg Tablet weight: 719g Windows 10 Pro The Surface Book 2 runs the same version of Windows 10 as any other modern PC, which in this case is the Autumn or Fall Creators Update. Since the launch of the first Surface Book, Windows 10 has become more efficient, with various battery saving settings that can make a real difference when using the screen in tablet mode. With plenty of useful gestures, excellent stylus and accessory support, and a modern design, the Fall Creators Update is the most well thought out, fastest and slick version of Windows 10 yet. There are still the legacy bits, such as parts of the Control Panel and back-end tools that look like they came straight from Windows XP 16 years ago, but Microsoft’s progressive modernisation of the user interface means most will not have to encounter them unless something breaks. USB-C, Surface Pen and Dial One of the important updates for the Surface Book 2 is Microsoft’s eventual acceptance of USB-C, which has increasingly become an important standard, not only for connecting accessories such as displays, but also for charging. The Surface Book 2 has one USB-C port, which will also charge the machine, alongside the Surface Connector. But unlike most other high-end machines, the USB-C port does not double as a Thunderbolt 3 port, which is a shame for such an expensive and otherwise capable computer. The Surface Book 2 will quite happily drive a 4K monitor at 60Hz, as you would expect, via the USB-C port, but if you want more than one display you’ll have to switch to the Surface Connector and Microsoft’s optional extra docking solution, which will drive two external displays, provide power and USB connectivity. The improved £100 Surface Pen is the best stylus in the business – accurate, with low latency, pressure and tilt sensing, it stays firmly attached to the side of the screen with magnets. It’s the first stylus that has not come off in my bag while transporting any machine. The new machine also supports Microsoft’s £90 Surface Dial rotary accessory, both on and off the screen similar to the company’s Surface Studio desktop computer. While using it on the screen can be a bit cramped, it works very well indeed. It will work as a general computing input for things like scrolling through web pages, zooming or adjusting the volume, and can be set to perform certain tasks on an app-by-app basis. It comes into its own when used with photo editors and other creative tools. In Affinity Photo, for instance, you can adjust brush sizes, change opacity and other settings, or you can put it on the screen and use it to rotate the image. There are plenty of ways to use it, and while it’s by no means a must-buy for most, creatives will certainly get their money’s worth out of it – particularly with the Surface Pen in the other hand. Observations The hinge has been improved, but it still has play when positioned Microsoft’s Windows Hello camera is great, recognising you and logging you in instantly Full sized SD card slot is a rarity in any machine in 2017 The speakers in the screen are loud and clear, making watching a film a pretty good experience You can charge the tablet without the keyboard using the Surface power adapter You need quite a powerful USB-C power adapter (at least 45 Watts) to safely charge the Surface Book 2 Price The Microsoft Surface Book 2 starts at £1,499 (buy here) for the base model with 256GB of storage, a 7th gen Core i5 (dual-core) and 8GB of RAM, but without a discrete graphics card in the keyboard. The 8th gen Core i7 (quad-core) version with 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM and a GeForce GTX 1050 discrete GPU costs £1,999 (buy here). The same Core i7 version with 512GB, 16GB of RAM and GPU costs £2,499 (buy here) and with 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM £2,999 (buy here). For comparison, Microsoft’s Surface Laptop starts at £979 (buy here), the Surface Pro starts at £799 (buy here), Apple’s 13in MacBook Pro starts at £1,249 (buy here) and Dell’s XPS 13 starts at £1,099 (buy here). Verdict The 13.5in Microsoft Surface Book 2 is an adaptable powerhouse of a computer. There aren’t many rivals that can double as a true hinged laptop, tablet and angle graphics tablet-style halfway house, particularly with the power of a discrete graphics card. Given that the minimum specification anyone should really buy if they’re considering the Surface Book 2 is the £1,999 model with the discrete graphics card and 8th-generation Core i7 chip, Microsoft’s do-it-all machine is very expensive. But you get a lot of computer for your money with some very neat party tricks. It’s not perfect, lacking Thunderbolt 3, but the Surface Book 2 is arguably the best Windows 10 power-user laptop going – plus you can take the screen off. Pros: excellent keyboard, great trackpad, brilliant screen, great stylus, 9-hour battery, fancy hinge, great 2-in-1 compromise, USB A, full-sized SD and USB-C, Windows Hello, Surface Dial support, 8th generation Core i7 chips, discrete GPU Cons: Windows still has tablet app gap, very expensive, relatively heavy, still a bit of play in the hinge, no Thunderbolt 3 Other reviews Microsoft Surface Laptop review: a USB-C short of the best Windows 10 laptop Microsoft Surface Pro review: very nearly almost the future of Windows PCs Apple 13” MacBook Pro (2017) review: battery life to get through a working day This article contains affiliate links to products.

The plan for the village of Lydbrook, Gloucestershire, may soon be joined by other schemes. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has indicated that the government may support other schemes to restore the beaver four centuries after it was driven to extinction in England and Wales. The beavers’ dam-building stores huge quantities of water and slows peak flows during flood events, potentially lessening devastating floods. Unofficial releases of beavers on to the River Otter in Devon have led to an official trial and similar schemes in Scotland last year led to the Scottish government declaring that the beaver would once again be recognised and protected as a native mammal. “The beaver has a special place in English heritage and the Forest of Dean proposal is a fantastic opportunity to help bring this iconic species back to the countryside,” said Gove. “The community of Lydbrook has shown tremendous support for this proposal and the beavers are widely believed to be a welcome addition to local wildlife.” Local people have welcomed the decision after months of uncertainty over whether the scheme, which was first proposed by the Forestry Commission, would be supported by central government. This is the first such scheme on government land. “We’re all very excited – it’s great news,” said Sid Phelps, a local Green councillor. “They’ve got the beavers in cages all ready to go and we have some good experts who know the beavers. The worst-case scenario is that they have little impact on flood alleviation but there are other spin-offs such as the benefit to local ecology and tourism. Someone came in the pub the other day to ask where the valley was. There is a lot of interest and we might even get Michael [Gove] himself down here to open the cage door.” The Forestry Commission is funding and overseeing the project on Greathough Brook, in which two adult beavers and two kits will be released into a 6.5 hectare enclosure surrounded by state-of-the-art fencing to ensure the beavers do not move into the wider landscape. The Forestry Commission will monitor the impact on wildlife – shown to be hugely beneficial – as well as recording the water flow in the brook. All the beavers will be fully tested for disease before they are released. Chris McFarling, a cabinet member of Forest of Dean district council, said: “Beavers are the most natural water engineers we could ask for. They’re inexpensive, environmentally friendly and contribute to sustainable water and flood management. “They slow the release of storm water with their semi-porous dams, decreasing the flooding potential downstream. Water quality is improved as a result of their activities. They also allow water to flow during drought conditions. Financially they are so much more cost-effective than traditional flood defence works so it makes sense to use this great value-for-money opportunity.” The government’s backing for the Lydbrook scheme is likely to trigger a rash of applications by wildlife charities to return beavers to river systems in England and Wales. New government guidance shows how Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog, will assess applications for licences. But environmental consultant and beaver expert Derek Gow warned that the new licensing conditions are vague and could prove so onerous in its monitoring requirements that other attempts to bring back beavers will be halted because they cost too much. “It’s a great decision by Michael Gove and its intent is quite clear – to prepare the way for the restoration of the species on a wider scale across England and Wales,” said Gow. “But I’m concerned by how future trials are funded as the new licensing system is introduced. We might be opening the stable door for the horse and then shutting it again when the horse is half way through.” According to Gow, vague-sounding requirements that make organisations reintroducing beavers responsible for all subsequent monitoring and recapture far into the future will prove prohibitively expensive. The Devon trial being undertaken by the Devon Wildlife Trust is costing more than £500,000, which the small charity must meet itself, while a trial in Scotland cost £2.2m. Gow added: “To make beaver reintroductions possible, we need very clear guidance now from Natural England and Defra on exactly what they want.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/11/university-vice-chancellors-salaries-in-the-spotlight","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T19:18:43Z","webTitle":"University vice-chancellors’ salaries in the spotlight | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/11/university-vice-chancellors-salaries-in-the-spotlight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/11/university-vice-chancellors-salaries-in-the-spotlight","fields":{"headline":"University vice-chancellors’ salaries in the spotlight","bodyText":"If rip-off fees guaranteed a university education of excellent quality they might be defensible. They do not. The university system is a self-serving bureaucracy whose sole aim is “bums on seats”, hence maximising financial returns and fat-cat salaries. The vice-chancellors are the most obvious targets with their grossly inflated salaries but there is a whole massive gravy train of pro-vice-chancellors, deputy-pro etc. Much of the actual work is done by poorly paid academics often on zero-hours contracts. One course I taught had 50 students in the first year, then 125 and 180 in subsequent years. The course was a nonsense with these vastly increased student numbers so I withdrew from teaching it after the first year. At another institution with which I was associated the principal spent hundreds of thousands on an unnecessary refurbishment of his suite of rooms while he was sacking “redundant” academics who were very close to retirement. All of this happened years ago but continues today. My view, based on decades of observation, is that university heads are frequently greedy, bullying incompetents with no detectable managerial skills and no commitment to the scholarship, teaching and research which are what universities are supposed to be about. Close examination of their salaries and performance is long overdue. Dr John Cookson Bournemouth, Dorset • Jeevan Vasagar says protests against vice-chancellors are motivated by their being seen as out of touch and by “inequality when university pensions face a shortfall” (Britain distrusts meritocracy: that’s the lesson from Bath University, theguardian.com, 6 December). Any “leader” who loses the confidence of their staff to the point where some of them throw biscuits at a meeting room window is rather more than “out of touch”. Further, executive pay has been an issue at Bath for many years, with the governing body ignoring many requests for transparency. Vasagar says Professor Glynis Breakwell’s success is demonstrated by the increase in research grants from £17m to £36m, and by the doubling of student numbers. Vice-chancellors do not bring in grants: staff do. Student numbers rose because more students were admitted. In 2015, the students’ union president wrote that “students are sleeping on sofas or friends’ bedroom floors, travelling from home, living out of hostels, sharing bedrooms (of up to four persons) … or considering not to continue their studies”, after management failed to plan accommodation for increased numbers. Vasagar believes that Professor Breakwell’s pay is a result of excellent performance. This case has never been made to the university community. Not even the governing body, I believe, sees the measures used to assess the vice-chancellor’s performance and set her pay. This lack of transparency led to the failures of governance criticised by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). Staff and students have now made clear their lack of confidence in the running of Bath. This has not happened overnight. Michael Carley President, University of Bath University and College Union • The debate around the remuneration of university vice-chancellors reached a new low with Andrew Adonis’s call for the archbishop of Canterbury to look into the issue (Report, 8 December). As a contributor to the current system of university finance he should appreciate the challenges faced by universities in the current environment and the distinct and rare combination of knowledge and skills needed to lead them. He should also realise that even the highest-paid vice-chancellor’s salary has no material effect on student fees. I’ve studied and worked under almost a dozen vice-chancellors, all outstanding scholars and leaders who have helped to create a higher education system that is the envy of the world. Universities are among the most complex organisations in existence, balancing multiple challenges that range from achieving research and teaching excellence across fields ranging from the humanities to sciences, medicine and engineering while contributing locally, nationally and globally culturally, socially and economically. The typical UK vice-chancellor has shown an ability to deal with these issues effectively. No wonder their talents are in demand globally, unlike the politicians with whom they are compared. The debate is a convenient sham. It takes attention away from the scandal of executive remuneration in British industry where governments have talked long and done nothing. Equally, it is a useful distraction from discussion about the real issues around university finances and student debt. If, however, Lord Adonis wants a financial issue for the archbishop to examine, perhaps the £70m a year cost of the Lords or the average cost of almost £100,000 for each of their lordships would be start. Emeritus Professor Tom Cannon Manchester • Regarding university vice-chancellors’ salaries, much the same thing happened when further education colleges were sort of privatised in 1992. A gravy train was constructed and rapidly exploited. Principals were told that they were running quasi-independent businesses and urged to emulate private sector practice. Not surprisingly, pay consultants were rapidly summoned and undertook benchmarking exercises that resulted in substantial pay rises for principals – what better way of guaranteeing annual consultancy fees from satisfied clients? There followed mergers and acquisitions, sales of once-public assets, dodgy deals, downward pressure on pay and conditions and insecure work contracts, all the glitz of the private sector in fact, and ever increasing rewards for the overburdened chief executives, as the principals were now called. Commerce rather than education became the order of the day. And has the student experience improved? I leave that to others to decide. Roy Boffy (Former senior adviser for further education, Dudley MBC), Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands • It is surely very paradoxical that the UK university sector, having fully embraced the mechanisms of the market and the principles of business, seems incapable of marketing itself positively to existing and potential consumers. Few days pass without a negative story being told about it. Accounts of rip-off fees for courses, grotesquely high salaries for its leaders, and inadequate contracts of employment and poor wages for other over-worked employees are quickly becoming the norm. Indeed, some of us, who once were proud to be university employees, are beginning to wonder if they are true, given the sector’s failure so far successfully to rebut them. David Halpin Kirk Deighton, North Yorkshire • Last week you reported (6 December) that the vice-chancellor of Birmingham University has an annual salary of £426,000. A few days later I received a letter asking whether, as a former student, I might like to volunteer to help current students. This “volunteering” apparently consists of making a donation of at least £100. I don’t have £100 to spare, but I could suggest where a slightly bigger sum might be found in-house. Anne Cowper Bishopston, Swansea • Your article on university attitudes to accelerated degrees (U-turn on two-year degrees predicted as fears grow over funding, 5 December) makes reference to Coventry University College’s “no frills” educational offer. Let’s be clear about what “no frills” actually means in this context. Coventry University College, or CU Coventry, as it’s now called, charges lower prices for its three-year degrees and claims to offer students a more flexible experience. But if you teach at CU Coventry – a subsidiary of Coventry University – “no frills” means you get paid much less than your colleagues at the university, your teaching year is much longer, your workload heavier, and you have no access to a decent occupational pension. About 40% of the teachers are paid by the hour and this “sweating of the assets” means there is a heavy turnover of staff. All of which helps to explain why these teachers are fighting hard for a union. Their colleagues at Coventry University can be in a number of unions that are recognised by the university. Appallingly though, the board of governors at CU Coventry decided recently to resist any approaches from unions at the college. CU Coventry’s “no frills” model is highly profitable. In 2016 it registered post-tax profits of £3.8m which it then gift-aided to its sole shareholder, Coventry University. The CEO of CU College is the pro-vice-chancellor of Coventry University and the board includes two deputy vice-chancellors and the university secretary. The university sector is currently beset by scandals over senior pay and perks, and it is right that a light is finally being shone on the murky world of remuneration committees. It is also time to take a proper look at the role of subsidiary companies and how they treat their staff.

Root and Trevor Bayliss, the England head coach, expressly told the players to behave before the Thursday night in Perth that resulted in Ben Duckett’s suspension from Lions duty for tipping a drink over Jimmy Anderson – and suggestions he was not alone in the caper. England insist their investigation into events has concluded, with no further action to be taken against others present that night. The midnight curfew is now restored – much to the chagrin of the squad members who know how to conduct themselves – and the focus is on the third Test which starts on Thursday. That it occurred in the same Avenue bar in Claremont where Bairstow’s now infamous “head-butt” greeting to Cameron Bancroft took place at the start of the tour has given rise to the perception of a squad out of control, something not helped by their being 2-0 down with three to play in what has been a faltering Ashes defence. “We need to rebuild the trust we had built over the last few years as a team,” said Bairstow, as the team’s representative at an event for Yorkshire Tea on Monday, the type of sponsors the England and Wales Cricket Board fears could be put off by such a sequence of events. “You rebuild it by winning games of cricket. You’ve got to go out and win games and that starts at training and then in the Test. The lads are still feeling positive and there is no reason we can’t go forward.” Asked if Root had been let down, replied: “I think everyone realises that is something we have done. And not just him. But we move on from that now. It is something that has been dealt with. We’ve got a chance as a group to go out there and front up.” Trust between the players, the ECB hierarchy and the security staff may also need rebuilding over the coming weeks, not least since it was the latter who flagged up the Duckett incident to the team management, who then decided to release the news pro-actively. Both of those calls were made in light of the Bairstow situation at the start of the tour, which only came to the attention of the ECB and the coaches four weeks after the event – during the Brisbane Test – when a local reporter put it to them. There is a feeling among the squad that the delay in exonerating Bairstow and the curfew which then resulted was an error. Those above them are in turn staggered that certain individuals seem unable to grasp the significance of representing their country, not least given that the brief relaxation of the midnight cut-off resulted in another incident. The responses of the ECB and the team management to two acts that may otherwise have been considered trivial have been shaped by the arrest of Ben Stokes in Bristol last September after a night out, the fallout from which continues to affect events on and off the field. Certainly Australia are keen to use this latest situation to their advantage, with their wicketkeeper, Tim Paine, saying he and his team-mates intend to sledge England’s players about it on the field when what has been an acrimonious series resumes at the Waca this week. “I’m sure someone will bring it up at some stage,” said Paine. “But what’s happening in their camp off the field has no effect on the way we’re going to go about our cricket this week. The time we start worrying about them is the time when we’re not thinking about our own backyard enough. It’s not going to affect the way our team plays.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/06/roger-goodell-contract-extension-nfl-commissioner","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T21:51:28Z","webTitle":"NFL commissioner Roger Goodell signs reported $200m contract extension","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/06/roger-goodell-contract-extension-nfl-commissioner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/06/roger-goodell-contract-extension-nfl-commissioner","fields":{"headline":"NFL commissioner Roger Goodell signs reported $200m contract extension","bodyText":"NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has signed a five-year contract extension, ending an extended standoff with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who had publicly voiced opposition to the pact. Pro Football Talk was first to report the news of Goodell’s extension, which is said to be worth roughly $200m over five years. The NFL’s compensation committee informed the league’s 32 owners on Wednesday that a “binding contract extension” had been signed with a “nearly unanimous consensus” in favor of finalizing the deal. While Goodell’s approximate annual salary of $40m is in line with his current contract, the New York Times reports that nearly 90% of the potential compensation may be withheld if a series of financial targets are not met. The extension comes at a time when the NFL has been dogged by an array of problems including falling television ratings, mounting player safety issues and a wave of national anthem protests that have divided audiences and incurred the wrath of the president of the United States. But Goodell, 58, has also overseen rapid revenue growth since he succeeded Paul Tagliabue as the NFL’s top executive in 2006, with the league expected to generate $14bn this year alone. Other accomplishments include the launch of the Thursday Night Football franchise and further expansion into international markets, most notably with a growing series of overseas games in the United Kingdom. Jones spoke out against Goodell’s extension starting in August after the commissioner suspended Cowboys star running back Ezekiel Elliott for his role in a domestic violence case, although Jones denied his dissent had anything to do with the punishment. Once Elliott’s legal appeals were finally exhausted, Jones threatened to sue the members of the six-man compensation committee – comprised of the owners of the Chiefs, the Falcons, the Giants, the Patriots, the Steelers and the Texans – to put a stop to the negotiations before finally dropping the threat in November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/06/vancouver-canada-homeless-project-protest-court","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T22:02:40Z","webTitle":"Vancouver protesters ordered to stop blocking homeless housing project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/06/vancouver-canada-homeless-project-protest-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/06/vancouver-canada-homeless-project-protest-court","fields":{"headline":"Vancouver protesters ordered to stop blocking homeless housing project","bodyText":"A court in Canada has ordered protesters in a Vancouver neighbourhood to stop interfering with efforts to build temporary accommodation for the homeless, bringing an end to a bitter debate triggered by the city’s housing crisis. “We respect people’s rights to protest, but blocking the construction of much-needed housing for the homeless is not something the city can accept,” Gregor Robertson, the mayor of Vancouver, said in a statement responding to the court’s decision. Controversy erupted after the city announced earlier this year that a 78-unit project would be built in Marpole, a neighbourhood in south Vancouver. The development is part of a wider effort to create 600 units of temporary housing across the city, as Vancouver grapples with record levels of homelessness. Protesters – armed with placards and posters and swelling to as many as 200 people at times – began descending on the site. Some pointed to the project’s proximity to nearby schools, including an elementary school across the street. Others highlighted plans for a mix of tenants that they said could include people with an extensive criminal history and a high risk of reoffending. “We’re not against modular homes for the homeless people, that is not the issue. It’s just that the location is very, very wrong,” one protester told CTV News. “It’s so close to vulnerable children. Kids were out during recess and they came up to the fence,” noted another. The city said the site, which would be tailored for people aged 45 and over, would be managed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by an agency with experience in supportive and low-income housing. It had struck a five-year contract with a developer to use the land, after which it would either extend the contract or seek to move people into permanent housing. Last week the city said that construction of the project was being delayed by several protesters who were physically blocking entrance to the site. After infraction notices did little to dissuade the protesters, the city said it had been forced to file a demand for an injunction. The injuction issued by a British Columbia supreme court judge prohibits anyone from loitering on nearby streets or sidewalks. While the city welcomed the decision, it noted that the delays could mean the homes may not be ready for tenants before the end of winter. News of the injunction prompted some two dozen people – including students from a nearby high school – to turn up at the site on Tuesday to show their support for the project. The debate over the project comes as Vancouver, which ranks as one of the world’s least affordable housing markets, is in the grips of a housing crisis. Despite a 15% tax levied last year on foreign buyers, a typical home in the greater Vancouver region costs C$1m, placing it out of reach for many in a city where the median household income is C$79,930. Rental vacancy rates have dropped below 1% while the number of homeless people in the city has increased 30% since 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/06/six-women-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-harvey-weinstein-and-complicit-producers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T23:45:15Z","webTitle":"Six women file class-action lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and 'complicit producers'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/06/six-women-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-harvey-weinstein-and-complicit-producers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/06/six-women-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-harvey-weinstein-and-complicit-producers","fields":{"headline":"Six women file class-action lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and 'complicit producers'","bodyText":"Harvey Weinstein and his former film production company are facing a class-action lawsuit from six women, who are seeking to represent “hundreds” of other women allegedly victimized by the disgraced movie producer. The proposed class action comes as Weinstein is facing numerous criminal investigations across the globe following accusations of sexual assault, rape, harassment and misconduct from dozens of women. The named plaintiffs in the suit include Zoë Brock, a model who shared her story with the Guardian and alleged that she had to lock herself in a hotel bathroom to escape Weinstein’s advances when she was 23. “We are but six women representing hundreds. Dozens have come forward so far, and many more remain in the shadows, still trying to find their courage,” the plaintiffs said in a statement. “But we will, if we can transform our horror stories into a cultural shift.” The lawsuit alleged that Weinstein was aided by “complicit producers” along with other firms and individuals who helped “facilitate and conceal his pattern of unwanted sexual conduct”. The companies and people who enabled Weinstein’s behavior, which has been described as an open secret in Hollywood, were part of an enterprise that violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico), according to the complaint. The law has been used to target the mafia for organized criminal behavior. The complaint follows multiple stories that have accused Weinstein of assaulting and harassing high-profile actors and others in the industry, and suggest he went to great lengths to try to silence the women, including deploying an “army of spies”. The scandal has inspired women in entertainment, media and a number of industries to come forward with stories of sexual abuse under the banner of the #MeToo movement, which was recognized as Time magazine’s Person of the Year on Wednesday. Representatives for the film producer and the Weinstein Company, which fired the co-founder after the first allegations surfaced, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Through his spokespeople, Weinstein has previously apologized for his behavior, but said he denies many of the sexual harassment allegations. He has also repeatedly said that he “unequivocally” denies allegations of “non-consensual sex” and claimed he never retaliated against women who refused his advances. Police in New York, however, recently said a 2010 rape allegation from actor Paz de la Huerta was “credible”. The new suit accused Weinstein and his associates of a “long-running practice of isolating and blacklisting Weinstein’s victims”. The 104-page complaint also named his former company Miramax, the producer’s brother Bob Weinstein and a number of current and former Weinstein Company board members. The suit further alleged that James Dolan, the owner of the New York Knicks who sat on the board in 2015 and 2016, “knew of Weinstein’s pattern and practice of predatory sexual conduct toward women from his personal relationship with Weinstein and his position as a director of [the Weinstein Company]”. A spokeswoman for Dolan said on Wednesday afternoon that attorneys were still reviewing the complaint, adding: “Mr Dolan is confident that he acted appropriately in all matters relating to his time on the Weinstein board.” The suit is seeking to represent a class of women who faced “unwanted sexual conduct that took many forms”, including “flashing, groping, fondling, harassing, battering, false imprisonment, sexual assault, attempted rape and/or completed rape”. Actor Katherine Kendall, one of the plaintiffs, alleged that when she was 23 years old, “Weinstein imprisoned her in his apartment, threatened and assaulted her”. Louisette Geiss also alleged that Weinstein assaulted and threatened her when she meet with Weinstein to pitch him a script. Another plaintiff, Sarah Ann Thomas, alleged that Weinstein Company employees arranged for her to interview with Weinstein at his home and that he conducted the interview in his underwear, “embraced Thomas in a sexual manner, and did not give her the job when she did not take him up on his sexual propositions”. Melissa Sagemiller alleged that Weinstein “imprisoned” her in his hotel room and later on an airplane, and threatened to assault her. The suit said she was meeting with Weinstein to discuss changes to a script for a movie that Miramax was distributing. Plaintiff Nannette Klatt alleged that she was assaulted by Weinstein during an audition for a part in a Miramax production. “Weinstein told Klatt that if she refused his advances and his requests, he would ruin her, and he ultimately withdrew the offer he had given her for a part because she would not accede to his advances.” The latest New York Times investigation, published on Tuesday, detailed claims of Weinstein’s “complicity machine”, alleging that the producer covered up sexual misconduct accusations for decades by relying on powerful relationships across industries. In response, Weinstein’s representatives released a statement asserting that “no legal wrongdoing occurred”, saying: “Mr Weinstein has never at any time committed an act of sexual assault, and it is wrong and irresponsible to conflate claims of impolitic behavior or consensual sexual contact later regretted, with an untrue claim of criminal conduct.” The statement added: “Nonetheless, to those offended by Mr Weinstein’s behavior, he remains deeply apologetic.” A joint statement from the six plaintiffs said, “If this is happening in Hollywood, it is happening at the hospital, the supermarket, the accountant’s office, the mechanic’s garage, the school … everywhere,” adding, “We hope this case sends a message to all companies sheltering abusers and their secrets: the tide has turned.” Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/07/aactas-populist-problem-best-film-award","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T23:23:02Z","webTitle":"Aactas 2017: do Australia's biggest screen awards have a problem with populism? | Luke Buckmaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/07/aactas-populist-problem-best-film-award","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/07/aactas-populist-problem-best-film-award","fields":{"headline":"Aactas 2017: do Australia's biggest screen awards have a problem with populism?","bodyText":"A long time before any of the guests at last night’s Aacta awards donned their Sunday best and walked the red carpet, everybody knew which film would win the lion’s share of awards, “Lion” being the operative word – the title, of course, of the director Garth Davis’s moving drama about an Indian-born Australian man who tracked down his estranged family through Google Earth. It was clear as early as January that triumph at the Aactas would be a fait accompli for the film. Not necessarily because of its international acclaim (including six Oscar nominations – although that wouldn’t have hurt) but due to the fact that, since the inaugural ceremony seven years ago, the best-performing film at the box office has taken the top gong every time. In other words, the most popular movie always wins. One year it looked like there would be an exception: 2015, with the director Jennifer Kent’s creepy-crawly thriller The Babadook, about a top hat-wearing monster-cum-gay icon. The film narrowly won the first count, as the Sydney Morning Herald revealed, only to have Aacta organisers count the votes again using a different methodology that favoured Russell Crowe’s tear-jerking box office juggernaut The Water Diviner. Best film was announced as a tie between them. The problem with populism runs deep at the Aactas. This is a ceremony that recognises productions such as Australian Ninja Warrior (best light entertainment series), Selling Houses Australia (best lifestyle television program) and Australian Survivor (best direction in a television light entertainment, lifestyle or reality series) but awards nothing to film screenwriters, cinematographers and editors. Prizes for these categories were dished out earlier in the week, at the annual “industry luncheon” – a smaller initiative that isn’t televised. Why not include them in the main event? The official line is that there isn’t enough time to squeeze these professions into the ceremony proper – though it does have enough time to recognise the creative genius behind the construction of televised obstacle courses. And also, during last night’s ceremony, nobody seemed to be in much of a rush. For the second consecutive year, Paul Hogan rambled into the microphone for what felt like the duration of Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (which is to say, an eternity). Later, unusual banter took place between Osamah Sami, the charming star of Ali’s Wedding, and a career-rejuvenated Sophie Monk, who awkwardly pretended not to understand what the word “diversity” meant. Quibbles aside, there were plenty of winners last night deserving of their recognition. Emma Booth was sickeningly effective in Hounds of Love. Hugo Weaving was excellent, as always, in Seven Types of Ambiguity, for which he won best lead actor – despite not being the lead actor (the protagonist of the show changed each episode). It was good to see Ewen Leslie take home a trophy for Top of the Lake: China Girl. The industry is well aware of the man’s talents; this was (if you include the AFIs) his fifth nomination. I’m not sure the general public, however, has fully grasped that Leslie (who recently co-starred in The Daughter, The Mule, The Butterfly Tree and the upcoming Sweet Country) is one of the finest Australian actors of his generation. And Lion is, I should stress – despite the predictable win – a great film. So rich; so moving. When that ending rolled around, man, I bawled my eyes out. I may have been a little watery-eyed when Saroo and Sue Brierley spoke in the media room last night, Sue reflecting on how her son is blessed to have not one loving mother but two. In terms of snubs: it is supremely odd that Alice Foulcher, wonderful in the low-budget dramedy That’s Not Me, did not receive a nomination for her (clearly deserving) performance. Also strange is the snubbing of the director Damien Power’s Killing Ground (nominated only for best sound) which featured, among other things, an excellent, thoroughly memorable performance from Harriet Dyer. In January I picked Lion as the winner at this year’s Aactas. I reckon I can do better. Let me state that the winner of best film a year from now will be Warwick Thornton’s Sweet Country. That is both a prediction and a hope. Thornton’s second masterpiece (following Samson &amp; Delilah) is unlikely to be the top Australian film at the box office in 2018. But the weight behind this extraordinary achievement will surely prove too great to ignore. Even for Aacta."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/27/top-culture-stories-2017-get-out-christian-rock","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"The top US culture stories of 2017: Get Out, rightwing comics and Christian rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/27/top-culture-stories-2017-get-out-christian-rock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/27/top-culture-stories-2017-get-out-christian-rock","fields":{"headline":"The top US culture stories of 2017: Get Out, rightwing comics and Christian rock","bodyText":"The influence of a president with a background in showbiz was felt in every corner of the cultural world in 2017, from politically inflected theatre to a revitalized late-night comedy scene. The year also saw the downfall of many Hollywood heavyweights in a climate that gave those with less power the ability to speak out against sexual predators, from Harvey Weinstein to Kevin Spacey. It wasn’t just a barrage of bleakness, though, with a number of refreshing and vital box office hits showing that diversity is not only necessary but profitable (from Get Out to Wonder Woman to Girls Trip) and a seemingly unending embarrassment of riches on the small screen with The Handmaid’s Tale, Mindhunter and Big Little Lies among many fantastic options. Mike Pence, finding God and the shifting agenda of Christian music festivals Alongside our coverage of Coachella, we found time to focus on a less-reported subsection of music festivals. Jemayel Khawaja attended the world’s biggest Christian gathering, looking at the part that such events now play and how their dwindling attendance has led them to seek a more progressive attitude, at odds with those held by Mike Pence, who found his religion at one in 1978. There is strange irony in the fact that after decades of trying to break Christian acts into mainstream music and eventually succeeding at doing so, that open-door facilitated a cross-pollinization of Christian and secular culture, one that has had deleterious effects on the singular importance many youthful believers place on Christian music as their source for their cultural engagement. The result is that attendance and profits for Christian festivals around the country have dropped significantly over the past decade. Many of the smaller events have ceased to exist, while a sizable portion have been swallowed up by the still massive Creation series of festivals – including Ichthus in Kentucky, where Mike Pence found Jesus. Even more worrying for traditionalists is that many of the acts performing are not overtly religious in their messaging and do not sing about God, while others even make questioning their faith a central theme of their music. Like it or not, modern Christianity has become intersectional, and it’s a lot harder to influence a generation who pick and choose their identity in a bricolage rather than a one-size-fits-all worldview. Glenn Close: ‘People don’t realize that you keep your sexuality up until you die’ We featured a number of big-name interviews this year, including Spike Lee, Susan Sarandon and Michael Haneke, but in September, our chat with Glenn Close was something of a precursor to the #MeToo movement that was soon to follow. The multiple Oscar nominee spoke about her horrifying casting couch experience as a younger actor. Fatal Attraction made Close a household name and provided her with a fourth Oscar nomination, but despite a decade filled with hits, she felt she was not always awarded the respect she deserved behind the scenes. We discuss the casting process and the horrors that often greet female actors along the way. She offers a “demeaning” anecdote of an actor who inappropriately touched her thigh (“I did feel there was a collusion between him and the director”) but goes on to recount a far more troubling story. “I was asked to come in and read with an actor who was huge at the time and I walked in and there was a bed,” she tells me. “I had the pages with me, but he didn’t know any of his lines and didn’t have them with him. So it was horrible. I realised afterwards that it was like putting a dog in with a bitch to see if he wanted to jump on her. If I had just forgotten the lines and worked at seducing him then I probably would have gotten the part.” Why can’t rightwing comics break into US late-night TV? The rare upside of Trump’s bombastic stupidity was a reinvigorated late-night comedy scene with John Oliver, Stephen Colbert and Samantha Bee all using their wit to spread the word of the growing resistance. But where was the rightwing equivalent? Jake Nevins explored the curious absence of Trump-supporting comics and how those who do exist have struggled to gain visibility. Victories, for conservative comics, are hard to come by. Outside the brick walls of comedy clubs, where their politics are unfashionable but not blacklisted, and churches, where many faith-based performers have cut their teeth, rightwing comics have found themselves battling a bureaucracy whose gilded gates are famously difficult to pry open. “I’m the new Lenny Bruce,” Brad Stine, a conservative Christian comic who’s been likened to Sam Kinison and George Carlin, told me. “That’s how ridiculous this is. They’re not arresting me like they did Lenny; they’re just not allowing me on their TV shows.” Stine is a born-again Christian, a label that makes up one-third of the existential trifecta (white, male, Christian) that he considers the primary blockade in his efforts to join the ranks of the comedy elite. Before what he refers to as an awakening – when a lesbian standup at a comedy club advised him not to shy away from politics in his act – he appeared on mainstream networks such as MTV, Showtime and A&amp;E, and was almost booked for the 2004 Republican national convention. Embracing his politics earned Stine a nice living on the comedy club circuit but made him a pariah on mainstream networks. Get Out: the film that dares to reveal the horror of liberal racism in America Probably the most talked about film of the year, Jordan Peele’s audacious directorial debut Get Out combined thrills with savage social commentary and became one of 2017’s biggest box office hits. In February, Lanre Bakare discussed how Peele managed to make a film that was so frighteningly of the moment. There was always something that didn’t quite ring true about Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner – a film many have compared to Get Out. It wasn’t in Sidney Poitier’s performance, which felt real: his anger, fear and frustration at having to battle his own family’s disapproval of him marrying a white woman and her family’s liberal hand-wringing was note-perfect. What didn’t feel real was the mostly calm reactions of almost everyone involved. In Get Out, under that placid exterior lurks the dark subconscious, where the true horror lies. In the screening I was at, the biggest reactions from the mainly black audience were the knowing laughs whenever Peele took on tropes people recognised from real life. There was the anxiety about meeting the family of a white partner, which proved to be well placed when Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) arrives at the Armitage residency and is immediately treated to a line of ham-fisted and loaded questioning. There was the cringe-inducing way the black serving staff are treated; the interactions with the police who, unlike in most horror films, aren’t last-minute saviors but potential fatal hurdles. Only 4.8% of TV writers are black. As one of them, I know the system is broken Depressing statistics this year revealed that just 4.8% of TV writers are black and to write on the topic, we worked with Stefani Robinson, a writer-producer working on Donald Glover’s Emmy-winning comedy Atlanta. She spoke about her experiences within the industry and her hopes for change. The reason for the lack of black television writers, I believe, is systemic. Hollywood is an intricate machine that traditionally has served and supported an overwhelmingly white demographic. To demand an immediate change within a well-oiled machine is tough, because everyone is used to the machine operating a certain way. Generally speaking, white executives, producers and showrunners are influenced by the operations of their predecessors and their predecessors and so on. Disrupting that traditionally white-centered narrative to introduce a black (or Asian, or Hispanic, or indigenous, etc) narrative is possible, but it’s just not easy to change that culture. I also remember having a conversation with a white network executive once. She too was concerned that there weren’t a lot of black writers in television. She then said something like: “I guess there aren’t a lot of them [black writers] out there. Because it’s not like anyone would discriminate against them outright because of their skin color like they could do to black actors. When black writers submit scripts, how would people [executives, showrunners, agents, etc] know that they’re black? We’re reading a script. So, with that in mind, it just seems like maybe there aren’t a lot of black writers to begin with.” Design by Sam Morris and Francisco Navas"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/06/facebook-weekly-standard-fake-news-fact-check","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T21:07:10Z","webTitle":"Conservative Weekly Standard to aid in Facebook fact-checks, prompting outcry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/06/facebook-weekly-standard-fake-news-fact-check","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/06/facebook-weekly-standard-fake-news-fact-check","fields":{"headline":"Conservative Weekly Standard to aid in Facebook fact-checks, prompting outcry","bodyText":"A conservative news organization has been approved to partner with Facebook to fact-check false news, drawing criticisms that the social media company is caving to rightwing pressures and collaborating with a publication that has previously spread propaganda. The Weekly Standard, a conservative opinion magazine, said it is joining a fact-checking initiative that Facebook launched last year aimed at debunking fake news on the site with the help of outside journalists. The Weekly Standard will be the first right-leaning news organization and explicitly partisan group to do fact-checks for Facebook, prompting backlash from progressive organizations, who have argued that the magazine has a history of publishing questionable content. News of the Weekly Standard’s involvement comes as Facebook and other tech companies are continuing to face intense scrutiny over their role in disseminating false content and propaganda and aiding Russian efforts to interfere with US politics. Shortly after Donald Trump was elected, Facebook responded to outrage about fake news by saying it would empower journalists from reputable outlets to flag false articles, which would then get a “disputed” tag to warn users. Some of the third-party media partners – which include reporters from the Associated Press and ABC News, and journalists from the fact-checking organizations Snopes, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org – have alleged that the project is largely failing to have an impact. Facebook has repeatedly refused to release meaningful data on the success of the journalists’ debunking efforts and has insisted that it is a platform and not a media publisher or “arbiter of truth”. Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) at Poynter, which verifies Facebook’s third-party fact-checkers, said it approved the Weekly Standard because the publication agreed to the IFCN code of principles. The magazine also has a fact-checking operation that is not associated with political parties or advocacy organizations and has committed not to write opinion pieces, he said. The conservative pundits Bill Kristol, Fred Barnes and John Podhoretz launched the Weekly Standard in 1995, with support from the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, aimed at countering successful liberal publications, such as the Nation. During last year’s presidential campaign, the magazine was aligned with the #NeverTrump movement and has recently sought to expand its fact-checking efforts. Though the Weekly Standard is distinct from far-right publications like Breitbart that are known for publishing propaganda and misinformation, some have questioned whether it was an appropriate partner for Facebook given its ideological bent. “I’m really disheartened and disturbed by this,” said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, a progressive watchdog group that published numerous criticisms of the Weekly Standard after the partnership was first rumored in October. “They have described themselves as an opinion magazine. They are supposed to be thought leaders.” Calling the magazine a “serial misinformer”, Media Matters cited the Weekly Standard’s role in pushing false and misleading claims about Obamacare, Hillary Clinton and other political stories. In recent years, the magazine also faced backlash for giving a platform to a contrarian climate scientist and for sending an anti-gay marketing email warning of the “homosexual lobby” and its “perverted vision for a homosexual America”. Recently, the Weekly Standard has also repeatedly attacked the fact-checkers who are already working with Facebook. Stephen Hayes, the Weekly Standard’s editor-in-chief, told the Guardian in an email that the publication had been “formally” doing fact-checking for six months and had hired “an incredibly sharp” fact-checker, Holmes Lybrand. He added: “The work really does speak for itself.” Hayes praised Facebook for working with rightwing journalists: “I think it’s a good move for [Facebook] to partner with conservative outlets that do real reporting and emphasize facts. Our fact-checking isn’t going to seek conservative facts because we don’t believe there are ‘conservative facts’. Facts are facts.” A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on the Weekly Standard, but told the Guardian: “We continue to believe that objective facts are objective facts. The political provenance of a given source is irrelevant if their reporting is factual … At Facebook, providing access to authentically fact-checked content is one of our top priorities and is just one of the tools we use to fight fake news.” Brooke Binkowski, managing editor of the Facebook fact-checking partner Snopes.com, said she didn’t have specific concerns about the Weekly Standard, but was worried about the broader implications of Facebook choosing to rely on a partisan conservative outlet. “If you’re going to be politicizing facts, no good can come of that,” she said. “What they are saying is we consider you to be liberal. It doesn’t give us a lot of credit for being trained, being transparent.” Last year, Facebook fired its team responsible for “trending” topics after it was accused of being biased against conservatives. Without human moderators, the algorithms promoted false stories and offensive content. The company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, subsequently met with prominent rightwing leaders to address the backlash.

Greg Clarke has already visited two thirds of Uefa territories but he will extend his meetings to include Africa and Asia. The purpose of the trip is to build bridges and reverse a commonly held belief among certain countries that the FA is arrogant. However, it will no doubt also be invaluable if the FA puts its hat in the ring to host the 2030 World Cup finals, in what will be the second 48-team competition. A European host country for 2030 is looking increasingly likely after Uefa promised to fight for the tournament and block any effort to hand it to China. When Clarke was asked this year about a possible World Cup bid, he said: “We are building bridges, we are showing that we are not standoffish noses in the air, we invented football, that sort of stuff that we have a reputation for, we are just a team player in Uefa and Fifa. “I have joined a couple of Uefa committees, I have met a lot of people and what I am trying to do is to create room at the table for England to be listened to. “It’s my job to get to know enough people in Uefa and Fifa so that we may or may not get a run at a tournament but we won’t waste £20m bidding for a tournament we can never win, because that’s 40 artificial pitches I can’t afford to waste.” If Fifa abides by a continental rotation policy the 2030 World Cup finals will be held in Europe. The policy, which dictates that the World Cup tournament should not be held in the same region more than once every 12 years, was abandoned in 2007 but resurrected with the ruling that the 2026 edition would not take place in Europe. It should block an Asian nation winning the 2030 tournament, given that Qatar will host 2022. The FA has not committed to bidding for the 100th anniversary of the tournament but is aware there would be plenty of legwork if it did decide to bid for the finals. England have failed in two bids to host the World Cup since the 1966 tournament, most recently in the vote for the 2018 edition. Richard Caborn, a former minister of sport, claimed an arrogance around the FA was reason for its failed bid. The chief executive, Martin Glenn, has admitted previously that there is a PR war to be won in terms of how England is perceived on the world stage. England’s failure to perform at major tournaments in recent years has not inspired and there is a prevailing feeling that they are trying to tell the rest of the world how to run the game. Clarke’s performance at a government hearing into the FA’s handling of Eni Aluko’s allegations of racism against the former England coach Mark Sampson failed to win him any admirers. But he has forced through radical reforms in how the FA operates and will hope he can use those tested negotiation skills to build bridges abroad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/06/fifa-dependence-russia-ioc-ban-david-conn","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T18:55:02Z","webTitle":"Fifa’s desperate dependence on Russia exposed in flimsy response to IOC ban | David Conn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/06/fifa-dependence-russia-ioc-ban-david-conn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/06/fifa-dependence-russia-ioc-ban-david-conn","fields":{"headline":"Fifa’s desperate dependence on Russia exposed in flimsy response to IOC ban","bodyText":"How awkward it has been for Fifa and its president, Gianni Infantino, ruthlessly plotting a course towards next year’s World Cup in Russia, that the International Olympic Committee banned the country from the Winter Olympics – and the senior minister Vitaly Mutko from the Olympics altogether – for state‑sponsored doping. The IOC’s decision should mean Fifa has no hiding place from a clear ethical stance on Russia’s appalling violations but it has only shone an unforgiving light on Fifa’s dependence on Russia. Infantino is spending plenty of quality time with Mutko, who is the president of the Russian football association and World Cup organising committee, and they were shoulder to shoulder during the draw last week for a tournament Infantino considers immovable and essential to bring in the dollars. Fifa’s statement in response to the IOC’s ban was a tapestry woven around the central issue, which should be alarm over Russia and Mutko. Top, for the avoidance of doubt, was the IOC’s decision having “no impact on the preparations for the 2018 Fifa World Cup” – for which, by the way, ticket sales are proceeding heartily. Fifa said it “takes its responsibility very seriously” on anti-doping and is “investigating the allegations” made in the devastating report by the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren last year, which exposed Russian state involvement in doping athletes while Mutko was the sports minister. Fifa said it would “impose the appropriate sanction” should “any athlete” be found to have violated anti-doping rules – but that appears to relate solely to footballers, against whom it suggested there was not enough evidence. At the end of the statement was the only oblique reference to Mutko: “When it comes to potential disciplinary or ethical matters concerning specific individuals, it will be up to the respective Fifa bodies to evaluate them.” Reading that, a trusting football supporter, properly concerned about Russia’s monstrous doping programme, would think Fifa’s “respective bodies” will only now begin to look at the McLaren report, and the IOC’s decision, and begin to “evaluate” them. Yet the fact is Wada explicitly called on Fifa’s ethics committee to investigate Mutko’s role, and the allegations relating to football, as long ago as July 2016 when it published McLaren’s report. Mutko denies, in effect, the whole report and dismissed its allegation of state-sponsored doping again last week when he and Vladimir Putin had the world where they wanted it, in Moscow for the draw. McLaren’s report cited the Russian whistleblower Dr Grigory Rodchenkov, who ran the Moscow anti-doping laboratory, explaining how state institutions and officials covered up – “saved” – positive tests of athletes. The deputy sports minister, Yuri Nagornykh, also banned by the IOC, was accused of being directly involved. “Deputy minister Nagornykh told [Rodchenkov] that minister of sport Mutko was aware of everything that they were discussing,” McLaren wrote. “Dr Rodchenkov’s evidence is that it is inconceivable minister Mutko was not aware of the doping cover-up scheme.” Mutko is also accused of direct personal involvement in a doping cover-up for “at least one foreign footballer playing in the Russian league”, the report stated. “That ‘save’ decision was made by minister Mutko and not deputy minister Nagornykh.” Following Wada’s call, Fifa’s ethics committee, then chaired by the Swiss prosecutor Cornel Borbély, did begin an investigation, senior sources have confirmed, but he was not provided with evidence he considered sufficient to bring any charges. Seventeen months later, Borbély is gone, removed by Infantino, and there is no news of any investigation. Infantino orchestrated the removal in May of Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, the German judge who chaired the ethics committee’s branch determining sanctions, which was rubber-stamped by the Fifa Council. Both men argued their removal was “incapacitating” Fifa’s ethics process, and that hundreds of cases were continuing. It was revealed soon afterwards Infantino had been under investigation for complaints he interfered in the election of a president at the Confederation of African Football, and for allegedly under-declaring the budget he was given by Uefa, where he was previously general-secretary, to campaign for the Fifa presidency. Miguel Maduro, an internationally renowned Portuguese law professor, was also fired from his chairmanship of Fifa’s governance committee. He revealed that Infantino had interfered with a committee decision to bar Mutko from being on the Fifa council. The governance committee’s decision was based on upholding Fifa’s rule that council appointees must be politically neutral, while Mutko was clearly a senior Russian politician. But Maduro said Infantino believed his own survival was threatened if Mutko was removed, and Fatma Samoura, Fifa’s secretary‑general, came to see Maduro. “The secretary-general made it clear [the Mutko decision] was extremely problematic and we needed to find a solution to declare Mr Mutko eligible,” Maduro told the parliamentary select committee for culture media and sport in September. “She said the World Cup would be a disaster and that as a consequence the continued presidency [of Infantino] would be in question.” Infantino denies any wrongdoing and Mutko remains the organiser of Fifa’s next World Cup. The impression lingers that Infantino and Fifa feel deeply reliant on Russia and are terrified of anything that might disturb the peace, or Putin. Borbély may have decided before his removal that the documented evidence against Mutko personally was not strong enough, but after the IOC’s further work and decision, there was no sense of alarm at Fifa HQ, or of eagerness for a further push by the new ethics committee chairs. The 2014 World Cup in Brazil made $4.8bn for Fifa, and Russia 2018 will stuff the Zurich coffers with more. Russia’s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom is also a Fifa sponsor now – as is Qatar Airways, state-controlled company of the 2022 World Cup hosts. Infantino can be imagined grumbling tit was easy enough for the IOC to act strong now, three years after the Winter Olympics in Sochi, where the Russian competitors were allegedly doping, but the IOC has long been safely back with the money. Fifa needs Russia to host its prime event and no alternatives are being considered. For Infantino, Mutko is still in the clear, and the show must go on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/08/benjamin-damage-pester-hmv-employees-records-john-peel-played-techno","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"Benjamin Damage: ‘I’d pester HMV employees for records John Peel played'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/08/benjamin-damage-pester-hmv-employees-records-john-peel-played-techno","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/08/benjamin-damage-pester-hmv-employees-records-john-peel-played-techno","fields":{"headline":"Benjamin Damage: ‘I’d pester HMV employees for records John Peel played'","bodyText":"The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with SHXCXCHCXSH: Stämma #5 I never recommend these guys in person because of the intense embarrassment of trying to pronounce SHXCXCHCXSH.

The party says ministers are trying to push through the creation of “accountable care organisations” (ACOs) without proper parliamentary scrutiny. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has written to Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, urging her not to let “the biggest change to our NHS in a decade” go ahead without MPs’ involvement. NHS England’s chief executive, Simon Stevens, and the government see ACOs as central to far-reaching modernisation plans that they hope will improve patient care, reduce pressure on hospitals and help the NHS stick to its budget. ACOs involve NHS hospital, mental health, ambulance and community services trusts working much more closely with local councils, using new organisational structures, to improve the health of the population of a wide area. The first ACOs are due to become operational in April in eight areas of England and cover almost 7 million people. Labour has seized on the fact that the Department of Health plans to amend 10 separate sets of parliamentary regulations that relate to the NHS in order to pave the way legally for the eight ACOs. In his letter, Ashworth demands that Leadsom grant a debate on the plans before the amended regulations acquire legal force in February. “Accountable care organisations are potentially the biggest change which will be made to our NHS for a decade. Yet the government have been reluctant to put details of the new arrangements into the public domain. It’s essential that the decision around whether to introduce ACOs into the NHS is taken in public, with a full debate and vote in parliament,” he writes. A number of “big, unanswered questons” about ACOs remain, despite their imminent arrival in the NHS, he adds. They include how the new organisations will be accountable to the public, what the role of private sector health firms will be and how they will affect NHS staff. Ashworth also says “the unacceptable secrecy in which these ACOs have been conceived and are being pushed forward is totally contrary to the NHS’s duty to be open, transparent and accountable in its decision-making. The manner in which the government are approaching ACOs, as with sustainability and transformation plans before them, fails that test.” Stevens’s determination to introduce ACOs has aroused suspicion because they are based on how healthcare is organised in the United States. They came in there in the wake of Obamacare as an attempt to integrate providers of different sorts of healthcare in order to keep patients healthier and avoid them spending time in hospital unnecessarily. A Commons early day motion (EDM) on ACOs also being tabled by Labour on Thursday, signed by its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and other frontbenchers, notes that “concerns have been raised that ACOs will encourage and facilitate further private sector involvement in the NHS”. In his letter Ashworth adds: “There is widespread suspicion that the government are forcing these new changes through in order to fit NHS services to the shrinking budgets imposed from Whitehall.” The EDM also notes “concerns that ACOs could be used as a vehicle for greater rationing”. The King’s Fund, an influential health thinktank, denied that ACOs would open up NHS services to privatisation. “This is not about privatisation; it is about integration,” said Prof Chris Ham, its chief executive. “There is a groundswell of support among local health and care leaders for the principle of looking beyond individual services and focusing instead on whatever will have the biggest impact in enabling people to live long, healthy and fulfilling lives,” added Ham. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association, backed Labour’s call for greater transparency but said care services should be integrated. However, he added: “ACOs will not in themselves address the desperate underfunding of the NHS and may divert more money into processes of reorganisation. Current procurement and competition regulations create the potential for ACOs to be opened up to global private providers within a fixed-term contract and with significant implications for patient services and staff.” The Department of Health refused to say if MPs would be able to debate ACOs. “It is right that local NHS leaders and clinicians have the autonomy to decide the best solutions to improve care for the patients they know best - but significant local changes must always be subject to public consultation and due legal process. “It is important to note that ACOs have nothing to do with funding - the NHS will always remain free at the point of use,” a spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/06/new-vision-railways-short-sighted","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T19:32:08Z","webTitle":"A new vision for railways that's rather short-sighted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/06/new-vision-railways-short-sighted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/06/new-vision-railways-short-sighted","fields":{"headline":"A new vision for railways that's rather short-sighted","bodyText":"The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, unveiled his “new vision for our railways” a week ago and gained a few favourable headlines for the modest commitment to reopen a few lines closed in the Beeching cuts of the 1960s. Forget that crowd-pleasing diversion, however, because it’s not what the rail industry is talking about. Instead, rail bosses are dumbfounded that Stagecoach is being bailed out of its onerous contract on the East Coast main line. And they struggle to understand how Grayling’s new “public-private partnerships” are supposed to work. The model – to be adopted on some lines but not on others – just seems to add complexity to a franchising system that is already baffling. First, the Stagecoach affair: as Lord Adonis, former transport secretary under Labour, has been saying loudly, the soft-shoe shuffle looks outrageous. Stagecoach, in partnership with Virgin Group, won the East Coast franchise by promising to pay the Treasury £3.3bn under a contract that was supposed to run until 2023. Now that contract – currently loss-making for Stagecoach – is being ripped up early, to be replaced in 2020 by the new-fangled public-private arrangement. The net effect is that Stagecoach is off the hook, more or less. It may still forfeit £165m, but there’s no chance of it being asked to honour the original contract. Instead, new terms will be renegotiated to run until 2020 and, hey presto, the company can also bid to be part of the public-private show that will follow. It’s a sweetheart deal, rivals complain privately. You can’t blame them. They have had their fill of Stagecoach preaching about other firms bidding aggressively to win contracts. They were looking forward to seeing the tables turned. Why aren’t they saying so out loud? Partly, one suspects, because they may wish do business with Grayling themselves one day. Adonis claimed on Wednesday that FirstGroup is consulting its lawyers to see if, post-Stagecoach, it can get help with its loss-making TransPennine Express franchise. The company says not, but Adonis’s underlying point remains: Grayling may have set a costly (for taxpayers) precedent on the East Coast line. The wider picture is also alarming. Grayling’s big idea of getting train operators to work more closely with Network Rail is widely seen as sensible, but the franchising system now seems more muddled than ever. Sometimes franchises are awarded via competitive tender; sometimes they are just handed out via a “direct award”; and now public-private partnerships will enter the mix. Even before last week, some of the results seemed perverse. Govia, the firm controlled by Go-Ahead Group, made a mess of its Southern franchise but was well regarded on the London Midland line, not least because it forced genuine competition and lower fares on the Euston to Birmingham New Street route. Yet Govia has been booted off, to be replaced by a consortium that includes a Dutch state-owned firm that presumably enjoys lower costs of capital. How does that work? Govia performs well and loses London Midland to save the Treasury money, but Stagecoach over-bids on the East Coast and gets bailed out. Where is the rhyme or reason? Adonis should keep pressing. The government’s “new vision” looks suspiciously like a short-termist approach designed to silence Labour’s nationalisation chant. Coherent, it ain’t. Christmas sale for Intu Little has gone well for Intu since it changed its name in 2013 from Capital Shopping Centres, which was a better label for a company that owns the Trafford Centre near Manchester, Lakeside in Essex and Gateshead’s Metrocentre. The share price in those days was pushing 330p. Now, at a moment when the stock had dipped under 200p, Intu is selling itself to Hammerson for £3.4bn. Intu gets Hammerson paper worth 238p a share, which is an improvement of sorts, but the terms hardly count as a triumph when the assets, according to the last valuation, are worth 403p when adjusted for debt. Why sell? One assumes John Whittaker, the billionaire who controls 27% of Intu, would prefer to spread his financial risk, which would be logical. Intu’s debt load is heavy and an impediment to buying more properties, say analysts. Hammerson should be able to refinance at better rates. Yet, in the age of internet shopping, the deal hardly screams confidence on either side. Hammerson is only jumping because it’s getting a relative bargain. Intu looks as if it’s running for shelter. The duo are also taking that risk that the customers – retail tenants – head straight to the Competition and Markets Authority. Given that Hammerson-Intu would own 17 of the 25 biggest shopping centres in the UK, that risk is real. Still, at least the irritating Intu name will be dropped, if not from the centres themselves. That would be an improvement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/06/rpi-no-longer-fit-for-deciding-rail-fare-rises","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T18:54:44Z","webTitle":"RPI no longer fit for deciding rail fare rises | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/06/rpi-no-longer-fit-for-deciding-rail-fare-rises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/06/rpi-no-longer-fit-for-deciding-rail-fare-rises","fields":{"headline":"RPI no longer fit for deciding rail fare rises","bodyText":"The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, is on the right tracks. The annual rises in rail fares should be decoupled from the retail prices index (RPI), as he argued in his Guardian article (This hefty train fare rise is yet another Tory betrayal of passengers, theguardian.com, 5 December). The Royal Statistical Society (RSS) has long believed that the RPI should be declared redundant for such uprating purposes. Significantly, our view is shared by both the national statistician and the chair of the UK Statistics Authority, who told MPs, only last month, that he “deprecates” RPI being used in this way. The RPI was a good measure of inflation for many years but developed various technical problems; legal and other constraints prevented them from being solved. This situation led to its loss of “national statistic” status as far back as 2013. In these circumstances, it is indefensible that RPI is still used to set people’s rail fares and many of their other outgoings – from air passenger duty to interest on student loans. It is especially unjustifiable as the government uses the consumer prices index (CPI), which normally gives a lower estimate of inflation, when uprating many people’s incomes through state benefits or public sector pensions. People’s incomes and outgoings should both be linked to a single index which commands “national statistic” status and is credible for uprating purposes. The CPI, while imperfect, meets these key criteria. The household costs index (HCI), currently being developed, may well do so in the future. Alas, the RPI now fails on each count. For uprating purposes, it is surely now reaching the end of the line.

Ten Conservative MPs and one DUP MP voted that Davis was not in contempt of parliament, hours after the Brexit secretary said that there had been “no systematic impact assessment” of leaving the EU. Eight opposition MPs voted against. MPs on the committee asked Davies how he could say there was no detailed information to publish, even though he had talked previously about the 58 studies existing “in excruciating detail”. In a sometimes gruelling appearance before the Brexit select committee Davis said there had been “no systematic impact assessment” of leaving the EU, having talked previously about such apparent studies existing “in excruciating detail”. Davis insisted he had been misunderstood, saying the only work undertaken comprised broad surveys of various parts of the economy, none of which included any forecasts of how Brexit might affect them. After the hearing, some MPs had called for Davis to be held in contempt of parliament for not complying with a Commons motion in October demanding that he release the impact assessments – prompting the vote. At the hearing the committee chair, Labour’s Hilary Benn, had asked Davis if the government had carried out any forecasts on the possible impact of Brexit on the automotive, aerospace or financial services sectors. “The answer’s going to be no to all of them,” Davis replied. His comments prompted incredulity from some members, including Benn, who said it was “quite extraordinary” to be told that no impact assessments had been carried out. Benn asked how the assessments could not exist when the Brexit secretary had previously told MPs in September last year there were sectoral analyses for “about 50 cross-cutting sectors, [for] what is going to happen to them”. Davis insisted he had never been misleading, and that the studies undertaken had never been intended as a quantitative analysis of how various parts of the economy could be affected by Brexit, in part as there were too many variables for this to be feasible. “Do not draw the conclusion that because you use the word impact, you have written an impact assessment,” he said. Another Labour MP, Seema Malhotra, the member for Feltham and Heston, called Davis’s admission a “dereliction of duty”. After the hearing, the Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas and the former Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said he should resign as a minister. In a TV interview in June, Davis had he said nearly 60 sector analyses had been completed. In October he told the Brexit committee that Theresa May had read summaries of impact assessments, which he said went into “excruciating detail”. That month, the Commons demanded the Brexit department release the 58 impact assessments, passed unanimously after Conservative MPs took no part. Davis then said the information did not exist in this form. Eventually, following complaints, MPs were eventually handed two files containing 850 pages of mainly background “sectoral analyses” of various parts of the economy. Many said this was not sufficient to comply with parliament’s request. Speaking on Wednesday, Davis told the committee that impact assessments would be done, but “a little closer to the negotiating timetable”. “We will at some stage, and some of this has been initiated, do the best we can to quantify the effect of different negotiating outcomes as we come up to them,” he said. Asked later by Benn whether there had been any economic assessment of the impact of leaving the customs union, he replied: “Not a formal, quantitative one.” Davis also said government plans for the possibility of leaving the EU without a trade deal did not include any impact assessment. The contingency planning included proposals for areas like customs and aviation, but “don’t have numbers attached to them” and so didn’t constitute a forecast, he said. The revelations prompted calls in the Commons for the Speaker, John Bercow, to examine whether the Brexit secretary was in contempt of parliament for not handing over all the information he could. Raising a point of order, the SNP’s Pete Wishart said: “The government have singularly failed to meet the requirements of that binding vote in the house six weeks ago and must surely be in contempt.” Bercow said he would discharge his responsibilities, but stressed any action would depend on the view of the Brexit committee. However, Chuka Umunna, a pro-remain Labour MP who is not on the Brexit committee, said later he had written to the Bercow, asking for a fresh investigation into whether Davis had misled the Commons over the assessments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/03/europe-xenophobes-continent-poland-hungary-austria-nationalism-migrants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T23:48:59Z","webTitle":"Can Europe’s new xenophobes reshape the continent?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/03/europe-xenophobes-continent-poland-hungary-austria-nationalism-migrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/03/europe-xenophobes-continent-poland-hungary-austria-nationalism-migrants","fields":{"headline":"Can Europe’s new xenophobes reshape the continent?","bodyText":"In the House of Terror, one of Budapest’s most popular tourist attractions, two mannequins’ torsos stand back to back on a rotating platform, one wearing the uniform of Hungary’s communist secret police, the other that of the Arrow Cross fascist party. They bear mute testimony to the traumas of 20th-century history in this corner of Europe. Mária Schmidt, the museum’s director, says she would like to show her display to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, thus reminding her that in 1945 Hungary was occupied by the two most brutal totalitarian regimes of the last century in the space of a single year. This would, she believes, explain why the country remains fiercely proud of its independence and suspicious of “neocolonial attitudes” towards eastern Europe from Brussels. “We are Hungarians, and we want to preserve our culture,” Schmidt says, sitting in the museum’s boardroom. “We don’t want to copy what the Germans are doing or what the French are doing. We want to continue with our own way of life.” When the German chancellor visited Budapest in 2009, Schmidt claims she sent her an invitation to a commemorative event but got no response. “There is only one explanation for this,” she says. “She has a heart of ice.” A historian who once wrote acclaimed books about the Holocaust, Schmidt is now seen in Hungary as intellectual-in-chief to the country’s avowedly illiberal prime minister Viktor Orbán, whose government subsidises the museum and a number of think tanks directed by her. Like Orbán, she is no fan of refugees. Schmidt rejects the term for the thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan and other war-torn countries who were left stranded at Budapest’s Keleti station in the summer of 2015, insisting they were “migrants” because they had already crossed several borders on their journey to the heart of the continent. “We used to fight Turkish invaders and were occupied by the Turks for 150 years,” she says. “We know the consequences that certain kinds of contacts may entail.” Schmidt dismisses the argument that European economies need immigration to make up for declining demographics and, in Hungary’s case, high levels of emigration: “The Hungarians who have emigrated will eventually come back because they will realise it is better here than anywhere else,” she says, adding that “automation and artificial intelligence are creating new kinds of methods of production” that require a smaller labour force. “There is a debate about the future of Europe: whether it can remain an alliance of nation states, or whether it should become an empire. I don’t believe in empires. Where is the Soviet Union now? Where is the Third Reich? Where is the Ottoman empire? Where is the British Empire? Meanwhile, Hungary is still here. This is a state which is 1,100 years old.” “Germany, by comparison, is a young country,” Schmidt adds, raising her voice. “I don’t like being lectured by people who couldn’t even set up a nation state before 1871.” Schmidt’s office later emailed to clarify that she had intended this as a joke. Increasingly, there are signs that Schmidt and Orbán have the ambition to take their brand of “illiberal democracy”, with its constant attacks on liberal freedoms and its disdain for Muslim migrants perceived to be undermining the country’s Christian identity, to another level. “Twenty-seven years ago here in central Europe we believed that Europe was our future; today we feel that we are the future of Europe,” the Hungarian prime minister told an audience in Romania last July, sketching out a scenario whereby Hungary would no longer just obstruct Brussels but begin to shape the continent in its image. And as the fallout from the 2015 refugee crisis continues to divide east and west Europe, Orbán gathers copycats and admirers across the former Soviet bloc. Since Poland’s 2015 general election the conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) has found itself entrenched in a constant stand-off with EU leaders over its plans to overhaul its constitutional court – a battle similar to one fought in Hungary in 2013. As with Orbán’s assault on the judiciary, human rights NGOs and press freedom, Polish cities have seen large-scale protests by a younger generation, with thousands of people taking to the streets to protest against restrictions on women’s rights in the spring of 2016. In the Czech Republic, president Miloš Zeman managed to secure his re-election last weekend by running a campaign from the Orbán playbook, painting his liberal opponent Jiří Drahoš as a pro-immigrant elitist with ties to Merkel. Even Austria, governed since December by a right-leaning coalition which includes Heinz-Christian Strache’s rightwing Freedom Party (FPÖ), has not been immune to the Hungarian leader’s populist charm. Orbán, who expects to extend his rule at elections in April, last Tuesday boarded a humble Railjet train to meet the new Austrian prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, in Vienna and declared a “fresh start” in Austrian-Hungarian relations: a symbolic westward extension of the Visegrád group – the post-cold war alliance formed in the early 1990s between Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – with a dash of old Habsburg glamour. This November marks the centenary of the collapse of the Habsburg empire, ruled for the last stretch of its 650 years by a dual monarchy from Budapest and Vienna. For Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian political scientist at Vienna’s Institute of Human Sciences, the anniversary is crucial for understanding the new anti-Brussels axis running through the continent. “In central and eastern Europe, the disintegration of the Habsburg empire resulted in the emergence of interwar ethnic states,” he says. “But these states were highly unstable because of the rivalries built up before the war.” Eastern European resentment over the refugee crisis had thrived because many states in the region still associate ethnic diversity with the tumultuous years between the wars. In his 2017 book After Europe, Krastev sketches out how the genocides and migration waves of the war years replaced a previously multicultural Austrian-Hungarian empire, where parliaments at times allowed delegates to speak in any of eight languages, with a region of ethnically homogenous nation states. Eventually, some of them signed up to the philosophy that states should be founded on a homogenous culture, a 19th-century western idea. Now that Germany had suddenly changed its mind about multiculturalism in the 21st century, why should they follow suit again? If the story of the Austro-Hungarian empire and its collapse can explain the deeper dynamics of the new rift between eastern and western Europe, it also hints at where Orbán’s conservative counter-revolution may come up against its limits. “There is a widespread view in central and eastern Europe that multinational empires were fated to collapse, because the western powers and historians spent decades telling them that they were,” says Philipp Ther, a professor of central European history at Vienna university and author of the prizewinning Europe Since 1989: A History. “In fact, in Austro-Hungary’s case, it was full of life and managed to gradually democratise, a lot more so than Prussia. “But there won’t be a revival of Austro-Hungary now,” Ther says. “On the contrary: we will see growing conflicts between Austria and Hungary in the coming years.” Austria’s vice chancellor Strache may have argued the case for Austria joining the Visegrád group in last year’s election campaign. But his own Freedom Party has been just as vocal about the need to hinder eastern European migrants’ access to the Austrian welfare state: plans to index benefits for children of Hungarian migrant workers is one of his government’s signature policies. Eastern European governments, including Orbán’s, have announced their intention to oppose the measures – in Brussels, naturally. Austria, meanwhile, has announced its intention to sue Hungary for plans to expand a nuclear power station near the Austrian border, which is financed with a Russian loan of over €1bn. The Visegrád group, a loose network without any joint institutions or binding agreements, was partly set up as a post-imperial project from which the old power player in the region, Vienna, was deliberately excluded. The Austrian right, meanwhile, is less keen on seeing Poland as part of an eastern alliance, because it would no longer be the biggest and most powerful player. Stoking nationalist sentiments has helped Orbán win elections but could eventually back his country into a demographic dead end. The economies of Poland and the Czech Republic already draw vast numbers of guest workers from the Ukraine. Hungary, on the other hand, speaks a complex language that has more in common with Finnish and Estonian than the Slavic tongues of its neighbouring states, and offers wages which are unattractive even to Hungarian minorities in Slovakia. “Orbán doesn’t have the intellectual potential to become a leadership figure for the post-American European right,” argues Ther. “His notion of ‘illiberal democracy’ is a phrase, but not a concept with real foundation.” Zeman’s courting of trade with China and Russia has drawn ire from Brussels and Berlin, but there are also western economists who concede that eastern European states may have to rebalance their economic models to avoid being stuck in what some call the “Europeanisation trap”. In a recent post for his blog at Le Monde, economist Thomas Piketty argued that the returns western investors have drawn from the Visegrád Four more than exceed capital flows heading the other way. Yet, for now, Germany remains by far the most important export and import partner for each of the four Visegrád countries and Austria. Any move toward political divergence finds itself up against years of economic convergence. “Nationalism used to be about your army or your economy,” says Krastev. “Now it is very much about the politics of culture, which is why people like Mária Schmidt are so important to Viktor Orbán.” But the culture wars that galvanise support for Orbán in Hungary do not automatically work in Poland or Slovakia. In January the Hungarian foreign office abruptly cancelled a Future of Europe conference it had organised to mark the country’s presidency of the Visegrád Four. Schmidt says the conference had been postponed until May because it been caught “in the cross-hairs of political attacks” ahead of the April election. But some speculate that the conference was called off because the list of invited speakers, including alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, proved too unpalatable for some of the other co-hosting governments. As pessimistic as Krastev is about the future of the European Union, he is even more sceptical about Orbán’s conservative counter-revolution. “In a strange way, the success of every revolution is legitimised by the counter-revolution. I don’t believe we can restore nation states. And, at any rate, such nation states have a very short history. We are trying to make normal something that was very unusual.” After a pause, he adds: “Of course, the problem is that the fact that no one really wants to destroy the European Union isn’t a guarantee that it isn’t going to disintegrate. Disintegration of empires is rarely an intention – it’s usually a traffic accident. Empires tend to disintegrate from the centre, not from the periphery. “If Hungary were to leave the EU, no one would notice. The problem with the European Union comes when Germany decides it no longer has the patience to deal with this mess.” MITTELEUROPA TURNS RIGHT Austria Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of the centre-right Austrian People’s Party rules in a coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party. The parties have stated their intention to curb benefits for migrants from other EU member states and restrict cash payments for asylum seekers. While explicitly ruling out a referendum on EU membership, Kurz said the European Union should focus more on “big issues” and not “small issues on which nations or regions can better decide for themselves”. Receiving Viktor Orbán in Vienna this week, Kurz stated his aim to become “a bridge-builder between the Visegrád states and the countries in western Europe” Czech Republic President Miloš Zeman, one of the last remaining active leaders from the region’s post-Soviet transition period, last weekend managed to get reelected by beating an opponent he derided as a pro-immigrant elitist with ties to Angela Merkel. Zeman surrounds himself with business advisers with connections to Moscow and Beijing and opposes sanctions against Russia. Prime minister Andrej Babiš hails from rightwing populist party ANO but advocates close economic ties with the European Union. Hungary Campaigning is underway for a national poll on 8 April that is expected to result in the reelection of prime minister Viktor Orbán of Fidesz. Hungary’s government has clashed with Brussels over its opposition to distribution quotas for refugees and judicial reforms that critics have described as “a serious risk to the rule of law”. A new law, dubbed the “Stop Soros Plan”, looks designed to curb the influence of Hungarian-born financier George Soros, who founded the Central European University and donates to the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human-rights group. Poland Poland has been engaged in a two-year legal battle with Brussels that has been prolonger rather than curtailed by a government reshuffle and the appointment of a new PM, Mateusz Morawiecki. The Polish government has been battling to control the constitutional court, a move which critics say puts the country on a road to autocracy. On Thursday, the Polish government passed a libel bill that allows jail sentences for those accusing the Polish population of collaborating in the Holocaust or other war crimes. Slovakia Slovak prime minister Roberto Fico has his own history of clashing with the rest of the EU, describing the bloc’s migration policy in January 2016 as “ritual suicide”. But Slovakia is also the Visegrád group’s only member of the eurozone, and Fico last October insisted that ties with western Europe were more important for his country than solidarity with its Eastern European neighbours, describing his country as “a pro-European island in this region”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/07/must-borrow-to-invest-labour-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Don’t let the Tories fool you: we must borrow to invest | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/must-borrow-to-invest-labour-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/must-borrow-to-invest-labour-strategy","fields":{"headline":"Don’t let the Tories fool you: we must borrow to invest","bodyText":"Here is a story about how crude dogma and a factually baseless political attack line are wrecking the country’s future. Britain desperately needs investment, and with interest rates this low it would be economic madness not to borrow to fund it. In the years leading up to the crash, rightwing outriders such as the TaxPayers’ Alliance, incensed at a Tory commitment to match Labour spending pound-for-pound, launched a campaign to demonise the notion of such public investment. They sought out horror stories of wasteful spending, of overpaid public servants, of failed state projects, all of which appeared designed to discredit the very notion of public investment. When the crash came, the ideologues were triumphant and the Tory leadership revised history. The huge deficit wasn’t, according to this dishonest narrative, driven by a drop in tax revenues and the inevitable recession-induced increase in spending. It was instead caused by Labour profligacy making the nation’s money run out. This package of lies delivered numerous political advantages for the Tories. It fulfilled crude partisan aims. Throughout the coalition’s tenure in office, polling showed that while public opinion disliked cuts, it blamed the last Labour government for them more than the Tory-led administration actually imposing them. Cuts were seen as sad but necessary, rather than ideologically driven. Aided by Ed Balls’ concessions to the austerity narrative, the Tory mantra of “we’re clearing up Labour’s mess” acted like a ball-and-chain on confidence in Labour to run the economy, ensuring the party languished behind George Osborne in the polls. It had profound ideological gains too: shrinking the state makes the hearts of all true-blue Tories beat that little bit faster, even though – for a period – they were forced to pretend to abandon this objective. Yet the Tories’ economic strategy failed on its own stated terms. A deficit we were told had to be eradicated by 2015 to stop Britain going the way of Greece will now, according to the Tories’ projections, remain until 2031. More than £700bn has been added to Britain’s pile of national debt since David Cameron entered No 10. Britain now has the weakest growth of any G7 country, having endured the worst slump in living standards of the 35 industrialised OECD nations other than the very bogeyman repeatedly conjured up by the Tories: Greece. But as a political device – until now, at least – it has been crudely effective. And at such cost to the country. Britain has some of the worst regional inequalities in the western world, and they have only got worse. Spending on London’s transport per head is £1,500 higher than in the north. A housing crisis has locked much of younger Britain out of home ownership and, with the failure to build desperately needed council housing, a generation is driven into an unregulated rip-off private rented sector instead. And so – instead of money spent to build housing – over £9bn a year ends up subsidising private landlords instead. We have a productivity crisis that only gets worse: last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility downgraded its forecasts. Britain remains pitifully near the bottom of the league table for government investment. If you need any proof as to how much of a con Tory austerity actually is, witness the way they have been trying to drive through a £4.7bn giveaway to banks by cutting the bank levy, while children’s services face crisis without an extra £2bn. Labour is right, then, to boldly and unapologetically make the case for borrowing to invest. But at the next election, the Tories and their media cronies will far more obsessively zero in on Labour’s economic plans, not least given Jeremy Corbyn is likely to emerge from an electoral contest as prime minister. That’s why the debate has to be had – and won – now. Indeed, because the Tories’ dogma is so at odds with the nation’s needs, even a Conservative cabinet minister such as Sajid Javid has broken ranks to demand £50bn of borrowing to solve the housing crisis. Labour’s own plans, as enshrined in the fiscal credibility rule, commit not to borrow for day-to-day spending. Indeed, it is notable that when John McDonnell was chair of finance at the Greater London Council in the early 1980s, he produced a balanced budget every year. Instead, the borrowing is earmarked only for any project with a clear economic benefit: such as energy infrastructure, or research and development. With interest rates at such historic lows, here is the dictionary definition of “no-brainer”. There is an obvious counterattack to these proposals. What if interest rates jump? Here is an attempt to use an unknown to halt investment that would not only modernise the country, but fuel tens of billions of economic growth. For example, Labour estimates that its plans to build a “Crossrail for the north” would cost £10bn in borrowing: but the Transport for the North body believes such a project would help deliver £85bn of desperately needed growth in northern England. The electrification of the entire Great Western Railway would cost £700m, but – according to the Department of Transport – the economic benefits could be worth two and a half times that. And that’s the point of investment, of course: the economic returns, and the increased tax revenues, dwarf the costs, and – critically – the cost of servicing the debt. Housing is an obvious win-win example. Spending on a mass house building programme will slash the billions spent on housing benefit; create skilled, properly paid jobs – thereby reducing the amount splashed out on in-work benefits; produce an economic multiplier effect, with every £1 spent on housing generating an estimated £2.84 in economic output; and boost a range of industries dependent on housebuilding. With their ideological zealotry in rolling back the state, the Tories have disastrously held back the country’s development. Add the bungled Brexit approach, and Britain risks becoming the sick man of the western world: in growth, productivity, living standards, you name it. The onslaught in a short election campaign against Labour’s desperately needed proposals will be brutal and unrelenting. But Labour must win the argument. The alternative is another generation of stagnation and decline. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/06/beware-of-moving-the-church-flower-stand","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T18:53:04Z","webTitle":"Beware of moving the church flower-stand | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/06/beware-of-moving-the-church-flower-stand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/06/beware-of-moving-the-church-flower-stand","fields":{"headline":"Beware of moving the church flower-stand","bodyText":"How sad that your Christine Keeler obituary (6 December) should continue the misogyny directed at her all her life: she “preferred to call herself a model, while others labelled her a prostitute”; her writings were “lurid”; “she made things up”; enjoyed “the seedy life of Soho”.

I was in perspiring agony and, even before I got out of bed, utterly exhausted. But I thought: what would a junior doctor do? Of course, if he or she were suffering from flu, the correct answer would be: not go anywhere near a hospital. But that’s not the sense you get from Kay’s bestselling diary of his time as a doctor training in obstetrics and gynaecology – or, as it was referred to at his medical school, brats and twats. In This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor, hospital doctors, and in particular the author, are depicted as poorly paid, undervalued and grossly neglected professionals who are unfailingly willing to give up their own time for free to do battle with the health of the nation. That is, when they’re not trading stories about their patients’ bizarre sexual proclivities. Doctors in Kay’s book don’t have time to be ill, because everyone else is sick and they’re busy having to deal with it. So it was in that dogged spirit that I eased myself into a vertical setting, waving away the doubts of my wife and concerned looks of strangers in the street, and gingerly made my way to meet Kay at the Wellcome Foundation in Euston, London. Kay is now a 37-year-old comedian and scriptwriter. He’s got a round, serious face that breaks occasionally into shoulder-shaking laughter. Half-cherubic, half devilish, he looks a bit like a clean and sober John Belushi. “How are you?” he asks politely when we meet. This is a trick question, of course, the answer to which no doctor, or even former doctor, ever wants to hear in detail. Kay grew fed up of friends and people he met at parties recounting their ailments for his expert attention. But as he notes in his book, he prefers it to people asking him to read their scripts. “No one’s sent me their book yet,” he says. “It’s bad enough finding time to read books I want to read, let alone those of friends of my aunt who decided they’ve an autobiography in them.” The medical memoir is not a new idea. There have been several notable additions to the genre in recent years, including the brain surgeon Henry Marsh’s Do No Harm. But they’ve tended to focus on the ethical and the surgical, and as a consequence have conformed to a scrupulous style of writing. That is not Kay’s approach. His is a much more personal and, not infrequently, flippant recounting of his experiences. You’re rarely a paragraph away from a punchline, and the descriptions err on the side of comic exaggeration. But it’s also full of tense situations that sometimes end in death or disability. It makes for an odd and rapid-fire oscillation between the comic and the tragic that has obviously struck a chord with the reading public. Was he surprised by the book’s success? “Yes,” he says immediately. “I thought that if it got an audience it would be because we all use the NHS. But the majority of people who write to me say they didn’t realise it was that bad. The NHS is such a big employer that everyone knows someone who works for it. And people are thinking, ‘I know someone who’s in that position”, rather than ‘Isn’t the human body marvellous?’” And if Kay’s account is halfway accurate, any doctor below the level of consultant deserves the sympathy that readers appear to be giving them. The problem about assessing its accuracy is that Kay writes a lot for laughs, and his particular style of humour is to ramp up events until they seem too anecdotally perfect to be true. But he insists the book is “reasonably accurate”, and that the main sleight of hand was to bolt the clinical data of patients to the biographical details of other patients, and change everyone’s names. “I wanted it to be more accurate but the publisher didn’t want me to go to prison,” he explains. Nonetheless there are many situations that test plausibility. After he is gazumped in trying to buy a flat that he and his boyfriend have set their hearts on, the couple who gazumped them turn up at his antenatal clinic. His fantasies of revenge are limited to revealing the baby’s sex to the unknowing parents. All true, he says. On another occasion he deals with a difficult and racist patient undergoing surgery by sewing her up after the operation in such a way as to disfigure her dolphin tattoo. Did that really happen? “I don’t want to talk about that one because that’s one I wasn’t meant to put in the book,” he says, adding, “but that obviously did happen.” If anything, he says, it’s the stuff he left out that is really outlandish. “I’ve got some amazing stories about celebrities, which couldn’t go in.” In his first year as a doctor, he writes, he removed four foreign objects – including a toilet brush and TV remote control – from different patients’ rectums. They all suffer from what he terms Eiffel syndrome – “I fell, doctor! I fell!” In the book he’s told that the remote control insertion occurred while sitting down on the sofa, which he concedes is a possibility. Cue the punchline. When the remote control is removed in theatre, “we notice it has a condom on it, so maybe it wasn’t a complete accident”. I wonder if seeing the absurd lengths to which people go in an effort to find pleasure or stimulation affected how he looked at his fellow humans? “No, it’s like when you get into your first serious relationship and you meet someone’s family and realise everyone’s family is really weird as well – not just my one. We’ve all got our hidden stories. One of the strange privileges of being a doctor is finding out what everyone’s up to. Working in sexual health you stop being surprised about the things people do.” The book is based on diaries he kept while he was a junior doctor, and he thinks he may have overrepresented the comic incidents because he used to write about them to ease the sense of pressure he felt. Kay is at his most vivid as a writer when describing what that pressure involved. We see him working 97-hour weeks, falling asleep in his car, unable to maintain friendships because he’s never able to see friends, driving long distances to work at ever-changing hospitals and having to pay extortionate parking fees, and struggling to find decent accommodation on a paltry salary. On top of that he’s admonished if he makes mistakes, but never commended if he does well. And whereas he has to cancel holidays, wedding invitations and much else besides to fit in with changing rotas, one of his consultants takes two weeks of compassionate leave when her dog dies, while other consultants are almost strangers to their wards. Towards the end of the book, Kay is in charge of an operation that, owing to an unforeseen complication in the patient’s pregnancy, goes tragically wrong. And although he’s only one rung down from being a consultant, he realises that he can’t go on and walks away from the profession. He says now that he was probably suffering from undiagnosed post traumatic stress disorder, and that little understanding was shown by the medical authorities. He believes that in such circumstances, doctors should immediately be offered a week off work if they want it. Instead, he didn’t discuss what had happened with anyone, even his family, who are all doctors. He was in a state of depression for about a year, not going out, not seeing anyone, and losing a great deal of weight. It was only when he began getting work as a comedy writer that he got his “life back on track”. Kay had enjoyed a longstanding interest in comedy, performing in medical student revues, and later in corporate gigs for pharmaceutical companies. He’d also been on Radio 4 and performed at the Edinburgh festival, so comedy was the obvious way to go, though he found it difficult to turn his back on medicine, and briefly considered retraining as a GP. Although he has forged a successful new career, it would be wrong to say he never looked back. He still misses that “non-specific feeling of doing something good and useful”. And he maintains a great respect for those who do the job he once did. This is why he was so upset about what he sees as the misrepresentation of junior doctors in last year’s contractual dispute with the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. At the time the British Medical Association recommended the new contracts being offered by the department for health as “safe” and “fair”. But junior doctors disagreed and the BMA then supported strike action. Kay believes the doctors were portrayed as money-grabbing and irresponsible when, he argues, precisely the opposite is true. So he saw the book as a chance not only to set the record straight but “an opportunity to make a pre-emptive strike … for the next time around, and there will be a next time around.” Indeed, Kay believes the situation has got much worse since he left medicine in 2010. “I spoke to various colleagues and people when I was putting it together to make sure I was still adequately representing the plight of a junior doctor. The system is one that never had a lot of slack in it but is now stretched to absolute breaking point. They’ve got a fraction of the number of doctors they need to adequately perform the job. The biggest problem at the moment is the retention of doctors and that’s simply because the working conditions are so bad.” At the conclusion of the book, Kay writes an open letter to Jeremy Hunt in which he suggests he should have to work shifts alongside junior doctors, so that their motivation was never again questioned. This message has obviously worked with readers. At book signings Kay says he has often been asked to sign an extra copy that people then send on to Hunt. Whether or not it was receiving these books that did it, Hunt asked to see Kay a few weeks ago. “It really confused me,” says Kay. “I don’t understand why he wanted to meet. All he was going to do was give me publicity should I want it.” Presumably he wanted to put his case across, which, it turns out, is exactly what happened. “He genuinely thought he could change my mind,” Kay says, mystified by the idea. “It was as if he was explaining to someone who didn’t know the facts.” The meeting lasted just over half an hour and, by Kay’s reckoning, neither party was much impressed by the other. “Let’s not forget that this is a man who got into a fight about statistics with Stephen Hawking, so the chance that I was going to change his worldview was slim.” The trouble with the book is that even if it did persuade Hunt to recruit more doctors, it would also probably discourage students from applying. As Kay admits: “I think if I had kids I would put them off medicine.” The book certainly confirms the popular belief that the NHS has been financially starved and its staff is demoralised. There is a more complex story that could be told about organisational reform, ever-expanding medical demands and expectations, and how much tax we’re prepared to pay to finance massive investment in healthcare. But this is a personal story, and one that resonates in a time of austerity and stasis. It’s a tale of hidden self-sacrifice in an age of naked self-enrichment. Inspired by such stoicism, I never do get around to telling Kay about my various illnesses. Given that he’s now a comedy writer and he used to specialise in obstetrics, I think, from my sick bed, that it was probably the right choice. • This Is Going to Hurt by Adam Kay is published by Picador (£16.99).

It’s not the friendly Potteries dialect, but something that sounds a little like the lovechild of French and German. A Tudor house here is home to the Esperanto Association of Britain (EAB), which encourages people to learn the constructed language. Esperanto summer schools were first established in Stoke in 1960, and were funded by the council for more than 50 years. The concept of an easy-to-learn, universal second tongue was energetically promoted, drawing prominent speakers to the area. And the city still bears traces of its Esperanto history. In Smallthorne, in the north-east of the city, drinkers can stop off on Esperanto Way to get a pint at the Green Star – the symbol of the Esperantist movement. A row of terraced houses a short walk away are located on Zamenhof Grove, named after the inventor of Esperanto, LL Zamenhof. The language isn’t a relic; in fact, while exact figures are difficult to pin down, there has been a resurgence in people taking it up. The Esperanto Association has increased the number of beginners’ courses it offers four-fold to keep up with demand, says Viv O’Dunne, the charity’s operations and events director. The “inner idea” of Esperanto, Zamenhof once said, was to promote world peace. A Jewish-Polish doctor born in 1859 in Białystok, now in Poland, Zamenhof grew up under Russian occupation. Violence between different groups was common – Białystok which was a melting pot of Protestant Germans, Catholic Poles, Orthodox Russians and Jews. While still a child, Zamenhof hit upon the idea that a constructed second language that was easy to learn and understand would allow people to talk as peers, rather than fight. In 1887, after tinkering away for more than 10 years, Zamenhof published his ideas in a pamphlet. By 1905, the fundamental rules of Esperanto had been established by a conference of speakers in France, and Esperantist groups began popping up across the world. Tim Owen, education director for the EAB, gives me a crash course in what makes it straight-forward. “Probably the main factor is that you can acquire a huge vocabulary without knowing so many words,” he says. All words ending -o are nouns, an -a ending is for an adjective, while -e denotes an adverb. He shows me that, for instance, “vidi” – meaning to see – can become “vido” for vision, “vida” for visual and “vide” for visually, concepts that require different words in English. If you need to find an opposite, you can add the “mal” prefix: “pura” is clean, “malpura” is dirty. These building blocks can help speakers learn new words very quickly. “It’s like working with a magic multiplier,” says Owen. The spellings are phonetic, there are no grammatical genders, verbs are strictly regular, and the vocabulary is a blend of European languages familiar to many. It’s child’s play to learn compared with my years of torturous high-school language lessons. But isn’t a universal constructed language just a hobby for idealistic eccentrics? O’Dunne laughs, and concedes the stereotype might have a grain of truth: “We’ve still got those!” But, he says, there’s been a marked change in the demographic of attendees recently. “Over the last two or three years, there’s been much more interest from younger people who want to use it to travel and correspond ... it just feels like it’s been rejuvenated,” she says. At the charity’s headquarters at Esperanto House, there are rows of old academic tomes on the linguistics of constructed languages, but it’s the colourful translations of bestsellers and bright current affairs magazines that catch the eye. “[Esperanto is] a little bit geeky, but geeky is cool now, right?” says one recent convert. Nineteen-year-old Sammy Kennedy, an aspiring photographer who works in retail in Manchester, is one of the young Esperantists helping the language shake off its niche image. He has attended events run by the EAB and has noticed more and more people taking an interest. Esperanto groups where he lives were defunct for ages, he tells me. “Now, there’s a new Manchester Esperanto group that meets up monthly,” he says. Esperanto has become steadily more accessible largely thanks to the language-learning app Duolingo. The Esperanto course recently reached a million learners worldwide, more than are currently learning Hungarian or Czech on the site. There’s a dizzying array of other online options to help would-be learners, too. A few taps on the Amikumu (or “do the friendly thing”) app shows users local Esperantists to chat with, while numerous Facebook groups help beginners with vocab and grammar. Esperanto may have been the brainchild of a Polish doctor in the 19th century, but it has adapted for the 21st. Simone Davis, a civil servant, began learning Esperanto online to distract her from painful chronic health conditions. She found that even at her most tired or ill, she could manage a lesson on her tablet. “One lesson easily becomes two or three and before I knew it I was hooked,” she says. In just over a year, she learned more Esperanto than she has French, despite taking French classes for five years. It’s the values underpinning the language, as well as its ease, that drew in Davis. Esperanto is “a symbol of intentional goodwill towards others”, she says. Esperantists place a heavy value on the language being “neutral”, not belonging to one country. Many tell me they were inspired to pick up the books in response to what they see as rising isolationism in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit. Learning the language isn’t just a hobby, but a commitment to making connections across borders on a level playing field. I initially write this off as simply a nice sentiment, but there’s plenty of practise behind the principle. O’Dunne shows me the Pasporta Servo, a pocket-sized directory of Esperantists all around the world. They offer fellow speakers a place to stay in their home country, often completely free of charge. For language enthusiasts under 25, the charity NoJef will pay for travel and accommodation for attendance at Esperanto-themed events. The Pasporta Servo led 26-year-old James McMurray, a data engineer from Crawley, to make learning Esperanto his New Year’s resolution several years ago. He had first became familiar with the language while leafing through his grandfather’s books – he had become an Esperantist while stationed in India during the second world war. “I remember growing up and seeing his books in Esperanto, without being able to understand it, and his correspondence with people all over the world who may not speak English and be able to communicate,” McMurray says. He has since attended Esperantist music events in France, and met up with fellow learners in Prague and Malaga. His first serious relationship started through a shared interest in Esperanto. Despite the resolutely internationalist spirit of Esperanto, it hard to imagine global business being conducted with a cheery “Saluton!” Some utopian-minded speakers say its day as a lingua franca will come (“Esperanto” means “one who hopes” in the language), but most acknowledge that this is unlikely. Partly to blame is repression throughout the 20th century by authoritarian regimes. Adolf Hitler condemned Esperanto in Mein Kampf as a “secret language” for Jewish plots, and even the very small minority of pro-fascist Esperanto speakers were targeted by the Nazi party. Mostly, however, it’s the omnipresence of English that explains why Esperanto isn’t the current go-to for international communication. Esperanto is “neutral” because it is not a national language, but that also means it does not have a state backing its use abroad. (For context, the British Council allocated more than £1bn last year to promote English-language education overseas.) “People having to make a choice will see English as the financially better option,” Kennedy says. “However, Esperanto gives you things that English will never be able to give you … [such as] a sense of belonging.” He credits the “accepting and caring” Esperanto-speaking community with helping him to overcome loneliness and bullying. Whether to learn a national language or a constructed one is a debate Kennedy has had with others. But one piece of advice from another Esperanto-speaker stayed with him: “Learn English if you want to make money; learn Esperanto if you want to make friends.” “It’s one of the truest things I’ve ever heard,” he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/06/ryanair-at-risk-from-industrial-action-ahead-of-christmas-schedule","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T18:50:07Z","webTitle":"Ryanair pilots threaten to strike in run-up to Christmas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/06/ryanair-at-risk-from-industrial-action-ahead-of-christmas-schedule","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/06/ryanair-at-risk-from-industrial-action-ahead-of-christmas-schedule","fields":{"headline":"Ryanair pilots threaten to strike in run-up to Christmas","bodyText":"Ryanair is facing the threat of pre-Christmas industrial action in three European markets, including its first ever pilots’ strike. Pilots in Italy have voted to strike for four hours on 15 December, while colleagues in Dublin are voting on whether to follow suit, just days after Portuguese pilots voted in favour of industrial action. Ryanair brushed off the prospect of fresh disruption, saying that previous threatened strikes hade failed to materialise. The carrier’s relationship with its pilots has become increasingly strained after rostering problemsled to 20,000 flight cancellations. Ryanair moved to head off the threat of Portuguese and Italian action spreading to Ireland on Thursday, warning pilots that their pay and conditions may be affected if they vote in favour of a strike. In a memo to captains and first officers in Dublin, the Irish airline said it would freeze promotions, cut cash allowances and move pilots to different bases if they supported industrial action during ballots being held this week. Speaking earlier this week, the Irish pilots union, IALPA, said its members were considering following their counterparts in Italy and Portugal by backing industrial action. Capt Evan Cullen, the union’s president, said: “The pilot issues which gave rise to the flight cancellations earlier this year have not been adequately addressed. Ryanair pilots, who are members of IALPA, are currently considering their options.” Ryanair said: “We regularly receive threats of industrial action from competitor airline pilot unions from Italy, Portugal and even Aer Lingus pilots occasionally. Both we and our pilots ignore these letters.” The Italian pilots’ union, Anpac, which claims to represent 280 of Ryanair’s approximately 4,000 pilots, said on Wednesday its members would not work between 2pm and 6pm on 15 December. Ryanair, which does not recognise trade unions, said Anpac was an Alitalia union with “no role” in the company. Ryanair pointed out that Anpac had previously voted to strike six times without any action taking place. “We expect this latest threatened strike will also be postponed or cancelled,” a spokesperson said. Relations between Ryanair and its pilots have soured since it announced two waves of cancellations due to an error in how it schedules their hours. Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive, admitted the airline had been “too tight on pilot numbers”. The company has been recruiting to solve the problem. Pilots are understood to have been emboldened by a belief that the airline is still short of qualified pilots and are coordinating their efforts via their European employee representative committee (ERC) composed of current Ryanair pilots. Ryanair deals with multiple European ERCs separately, allowing it to negotiate separate terms with different bases of operations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/06/letter-liam-smith-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T17:02:00Z","webTitle":"Letter: Liam Smith obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/06/letter-liam-smith-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/06/letter-liam-smith-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letter: Liam Smith obituary","bodyText":"From 1962 to 1965 Liam Smith was our history tutor at Goldsmiths College London.

But inside the theaters the faces were long and so were the running times. Though rich in new American plays and gussied up revivals, Broadway this year often felt like a letdown, taking fewer risks and reaping fewer rewards. The Laura of Sam Gold’s deconstructed The Glass Menagerie wouldn’t blow out her candles, yet elsewhere the lights seemed dimmer, the costumes less spangled, the orchestra mildly depressed. Blame these blues on the presidential election? Tempting. But most projects secured funding before last November. A handful of pieces were explicitly political to begin with and became even more political after the inauguration, like Lynn Nottage’s Sweat, a deeply researched meditation on what happens to factory workers in a swing state small town when the factories shutter. The finale of JT Rogers’s Oslo, about a back channel for negotiations between Israel and Palestine, also struck a melancholy note, as the promise of peace receded out of reach of its characters. If one wanted to escape grim news alerts and social media feeds, other plays offered even less quarter. The London import 1984 provided a violent dystopia that might have resonated more had its leads not been miscast. (Who thinks of Tom Sturridge as humdrum or of Olivia Wilde as drab?) Less violent though often just as frustrating was Michael Moore’s self-congratulatory solo The Terms of My Surrender, notable mostly for baiting the president into a Twitter war. Add “limited run” to the concepts Donald J Trump has failed to grasp. Like Moore’s show, Beau Willimon’s Beltway play, The Parisian Woman, name-checked cabinet members and railed against venality, though the president has yet to tweet a response. Themes of conflict and disenfranchisement extended throughout other works, like August Wilson’s Jitney, superbly acted, in which unlicensed livery drivers struggle in a changing Pittsburgh, and Arthur Miller’s The Price, in which a beat cop must reckon with his sacrifices. And there were uncomfortable echoes of the people and forces that had put Trump in power in everything from the enjoyably vicious and appetitive antiheroine of Lillian Hellman’s The Little Foxes to the less enticing machers of Ayad Akhtar’s Junk, set in the unregulated Wall Street of the 1980s. Disillusionment and dashed hopes stalked the characters of The Present (Andrew Upton’s adaptation of Chekhov’s Ivanov), Joshua Harmon’s Significant Other, JB Priestley’s Time and the Conways, Sunset Boulevard, Miss Saigon, M Butterfly, Six Degrees of Separation, even the poignant revival of Sunday in the Park with George. Groundhog Day, despite its clever lyrics and imaginative stagecraft, seemed freighted with more than its share of existentialist dread and even Bruce Springsteen, in his soloish show Springsteen on Broadway, has reportedly tamped down his customary fire. He wouldn’t allow handclaps in the dark, let alone dancing. (Tickets were so rare and so expensive – another sort of a downer – that my knowledge of these stifled claps is admittedly secondhand.) Some shows meant to cheer up an audience didn’t fully succeed, like Present Laughter, which boasted a Kevin Kline soigné perfection from the tips of his moustache to the hem of his dressing gown, yet seemed to struggle for hilarity, though it never struggled quite as hard as The Play That Goes Wrong, which couldn’t seem to go quite nearly enough. The musical adaptation of Amélie couldn’t shake its air of preciosity or the pall of its passive heroine and Steve Martin’s iterative Meteor Shower was its own falling star, a comedy in search of a situation. Several of the more successful shows struck bittersweet notes, like Paula Vogel’s Indecent, an excavation of a forgotten theatrical scandal, and Come From Away, a wispy tearjerker and smile-tugger about a Newfoundland town that housed thousands of travelers in the days after September 11. (Some might add The Band’s Visit and Once on This Island, which I will see in the coming weeks, to this list. The final Broadway shows of that fall, The Children and Farinelli and the King, have yet to open.) But even a downbeat season has its pleasures and compensations, like the joyful and sumptuous revival of Hello, Dolly! starring a dumpling gobbling Bette Midler and a soaring chorus who make the most of heart-lifters like Put on Your Sunday Clothes. Though its story and characters barely register, the gonzo visual pleasure of SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical is extreme, particularly a curtain call of confetti cannon excess and full-bore surreality. New plays like Indecent, Oslo, Sweat and Lucas Hnath’s brainy A Doll’s House, Part 2 provided an embarrassment of American riches. Performances to treasure included Laurie Metcalf’s devastating, mercurial Nora in A Doll’s House, Part 2, Andy Karl’s dangerously charming Phil in Groundhog Day, Laura Linney’s blissfully avaricious Regina opposite Cynthia Nixon’s heartbreaking Birdie in The Little Foxes, Jake Gyllenhaal’s poignantly distant George and Annaleigh Ashford’s vibrantly present Dot, as well as the expert, responsive ensembles of Jitney and Indecent. And there were smaller moments, too, like the orgiastic dance party of The Present or the inky black evening gown that Cobie Smulders wore in Present Laughter. Or the brilliant beauty of Sunday in the Park’s Chromolume, a reminder that even in grim times there is color and light."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/bike-blog/2018/feb/20/its-time-football-started-to-take-cycling-seriously","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"It's time football started to take cycling seriously | Robin Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/feb/20/its-time-football-started-to-take-cycling-seriously","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/feb/20/its-time-football-started-to-take-cycling-seriously","fields":{"headline":"It's time football started to take cycling seriously","bodyText":"I am a football fan and I am a cyclist. These identities do not need to be mutually exclusive – so why is it often such a challenge to go to the game by bike?I support Norwich City and I live in Liverpool, which is the first hurdle. Liverpool is 238 miles away from Norwich, and the direct train takes more than five hours. Because of this, I have pretty much given up on home games. But I do love away games, and often go by train and bike, or car and bike. Norwich sometimes sell out their ticket allocation, so for the last three seasons I have bought an away season ticket to guarantee me access. Getting to a Tuesday evening game in Middlesbrough isn’t the easiest journey whatever the form of transport, but why should cycling some of the way add to the problems? My final match of last season was at Leeds. There are some decent cycle lanes there and I cheerfully cycled between the city centre and my accommodation in Headingley, but once I set off to Elland Road I saw no cycle route signs at all. On my way to Millwall, I thought cycling across London would be easier but the journey from Camberwell was tricky and the I couldn’t find any bike parking facilities at Millwall. And although there is walking and cycling signage to Bolton Wanderers’ Macron Stadium, I took my life into my own hands trying to cycle there on the busy roads and ended up locking my bike to a nearby lamp-post outside the ground. A notable exception is Brighton and Hove Albion, who have one of the newer stadiums that take cycling seriously. Although the Amex is a little way out of town, it is very well signposted and has proper cycle parking. When I visited there last season, I even found some home fans to cycle in with. Bristol City also deserve a mention; their website lists directions to get the the ground by bike, and provides parking when you get there. As I get older, my knees are getting worse and covering the final few miles by bike saves so much trouble whether I go by train or car. For many home fans, cycling could be the easiest option, but few clubs cater in any meaningful way for those who do choose to cycle to the match. It doesn’t have to be this way. In July, I went to Tilburg in the Netherlands to watch the England women’s team play Portugal. I borrowed a bike from my Airbnb host, and found I could ride easily to the ground thanks to good signage. The only hassle was queuing to get my bike back afterwards as the park was so crowded; about 5-10% of the 3,300 fans in attendance travelled by bike. Uefa even incentivised fans and staff to cycle with a smartphone app. Although football clubs already do a lot of good work in their communities, the stereotype of a middle-aged male fan squashed into a tight replica team shirt is too often accurate. Encouraging supporters to walk and cycle to grounds is a simple way of helping them to lead healthier lifestyles, as well as helping to reduce congestion and air pollution on a matchday. Clubs should work with the community to devise safe cycling routes with appropriate signage. Once at the ground, they should provide covered bike racks, ideally with CCTV for protection, and officials should know where the parking area is. And finally, clubs should tell the fans – the majority of clubs provide no indication of cycle routes or parking facilities on their websites. To help clubs encourage their fans to cycle to stadia on a matchday, Healthy Stadia has developed active travel guidance and case studies with pioneering clubs from across Europe, including Brighton and Hove Albion. With cycling on the rise, it’s essential that Britain’s football clubs embrace the needs of the future. • Robin Ireland is director of research (honorary) with the European Healthy Stadia Network What is provision for cycling like at your club?

Marriage equality will come into effect on Saturday, after the governor general, Peter Cosgrove, signed the bill into law on Friday, but the first same-sex weddings cannot occur until 9 January, after the one-month waiting period. Labor and the Coalition have begun a war of words over taking credit for the reform, with the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, accusing the opposition of stymying the postal survey. Brandis told ABC Radio: “This is not owned by the Liberal party or the Labor party or any political party, it’s owned by the Australian people.” The attorney general said the moment the public galleries “exploded spontaneously” was “unforgettable” and marriage equality was “the most consequential” thing he had done as the nation’s first law officer. Turnbull said the passage of marriage equality was “a joyous occasion”, brought about because Australians had told parliament to “get on with it” through the 62% yes vote in the postal survey. The prime minister, who originally opposed a plebiscite but committed to it after he rolled Tony Abbott as Liberal leader, trumpeted the fact he had gone to the 2016 election promising to give Australians a say. “The Labor party, for purely political reasons, did everything to frustrate that,” he said. “We managed to find a way to do that without legislation and it worked magnificently. That’s what gave the momentum.” Labor leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, accused Turnbull of “desperation” for attacking Labor in a moment of “national joy”. After all the amendments proposed by conservatives were defeated, marriage equality passed with overwhelming support, with only three Coalition MPs and the independent Bob Katter opposed. Turnbull said the image of only four MPs opposing marriage equality sent a message of “affirmation for same-sex couples” and young gay people. Senior conservatives – including former prime minister Abbott, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, and MPs Kevin Andrews and George Christensen – were absent from the chamber, abstaining from the vote. Christensen said he did not vote for the bill because he was concerned it “failed to protect religious liberty” and did not vote against it because “I told my electorate I would not vote against their wishes”. Joyce told the lower house on Thursday he would “never vote against the view of the Australian people”, but he supported the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. “There should also be acknowledgement that absolute victory is absolute tyranny if you don’t take into account some of the views of those who disagree,” he said. At a doorstop in the Bennelong electorate in Sydney, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said marriage equality was “a triumph not for parliament but for all the people of Australia”. He accused Turnbull of hypocrisy for “running around like he is the godfather of marriage equality”. “That is great that we voted that yesterday, but today is back to work, Malcolm Turnbull,” Shorten said. Actor and LGBTI rights advocate Magda Szubanski told Channel Seven’s Sunrise that Australia had experienced “one of those big civil rights moments”. “It’s an extraordinary moment in history. It will change us as a country. It will have an impact – we think we don’t have an impact on the world, but what we do ripples out,” she said. “It feels like this burden has been lifted. Lifted for all of us. And it just reminds you of the sense of fairness of the average Australian, doesn’t it? We are good people and we are sensible people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/11/brexit-distraction-real-problem-uk-clapped-out-economy-winden-manufacturing-production-base","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T08:58:47Z","webTitle":"Brexit is just a distraction to the real problem: the UK’s clapped-out economy | Austin Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/brexit-distraction-real-problem-uk-clapped-out-economy-winden-manufacturing-production-base","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/11/brexit-distraction-real-problem-uk-clapped-out-economy-winden-manufacturing-production-base","fields":{"headline":"Brexit is just a distraction to the real problem: the UK’s clapped-out economy","bodyText":"As Brexiteers shout “forward” and remainers chant “ back”, the battle over the EU dominates British politics. Yet it obscures a more basic British problem. Our clapped-out economy, brilliant at consumption, poor at production, is becoming unviable. A “nation of shopkeepers” has become a nation of shoppers, dependent on debt. Deindustrialisation and misguided economic policies have reduced the former workshop of the world to a level where Britain can neither pay its way, nor afford the defence and public services an advanced society needs. Everything in which we once were leaders – ships, railways, TV, great bridges, nuclear plants, bicycles, textiles, clothing, even Kit Kats – we now import. We consume more than we produce, leading to an annual balance of payments deficit rising above 6% of GDP, financed by borrowing and selling companies, property and citizenship to survive. The result is a sluggish economy (a growing proportion of which is owned by foreigners); low productivity (because the manufacturing sector has shrunk to one-tenth of GDP); and static pay, as every sector except finance cuts costs to survive. Being in or out of the EU has little relevance to this basic problem. The EU is a market, not a mutual support system. Instead of redistributing growth to succour laggards it punishes them, as it has Greece. It drains us and proscribes the techniques of nurture by state aid, protectionism and devaluation by which Germany and France grew. Its “aid” is just our own money back, with the EU’s heavy costs taken out. Even worse, Germany’s huge surpluses mean that deficit countries like the UK, with our £60bn-plus trade deficit, are compounded by the single market. Yet coming out offers no solution either. It generates uncertainty and deters investment. Most of world trade is controlled by multinationals, and Britain would be more vulnerable to their ministrations. Tory Brexiteers aim at turning us, down and dirty, into a low-wage, deregulated, cost-cutting tax haven-on-Thames. Hardly acceptable to an electorate that has already endured decades of that. The only solution is to rebalance an economy excessively dependent on finance and services by widening the manufacturing and production base and making it competitive. Neither free trade nor the single market will do that. New industries don’t just come, still less grow to scale, or become national champions like VW, Samsung or Toyota, unaided. The only historic model of rebuilding is that used by Germany and Japan after the second world war, and later by young dragons such as Korea and Taiwan, followed now by China. All built powerful exporting sectors by the opposite methods to those that have reduced Britain to its present pass. They used a devalued exchange rate, deliberately kept low to penalise imports and boost exports. They built up powerful exporting sectors and strong competitor companies by industrial policy, state support and investment, while restraining domestic demand to channel ability and investment into production. The result was a process of continuous improvement, while Britain wound down. Harsh treatment, but what alternative do we have? Neoliberalism has damaged, not boosted. Shelf-stacking and delivery driving for the consumer society offer few prospects. The Washington consensus doesn’t work. Training and upskilling are little use without industries to employ the beneficiaries. The financial sector is better at producing wealth for the few than jobs for the many. The government’s new industrial strategy offers hope without muscle. Our civil servants are hopeless at working with industry. We lack the French pantouflage skill at transferring their elite civil servants between public and private sectors, while Treasury rules make financial support bureaucratic and restrictive. Our governments have been generous to the banks, not to manufacturing. Finance prefers safe lending on mortgages to venture capital. Our unions don’t work like the German ones do in the Mitbestimmung system. Our companies look to short-term profit rather than long-term growth. Our capitalism is better at rent-seeking than competing. Serious policies of state support, economic discipline, corporate governance and investment priorities are essential to make Britain’s economy fit for use, in or out of the single market. Widening and deepening our industrial base requires a substantial devaluation, a restraint on domestic living standards, an industrial policy sustained by state intervention, investment and a venture capitalism that will allow a hundred plants to blossom. Britain won’t make it unless it can make things and sell them to the world. The prospect is daunting. Hopes for a government strong enough to do it look slim, and an electorate already alienated by years of austerity to no purpose won’t welcome more tough measures. Perhaps we’re set on a path of decline which has to go further and hurt more, before anything is done. Yet nothing will be, unless our political elite grasps the real problem. The argument over EU membership is just another distraction. • Austin Mitchell is a former Labour MP for Grimsby and public accounts commissioner.

But none of those who have been told they are leaving are from the countries proscribed by Donald Trump’s newly upheld travel ban. Refugees and asylum seekers on Manus are being held in new Australian-built accommodation centres on the island after the forcible and violent clearance of the decommissioned detention centre. The new facilities have been plagued by problems: large parts of the centres are not yet built, and there have been insufficient rooms and beds for the number of men there. There remains a lack of water, food has been stolen, and the owners of the land on which the centres are built have protested against their presence, cutting electricity, blocking access roads and threatening staff. Water supplies have failed at the East Lorengau centre – pictures and videos show refugees filling buckets from a water truck brought into the camp at night. Another accommodation block, Hillside Haus, has been without power. Refugees have been forced to wait up to seven hours for food, and, in some cases, only half have been fed, the Iranian refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani has said. A notice posted in the new Manus accommodation centres said representatives from the US Resettlement Support Centre would visit Port Moresby from 14 December, and that some refugees would be required to travel to the capital for appointments. “Further resettlement progress is expected in coming months. Your patience is appreciated.” About 60 refugees – understood to be mainly Afghans, Pakistanis and Rohingya – have been told they will be travelling to Port Moresby next week. None are from Iran or Somalia – countries proscribed by Trump’s “travel ban” that was this week upheld by a majority of justices on the supreme court. It remains unclear exactly what impact the executive order will have on the US resettlement deal brokered between Australia and the US before Trump came into office. The order suspends the entry into the US of nationals from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela There is a clause in the order which would allow for nationals of those countries to be admitted to “enable the United States to conform its conduct to a pre-existing international agreement or arrangement”, but it is not known whether the US will seek to take only refugees from countries other than those proscribed. Iranians make up the largest cohort of refugees on both Manus and Nauru. There are already more than 100 refugees and asylum seekers from Australian-run offshore camps held in Port Moresby, most for medical care. Some hotels have been entirely booked out for months by the Australian Border Force to house refugees. Many of the refugees have been in the Papua New Guinean capital for months – suffering serious health problems – but have had either one or no medical appointments. Boochani said the refugees and asylum seekers still held on Manus – most have been there since 2013 – were frustrated “because every day we have to struggle with suffering created by this system”. Boochani said the refugees’ health had deteriorated. “The medical condition is much worse than before because so many people are traumatised by the last incident, when police beat the refugees. Also, some people who had a long history of psychological illness cannot get medicine.

That’s something he would take into account probably a number of the stakeholders that would be involved.” Heightened tensions on the Korea peninsula have raised questions about US participation in the games in Pyeongchang. Neighboring North Korean has recently intensified weapons testing and its leader, Kim Jong-un, has been trading insults with Donald Trump. UN ambassador Nikki Haley cast doubt on whether America would take part in an interview with the Fox News Channel on Wednesday. “There’s an open question,” she said. “I have not heard anything about that. But I do know that in the talks that we have, whether it’s Jerusalem, whether it’s North Korea, it’s always about, how do we do protect the US citizens in the area.” The US Olympic Committee released a statement in response, saying it had not had any discussions, either internally or with government officials. A spokesman for NBC, which will broadcast the games in the US, told the Washington Post that the network is monitoring the situation and they currently “have no plans to change our preparation for the games, which are in full swing”. The Olympics are scheduled to begin on 9 February in a mountainous region located about 50 miles from the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. Earlier this week it was announced that Russia’s Olympic team would be barred as punishment over state-sponsored doping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/antonio-carluccio-remembered-by-giorgio-locatelli-obituaries-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"Antonio Carluccio remembered by Giorgio Locatelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/antonio-carluccio-remembered-by-giorgio-locatelli-obituaries-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/antonio-carluccio-remembered-by-giorgio-locatelli-obituaries-2017","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Carluccio remembered by Giorgio Locatelli","bodyText":"I met Antonio through [the chef and restaurateur] Fergus Henderson, when I was a young man working at the Savoy. I had come from Italy in 1985, and Antonio was already running the Neal Street Restaurant. He was like an encyclopedia: I remember thinking: “Wow, this guy really knows a lot about Italian food!” I thought I knew a lot, but he knew much more than me. After that we became friends, and sometimes we worked together. For me he was a great inspiration: this was someone who changed the way Italian food is perceived in this country. Before Carluccio people thought of Italian food as one thing: he was one of the first to highlight its regionality, which is very important. And his books are an amazing legacy – the last one, about vegetables, was unbelievable. Over the years, whenever I felt trapped in a corner or didn’t know what to do with the restaurant, he was practically the only person I could call. Because he’s been through it all: he got it all, he lost it all, he won it all. He’s been through all these emotions. So for me he was a very important person: he would just put me back in my place and say, “Come on, get on with that, that’s what you have to do.” A few years ago, when he was going through divorce and things like that, even if he was down himself he was always ready to give you good advice. There was never any self-interest: he wanted all of us to do well. He understood the importance of Italian food – there was no such thing as competition. He wanted everyone to know what he knew, he wanted to teach everyone. The thing he taught me about food was simplicity and truthfulness. He said: “You have to look at a dish and say, ‘Would my grandmother be proud of me if I cooked this?’” And that’s exactly the thing you should do all the time as a chef. It was his down-to-earth approach that made him so accessible and popular. What he did with the restaurants and the delis – the guy was 20 years ahead of everyone else. The best food he ever cooked for me was spaghetti with tomato sauce – it was the most delicious spaghetti. He never tried to strike you with the genius of the chef, it was always about the quality of the ingredients and telling a story: where the dish came from, why it was made like that. People remember dishes that come with stories, and he was very good at them. This is a guy who went mushroom-picking with Gorbachev – he did a lot of things in life. Some people tell you things to show off, but for him it meant he was not going to die with only him knowing it. At one point the Italian government gave me a prize, like a knighthood, and I was so nervous about going to the embassy. He called me up and said “That night I’ll be there next to you.” My father had passed away, but it felt like my dad was there. I think he saw a bit of himself a little through me: we had a 30-year age difference – a generation. He was roughly my dad’s age. We also did charity work together – every year we’d go to these “Olympic games” organised by an Italian youth group, to give them medals. He was so sweet about it, with all these kids around. We also did a project called The Clink, a charity run by a friend of mine where young offenders set up a restaurant at High Down prison outside London. Once, when we had worked really hard on lunch there, he gave me a lift back. In the car he started to tell stories, so for over two hours I just sat there listening. It was like an audiobook: like you were travelling through someone’s life. It was such a moment of intimacy – I felt very close to him. I love the picture we did with the fish and the violin [for Observer Food Monthly]. For the shoot he was really super grumpy: he arrived at the hotel and didn’t want to change. I was all dressed up with a hat and everything, and he was wearing jeans and a shirt. I said, “No, come on, Antonio, it will look fantastic” and in the end he changed. But every time he came to my house he would see it and go, “Argh, look at that”. For every slice of truffle I’ll cut for the rest of my life, or every mushroom I sauté, I’ll always think of Antonio. He’s going to be there for ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/08/metoo-skip-office-parties-sexually-assaulted-christmas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T09:48:42Z","webTitle":"#MeToo means I can be honest about why I skip office Christmas parties | Jean Hannah Edelstein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/metoo-skip-office-parties-sexually-assaulted-christmas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/metoo-skip-office-parties-sexually-assaulted-christmas","fields":{"headline":"#MeToo means I can be honest about why I skip office Christmas parties","bodyText":"No, I’m not going to the office Christmas party this year, and yes, I’m feeling pretty happy about it. Thanks to the current cultural moment, in which we’re being more open about sexual assault than ever before, I feel safe being open this year about the fact that it’s because I was sexually assaulted at an office Christmas party. And though it’s a long time since I worked for that company – I left less than a year later – the thought of colleagues and alcohol and Christmas lights still makes my blood run cold. After I was assaulted, and before #MeToo, I did still attend these parties: out of a sense of obligation, of concern that I would be judged to lack commitment or team spirit if I didn’t show my face. At the parties I would smile thinly, standing with my back to the wall, never dancing, never having more than one drink. At the parties I would feel afraid that if I told anyone the truth I would be judged: to be making it up, to be oversensitive, or simply to be ruining the fun. That’s certainly how my then-colleagues regarded me that night, when the man who sat next to me in the office came up to me on the dancefloor, grabbed my breasts in each hand and dug with his fingers through the fabric of my dress and bra to twist my nipples. I’m sure that some people reading this are thinking that maybe I shouldn’t have worn such a thin dress, and rest assured that’s what I thought, too, when I took the dress off upon getting home and threw it in the bottom of my wardrobe. I never touched it again until I moved out of the UK almost a year later, when I donated it to a charity shop. I loved that dress, had worn it on many happy occasions, but on that night, at that office Christmas party, apparently I should have worn a North Face parka over three burlap sacks and a layer of chainmail made with barbed wire if I didn’t want a colleague to sexually assault me. At least that’s what many of my co-workers seemed to think. Some came over to see why I was so upset, after I pushed the man off me. “Oh,” they said, when I told them what had happened, “but it’s the office Christmas party.” “It’s not like you have a boyfriend,” said another, while a third helpfully pointed out that my attacker “is your friend”. And indeed, the office Christmas party has long been enshrined in our culture as a time when sexual assault is just part of the fun: six hours or so when women’s bodies are up for grabs in the name of the festive season. From the little I know about trauma, I assume that the reason that I have never again been able to enjoy an office Christmas party is because I can’t bear to be around corporate carousers without feeling like I’m being dragged right back to that bar in east London, to those grasping hands, to the abject feelings of panic and disgust that I felt when I left and cried on the phone to a friend as I rode home in a black cab. Not to mention the nearly four months I spent afterwards in a protracted HR process until my assailant was at last fired, which meant that I had to continue to sit in a room with him every day for eight hours, and was ostracised by many of his friends in the company, who felt I had ruined the fun. (The #MeToo movement inspired me to Google my assailant, to see how his career is going. It’s going well, in case you’re wondering.) Last night, a friend and I speculated about whether I could ever get over this: if exposure therapy might help. “I guess,” I said, “I could touch some tinsel in a safe environment.” “And the therapist could play Last Christmas while you do it, but only for 30 seconds.” Now that I don’t have to go to the party, I can almost laugh about it. The thing that man ruined for me for the rest of my life is just one night of the year. In that I’m much luckier than many. • Jean Hannah Edelstein is a freelance journalist and author"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/10/project-polunin-satori-sergei-coliseum-review-natalia-osipova","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Project Polunin: Satori review – straight from the hurt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/10/project-polunin-satori-sergei-coliseum-review-natalia-osipova","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/10/project-polunin-satori-sergei-coliseum-review-natalia-osipova","fields":{"headline":"Project Polunin: Satori review – straight from the hurt","bodyText":"Sergei Polunin’s Satori, which opened last week, is a peculiar evening of dance. It arrives on an ocean of hype, and in the wake of a poorly received programme at Sadler’s Wells in March. Polunin has stated that he wishes to divide his professional life between film acting and dancing, and the former seems to be going well for him. He has roles in the recently released Murder on the Orient Express, in The White Crow, about the defection of Rudolf Nureyev, and in Red Sparrow, opposite Jennifer Lawrence. But ballet is not a part-time affair, and the glorious classical technique that Polunin displayed in his Royal Ballet days is now only a memory. The Satori programme is in three parts. We open with First Solo, created by the Moscow-born choreographer Andrey Kaydanovskiy. This is a tautly sprung solo for Polunin, with much anguished self-clutching and a furious expenditure of energy. One section features balletic pyrotechnics, performed with a calculatedly rough edge. First Solo is followed by Kasyan Goleizovsky’s Scriabiniana (1962). Goleizovsky was an avant garde Soviet choreographer whose controversial work for the Bolshoi in the 1920s caused him to fall foul of the authorities. This is a late work, created in the post-Stalinist era, and here performed by Polunin with Natalia Osipova and a cast of guest artists. For all Goleizovsky’s kinetic fluency, and the beauty of Scriabin’s music, the piece looks terribly dated. Removed from its historical context, the abstract imploring and stagey gestures quickly become relentless. The dancers are excellent, but the work defies their best efforts to breathe new life into it. Scriabiniana calls to mind Icarus, the 1971 Vladimir Vasiliev piece with which Polunin opened his Sadler’s Wells programme. Why is he so attracted to these overwrought Soviet relics? In part, I suspect, because they offer an appropriately dramatic outlet for his own anguish. When he dances Scriabiniana’s final pas de deux with Osipova, he seems to be repurposing the work. All those heroic lifts, all those human-spirit-in-chains histrionics, become the expression of his own emotional predicament. This gives the evening an unexpected resonance. Polunin’s pain is real, as anyone who saw the documentary Dancer will attest. He was born with a phenomenal gift for ballet, but one that only came to flower at the expense of his parents’ marriage. How this affected him is made brutally clear in Satori, the evening’s 40-minute title piece. A key passage of the work features a young boy (Tom Waddington) who is physically dragged in opposing directions by his parents (Polunin and Liljana Velimirov), even as he desperately and unsuccessfully tries to pull them together. If much of the piece is cryptic, this sequence is not. As the mother, Velimirov is portrayed as unambiguously cruel. Satori is set to music by the German film composer Lorenz Dangel, and opens with Polunin sitting underneath a giant bonsai tree. Multiple screens play above his head, disseminating random information. Polunin staggers around, characters come and go, and then Osipova enters and they perform an odd but engaging duet, in the course of which she whips off a sequence of classical fouettés because... well, because she’s Osipova. Waddington slips out of the trunk of the tree as if from a birth canal, and the parent-child trio ensues. Afterwards, sinister black-clad demons take control of Polunin, bearing him to the ground, but he is freed by the final, redemptive entrance of Osipova. For a novice choreographer to present his first work in the largest theatre in the West End is unusual, to say the least, and formally speaking Satori appears chaotic. The set design (by David LaChapelle) is over-elaborate, with colliding clouds and much else besides. The choreography mixes styles haphazardly, with Polunin’s tortured attitudinising owing a considerable debt to Kenneth MacMillan’s Mayerling. All this, however, does not occlude the sincerity and feeling underpinning the piece. If one discards conventional balletic notions of form, and applies to Satori the same criteria that one might to a work by an autobiographical artist such as Jean-Michel Basquiat or Tracey Emin, in which inner feelings and personal history are expressed through unexpected and seemingly disordered marriages of image and reference, then Polunin’s intention snaps into focus. He wants us to understand his hurt, and through it, himself. The result, for all its apparent naivety, carries an authentic emotional charge that the fashionably arid work of many of today’s celebrity choreographers does not. The unmaking of a dancer might just be the making of an artist."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2017/dec/15/blockbuster-star-wars-the-last-jedi-rian-johnson-feel-the-force","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Feeling the force: why directing a Hollywood blockbuster is tougher than ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/dec/15/blockbuster-star-wars-the-last-jedi-rian-johnson-feel-the-force","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2017/dec/15/blockbuster-star-wars-the-last-jedi-rian-johnson-feel-the-force","fields":{"headline":"Feeling the force: why directing a Hollywood blockbuster is tougher than ever","bodyText":"It was hardly short of work, but “creative differences” must have become the most overused phrase in Hollywood. It was trotted out earlier this year when directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller departed the Han Solo spin-off, and when Colin Trevorrow was jettisoned from Star Wars: Episode IX. Ditto when Edgar Wright left Marvel’s Ant-Man in 2014, while there was a tart whiff of you-know-what about the reshoots on Gareth Edwards’s Rogue One. Then there have been high-profile conflicts during production, as with Josh Trank on Fantastic Four, and last-minute balks such as Warner’s decision not to let Ben Affleck direct as well as be The Batman. It’s hard not to conclude that, in the blockbuster world, directors – far from the idea of the creative mastermind – are becoming more disposable than ever. Disney’s franchise-heavy outfit is becoming notorious – especially under its Star Wars imprint – for Vader-like profligacy with the hired help. “If you rub Kathleen Kennedy up the wrong way, you’re out,” said an unnamed producer in the wake of the Trevorrow ousting, referring to Lucasfilm’s president. It’s timely for Disney, then, that someone has just had a good time making a Star Wars film. The Last Jedi writer-director Rian Johnson tells me: “You never know what it’s going to be like until you jump into the pool, but the truth is we got very lucky. I know it sounds like I’m repeating a company line, but it is genuinely, hand-on-heart the truth.” So much so that he has been granted creative custodianship of the Star Wars franchise for a fourth trilogy. With billions of dollars at stake in the mega-franchises, it’s not surprising studio executives are quick to press the eject button when it feels as if things are going wrong. But that raises the question of whether these pressurised, assembly-line products – release dates programmed years in advance; hidebound by pop-cultural baggage; expensive SFX sequences sometimes laid down before a full script exists – are suitable places for directors to express a personal vision. In his case, they are, says Johnson, who has sole script credit on The Last Jedi: “The thing that I found from day one on engaging with Lucasfilm was that they encouraged me to find the personal in it and to pursue that. The original films felt the way they did because George [Lucas] was engaged with them, and they were essentially personal stories told in this big, mythic way.” Johnson speaks warmly about collaborating with Kennedy and the Lucasfilm Story Group, and says he wasn’t subject to particular stipulations or house style. Nor did Star Wars lore restrict his writing. “I was pulling from it in the same way that Lucas and [Steven] Spielberg were pulling from the sources they loved as kids for the Raiders movies.” It may be another $300m Disney behemoth, but it still contains themes close to his heart: “It’s so general that maybe it’s uninteresting, but the relationship between the future and the past. Meaning both generationally and also what you keep in terms of traditions and what you jettison in order to move forward.” Johnson has a nice-guy reputation and, more importantly, one as a director who likes to foster collaboration and a close-knit crew. Perhaps that temperament makes him better equipped to navigate the environment of the modern blockbuster. It’s not merely the stratospheric box-office expectations, but also the need – under the cinematic-universe model blueprinted by Marvel – for each film to fit the aesthetic and actors into a larger whole. Marvel has maintained a wary balancing act: appearing forward-thinking with some auteurish directorial choices (Kenneth Branagh on Thor; Joss Whedon on The Avengers; Taika Waititi on Thor: Ragnarok) but keeping them on a tight leash. DC’s turgid Extended Universe, overseen by Zack Snyder, sorely lacks this careful upholstering. The new-look Star Wars’ teething troubles, especially on the spinoffs, also attest to the difficulties of reconciling brand consistency with directorial inclinations. “Listener” personality types such as Johnson stand the greatest chance of success under these regimes. Typically diplomatic, Johnson refuses to generalise about his peers’ blockbuster experiences. “Ultimately, I know enough to know that I don’t know anything,” he says. “And I don’t know if it would be useful if I did. All you can do is engage with the process that you’re in and do your best with that.” But it remains to be seen if yoking his fortunes to Star Wars will give greater freedom to someone who made his reputation with spry originals such as Brick and Looper – or reduce him to a corporate functionary. Ditto Waititi, currently picking up praise for loosening up Thor in Marvel’s latest. Perhaps Disney has simply relaxed as the franchises have taken root. But comments made by Edgar Wright after Ant-Man hint at a new balance of power between studios and directors. “I wanted to make a Marvel movie, but I don’t think they wanted to make an Edgar Wright movie,” he told Variety. The conflict reportedly started when the studio tried to commission an extra draft without his involvement. “Suddenly becoming a director for hire on it, you’re sort of less emotionally invested, and you start to wonder why you’re there.” The sheer dominance of franchise-making in the studios’ 21st-century business – and the constraints directors must accept to work within that – is casting a shadow over directing. When Hollywood was at its most industrialised – during, for instance, the golden age of the 1930s and 40s – directors still had the opportunity to develop their craft and even, heaven forbid, a sensibility; not least because they were contracted to make several films a year. But the studios no longer seem to exist to support prolonged directorial careers, the exceptions being Clint Eastwood and Christopher Nolan, with their “sweetheart” deals at Warner Brothers. Newer mavericks who lack the stomach for blockbuster compromise, such as Wes Anderson, Darren Aronofsky and Steven Soderbergh, seem to bounce between the “arty” speciality arms of different studios in order to get their films made. Prestige TV has become a haven for objectors, but visually it is less of a directors’ medium (unless you’re David Lynch). The decline of the star system, with franchises and CGI increasingly the selling point for tentpole films, has been well documented. So, with recognisable faces and human drama increasingly shackled to franchise requirements, there’s a reduced need for unique directorial sensibilities to shepherd them. There’s a parallel shrinkage in the directorial system. That lack of scope is what prompted Soderbergh – criticising how studios treat directors – to try to bypass them entirely by creating his own distribution structure for Logan Lucky. Unfortunately, it flopped. Chappie director Neill Blomkamp is also trying to circumvent traditional financing and claim back creative control with his experimental Oats Studios. For all the criticism aimed at them, the studios are still the most reliable source of finance. So they dictate the terms on which directors make films, which means that ultimately it’s us doing the dictating. A key revelation for Soderbergh in recent years was that “the people who pay to make the movies and the audiences who see them are actually very much in sync”. He says: “I remember during previews of Contagion how upset the audience was by the Jude Law character. The fact that he created a sort of mixed reaction was viewed as a flaw in the film-making. Not, ‘Oh, that’s interesting, I’m not sure if this guy is an asshole or a hero.’ People were really annoyed by that. And I thought, ‘Wow, so ambiguity is not on the table any more.’” Now it’s for the likes of Johnson to try to take multiplex audiences into those grey areas once more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/08/geoffrey-boycott-commentary-tv-radio-ashes-england-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T13:00:03Z","webTitle":"Geoffrey Boycott may be vivid and trenchant but he is becoming unbearable | Matthew Engel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/08/geoffrey-boycott-commentary-tv-radio-ashes-england-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/08/geoffrey-boycott-commentary-tv-radio-ashes-england-australia","fields":{"headline":"Geoffrey Boycott may be vivid and trenchant but he is becoming unbearable","bodyText":"On a mid-summer afternoon more than 30 years ago, back in the long-lost era when Yorkshire played a lot more of their cricket away from the dismal confines of Headingley, I was having a happy sunlit wander round the charming old ground at Harrogate. One man on a bench on the boundary was going on and on to his mate about the usual subject. I paused for a moment to see which way this rather one-way conversation was going to turn when a bloke in the row behind intervened, loudly. “Oh, give it a rest for Christ’s sake!” he shouted. “We’ve all heard enough.” Had we ever. I can’t remember whether, at that precise moment, Geoffrey Boycott had been sacked, banned, dropped, had walked away, invaded Poland or what. But there was something; there was always something. Here he was, on the face of it, a dour, technically correct, boring but utterly reliable batsman, a man who any cricket team would welcome: “The unconsidered trellis,” as that great wordsmith Frank Keating once said of Ken Barrington, “around which the public’s favourite fancy-dans and flash Harrys entwined their colourful summer blooms.” But Boycott was the most obtrusive trellis ever constructed. More talked about than Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff and Ben Stokes put together. And he still is. Because he hasn’t stopped talking himself. During the Adelaide Test, Clare Connor, the director of England women’s cricket, sent out an early-morning tweet: “God, the arrogant, all-knowing opinions of Boycott are bordering on unbearable this morning.” Very restrained, some might say, given that she still had space for a dozen or so more adjectives before hitting the Twitter ceiling. But it was Tuesday, England’s good day, and we were all feeling a bit mellow. It was, however, hastily deleted; Connor, unlike Boycott, is not being paid to say what she wants. It is also more than 30 years since I last saw him bat: he was in Jamaica, just after his retirement, doing newspaper punditry on a Caribbean tour full of strife even without him playing. And he was in his Yorkshire cap blocking his way towards his fifty in what was meant to be a jokey press match. His opening partner then accidentally-on-purpose ran him out to the absolute corpsing delight of every single person present. Bar one. The very next day Boycott flew to the next leg of the tour, in Trinidad, ahead of the main party. And we were both arrested at the airport, confined under room-arrest in comfy barracks at the Holiday Inn for 24 hours and told we would be deported – ostensibly for not having a work permit; in reality as surrogates for the England party who elements in Trinidadian politics did not want in their country for reasons tangentially connected to South African apartheid. Well, it was all sorted out. He was good-humoured throughout and we have had a bond ever since: he always greets me as Tweedledum and I am supposed to reply in kind. So, unlike almost everyone else, I have a nuanced view of Boycott. But, honestly, Connor was spot-on. He really is becoming unbearable. We should, however, pause for a moment to celebrate the singular nature of his gift for commentary. Credit goes to the journalist Tim de Lisle for first noticing how, after they retired, Boycott and Botham swapped roles: the strong-armed slogger turned into a boring blocker; the old blocker started smashing every ball out of the park. As a commentator Boycott is vivid, trenchant and full of character. He has grasped the importance of having his own shtick, in his case a shtick of rhubarb, usually wielded by his granny. But it is not necessarily good character. Though a great talker, he is a shocking listener. We all get more negative as we get older, and when it comes to cricket the tendency is particularly acute, partly because there are damn good reasons for it. And we probably all get more self-referential too (I’ve chucked three reminiscences into this column already). Boycott’s commentary, however, comes back over and over to his own performances in the sunny long-ago, which is not the subject under discussion. You could turn it into a form of bingo, like counting the number of “clears” and “clearlys” emanating from the very unclear Boycott-lover Theresa May. Test Match Special boxes are usually very cramped and you can hear the air being sucked out of them when he’s on, especially when he’s partnered with one of the newer bods. Let me be very clear, as the PM rarely is. Boycott was a remarkable batsman who made an amazing career out of relatively limited natural gifts. But he had great difficulty understanding how his personal performance tied in with the aims of the collective, was a permanent pain in the arse in dressing rooms, and a dreadful captain. There are many anecdotes to support all this; I still chuckle about “Abbeydale back”, the mysterious injury that seemed to beset him before games on the pacy pitch at Abbeydale Park in Sheffield, especially if the opposition had a menacing West Indian in the attack. He was a very flawed kind of genius. Yet in this particular Ashes, when he is on both TV and radio, he has an unhealthy control of the entire narrative of the series as far as the UK audience is concerned. There is one possible advantage of this to the minuscule minority of the population able to watch BT Sport through these cold night and grey mornings. He can’t be on both TV or radio at once (or can he?). So once you hear him on one, it should be possible to switch to the other.

Perched on a stool in her spartan basement kitchen and sipping tea, she scrutinised the images I laid before her. A picture of Hepburn and Peter O’Toole on the set of The Lion In Winter (1968) elicited a comment on the third person in the picture. “Dear Tony. Looking so young and thoughtful,” she said, her eyes lighting up. She was referring to Anthony Harvey, the director of the film, who has died aged 87. “A real English gentleman and a brilliant director, one of the best I’ve ever worked with.” That was high praise indeed from a movie star who had worked with such greats as Howard Hawks, John Huston, John Ford, George Cukor and Frank Capra. Actually, by the time the picture was taken, Harvey was already 38 and directing his second movie, the first of four with Hepburn. He had been recommended to the producer Joseph E Levine by O’Toole, who had seen Harvey’s first movie, the low-budget, 55-minute Dutchman (1966), basically a two-hander set in a New York subway train, and a far cry from The Lion in Winter, a full-length, widescreen epic set in medieval France and featuring two of the cinema’s biggest stars. Based on James Goldman’s Broadway play about the bitter battle between Henry II of England and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine over which of their three sons should be the king’s successor, it was atmospherically filmed, mostly in Ireland, capturing fine performances from the two leads as well as from Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton making their feature film debuts. Early in the shoot, panic-stricken by the task, Harvey was forced to consider how a novice director such as himself could tell Hepburn, a living legend, point blank that her acting was over the top. He risked it and, to his relief, Hepburn laughed and agreed to tone down the dramatics to a certain extent. This resulted in Hepburn justifiably winning the third of her four academy awards, though it was shared by Barbra Streisand for Funny Girl. Harvey was not new to show business. After the death of his father, his mother, Dorothy Leon, married Morris Harvey, the stage and screen character actor, who gave Anthony his surname, and introduced him to some of the leading lights of British theatre. It was his stepfather’s acquaintance with Vivien Leigh that got the 14-year-old Anthony the role of Ptolemy, the troublesome younger brother of Cleopatra (Leigh) in Gabriel Pascal’s film version of George Bernard Shaw’s Caesar and Cleopatra (1945). This gave Harvey a taste for acting, and he won a scholarship to Rada. But, as he recalled, “I soon realised, when I got behind the footlights, I just knew I didn’t have the command.” Instead, he got a job as assistant editor on Boulting brothers’ films from 1953, being made chief editor on Private’s Progress (1956). Harvey went on to become a respected editor, working on The Spy Who Came In From The Cold (1965, directed by Martin Ritt), The L-Shaped Room (Bryan Forbes, 1962) and Lolita (1962) and Dr Strangelove (1964), both directed by Stanley Kubrick. It was Kubrick who advised Harvey to move from the cutting room to the studio floor. The advice paid off when Harvey was nominated for an Oscar as best director for The Lion in Winter. “It was a thrilling start,” he said, “but when you have success so early, everything after that is under great scrutiny. You wonder what the hell to do next.” What he did was direct They Might Be Giants (1971), a whimsical drama based on another Goldman play, and starring George C Scott as a judge who is undergoing medical treatment as he believes he is Sherlock Holmes, and Joanne Woodward as his psychiatrist, Dr Watson. It flopped, because Universal Pictures “mutilated” the last 30 minutes, according to Harvey. It made him regret that he had turned down Cabaret and Love Story. “I let them go out of total indecision,” he claimed. “It was a terrible mistake.” As consolation, he returned to Hepburn, now a firm friend, to play the former southern belle Amanda Wingfield in Tennessee Williams’s The Glass Menagerie (1973), a first venture for both actor and director into made-for-TV films. The eclectic Harvey showed his skill at directing actors. “I abhor showy directors who use camera gimmicks in their films. I try to keep the camera fairly stationary in order to not interfere with the performances.” These included Liv Ullmann as Queen Christina of Sweden in The Abdication (1974) and in Richard’s Things (1980); Faye Dunaway as the evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson in the made-for-TV biopic The Disappearance of Aimee (1976); and Hepburn in Grace Quigley (1984), the black comedy on euthanasia. After directing Hepburn and Anthony Quinn in the made-for-TV love story This Can’t Be Love (1994), Harvey retired. At his home in Southampton, New York, between gardening and walking his dog, he kept busy writing his memoirs (as yet unpublished) about the horrors of the Hollywood package and agonies of the film industry in general, under the title Incident Prone. He also regularly visited Hepburn at her home in Connecticut. She once told him that she so disliked show business that he was the only person from the industry with whom she was still in touch. • Anthony Harvey, film director and film editor, born 3 June 1930; died 23 November 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/17/anita-pallenberg-remembered-by-marianne-faithfull-obituary-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"Anita Pallenberg remembered by Marianne Faithfull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/17/anita-pallenberg-remembered-by-marianne-faithfull-obituary-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/17/anita-pallenberg-remembered-by-marianne-faithfull-obituary-2017","fields":{"headline":"Anita Pallenberg remembered by Marianne Faithfull","bodyText":"Talking about Anita is something I have to do. I don’t want who she really was to be forgotten. People think of her in one way – a 60s muse, all that shit – but she was so much more than that. A really talented artist, a great actor, intelligent, funny, thoughtful, fearless… she truly didn’t give a fuck what anybody thought of her. I was desolate when she died. Until she got very ill, we spoke on the phone most days. I don’t want to sound sentimental or sappy, she’s worth more than that. She was so important to me. I don’t think we’d ever have become friends if it wasn’t for Mick [Jagger] and Keith [Richards, who became Pallenberg’s boyfriend after she dated another Rolling Stone, Brian Jones]. We weren’t naturally meant for each other, really, but because the boys were so close at the time, and spent so much time in the studio, it threw me and Anita together. We also took a lot of drugs. We had very different personalities. Anita was really sophisticated and elegant, all that, and she was very good for me on that level, as I was a bit hopeless. She would put me together, tell me what to wear, get me to look right. I’d give her books, and she’d like that. She was four years older than me – I was much more vulnerable than her. When I say she never cared what anyone said, thought or wrote about her, it wasn’t that she talked about it – it was almost if all that stuff didn’t exist. I was always so jealous of her being able to do that. Anita was really well educated. She spoke five languages, and was a really good artist in her own right. She could have done a lot of other things – to be Keith’s moll was not necessarily her destiny at all. Keith is a very old-fashioned macho guy, who when he’s in love with a woman, wants her to be completely focused on him. I’m not putting that down – it’s just how it is. Anita rebelled a bit, of course. She did Barbarella when he told her not to. She did Performance when he told her not to [laughs] – for obvious reasons! But I have to say that taking drugs does not help your work. Don’t get me wrong, we had some wonderful times – like I remember being with Anita, Mick and Keith, [rock photographer] Michael Cooper, [art dealer] Robert Fraser, going down to Stonehenge and taking lots of acid. That was wonderful. But drugs blocked her, as they did me. Anita started doing all the things she could have done after stopping the drugs. This was many years later. She did a fashion degree [at Central Saint Martins, London, in the early 1990s]. She started to paint again and did some wonderful watercolours – I’ve got a lot here. She did botanical drawing classes, and she was a wonderful gardener. She liked nothing better than doing the gardens for her kids. And her children [with Keith Richards] are wonderful people – her son, Marlon, his wife, Lucy, and Angela. They were incredibly kind to me after she died, phoning me up, really making sure I felt like part of the family. Children of famous people aren’t always like that, I tell you. They had very difficult times. We all did – Anita could be a difficult woman, and I don’t want to idealise her. But once she got clean, things were so much better. Her getting ill was terrible bad luck. She got diabetes first of all, and when she was diagnosed, her nose was in the air about it. “I’m going to cure myself with diet!” she said. If only I’d said, “Are you out of your fucking mind, you nitwit!” If you don’t treat diabetes with insulin, it goes to your whole nervous system. She’d get things her body should have been able to ward off. Then she had to give in, of course, and she found it hard to inject. To be clean and have to take a drug was tough for her. I do wonder how her life would have been different, of course, but come on, she had a wonderful life. I miss calling her up about a lyric, and her always saying something brilliant. I miss her more than I can tell you. Every morning, when I wake up, I read a poem that makes me think about her, Sara Teasdale’s There Will Be Stars. It speaks to me so much about her [reads]: “There will be stars over the place forever, though the house we loved and the street we loved are lost… there will be stars forever, while we sleep.” That’s Anita to me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/08/fire-raging-ventura-county-climate-change-victims","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T13:25:32Z","webTitle":"Ventura county is burning.

My hometown is climate change's latest victim","bodyText":"An unbearable amount of Ventura county in southern California, where I was born and raised, is simply gone. And as I hear about site after site from my childhood simply disappearing into scorched earth, I am realizing that climate change is not only erasing the present, it is also destroying the physical touchstones to my own past. Victim to hot temperatures and high winds, some 90,000 acres have burned, hundreds of structures have been destroyed, and tens of thousands of people have been evacuated or lost power in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. But it is coastal Ventura, where I was born, that has driven home so personally what climate change looks like. I was, of course, relieved that my relatives were all accounted for, and that my brother, sister-in-law and nephew evacuated safely on Monday night. (Their house survived, though the fire came just a couple of blocks from it.) My sister, north of Santa Barbara, has been taking in friends and family who have evacuated. But it is heartbreaking to see the photos of the aftermath and to take stock of all that has been lost – both the things that can be be replaced, and the things that can’t. Hundreds of schools in Oxnard, Ventura, and Los Angeles have been closed all week. This massive loss of education time – not to mention the economic precariousness for families deprived of childcare – is yet another impact of climate change. When I was trying (in vain) to fall asleep on Wednesday night, I read journalist John Sepulvado’s tweets from Ojai, in which he said he was “able to separate my emotions from the story until I hear a coyote wail in pain or see cats scurry. Meanwhile, sirens ring and ash falls.” I found myself thinking about the fire jumping rural Highway 33, where I learned to drive, and thought about the bird-filled cages of an old sanctuary I visited just off that road in my youth. And about those howling coyotes. And of all the horses stabled out that way. I wondered if these animals were escaping, or if they were being cooked alive. They, too, are the victims of climate change. I am hearing from friends and family that the air is simply too bad to do much of anything physical outdoors. And yet, I saw that photo of farmworkers out in the fields, still doing the work while breathing air which will make them sick. Strawberry fields are toxic worksites filled with deadly chemicals even when they are not on fire. I am terribly worried about the economic suffering these fires are causing. An entire apartment complex destroyed in Ventura contained some of the only affordable housing in the city: will what replaces it also be made affordable and available to the displaced, or will disaster capitalism replace it with multimillion-dollar condos? I think people look at Ventura County – and, noting it sits on the Pacific Ocean between Malibu to the south and Santa Barbara County to the north – think it is a rich place. It is not. There are a lot of poor people in Ventura County, many of whom work at one of its two military bases, in agriculture, or in service jobs. But while the wages for many of these jobs are low, housing is very expensive. Some of the apartments and homes lost were rental units occupied by poor people who likely didn’t have insurance and will have lost everything, and will have no other affordable housing options in the county. They, too, are victims of climate change. And while Ventura County residents are coming together to help each other, the increasingly cruel federal government is neither providing an adequate response to climate change nor an adequate social safety net even in the best of times. In 2012, I got to see what climate change looked like wet, when the city of my adult life, New York, was deluged by Hurricane Sandy. But at least I got to help a bit with recovery efforts. Five years later, I am watching powerlessly from afar a very different manifestation of climate change – one that is made worse by a terrible lack of water in my hometown. They’re two side of our climate crisis, and neither is pretty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/08/its-been-a-long-time-coming-but-fifa-intervention-means-ffa-change-is-on-the-way","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T23:57:08Z","webTitle":"It’s been a long time coming, but Fifa intervention means FFA change is on the way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/08/its-been-a-long-time-coming-but-fifa-intervention-means-ffa-change-is-on-the-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/08/its-been-a-long-time-coming-but-fifa-intervention-means-ffa-change-is-on-the-way","fields":{"headline":"It’s been a long time coming, but Fifa intervention means FFA change is on the way","bodyText":"It feels somewhat perverse to praise Fifa’s acumen during a week in which its handling of Russia has re-alerted the football community to its ethical compromises, but the world governing body’s intervention into Australian affairs appears astute. The decision to lead a working group to address Australian football’s inability to expand its governing congress should, thankfully, herald the final act in the long-running saga. Moreover, by opting for a body consensual in nature but under Fifa/AFC direction, resolution should occur with the minimum of collateral damage. This is not a normalisation committee, the most decisive option at Fifa’s disposal, nor is it more futile mediation. This is a strategic intervention that brings the end within sight while minimising the risk of a World Cup suspension and maximising the likelihood the head of Australia’s delegation in Russia will have been elected, not imposed. What Fifa has managed to achieve is the prioritisation of the ends – the adoption of a more inclusive and representative membership model – by an appropriation of the means, the congress review working group. For much of this process the case for democratisation has been held hostage by acrimony. The debate should always have been about the betterment of Australian football and the ideal governance arrangement for the game’s prosperity. This has not been the case and the longer the imbroglio has continued the more it has descended into an unseemly squabble over voting thresholds anchored by an unsatisfying status quo. Fifa’s overdue entry to the scene has the potential to reframe this process for the better. It can now orchestrate a wide-ranging conversation, one that could unlock the untapped ambition and optimism of large sections of a football community fatigued or marginalised by business as usual. This is in contrast to the prolonged behind-closed-doors courting of a minority of stakeholders. It is a welcome opportunity to reboot. Fifa’s action places FFA in a curious situation. By avoiding a normalisation committee it could be argued the decision is a win for Steven Lowy and his agenda. But there is not much else on offer to provide succour. Fifa’s communique makes clear it will “define the terms of reference of the congress review working group, which include its objective, composition, mandate and timeline,” in other words benching FFA from its existing role in stewarding the democratisation process. Moreover, Fifa will do so having met with “the stakeholders (member federations, A-League clubs, PFA) and any other relevant interlocutors, such as the Association of Australian Football Clubs (AAFC), that have been established in the meantime”. This is consistent with all Fifa communication on this matter, avoiding direct reference to FFA and its leadership as a stakeholder. The letter, signed by Zvonimir Boban, the former Croatian international, now Fifa deputy secretary general, is businesslike in tone but an undercurrent of irritation is detectable. Recent failings in the democratisation process are detailed in the second paragraph before the third opens with the following carefully chosen words: “In light of the above the committee eventually decided...”. That eventually is pregnant with meaning. Fifa is also keen to point out the need for “a timely conclusion”, which is understandable given it has already allowed FFA a nine-month extension on its original deadline to reach this point. FFA’s public response drew plenty of ire. The opening line of its press release indicates it will establish the working group with “direct support” from Fifa, in contrast to the terms outlined in Fifa’s letter. When the A-League clubs issued their response later in the day they made sure to point out the “misleading nature” of FFA’s communication. Consequently, much of the immediate analysis of the situation on Thursday focused on FFA’s spin. This situation became even murkier on Friday morning when Fifa’s public statement on the issue was circulated by FFA. For whatever reasons this contains different phrasing to the letter signed by Boban, and now indicates “FFA together with Fifa and AFC will define the terms of reference,” suggesting FFA has not been sidelined entirely from the process. The big winners are the AAFC, the lobby group formed to represent the interests of participants in the National Premier League and the body negotiating with FFA to map out a professional second tier. They are referenced twice by Fifa as a “relevant interlocutor”. In other words, deserving of a seat at the table. It must now seem likely that a congress vote is in the pipeline for a group formed only nine months ago and given scant regard by many of the individuals they will soon be engaging with as equals. Fifa’s approach to this congress review process and acknowledgement of AAFC indicates a welcome desire to broaden the church as wide as possible. It has long been mooted that representatives of futsal, coaches, referees, fans and more besides should have a say in the running of the game. Their time could be arriving much sooner than expected. As always, the devil is in the detail, and there is much to be worked out before and after the Fifa/AFC mission arrives in early 2018. Until then, FFA’s administration can proceed as usual, which means the search for a new Socceroos head coach and planning for the World Cup finals can continue unhindered. It’s been a long time coming but after months of undignified infighting, a change looks like it’s finally going to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/10/dont-let-alt-right-coopt-metoo-agenda","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T09:00:32Z","webTitle":"Don't let the alt-right hijack #MeToo for their agenda | Rebecca Solnit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/10/dont-let-alt-right-coopt-metoo-agenda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/10/dont-let-alt-right-coopt-metoo-agenda","fields":{"headline":"Don't let the alt-right hijack #MeToo for their agenda","bodyText":"That was fast. In this #MeToo moment, feminism has been coopted by both people who don’t understand it and by people who oppose it. Worse: it’s now being used against people who are feminists and allies. The most recent example comes from Mike Cernovich, the alt-right conspiracy theorist who led the way on the Pizzagate hoax that claimed senior Democrats were involved in a child abuse ring in the basement of a Washington DC restaurant. That whole ruckus should’ve given MSNBC pause when he went after one of their regulars. Cernovich recently orchestrated a campaign to pressure MSNBC to fire contributor Sam Seder over a joke he made in a 2009 tweet. The network did fire him – only to then rehire him after a backlash against their decision. If you have ever been exposed to jokes before, you’d know the tweet was sarcastic. It mocked people whose defense of Roman Polanski from child rape accusations rested on the fact that he was a ‘great artist’. It was an anti-rapist rape joke, like the kind that Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, Amy Schumer and even Jay Leno later told about Bill Cosby. We’re now at the point where people are being canned for jokes, by people who don’t get the jokes, don’t get feminism, don’t get that maybe there should be some proportion in this thing, and don’t get that right-wing men with a public record of misogyny might not be your best guides through all this. Even if Seder’s joke was bad and made in the wrong spirit (which, just to be clear, it wasn’t), if we’re going to fire everyone who has made a non-feminist remark we’re pretty much going to clear all the offices everywhere of almost every man and quite a few women. That’s why people who’ve been thinking about gender politics and women’s rights should be in charge of this moment. We need to be led through this by people who’ve experienced harassment and denigration and discrediting. People who’ve spent years listening to others and who have been thinking about the dynamics, ethics and consequences of these things before. This should be a moment when powerful men and the women who’ve protected them say: ‘hey, when we were in charge it didn’t go that well, maybe we should learn to doubt ourselves, and our judgment, maybe we shouldn’t make snap decisions based on our brand-new interest in women as human beings possessed of inalienable rights.’ But instead they’re just finding new grounds to be in charge and to adjudicate all this. Consider the experience of writer Ijeoma Oluo, who last week said that USA Today asked her to write a piece arguing a feminist position against due process. She says an editor there told her, “[...] They want a piece that says that you don’t believe in due process and that if a few innocent men lose their jobs it’s worth it to protect women. Is that something you can do?” They were asking her to say feminists are happy to harm individual men for the good of the cause, and not interested in distinguishing innocence from guilt. She refused. That’s not who she is and not who feminists are. The slogan “believe women” arose because women have often been assumed from the outset to be crazy, mendacious, manipulative and anything but honest when they charge men of sexual crimes. That’s why their claims are often dismissed out of hand rather than investigated. The slogan doesn’t mean don’t investigate the claims. An accusation pits two claimants against each other, an accuser and, usually, a person who claims they’re not guilty of what they’re accused of. Both deserve due process. Project Veritas, the right-wing organization that went after Planned Parenthood in a sting operation over abortion a few years ago, bet that the Washington Post was also uninterested in distinguishing truth from falsehood, innocence from guilt. They sent an undercover operator to pretend she had been sexually involved with Roy Moore as a minor. The Post demonstrated beautifully what due process looks like in journalism. They interviewed the claimant and understood that she was trying to set them up and exposed her—a counter-sting they reported on in a November 27 article. It was apparent that, like Cernovich’s attack on Seder, Project Veritas’s attack on the Post was meant to discredit the #MeToo movement. Feminism is now being weaponized for right-wing agendas. At which point it’s not feminism: it’s misogyny using feminism as a cover. I was disconcerted that, when Leeanne Tweeden put out a story about her encounters with Al Franken, the alt-right site Infowars and right-wing Trump ally and Infowars associate Roger Stone apparently had advance knowledge of her story. “Infowars Called It! Correctly Predicts Al Franken Sex Scandal!” said a headline on November 16. Tweeden is a Fox employee and a friend of Hannity’s. I would have liked to know more about the situation, especially why right-wing operatives had advance knowledge of it. A friend who was once a congressional aide remarked to me that when it comes to men in the legislative branch, they’re nearly all guilty of some form of sexual harassment, inappropriate behavior, insensitive remarks, and so forth. I suspect a high percentage of powerful heterosexual men in general are guilty of at least Franken’s degree of denigration of individual women, and if such things are grounds for dismissal, fairness would demand we dismiss them all. But we are not going to find out about all of them. We are going to find out about some of them not because they are the most egregious, but because of other factors—because someone has good documentation to share, because a former victim is not afraid, or because something matters more than that fear, or because it fits a larger political agenda. We have heard from a great many women and some men in this Weinstein season. There is no reason to believe that we’ve heard from more than a small minority with stories of abuse to tell. John Conyers is accused by multiple women, some of whom were his employees, of sexual harassment. He rightly resigned. Still, I’m curious why Conyers’s accusations surfaced when they did and if they’re supposed to somehow neutralize Moore’s. There’s a man in elected office who’s been publicly accused more than a year ago of harassment, verbal denigration, groping, and sexual assault, including a credible case of attempted rape. I’d like to see any purge start with the predator in the White House. In this moment, we need to ask better questions. Whose agenda is being served in each case? Who decides? How do we weigh degrees of gravity? This is not about men who violated the norms but about the fact that misogyny has long been the norm. Misogynists have been protected and promoted for not decades but centuries. What are we to do about that? Moving forward, we need to figure out who decides not just these individual cases but how we move past this era of impunity—and who “we” is going to be, because justice for women sure doesn’t include Project Veritas and Mike Cernovich."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/08/jeremy-hunt-facebook-messenger-kids-smartphone-addicts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T06:00:34Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt is right.

Please, Facebook, leave our kids alone","bodyText":"Remember candy cigarettes? They were a sweetshop staple when I was growing up: thin white sticks of chalky candy, stacked in a carton to look just like grownup cigarettes. Naturally we all pretended to smoke them, before eventually losing interest and eating them. For the full effect, the village shop also sold cans of Top Deck lager-and-lime-flavoured fizzy pop. Pretend kiddie booze, to go with pretend kiddie fags. Like many things that seemed perfectly normal in the 1970s, with hindsight all this seems mildly demented. What on earth did the manufacturers think they were doing? Children will always want to play at being grownups, but the point is surely to encourage them to copy us at our best, not our worst. And that, in a nutshell, is the problem with Facebook’s new overture to the under-10s. Messenger Kids has launched in the US as a “safe” starter form of social media, catering for those too young for the real thing (which in theory, if not practice, is over-13s). The new app lets children as young as six exchange messages via tablet and smartphone, but only with people pre-approved by their parents. Strangers can’t approach them directly, and so Facebook is touting it as a wholesome alternative to rival apps reputedly used by groomers. To anyone over six, however, it should be obvious it’s nothing of the kind. Even assuming this doesn’t backfire as badly as the YouTube Kids app, recently found to be carrying some disturbingly adult material, the wholesome equivalent of social media for six-year-olds is board games and going to the park. Primary school children need new reasons to beg for screen time about as much as their 70s counterparts needed early opportunities to practise smoking or get used to the taste of alcohol. The jury may still be out on how technology affects developing brains, but as with TV a generation ago, the obvious concern is over what six-year-olds are not doing – running around getting muddy, annoying their siblings – when they’re hunched over a screen. So for once, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, spoke for the nation when he responded by asking Facebook to “stay away from my kids please”. This was, he wrote, hardly what he expected when the company said it was examining ways of preventing underage use of social media. That Hunt made his point on Twitter underlines an irony of which most adults will be uneasily aware. We know we’re addicted to our phones. Parents who have spent years plastering the kids’ photos all over Instagram, furtively checking for likes and shares when we were supposed to be watching them on the climbing frame, will understand it’s hypocritical to deny our kids the same gratifying dopamine hit. But without shameless hypocrisy, parenting would be impossible for mere mortals. We constantly pull rank on grounds of age, embrace double standards with gusto, because how else do we protect our kids from temptations they’re not yet mature enough to handle? Parents who can’t stop smoking themselves will still quite rightly warn their own children not to start. Mothers hitting the pinot grigio before bedtime don’t just shrug and pour the toddler a glass. And interestingly, many Silicon Valley parents publicly pride themselves on rationing their own kids’ screen time. “Do as I say, not as I do” is an inelegant philosophy but it’s often the best hope of not passing on habits we regret – which increasingly include the hours frittered away on pointless arguments with strangers and envy-inducing pictures of other people’s lives, all at the cost of not properly paying attention to people we actually love. Social media does undeniably bring joy, solace and good times. But so does booze, which is why we make kids wait until they’re old enough to understand the downsides. And the evidence is that older children do understand. Two-thirds of teenagers told a recent survey for Digital Awareness UK that they wouldn’t care if social media had never been invented, suggesting an unexpectedly love-hate relationship with their drug of choice. Worrying as it is that over half of teenagers consider themselves addicted to their phones, they have more insight into their screen habits than adults give them credit for. Significantly, they also show an increasing preference for engaging with friends more privately, on apps including Snapchat, rather than on big public platforms such as Facebook – increasingly seen as for “old people”, ie anyone over 30. And that, perhaps, is a clue to what Facebook is really doing with Messenger Kids: neutralising what it sees as an emerging threat to the business. Its kiddie app has intriguing parallels with what the music industry did when its traditional revenue streams started shrinking, namely manufacture a squeaky-clean version of its product to draw in much younger children. If so, then like bubblegum pop and boybands, it may well be far more popular with tweenies than parents. Anyone old enough to remember a time before smartphones knows how they have both enriched our lives and opened sinkholes underneath them, which greedily suck in much more time and attention than we ever intended. Too late, many of us have begun to question our dependence on them. We shouldn’t be shy of making our kids learn from our mistakes. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/08/clear-failures-of-care-scathing-report-into-students-anorexia-death","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T00:01:27Z","webTitle":"'Clear failures of care': scathing report into student's anorexia death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/08/clear-failures-of-care-scathing-report-into-students-anorexia-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/08/clear-failures-of-care-scathing-report-into-students-anorexia-death","fields":{"headline":"'Clear failures of care': scathing report into student's anorexia death","bodyText":"A talented young student died of anorexia because of numerous “clear failures of care” by GPs, hospitals and specialists in eating disorders, a scathing report by the NHS ombudsman has concluded. Averil Hart’s death in December 2012 at the age of 19 “was an avoidable tragedy” caused by an array of health professionals failing to appreciate how dangerously unwell she was, the ombudsman said in a report released on Friday. While her family and even her cleaner could see that she was losing weight after she moved to Norwich to study, her GP surgery and psychologist in charge of her care did not, her father, Nicholas, told the Guardian. In one of the most trenchant criticisms of NHS care in years, Rob Behrens, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman, warned that the errors which culminated in Hart’s death illustrated “widespread problems with eating disorders services in the NHS”. Other people with potentially fatal conditions involving food have also died because of poor care, he said. “Our investigation found that Averil’s tragic death would have been avoided if the NHS had cared for her appropriately. Several NHS organisations missed opportunities to prevent the deterioration which led to her final admission to the hospital where she died,” the ombudsman’s wide-ranging report said. Hart was first diagnosed with anorexia at 17 when she was doing her A-levels. She spent almost a year as an inpatient at a specialist eating disorders unit in Cambridge in 2011-12 but was discharged in August 2012 so she could start studying English and creative writing at the University of East Anglia (UEA) a month later. The medical documentation that accompanied her discharge was clear that she was “vulnerable to subsequent relapse”. Doctors stressed that she needed ongoing monitoring and support to help her negotiate three potentially stressful events: leaving home, starting at university and coming under the care of a different NHS eating disorders service. However, “there were multiple opportunities between August and December 2012 to identify what was happening to Averil, to intervene to remedy the situation at that time, and therefore to prevent the subsequent course of events that led to the final emergency admission to hospital which culminated in her death”. The ombudsman’s investigation was undertaken by Dr Bill Kirkup, who oversaw an inquiry into the deaths of babies at a hospital in Morecambe Bay and was also a member of the independent panel into the Hillsborough disaster. Hart was badly failed by every NHS service that was meant to be caring for her from August 2012, Kirkup found. The care plan drawn up on her discharge by the eating disorders service in Cambridge was inadequate because it did not highlight the urgency of invoking a contingency plan if she deteriorated. Her weight and mental health were not monitored properly before she moved to Norwich. Once there, the Norwich eating disorders service, which took over her care in September 2012, did not appoint a care coordinator to oversee her treatment for a month, which meant she did not receive adequate assessment or support during that time. She had lost 6kgs by the time she was finally weighed. Although she was meant to be seen weekly by the GP surgery at the UEA, that only happened three times and at the last appointment – on 8 November – “a locum GP told her she did not need to come back for a month”. When her father and older sister, Imogen, visited her on 28 November “they were shocked by how much weight she appeared to have lost”. They sought help for her as an emergency. But she was found collapsed in her room in university accommodation on 7 December. She had suffered severe brain damage caused by her extremely low blood glucose and died eight days later in hospital. “There were multiple serious departures from the standards of care expected that meant that the critical nature of Averil’s condition was not recognised and treatment was not implemented properly as it could and should have been,” the report added. The failings by the UEA GP practice, and the acute NHS trusts in Norwich and Cambridge which provided treatment, as well as the Norwich eating disorders service, were so serious that each was guilty of “service failure”, said Behrens. The ombudsman’s office investigated the case after previous inquiries by the NHS bodies involved in Hart’s care proved so inadequate they constituted “maladministration”, he added. Hart’s father said: “Averil’s death wasn’t a one-off. Other people with anorexia have died needlessly because the lessons from her death weren’t learned quickly enough. “Averil was a great creative writer and the perfect daughter: full of fun, really cheeky, and was often a bit mischievous but got amazing grades.” Andrew Radford, the chief executive of Beat, an eating disorders charity, said: “This tragedy demonstrates, once again, the devastation eating disorders can cause. The Hart family have not only had to grieve for their daughter but also had to face the fact that her death could and should have been prevented.” NHS England said that eating disorders services had been expanded and that eight out of 10 young people suffering from one was now treated within four weeks thanks to a £150m investment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/08/the-guardian-view-on-universities-and-the-market-winner-takes-all","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T00:01:27Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on universities and the market: winner takes all | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/the-guardian-view-on-universities-and-the-market-winner-takes-all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/the-guardian-view-on-universities-and-the-market-winner-takes-all","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on universities and the market: winner takes all","bodyText":"On average, graduates earn more than their peers who have not been to university. But it doesn’t require a maths degree to know that averages don’t tell the full story. The potential earnings of a law student at a top university are likely to far exceed those of a media studies graduate from an institution at the bottom of the league. And neither is likely to earn anything like the £800,000 paid this year in salary, plus “golden handshake” benefits, to Christina Slade on her departure as vice-chancellor of Bath Spa university. The case for such huge salaries is familiar enough. It is claimed that competitive remuneration is essential to recruit the best candidates. This is a natural consequence of the deliberate marketisation of higher education, of which tuition fees have become the misleading emblem. There is a lot wrong with the fee system, but although it is impossible to count those who are deterred, the number of school-leavers from poorer backgrounds going to university is rising. A new report by the National Audit Office shows that the proportion of disadvantaged school-leavers in higher education is now 26%, up from 21% in 2011 – far fewer than from richer households, but not conclusive proof that fees limit access. Fees were introduced in a piece of government accounting jiggery-pokery, so more students could go to university in a way that did not appear in the public accounts (it is currently costing £9bn a year, £3bn more than a decade ago). It is often forgotten that the days of free provision coincided with a cap on student places, decided by what the Treasury would pay. Higher education used to be a privilege for the few, not a service for the many. When the coalition came in, however, the purpose of fees became expressly to make a degree into a consumer product that would respond to market forces. Universities, in theory, would improve their courses in order to attract more students. But efficient markets depend on good information. The NAO report highlights the failure of universities to provide it. Students from poorer backgrounds tend to know least about the advantages of different universities. As a result, they are less likely to benefit from the graduate earnings dividend. Yet the debts they accrue are the same as those who leave top universities for top-paying jobs. Nor do students switch universities for a better course. Universities have a clear incentive to put on courses that are cheap to run, whether or not they are popular. There is a hidden profit motive that encourages them to recruit as many students as possible paying top whack for the least cost to the provider. Fees might not be deterring applicants but they are, in many cases, a rip-off. It is at least partly in recognition of these failings that the Higher Education and Research Act was introduced. But as the NAO soberly concludes, higher education is even more complex a market than other public services where marketisation has failed. It is not the NAO’s job to condemn, but every line in its latest report hints at a deep scepticism that marketising higher education can meet the government’s objective of widening access to university while driving up quality through the power of student choice. Instead, rather than helping those from the least well-off backgrounds to succeed, it risks generating a two-tier system that merely entrenches their disadvantage. And rich or poor alike, the debt will be the same."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/07/gvc-and-ladbrokes-coral-david-gambles-on-goliath","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T06:50:28Z","webTitle":"GVC and Ladbrokes Coral: David gambles on Goliath | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/07/gvc-and-ladbrokes-coral-david-gambles-on-goliath","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/07/gvc-and-ladbrokes-coral-david-gambles-on-goliath","fields":{"headline":"GVC and Ladbrokes Coral: David gambles on Goliath","bodyText":"Ladbrokes Coral’s bosses will try to sound cheerful about the prospect of being taken over by GVC Holdings, the company behind Sportingbet and Foxy Bingo. But, on the long view, this deal would be a corporate humiliation. Ladbrokes is one of the oldest names in British bookmaking and still collects the largest revenues. It traces its roots to 1886 and, under chairman Cyril Stein, boomed after the legalisation of betting shops in 1961. When Stein retired in 1993, the company, with a collection of Hilton hotels at a time, was worth £2bn. Now, a quarter of century later and with Coral on board, it is in discussions to surrender for just £3.1bn, plus a potential £800m kicker, to an Isle of Man-based company that was worth only £100m five years ago. David, after bulking up with a few deals, is bidding for Goliath. There’s no point blaming the current crop of Ladbrokes’ managers. It was their predecessors who were late to the starting gate in the digital Derby. Ladbrokes flapped around ineffectually trying to build in-house technology, lost ground online and has only recently picked up the pace. Other failures included loading up with so much debt in the pre-financial crash years that a £286m rights issue was required when recession arrived in 2009. Were Ladbrokes directors luxuriating in the easy money from their electronic roulette wheels, or were they just poor at executing online? Probably both. Last year’s merger with Coral gave Ladbrokes greater size, but only increased the appeal for the acquisitive GVC. Thursday’s outline deal is the fruit of the third set of talks. From Ladbrokes’ point of view, the best that can be said is that the proposed terms are better than those previously rumoured. The basic price is 161p versus 140p. As importantly, GVC last month agreed a deal to sell its business in Turkey, where online gambling is illegal. That allowed it to present itself to Ladbrokes as more of a regular company with operations in regulated markets. That points to another aspect of the shift in corporate power in the internet era: newcomers were happy to shoulder the risk of operating in so-called “grey” markets, but the old guard were understandably shy. In the end, the upstarts got the better of the gamble. European countries have generally dealt with the rise of online operators by taxing and regulating. After exiting Turkey, GVC’s regulated and “regulating” revenues will be 75% of its total. Buying Ladbrokes, which is virtually 100% regulated, would make the regulatory risks almost minimal. GVC is accepting a different type of risk by getting into physical betting shops for the first time but it has an odd but neat solution to the government’s review of the machines. Ladbrokes shareholders will get “contingent value rights” that will pay out between zero and 42.8p depending on how far machine stakes are reduced. Both sets of shareholders seem happy – Ladbrokes’ shares rose 29%, GVC’s 8% – so the deal looks to be on. To spare its corporate blushes, Ladbrokes could say that the offer is mostly in shares and its shareholders will end up in a company that will be one of the world’s largest gambling groups. Given past upsets, that’s not the worst outcome. Yet it could have been better. Stein, who died in 2011, built Ladbrokes by opening shops harder and faster than his rivals. Then the internet changed the game. Bitcoin bubble: back to the future Sir Howard Davis is right. As the bitcoin mania becomes truly silly, it would be helpful to hear central bankers and regulators shouting more loudly about risks to investors. If officials have been fearful of coming across as luddites, it’s time to wake up. Citizens also want to know that the back door of the financial system hasn’t been left open for fraudsters and money-launderers. And do regulators really approve of plans by two Chicago exchanges to make it easier to speculate on Bitcoin? It’s hard to believe they do. Regulators pushed to make financial markets more transparent after the banking crisis. The impending launch of Bitcoin futures would seem to run in the opposite direction. An old-fashioned price crash would cool the market faster than anything regulators can say, of course. But the timing of that event is impossible to predict. The bitcoin bubble has become a global phenomenon, and comparisons with past manias may be irrelevant. Keep it together A US hedge fund called Sachem Head has taken a 3.4% stake in Whitbread, provoking muttering that it may lobby to break up the Costa Coffee and Premier Inn group. Sachem hasn’t said a thing, note, but the Whitbread chief executive, Alison Brittain, should be prepared to apply common sense. Starbucks may trade on a fancy stock market rating, but that doesn’t mean an independent Costa would. There are only two moving parts at Whitbread: it shouldn’t be hard for investors to value the company in its current form."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/dec/07/arsenal-v-bate-borisov-europa-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T22:05:15Z","webTitle":"Arsenal 6-0 Bate Borisov: Europa League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/dec/07/arsenal-v-bate-borisov-europa-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/dec/07/arsenal-v-bate-borisov-europa-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal 6-0 Bate Borisov: Europa League – as it happened","bodyText":"Well that was fun. Arsenal went for the throat against a very poor Bate side and it reaped great rewards. Jack Wilshere was brilliant throughout, making space with clever spins and creating openings with probing passes. Wilshere scored his first goal for two and a half years and Debuchy also ended a lengthy drought with a stunning strike. Red Star beat Köln 1-0 in Belgrade to join the Gunners in the knockout stage. Thanks for joining. Bye. Arsenal march into the Europa League knockout phase in style. Bate Borisov bow out. 90+1 min On the TV John Hartson accuses Bate of a lack of ability after a slow break fizzles out meekly. as it on cue Gordeichuk works some space and fires a vicious shot on goal, which Ospina does well to beat out. 89 min It looks as if 80% of the seats at the Emirates are empty now. Arsenal fans are never happy are they? 87 min Signevich works some space and whips in a threatening shot but it drifts narrowly wide. The game is petering out now. 81 min Coquelin breaks up the play and finds Wilshere in acres of space. He moves the ball on to Nelson but his shot is blocked. Can Arsenal match Liverpool’s tally of last night? Bate are giving them every opportunity. 78 min Nketiah and Willock come on for Welbeck and Elneny. Elneny scores only his second goal for Arsenal, and it’s a beauty. Wilshere picked up the ball on teh edge of the box, shimmied and threatened to shoot before laying the ball to his left for Elneny. The Egyptian, who I may earlier have suggested was not very creative, strikes the ball first time, arcing it beyond Scherbitski and into the far corner. Fine goal, fine player. Needs to do this more often. What a player this guy is! 71 min Reiss Nelson comes on for Theo Walcott. This boy can play, and has impressed in the Europa League this season. He’s 18 on Sunday. 68 min Bate work an opening in the penalty area with a nice bit of play. Stasevich tops it off with a clever flick over his shoulder and first-time shot but it’s straight at Ospina. It was a soft penalty, clumsy more than anything, but maybe still the correct decision. Giroud stepped up and smashed it with his left instep high to the keeper’s left. The referee made him retake it, and he just did the same. Scherbitski got a hand to it this time but to no avail. Giroud has to score twice thanks to the referee’s eagle eye Milunovic bundles over Walcott 57 min Great save! Welbeck is played in in the inside right channel by Elneny and turns inside his man with a typical body swerve. He takes the opportunity to shoot on his left and drills it with some venom but Scherbitski stands big and keeps it out … with his face. That was unfortunate but entertaining. Walcott broke clear down the right and squared for Welbeck to put into an empty net. However before the Arsenal striker could do that Polyakov fairly Polyakoved it past his own keeper in some style. It’s an own goal, but a spectacular one. 46 min Peep peep! The players are out for the second half but Wenger isn’t, not for the first few seconds of action anyway. He must be enjoying this so far. Mak Imamovic has written in to say £20 for a ticket to tonight’s game is expensive. “Is that supposed to be cheap?” he writes. “I know my perspective from Eastern European Jungle is a bit screwed, but come on ...” At the time I thought I was suggesting £40 for the pair was quite a lot for a nothing game, but after that half I’m not so sure. That was exhibition stuff from Arsenal, and Jack Wilshere in particular. The England talk just might not be so ridiculous. Wilshere scores his first goal for two and a half years, and a fine one it is too. He was picked out inside the box by a sharp pass and bought himself space with a nice trick. Sixteen yards out and on the angle, he spun and drilled a left-footed drive across the keeper and into the far corner. He has looked very good tonight. Bate look terrible. That is brilliant again! 41 min Wilshere steps inside on the edge of the box and curls one towards the top corner with the inside of his left foot. It looks good but it’s not quite in the corner and Scherbitski palms it over the bar. Welbeck was put in on the left side of the box. He faced up and beat the last man but another appeared and dispossessed him with a desperate last-ditch challenge. The ball went straight to Walcott through and he fired it calmly across the keeper and inside the far post. Game over. That was coming. 35 min Walcott is throwing his weight around a bit, piling into a shoulder barge after overrunning the ball. Arsenal have completed 258 passes to Bate’s 61. This game is only heading one way at the moment. 30 min Wilshere goes down as only Wilshere does, clutching his ankle and unmoved after a heavy challenge. It looks alarming. It’s not. He’s up and sparking another move that ends with Walcott crossing to no one in the middle. 28 min Arsenal have a free-kick in a very dangerous position. Walcott is over it. The wall jumps and Walcott hits it underneath the jumpers, Coutinho style, but it flies wide of the far post. Not quite enough curl from the instep. 25 min Great save from Walcott. Giroud nods down and Walcott is five yards out. It’s a great point-blank save from Scherbitski. 24 min Another lovely pass over the top from Wilshere brings a desperate header out of a Bate defender to prevent Giroud getting in. The keeper palms away the attempted clearing header. 23 min A lovely pass from Wilshere puts Welbeck clear of the defence down the left. The keeper senses danger and comes flying out, getting enough in the way of the first-time strike to stop the danger. That could have been disastrous for Bate but they escape. Welbeck should have done better there. 20 min Wilshere is playing well, finding space around the edge of the box and looking to take the ball on the half turn and make things happen. Bate are struggling to cope with Arsenal’s slick passing at the moment. 17 min Nice football from Elneny and Wilshere sets Maitland-Niles free down the left. His cross is blocked for a corner, which comes to nothing. Volodjko is booked for a slightly desperate lunge on Debuchy 15 min More pressure from Arsenal results in a corner and panic in the Bate box. Scherbitski flaps and Bate escape this time, but the confidence is flowing through Arsenal now. That was really quite something from the forgotten Frenchman. Waslcott caused a bit of nuisance on the right of the penalty area after a lofted ball from Chambers. He was almost fouled in the box but the ball dropped to Debuchy near the apex of the box. Running on to it from the right-back position Debuchy struck it first time on the half volley and rifled it into the far top corner. What a goal this is! 8 min Bate have started brightly and when the ball falls to Ivanic on the edge of the box he is quick to have a pop. It’s on his left foot on the half volley but Ospina watches it go over the bar. 5 min The commentators say this is guaranteed to be the lowest ever attendance at the Emirates. The previous lowest was 44,000 or thereabouts. How much would you pay to watch a Europa League dead rubber. A friend of mine was offering a pair for £40 total. They did sell. 2 min Elneny hits the post. I was almost eating my words. A Walcott flick on was knocked back by Giroud and Elneny swung his left foot at the ball. It was an awkward connection from the edge of the box but hit the outside of the post. 1 min Peep peep! Bate kick off in yellow with Arsenal in the traditional red and white. The atmosphere is low key. An email! “Personally I find Elneny quite inspiring,” writes Michael Whelan. “Maybe I can still make it.” Cristiano Ronaldo has won the Ballon d’Or for the fifth time, equalling Lionel Messi’s record. A free subscription to The Fiver for anyone who can guess which players came second and third… Coventry has been named UK City of Culture 2021. Maybe there’s hope for the Coquelin-Elneny axis yet? So Wenger has put his faith in experience for this dead rubber and dropped Nelson and Willock to the bench from his usual Europa League XI. A centre midfield pairing of Coquelin and Elneny is about as uninspiring as modern football gets, but Welbeck and Chambers continue their comebacks from injuries. Arsenal Ospina, Debuchy, Holding, Chambers, Maitland-Niles, Coquelin, Elneny, Wilshere, Walcott, Giroud, Welbeck. Subs Macey, Reine-Adelaide, Akpom, Nelson, Nketiah, Sheaf, Willock. Bate Scherbitski, Rios, Polyakov, Milunovic, Maksim Volodjko, Berezkin, Dragun, Gordeichuk, Ivanic, Stasevich, Rodionov. Subs Chichkan, Yablonskiy, Buljat, Signevich, Tuominem, Baha, Gvilia. Referee: Robert Schoergenhofer (Austria) Everton are currently 2-0 up courtesy of Ademola Lookman’s brilliance. You can follow the last half an hour of that game with Nick Miller … So here we are. Arsenal’s long (in miles at least), successful and at times mind-crushingly dull journey through the Europa League group stage ends here with an Emirates showdown that matters only to the team from Belarus. Arsène Wenger’s side are already through as group winners but Bate can still join them in the knockout phase, if they can snatch a win while Red Star and Köln cancel each other out in Belgrade. For Wenger, the tournament he did everything in his power to avoid for so long has proved surprisingly useful this season. He’s been able to blood young talents such as Reiss Nelson, Joe Willock, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Eddie Nketiah, while giving the the elder statesmen who have fallen out of favour just enough game time to keep them from banging down his door. Olivier Giroud, Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere have not started a Premier League match between them this season but have all had their moments in the Europa League. In the first game between these two Arsenal were 3-0 up inside 25 minutes with the help of a Walcott double before running out 4-2 winners so we can be hopeful of goals tonight. With the likes of Napoli, Borussia Dortmund and Atlético Madrid dropping into the competition from the Champions League after Christmas Wenger may not persist with his second string for too long. Tonight would be an opportune moment for them to remind him of their worth.

In The Elephant Man it was only the voice. As Quentin Crisp in The Naked Civil Servant the voice swerved into a gay queenery. It expressed pain and suffering as a monster exploded out of his stomach in Alien. His Christ for Mel Brooks persuaded us that Jesus had such a voice. Its emollience spread over hundreds of movies, plays and commercials. On stage, it put audiences into a light hypnosis. He lent it to me for two short films which were the most enjoyable of my career. He was a fine companion over 45 years. He first came to Ireland to make Sinful Davey in 1969. He was convinced that [the director] John Huston decided after the first week that the film was a dud and if he could kill or seriously injure his star it would be cancelled and the insurance would pay up. He had Hurt riding over rough terrain on mettlesome horses. Despite that John moved here. He spent four months living in my guest cottage with a lover and we had dinner nearly every night. In 1991 I made a docudrama, I Dreamt I Woke Up. I conducted the reality elements myself, but when it became mystical or magical John became my alter ego. In the final scene we appeared side by side debating the nature of reality. It was tongue-in-cheek. He was fearless and would rise to any challenge. I loved that about him. For Two Nudes Bathing in 1995 I asked him to play the strict, possessive father. I sent him the script but got no response. He was having a bad time. His marriage was collapsing and he was staying with various friends and hard to contact. When I finally reached him he apologised. “I left the script somewhere, John. Lost it.” “I’ll send you another copy,” I said, “but I need a quick answer.” John said, “Don’t worry, John. Of course I’ll do it. I don’t need to read the script.” Nevertheless, I sent him another copy, a plane ticket to Paris and instructions about where to get the train for Angers. He headed for Dublin airport; halfway there he realised he had left his passport behind. He raced back and retrieved it, but left the script and ticket behind. He bought another ticket, made the plane by the skin of his teeth and astonishingly got on the right train despite having been drinking heavily for several days. Whatever else went wrong, he always managed to turn up on the set on time. He spoke to his fellow passengers and told them he was going to Angers, then fell asleep. We waited on the platform to meet him: the train pulled in, people got off, people got on, no sign of John. The train started to pull out. John’s fellow passengers wondered if they should wake him. Didn’t he say he was getting off at Angers? Someone shook him. With a roar he leapt out of the moving train and fell in a heap on the platform where he lay inert. His suitcase was hurled out after him. In the morning we dressed him in his heavy, elaborate costume as he drank a beer to steady himself. He asked me what dialogue he had in the first setup; I said just these two lines. He looked them over, we shot it and moved to the next setup. He learnt the next speech as we lit the scene. I filled in the absolute minimum of story and emotion that he needed to know for each shot. Thus we proceeded through the morning. He had not read the script, did not know the name of the character he was playing, or even the name of the film. As we broke for lunch, he said, “This is the way to make movies. All that rehearsal bullshit is a waste of time. Spontaneity is everything.” Drinking steadily through those three days, John was wonderful and I loved him dearly. He played this authoritarian aristocrat out of some kind of actor’s intuition that connected him to the period. The 17th-century costume helped: its heft and style defined the man. He was brilliant. After the three days we poured him back on to the train.

The company filed a complaint on Wednesday accusing Donald Trump of exceeding the powers of his office earlier this week when he ordered that Bears Ears national monument be reduced in size by 85%. The president framed the action as a correction of earlier federal overreach. Barack Obama established the monument at 1.3m acres one year ago, in a move Republicans in Utah’s legislature compared at the time to “the unilateral tyranny exercised by the King of England against the American colonies two and a half centuries ago”. But Patagonia’s lawsuit asserts that Trump is the one playing king, by enacting the largest removal of protection from federal lands in history. The complaint, which was joined by a coalition of conservation groups, was filed in parallel with a separate lawsuit joined by five Native American tribes who say the president’s move endangers sacred sites. Obama established Bears Ears following a request from the inter-tribal coalition that cited increasing thefts and vandalism at more than 100,000 native cultural sites in the area. While it’s not unheard of for corporations to sue the government, it’s also not an obvious business play. But anyone who doubted Patagonia’s willingness to swap backpack for briefcase in the long-running battle over Bears Ears and other public lands had their answer on Wednesday. “We haven’t shied away from making our beliefs known, and I don’t think we’re going to get shy now,” said Robert Tadlock, a lawyer with Patagonia, in a phone interview on Thursday. “This is certainly a step we’ve never taken before in this context. But the president’s decision is unprecedented. And so it calls for a different kind of response.” A fixed-screen, black-and-white statement on the company’s web site is more pugnacious. “The president stole your land,” it reads, calling the reduction “an illegal move” and inviting visitors to join a network of activists and post about the issue on social media. Patagonia and its partners warned they were ready to go to court last summer, after the Trump administration indicated that it was serious about carving up Bears Ears. Apart from a lingering resentment of Obama, Utahans opposed to the Bears Ears monument have expressed seemingly clashing concerns – they are worried about potential environmental impact from increased tourism to the area; yet they also insist upon the right to preserve access to the land for energy and drilling interests. Proponents of the monument point out that federal dollars are needed to preserve the area’s cultural sites and to manage tourism, which could provide a much-needed economic boost for the region. National monuments are protected sites of historical, cultural or scientific interest managed by a patchwork of federal agencies. Legal analysts disagree on whether the president has the authority to shrink Bears Ears and similar conservation sites without action by Congress. “The president doesn’t have the authority under the Antiquities Act to do what he did,” said Tadlock, Patagonia’s lawyer, referring to the 1906 law giving the president the power to create a monument. “The executive only has power to manage federal land to the extent Congress grants that power.” In a letter sent to the interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, in July, 121 legal scholars supported that theory. But the opposing view has been advanced by Todd Gaziano of the Pacific Legal Foundation and professor John Yoo, best known for his work in the George W Bush administration to strike torture from the list of war crimes. “Trump has the right to reverse the national monuments created by previous presidents without an act of Congress, but by the same token, the Constitution creates a check by allowing future presidents to reverse Trump too,” the pair wrote in a July editorial. The government has 60 days to respond to Patagonia’s complaint. “I wouldn’t expect the decision certainly on the substance until sometime next year, but it’s very hard to predict how quickly it will go,” Tadlock said. Tadlock dismissed the notion that Patagonia was out for a political win from taking on Trump. “We feel that this is not about who the administration is. This is not about the politics of it,” he said. “This is about the issue of public lands. We’ve been consistent on this issue for 40 years. It’s something we’ve fought for since we’ve started and it’s a big reason honestly why the company is still going, to be a voice on these issues.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/07/tories-britain-irish-border-debacle-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T20:11:24Z","webTitle":"How can the Tories lead Britain when they barely understand it? | Martin Kettle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/tories-britain-irish-border-debacle-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/07/tories-britain-irish-border-debacle-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"How can the Tories lead Britain when they barely understand it?","bodyText":"No mainstream British political party is more comfortable with the rhetoric of unionism than the Conservatives. It never takes long before Tory ministers, confronted with some challenge or other from Irish, Scottish or Welsh nationalists, fall back on the mantra that they represent the Conservative and Unionist party. Theresa May does this all the time. The implication is always the same. The union is axiomatically safe in Tory hands, because they, the Tories, uniquely understand and are uniquely committed to it. Except, this week, they showed that they don’t and they aren’t. There have been multiple humiliations of government Brexit policy this week. There is a luxurious display of catastrophes to choose from. They range from the jaw-dropping confession by Philip Hammond that the cabinet has never ever, in 18 months since the referendum, held a single discussion about what kind of Brexit it seeks, to the air rushing rudely and loudly out of the whoopee cushion of David Davis’s Trumpian claims to be one of the negotiating masters of the universe after he admitted that he had conducted not a single assessment of the impact of Brexit on any sector of the UK economy. Yet perhaps the most damning failure of a disastrous week for May is the evidence that the modern Conservative party simply does not understand any of the cultural contours of Britain. It is not a surprise that a lot of Conservatives don’t like abroad, or that they dislike the EU in particular. But the more extreme failure is that they don’t get Northern Ireland – or the Irish Republic either. They tend to forget Scotland. They don’t really think about Wales at all. Gibraltar, whose union jackery the Conservatives will always loudly pledge to defend, never so much as enters their minds, though in Brexit terms it is part of this country too. And if they don’t get any of these places right, they don’t really get England right either. The desire to leave the EU, it became clear this week, is based not just on a failure to understand Europe but on a profound set of misconceptions about these islands. The two failures are umbilically linked, which is why Brexit is a profound threat not just to relations with Ireland but to the union itself. That there would be a problem in Ireland with the Tories’ approach to Brexit has long been obvious. Some of us had warned about this issue before the vote, and then warned about it again afterwards. Yet May breezed on, her admirers berating the sceptics as remoaners, confident she could have it all: leave the single market and the customs union and yet continue the open border between north and south in Ireland. This week, in the most humbling of circumstances, the border bit back and the sceptics had their best week since the election. There were signs today that London may have found some more capacious form of words that will enable the Irish Republic, the EU, the DUP and the government to allow the Brexit talks process to get into its second phase at next week’s Brussels summit. At a pinch, the decision on a form of words may be pushed into 2018. But the whole of this week’s crisis has been caused by the collective and institutional failure to take the Irish dimension seriously enough. How could a London government that is peopled by ministers who are still of an age to remember what Northern Ireland was like in the 1970s, and how radically this changed in the 1990s, forget so quickly? It is incredible that supposedly serious British politicians should simply overlook the trenchancy of DUP attitudes towards the status of Northern Ireland, allow the zero-sum politics of the north to slip their minds or lose track of the Irish Republic’s existential engagement with the peace process. But it has happened. The very fact that the DUP Westminster deal exists at all is proof that political antennae have atrophied. A government whose mind was large enough to think about the Irish dimension properly would have been far more careful. “You are all so young,” lamented the admirable Lady Hermon during an important debate this week on the EU withdrawal bill in which she, the sole independent unionist voice in the Commons, tried (and failed, alas) to get the government to write the upholding of the Good Friday agreement into the bill. Yet the passing of the generations at Westminster, when only those in their 50s know what Burntollet Bridge, the Bogside, Warrenpoint and all the rest mean, only partially explains why British politicians don’t take Ireland seriously enough. The lamentable absence of a constitutional nationalist voice in the 2017 parliament – for the first time since the first half of the 19th century – is another concern too. But there is surely a deeper cultural explanation as well. There is a closing of the mind in British society and politics, a lack of awareness, understanding, experience, imagination and contact with those who live outside the political class or who see the history of these islands differently. It is a complicated material and cultural process, not to be trivialised as merely the failings of individual politicians. It also reflects a shared civic failure and decline in basic statecraft. But its results are dire. Among them are the mental retreat that led both to the referendum result itself and now to the subsequent mishandling of Brexit in its turn, as well as to the widely acknowledged inability of the government to focus effectively on anything except Brexit. May, with her cavalier disregard of the 48%, is very lucky she has Ruth Davidson to at least remind her that these things look different from Scotland. Davidson this week understood what May, in spite of her unionist claims, did not. The Irish draft this week was a gift to Scottish separatism. The logic of the Irish problem can only mean a soft Irish border and regulatory alignment with the EU in the form of continued membership of the customs union. No British prime minister, especially one who actively promotes herself as a defender of the union as May does, can be excused for paying so little attention to Northern Ireland and to relations with the Irish Republic. May cannot be everywhere all the time, but she has been to the Middle East more often than she has been to Ireland since becoming prime minister, and she spends a lot more time in Brussels than she does in Edinburgh or Cardiff. Nor does she have heavyweights to fill in for her, either as secretaries of state or at No 10. In the end, this shows in the outcomes. And that is what happened this week, when her signature policy was exposed as delusional, incompetent and unworkable. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/07/ministers-are-reading-too-much-into-this-test","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T18:46:22Z","webTitle":"Don’t read too much into the Pirls literacy test results | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/07/ministers-are-reading-too-much-into-this-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/07/ministers-are-reading-too-much-into-this-test","fields":{"headline":"Don’t read too much into the Pirls literacy test results","bodyText":"England’s nine- and 10-year-olds showed a modest improvement on the 2016 Pirls (Progress in international reading literacy study) reading test, compared with 2011 scores (English pupils improve results in international reading exams, 6 December).

The Pirls test is a test of reading comprehension: students have to understand what they read. Research consistently shows that phonics ability does not influence scores on tests of comprehension. This is consistent with results showing high scores on phonics screening tests do not result in better reading several years later. In our analyses of previous Pirls tests (2006 and 2011), the strongest predictors of achievement were level of poverty (negative) and the presence of a school library (positive).

Lavinia Woodward, 24, received a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, for stabbing her then partner with a breadknife in a drunken attack. The presiding judge in the original case reportedly told Woodward that a custodial sentence could damage her career prospects and was therefore too severe. The judge’s remarks led to accusations of leniency and tabloid headlines including “Too clever for prison”. They also provoked a debate about social and racial inequalities in the judicial system. Woodward – who lives in Milan with her mother – has now applied to the court of appeal to review her sentence, which was delivered at Oxford crown court in September this year. “Lavinia Woodward has submitted an application for permission to appeal,” said a spokesman for the Judicial Communications Office. “The next stage is for a single judge to consider the application on paper and if permission is granted it then the substantive appeal will be heard in court before three judges.” The stabbing occurred on 30 September 2016 when Woodward’s partner, a University of Cambridge student whom she met on Tinder, visited her in Oxford. He infuriated Woodward after contacting her mother with his concerns about her drinking. She became “extremely angry” and began throwing objects at him before stabbing him in the leg. Woodward pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and has since returned to a clinic for continued treatment for drug and alcohol problems and an eating disorder. Woodward was an aspiring heart surgeon and medicine student at Christ Church college who has had articles published in medical journals. She was originally meant to be sentenced earlier this year after admitting unlawful wounding, but the judge deferred her sentence for four months to allow her to demonstrate good behaviour. As part of these efforts, she voluntarily suspended her studies at Oxford but could return, take an academic research job or begin a PhD at another university. Prior to sentencing the judge Ian Pringle QC said: “It seems to me that if this was a one-off, a complete one-off, to prevent this extraordinarily able young lady from not following her long-held desire to enter the profession she wishes to would be a sentence which would be too severe.” James Sturman QC, her lawyer, said the judge’s comments had been taken out of context and it was wrong to say the defendant had been treated leniently because of her academic achievement. Passing sentence, Pringle said there were “many mitigating features” in her case, including her spotless prior record, and added: “I find that you were genuinely remorseful following this event.” “Whilst you are a clearly highly intelligent individual, you had an immaturity about you which was not commensurate for someone of your age.” “You have demonstrated over the last nine months that you are determined to rid yourself of your alcohol and drug addiction and have undergone extensive treatment including counselling to address the many issues that you face,” he continued. The judicial watchdog later threw out three complaints against Pringle because they did not relate to his personal conduct."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/08/new-york-offensive-monuments","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T12:00:02Z","webTitle":"'For too long, they have generated harm': the fight to remove offensive monuments in New York","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/08/new-york-offensive-monuments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/08/new-york-offensive-monuments","fields":{"headline":"'For too long, they have generated harm': the fight to remove offensive monuments in New York","bodyText":"This summer, a series of Confederate monuments were torn down in Maryland, North Carolina, Florida, Texas and Louisiana after the death of a civil rights activist at a far-right protest in Charlottesville. It looks like New York City might be next. In a city with more than 800 public monuments, four in particular have irked artists and academics, who have signed a public petition. The 500 signatories are advocating for the removal of monuments of Christopher Columbus, James Marion Sims, Theodore Roosevelt and one adjoined honouring Philippe Pétain and Pierre Laval. “For too long, they have generated harm and offense as expressions of white supremacy,” reads the petition, in a city which “preaches tolerance and equity”. To the signatories, the Roosevelt monument, which shows the 26th American president with a Native American chief and an African man, glorifies racial hierarchies. “Roosevelt is a very salient symbol for us of white supremacy and it’s often cited as the most hated monument in New York City,” said Andrew Ross, an activist and culture professor at New York University. “It has no place outside of the museum.” Ross first drafted the petition alongside other members of Decolonize This Place, which organized the Anti-Columbus Day Tours at the American Museum of Natural History. New York’s Columbus statue, located at Columbus Circle in Manhattan, has come under fire for representing genocide. The statue, however, was a gift from the Italian American community, some of whom adopt Columbus as an icon. To Phil Folgia, counsel for the Italian American legal defense and higher education fund, the removal of the statue would be “an outrage to our community”. Not all Italian Americans feel that way. Tom Angotti, an American Italian professor at Hunter College believes “the genocide of Christopher Columbus should not be revered”, adding that: “We ought to honour instead the Italian immigrants who faced discrimination and fought for economic and racial equality – people like Vito Marcantonio, once a congressman from New York City.” To Roberto Borrero, a Taíno person who works for the International Indian Treaty Council, he explains: “Italians have many other role models to look up to, so their pride should not supersede my people’s tragedy.” John Viola, the president of the National Italian American Foundation, said: “In the wake of the lynching of 11 Sicilian Americans in New Orleans, the statue at Columbus circle was gifted to the city of New York by the newly arrived Italian American community. Our community was able to gather small donations from thousands of Italian American families and turn them into that statue – a testament to their belief and confidence in the American dream. That statue is a thank you card to America.” While New York City has seen several public art controversies – like Richard Serra’s Tilted Arc which caused an uproar for its inconvenience to pedestrians in the 1980s – for the first time the mayor’s office has responded to this issue by hosting public hearings and an online survey for New Yorkers. “It has hit a high level,” said Gregory Sholette, an artist who signed the petition. “It’s reached a situation that’s now different because people are finally standing to say ‘this not acceptable.’” According to the signatories, the monument honouring French politicos Philippe Pétain and Pierre Laval, which is part of the Canyon of Heroes on Broadway, needs to be removed, as the duo were historic markers of the Vichy France regime during the second world war and were “Nazi collaborators”. Alan Singer, a signee and professor at Hofstra University, says a new system needs to be brought in. “A scale needs to be developed to evaluate which monuments are taken down and which place names are changed,” he said. “Criminals, including traitors, should be stripped of honours, as well as advocates of hatred.” The monument of American physician James Marion Sims at Central Park near 103rd street is especially troubling, as Sims performed experimental gynaecological operations on enslaved African women between 1845 and 1849. “By honouring Sims, New York City honours the American equivalent of Josef Mengele,” said Singer. “This statue should be removed.” Could the monuments be replaced? One New York artist, Alicia Grullon, thinks there should be a statue of Kalief Browder, the African American man from the Bronx who was imprisoned on Rikers Island, and whose suicide is believed to be the result of prison abuse. “He is an unfortunate martyr who has forced us to look at the prison-industrial system and the inequity that drives it,” she said. “His short life forces us to be better, that’s a worthy statue to have and let it be 500ft high.” A series of public hearings were held in each borough last month by the Mayoral Advisory Commission on City Art, Monuments, and Markers, with its final hearing on 28 November. New Yorkers had the opportunity to voice their support or opposition of the monuments and the commission will bring the petition to the attention of New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, by the end of this month. The commission also had an online survey, which asked New Yorkers questions such as: “What is the best way to achieve public space that is open and inclusive?” The commission’s co-chairs, Tom Finkelpearl and Darren Walker, recently published an op-ed last week in the New York Daily News, which says they are looking “to develop a set of guidelines that allows us to approach these issues in a coherent, transparent way that brings people together in dialogue, instead of driving them apart”. While some of those guidelines includes adding labels or signs to change the meaning of the monuments, that isn’t the answer to one of the petition’s signees. “One of the most important functions of public space is to be a vibrant and safe hub for encounters of people from different backgrounds,” said Carin Kuoni, a professor at the New School. “An additional sign or label simply doesn’t carry the same weight as a monumental bronze sculpture that is placed in a prominent spot in the city.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/08/moment-that-changed-me-my-mother-dying","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T08:00:36Z","webTitle":"A moment that changed me: the third time I was told my mother was dying | Isabel Wright","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/moment-that-changed-me-my-mother-dying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/08/moment-that-changed-me-my-mother-dying","fields":{"headline":"A moment that changed me: the third time I was told my mother was dying","bodyText":"I had recently started primary school when I was told my mother was going to die. Prepare for the worst, someone said. Hardly anyone knew at school. A friend was baffled when I was given an unexplained hug by a teacher. It seemed inconceivable that my funny, feisty, feminist mother could die, that a sinkhole could open under my life like that. I decided there must be some prayer, magic spell or extremely good behaviour that would hold off the dark. And then, through the wonder of modern cancer treatment, the brilliant NHS and a good measure of sheer bloody-mindedness, hold off the dark she did. I was in my early teens when they told me the cancer had returned and that she was going to die. It seemed even more inconceivable that this would happen then. I was a weird, ginger-haired geek about to battle through adolescence – there was no way I was going to let her go. Surely a little more magic and extremely good behaviour would get us through? Once again, against the odds, my mother and the wonder of modern cancer treatment triumphed. My mother was fierce, all right. I decided her superpower was fending off death. She fought cancer as fiercely as she fought injustice, the monarchy, patriarchy and bad grammar in the essays of her students. She thought my sister and I were fabulous and was always on our side of the ring, urging us on. I started to write plays and thought I could weave more magic, creating universes where I could decide who triumphed and who succumbed. I wrote a play about a young man who desperately tries to tell his funny, feisty, dying father that he loves him. My mother thought it was hilarious, especially the joke about lung cancer. Through my early 20s she was often in remission, although no one ever said this. It felt like the shadow over our lives had lifted, but it was still there. I feel privileged that she met my future husband and approved of him. Our relationship evolved into a more equal one, though she was always going to be the matriarch of my small, close-knit, female family circle. Just after her granddaughter was born, my mother faced her final battle. That was the third time I was told she was dying, but even sitting through countless meetings with her oncologist I never really believed it. She had a superpower, after all. We were all on our very best behaviour. My sister had a baby on the way who wanted to meet her. Surely modern medicine owed us another win. She’d been so very good at trying whatever new anti-cancer drug was invented. Even as she moved into a hospice I told myself it was temporary. One day she asked a nurse to help her get dressed in the mother-of-the-bride outfit she’d bought for my wedding, which she now knew she might not attend. Even as the nurse took photos, I didn’t truly believe she wouldn’t be there making the most kick-ass mother-of-the-bride speech ever. I smiled ferociously through the photo shoot and told myself she was just being over-prepared. I tried to tell her I loved her, over and over, but mostly we just made black jokes. Surely this was just the bit when the audience thinks all is lost but then somehow, miraculously … A friend recently lost a parent, and I clumsily tried to explain why I knew all about the secret club she’d joined, why it gets less raw but still remains shitty. Rona Munro wrote an amazing play about grief and mountaineers, and there’s a line where the character says she’s been very good, and everyone’s saying she’s done so well and … when does she get her reward? But there isn’t a reward for grieving well, because the person’s still gone. Finding yourself an orphan when you’re in your 20s shouldn’t feel such a big deal; there are always people who have gone through worse, yet the sense of being on your own is profound. When I have a day that socks me in the jaw I still turn and expect to have her at my back. I hear her voice when Donald Trump talks about grabbing pussy, when politicians let down poor people, when poetry makes me cry, when new films explode on to the screen, when the Queen’s estate gets caught up in a tax scandal. I wish I could hear what she thought about these things. And I know it would give her a kick to be in the Guardian. • Isabel Wright is a playwright"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/08/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-watch-the-first-full-trailer-dinosaur-sequel","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T02:55:59Z","webTitle":"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom – watch the first full trailer of the dinosaur sequel online","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/08/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-watch-the-first-full-trailer-dinosaur-sequel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/08/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-watch-the-first-full-trailer-dinosaur-sequel","fields":{"headline":"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom – watch the first full trailer of the dinosaur sequel online","bodyText":"The first trailer for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the sequel to the global smash hit Jurassic World, has been unveiled.

It turns out that a pile of bones buried in a church in southern Italy, bones that tradition claims to be those of Saint Nicholas, the fourth-century bishop of Myra in present day Turkey, are old enough to have belonged to him.

Even so, the Saint Nicholas legends – associated with gift-giving and a concern for the poor – only began to take a recognisably Santa Claus shape after the Protestant churches firmly rejected the cult of the saints and the worship of bones as medieval superstitions. As was so often the case, official Protestant rejection of popular forms of religious devotion didn’t mean these cults disappeared, it just meant that the mythology and traditions developed outside of the church and took on a more secular form. Hence Saint Nicholas slipped his Christian moorings and took on a life of his own, with his first appearance in a sledge being in the American literature of the early 19th century. Now Santa Claus was ready to become the unofficial patron saint of the pre-Christmas period, the seedy saint who hangs around in shopping centre grottoes, blessing our over–indulgence as generosity and bouncing poor innocent children up and down on his knee. As well as being a corporate stooge, this Santa is a creep. And from a Christian point of view, the worst thing about Santa is that the candles and fairy lights that are lit in his honour are a form of light pollution that makes invisible the sight of that one simple star that hovers over an outhouse in (Roman) occupied Bethlehem. For in that great prophecy from Isaiah, it is the people who walk in darkness that will see a great light. Those who dwell in the shadow of death, on them the light shines. My friend Michael died this week. I sat with him for a while in the days when he was struggling for breath. And for a few moments after life had left him. During the last few weeks, Michael’s family has gathered round his bedside – crying, laughing, praying, telling stories, waiting – largely oblivious to, and rightly uninterested in, the great circus of greed that was playing itself out all over the county. There are so many more weighty things to think about than what cheap perfume to get for Auntie Dot. And so many easy ways continually to distract ourselves from the important things we have to say to each other. Or the times we might sit alone, doing nothing, listening to what we really need. This is what the Advent period should be all about. Instead we are, to use the words of TS Eliot “Distracted from distraction by distraction/ Filled with fancies and empty meaning”. Advent is the very antithesis of Santa’s secular pre-Christmas merry-go-round, because advent should release us from the obligation to be continually entertained and entertaining. Advent is not afraid of boredom as the occasional byproduct of doing little and with less, of doing without distraction. Instead, Santa wants to turbo-charge our baser instincts for more and more stuff, filling us up with costly rubbish so that we do not notice the call of that deeper lack for which there is no material consolation. But this call is the ultimate blasphemy to the creepy bearded man who listens only to the insistent nagging of our GDP, believing that growth is the only god of the season. The real Saint Nicholas of Myra, if he ever existed, would have been thoroughly ashamed of what his name has come to stand for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/11/ho-ho-hold-back-why-you-should-go-easy-on-the-festive-cheer-this-year","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Ho ho hold back … why you should go easy on the festive booze this year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/11/ho-ho-hold-back-why-you-should-go-easy-on-the-festive-cheer-this-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/11/ho-ho-hold-back-why-you-should-go-easy-on-the-festive-cheer-this-year","fields":{"headline":"Ho ho hold back … why you should go easy on the festive booze this year","bodyText":"Can you imagine a Dry December? The very thought of getting through the grim, grey days, manic bouts of shopping and emotional overload of the festive holidays without a drop of alcohol is surely unbearable for many. So, is there any such thing as safe drinking? Can we ensure we don’t slide into addiction? And is it true that it is actually bad to be teetotal? I love a drink but don’t want to end up addicted. What do you suggest? The only way to avoid being dependent on alcohol is not to drink at all, says David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London. “We talk about capture rate, the percentage of users who end up addicted to a substance. Tobacco is the most addictive, with a capture rate of about 40%, then heroin at 30%, crack cocaine about 25% and alcohol at 12%. But you can’t know if you’re going to be one of the 12% who is susceptible to becoming addicted to alcohol. And in the UK, 85% of adults drink alcohol, so that’s potentially around 4 million people who are at risk of addiction.” So, is it really best not to drink at all? Nutt says, at the very least, you should be aware of how much you drink, and then try to drink less. “Everyone should keep tabs on their weight, blood pressure, waist size and know how many units of alcohol they’re drinking. Try to stay within the government recommendation of 14 units a week or four units a day.” I have heard that we should all drink a bit to stave off dementia. Is is it true? The media have certainly embraced the idea that moderate drinkers (generally those drinking fewer than 20 units a week) are less likely to develop dementia than teetotallers. But neuropsychiatrist Killian Welch of the Royal Edinburgh hospital says the studies that seemed to show that some alcohol is better than none in terms of brain function were often flawed, and didn’t take other factors into account. “People who drink in moderation may also have a moderate approach to life in general; they may be more likely to exercise, eat a Mediterranean diet and socialise than teetotallers. And some people are teetotal because they used to be heavy drinkers, which damaged their health.” The upshot is that it is probably a myth that some drinking is better than none. I have had a blood test that says my liver is fine. Can I carry on enjoying a few pints? Just because your blood test is OK, that does not mean the liver isn’t becoming damaged by alcohol. And liver damage is just one of a range of harmful effects. “The only known way to reduce your risk of developing breast cancer or dementia is by cutting out alcohol,” says Nutt. Mark Leyshon, senior policy officer at Alcohol Concern, says alcohol is linked to more than 60 conditions, including liver disease and six forms of cancer: breast, bowel, liver, mouth and throat, oesophagus and stomach. The risk of developing alcohol-related health problems such as cancer relates to how much we consume: the less we drink, the lower our risk. Alcohol is thought to be responsible for about 4% of cases of cancer in the UK. Isn’t alcohol good for the heart? Leyshon explains: “For some groups, drinking very small amounts of alcohol has been shown to offer some protection against heart disease, but this should not be a green light to start drinking – there are more effective and less risky ways to protect yourself from heart disease, such as regularly eating fresh fruit and vegetables and taking regular exercise.” And there is no doubt that heavy drinking damages the heart muscle and contributes to high blood pressure. What’s better for you; spirits, wine or beer? Psychiatrist Anya Topiwala, of the University of Oxford, says: “The jury is out on whether one type of alcohol is better for you than any other. It’s the units that count; we know that drinking 0-7 units a week does not seem to damage your health. But once you get over 14 units a week, there is a dose response, so that the more you drink, the more cognitive decline you can demonstrate in memory testing and MRI studies.” Even moderate levels of alcohol are bad for the brain, including shrinkage of the area called the hippocampus. Leyshon says that whatever you are drinking, the trick is to stay well within the 14 units guideline; that is the equivalent of six glasses of wine, or six pints of ordinary-strength beer, spread out over three or more days. A large (35ml) single shot of spirits is 1.4 units. I come from a family of drinkers and we can all hold our drink. Doesn’t that mean I can manage a bit more? Topiwala says about half of alcohol dependence is explained by genetics, the other half by the environment. About a third of east Asians (people from Japan, Korea, Vietnam and China) have an inherited deficiency of an enzyme, which means they accumulate acetaldehyde in the bloodstream when they drink alcohol. This can cause facial flushing, nausea, headache and palpitations and may increase the risk of oesophageal cancer. People with this inherited tendency often choose not to drink because the effects are so unpleasant. Other people may have no trouble metabolising alcohol, but this means they are more at risk of drinking to excess because the biological brakes don’t kick in. And just because you don’t feel drunk, doesn’t mean the alcohol isn’t causing harm. Does all this mean that people in the know never touch a drop? Welch laughs when I ask him. “We all do things we probably shouldn’t, but it does seem important that people are provided with accurate information so they can make informed choices. For what it’s worth, I will be having a drink over Christmas, but my reading of the research literature would certainly encourage moderation.” Details of Alcohol Concern’s Dry January campaign are at alcoholconcern.org.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/10/barnum-musical-marcus-brigstocke-review-menier-chocolate-factory","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-10T08:00:31Z","webTitle":"Barnum review – all show, not enough tell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/10/barnum-musical-marcus-brigstocke-review-menier-chocolate-factory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/10/barnum-musical-marcus-brigstocke-review-menier-chocolate-factory","fields":{"headline":"Barnum review – all show, not enough tell","bodyText":"“Humbug” at this time of year usually means Scrooge. Barnum gives the word an altogether different twist. In this 1980 musical, “humbug” is legerdemain, entrepreneurial flair, salesman’s hype, the dazzle that puts stars in your eyes. Phineas Taylor Barnum, peddler of the American dream, bravura creator of spectacle (just look at his elephants sashaying through Victorian Chesterfield), was not only a showman and hustler but a politician. He might have lived in the 19th century but his life and circus could equally belong to 2017. Not in Gordon Greenberg’s staging, the show’s first major London revival since the 1981 production starring Michael Crawford. Mark Bramble’s script is thin. Episodes of Barnum’s life – bickering lovingly with his puritan wife (all principle and devotion), hearing his museum has burned down, having a romance with “the Swedish nightingale” Jenny Lind, trying to sell us a mermaid – are plonked undramatically down, one after another. Cy Coleman’s music – lots of brass oompah – and Michael Stewart’s merry but undistinguished lyrics are entertaining but not strong enough to make the story vivid. The show needs a trump card. Marcus Brigstocke, who plays Barnum, is not that card. As a quick-on-the-draw comedy performer he can do what many actors cannot: chat easily to the audience, beckoning them in or (in the case of a few challenges to critics) giving them the willies by picking some of them out and demanding they play the kazoo. It is, if anything, a plus that when he sets off to walk the tightrope you don’t know if he is wobbling in earnest or just teasing. That high wire on which he totters stretches from one lover to another: everyone falls off it from time to time. But wobble is not a force. Brigstocke, whose singing voice is not strong, sounds pallid beside Laura Pitt-Pulford, who as the goody-goody wifey soars with her lovely, knife-like voice. He also looks puny – and who wouldn’t? – alongside the acrobats, who are the real stars of the show. Paul Farnsworth’s design turns the tiny Menier into a big top. Rebecca Howell’s choreography and Scott Maidment’s “circus direction” encircle it in a whirligig of activity. Gorgeously. Girls in frilled corsets cartwheel and balance one-handed on their companion’s head. People eat fire, juggle with knives, jump through hoops, skim up poles, balance on enormous balloons. As Tom Thumb, Harry Francis pirouettes and leaps beautifully around the ring. As Jenny Lind, Celinde Schoenmaker beautifully belts out her numbers. Very impressive and jolly all this – the more so for being seen so close up – but these exuberant skills aren’t enough to disguise the weakness at the centre. Not so much humbug as Polo. • Barnum is at the Menier Chocolate Factory, London, until 3 March 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/08/wormwood-scrubs-inspector-dramatic-increase-violence-london-prison","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T00:01:27Z","webTitle":"Inspector finds dramatic increase in violence inside London prison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/08/wormwood-scrubs-inspector-dramatic-increase-violence-london-prison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/08/wormwood-scrubs-inspector-dramatic-increase-violence-london-prison","fields":{"headline":"Inspector finds dramatic increase in violence inside London prison","bodyText":"Patrol dogs, body-worn cameras for staff and extra CCTV have been urgently drafted into Wormwood Scrubs jail in London after the chief inspector of prisons found high levels of serious violence, including 90 attacks on staff in six months. The chief inspector, Peter Clarke, who inspected the west London prison in July and August, found “an extremely concerning picture” with the jail still suffering from “intractable failings” that had persisted since previous inspections dating back to 2014. In his report, published on Friday, Clarke said that serious violence leading to significant injuries was a particular concern, with a dramatic increase in assaults on staff in the previous six months. The report follows an earlier one this week that described a trailblazing “reform” jail, Holme House near Stockton-on-Tees, as awash with drugs – with a third of the prisoners testing positive for psychoactive substances and other drugs. Clarke said that at the Scrubs – a Victorian jail in Shepherd’s Bush holding 1,227 men, more than half of whom are from a black or minority ethnic background – some efforts were made to improve the physical environment, but the prison was struggling to provide decent conditions. “Too many men were locked up for significant periods of the day, often as long as 23 hours,” the report said. “Resettlement and offender management work was fundamentally failing and the prison was not meeting one of its key aims of supporting men to understand and address their offending behaviour and risk.” It added that 41% of prisoners were locked in their cells during the working day. Drugs were said to be “very accessible”. Clarke said staffing shortages were pervasive and led to a failure to deliver even basic services: “We saw large, challenging wings being run by groups of relatively junior staff, some of whom lacked the confidence to challenge the men in their care adequately.” Inspectors saw prisoners jumping between landings to avoid being locked up. Clarke said a recovery plan was urgently needed for the jail: “Overall, this was an extremely concerning picture, and we could see no justification as to why this poor situation had persisted since 2014. “The governor and his team were, to their credit, working tirelessly to address the problems faced … this was commendable. But we were not confident that they could deliver improvement to outcomes without considerable additional external support.” The prison conducted a full review of safety following the inspection and body-worn cameras, patrol dogs and extra CCTV were introduced to tackle the violence. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “HMP Wormwood Scrubs has taken decisive action to reduce violence, and is working closely with [contracted works provider] Carillion to urgently improve conditions at the prison. “We know staffing remains an issue, so we are recruiting 120 extra officers and will cut the time taken for new recruits to begin training. “The addition of new, senior probation staff has also led to significant improvements in resettling offenders into the community following release.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/07/pakistan-no-home-is-south-london-sadiq-khan-tells-bbc-reporter","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T16:43:28Z","webTitle":"Pakistan?

Khan’s parents moved from Pakistan to England in the 1960s, and while standing for mayor he frequently referenced his south London upbringing and in particular the fact that his father drove a number 44 bus. He grew up in Tooting and was elected as the area’s MP in 2005. But the BBC reporter Karl Mercer asked Khan as he crossed over the border from India into Pakistan: “Does it feel like coming home?” After making clear that was not what he was doing, the mayor elaborated on his emotional connection to the region. “It’s good to be in Pakistan, it’s good to come from India, home of my parents and grandparents. Obviously there’s an emotional connection for me, bearing in mind my connections to this great part of the world.” Khan became the first Muslim mayor of an EU capital city when he was elected in 2016, having fended off attempts by the Conservative campaign – widely discredited and criticised – to link him to Islamic extremists. Labour claimed the attacks on Khan were dog-whistle racism. His public profile and popularity have led to him being spoken of as a possible future Labour leader, but while in Pakistan he ruled out that prospect. Khan told ITV: “I never had ambitions in the first place and I’ve got no ambitions now. I love being the mayor. Why give up a job I love to do a job I don’t want? I’m absolutely ruling myself out. Forever.” Defending Mercer’s question, a BBC spokesman said: “Our reporter asked the mayor a question in the context of the trip being referred to by senior politicians in the region as a homecoming. The full answer the mayor gave shows he understood the context of the question.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/john-noakes-tv-hero-review-a-nostalgic-tribute-to-blue-peters-original-daredevil","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-11T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"John Noakes: TV Hero review – a nostalgic tribute to Blue Peter’s original daredevil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/john-noakes-tv-hero-review-a-nostalgic-tribute-to-blue-peters-original-daredevil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/11/john-noakes-tv-hero-review-a-nostalgic-tribute-to-blue-peters-original-daredevil","fields":{"headline":"John Noakes: TV Hero review – a nostalgic tribute to Blue Peter’s original daredevil","bodyText":"‘It wouldn’t happen now,” says Edward Barnes, who was deputy head of children’s programmes at the BBC in the 1970s. “Oh, a great deal of what we did we’d be in prison for now.” Dear me, this sounds a bit worrying ... Don’t worry, though. He’s not talking about those kinds of crimes, he’s talking about crimes against health and safety; the best kind of crimes, some might say. Edward was more of a planner than the person who actually carried out the deeds. That man was John Noakes, who died this year and is remembered in John Noakes: TV Hero (BBC2, Saturday). It is extraordinary and brilliant watching – rewatching for some of us – Noakes’s Blue Peter stunts today. Such as the scaling of Nelson’s column, up a wobbly ladder, then beyond the overhang to get on to the parapet, and up your man Horatio himself to clean the guano from his head. I see no poo. No harness or rope either. Nothing but a massive pair of cojones – JN’s, not HN’s. And climbing tall masts, jumping out of aeroplanes or on to trapezes or rapidly moving animals, hurtling down ice ... you just wouldn’t see that from a children’s TV presenter nowadays, would you? Incidentally, there’s an interesting revelation about that sky dive, from former RAF Falcons camera operator Doug Fletcher. Noakes wasn’t wearing a microphone; it might have interfered with his oxygen supply. So the breathless commentary – “and we’re out in space, it’s unbelievable, 25,000 feet” – with the atmosphere whistling past? Dubbed in later. Who knew, Blue Peter: fake news. (As for John Craven, he just made it all up as he went along.) Still, different times and all that, and Noakes was ahead of his. It wasn’t just the daredevil action man stuff. John was different from other people on TV. He had a regional accent when everyone else on TV spoke like the Queen. He was irreverent and spontaneous and seemed to be natural, even if it was an act and – as his wife says – he was introverted and shy in real life. He also played a big part in one of the most memorable television events ever. I’m talking about Lulu defecating live in a BBC studio, of course – Lulu the baby elephant from Chessington zoo, not Lulu the diminutive singer from Glasgow. While Peter Purves and Valerie Singleton didn’t know what to do, John turned it into a brilliant bit of ad-lib variety, chasing Lulu, pretending to be stood on, sliding around in her wee, jazz hands, everything. That was a bit before my Blue Peter time. I was John Noakes-Peter Purves-Lesley Judd era. Peter looked, sounded and was like everyone else on TV, he never did much for me. Lesley, I was a little bit in love with. John was my mate, just as everyone else thought he was. Watching this is just like bumping into a childhood friend and immediately re-clicking, a reminder of why and how much you liked them in the first place. Nice one. More fake news, plus another elephant obviously, in Attenborough and the Giant Elephant (BBC1, Sunday). He was called Jumbo, a Victorian superstar who came to London zoo from Africa, toured America and met his end in a Canadian railway tragedy. That – the end of the story – is where the fake news comes in. He charged heroically at an approaching locomotive, in order to save the life of a young elephant he was with, said reports at the time. That’s all very romantic, but sadly not true, discovers David Attenborough, with his Sherlock Holmes hat on. I mean playing detective, not wearing a deerstalker, sadly. Sir David’s no stranger to fake news himself, of course. Remember Frozen Planet’s polar bears, filmed in a zoo? Anyway, Jumbo was hit ignominiously from behind, while boarding another train. Bad luck, not heroism. But it’s a fascinating life story, one that includes royalty, alcoholism and terrible night rages. Jumbo, it is said, was the inspiration for Disney’s Dumbo, though Jumbo couldn’t fly, even if he might have thought he could after a few whiskys with his keeper, a strange fellow called Matthew Scott. Etymologically interesting, too. Named after the Swahili greeting usually written Jambo, he’s the reason jumbo came to mean something very big. Jumbo jet, jumbo sausage, hello jet, hello sausage ... although it’s possible there could be an element of fake news in that, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/09/liverpool-everton-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"Liverpool v Everton: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/09/liverpool-everton-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/09/liverpool-everton-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool v Everton: match preview","bodyText":"A sense of calm may have descended on Everton after three consecutive wins and clean sheets but Anfield brings one of trepidation and not only on account of their appalling record across Stanley Park.

The practice, which is widespread across parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, sees patients chained to drainpipes, starved and abused, and forced to perform sexual acts in exchange for cash to pay off their bills, according to the paper published by Chatham House this week. Campaigners are calling on the global health community to take immediate action against medical detentions ahead of a high-level forum in Tokyo on universal healthcare, which begins on Tuesday. The UN, World Health Organization and World Bank will meet world leaders to discuss ways to improve healthcare for all by 2030. “This is a systemic problem, and the number of rights abuses is quite profound: people are being detained without trial, they’re being locked up with security guards, and women are giving birth to babies who are entering the world, in effect, as prisoners,” said Robert Yates, project director at the Centre on Global Health Security, who co-authored the paper. “Healthcare user fees are at the root of the problem, and this just shows how bad a privately financed health system can get. We need to do more research on this and the global health community needs to start taking this seriously.” While exact numbers of medical detentions are unknown, in some countries the practice is so common that patients consider it “normal” for hospitals to detain those who cannot pay their bills. Politicians have used it to their advantage in the run-up to elections. Recently in Nigeria, an aspiring governor paid off a number of patients’ bills at a public hospital in Osun state, while the wife of a state governor in Abia showered nursing mothers with gifts, and paid off their bills, after visiting them in a hospital presided over by her husband. Those most at risk of being detained are the poorest people, according to the paper, among them those needing emergency treatment and pregnant women, with many of them resorting to desperate tactics in order to escape detention. Over a six-week period in 2016 in one health facility in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 54% of women who had given birth and were eligible for discharge were detained for nonpayment of user fees, according to the study, with many women and children held for months at a time. In a Nairobi hospital in Kenya, women who had been detained post-childbirth for fees amounting to 210,000 shillings (£1,500), were having sex with doctors for as little as 300 shillings (£2.16) in order to pay off their bills. “Healthcare really needs to be free of charge to the patient, because this is the consequence of making patients pay, and it is the worst situation in a whole range of very difficult situations: they may get the medical care they need but then they, or their belongings or their ID papers, are kept hostage,” said Dr Mit Philips, health policy advisor at Médecins sans Frontières. “Unfortunately, because many of these health facilities don’t receive sufficient funding to provide adequate care even when patients can afford to pay, this is the kind of economic logic that results. If we’re serious about universal health coverage, then abolishing user fees would be a good place to start.” Campaigners have called for national leaders to ban medical detentions and prosecute the hospitals that imprison their patients, as well as reform their health financing systems towards publicly financed universal health coverage. The paper cites Burundi as a clear example of how the abolition of user fees can improve health services, as public finance to hospitals and the provision of free maternity services saw deliveries in health units quadruple and infant mortality decline by 43% within five years. “The only countries that have achieved universal health coverage have done so through scaling up public financing, and a core part of universal health coverage is removing user fees,” said Oxfam’s health policy advisor Anna Marriott. “But we’re just seeing inaction around this across the world.

So it is not surprising that he is threatened by a group loyal to the Labour party’s manifesto and elected leader, both of which came as a shock to the “New Labour” right that thought it owned the party now (and which, ironically, was too right wing for Roy Hattersley when he was still active). Many Labour members, whom Hattersley would call “extreme left wingers”, don’t think that a party within a party is the way to go. However, we need to remember that, while Momentum is bureaucratic on principle, with committee meetings, minutes taken, “you are out of order, comrade” and all the rest of it, a less-visible rightwing Labour party within a party has grown up since Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader. Without Momentum’s bureaucracy, they meet for coffee or the stereotypical dinner parties or understand each other so well that they don’t need to meet at all to know what to do – the ideal self-managed conspiracy. John Wilson London NW3 Roy Hattersley rightly argues that Labour needs “politicians of principle to defend their aims and values” and that “politicians have a duty to defend their beliefs”. Would these be the same politicians whose principles and sense of duty compelled them to acquiesce meekly to the democratic claims of a referendum corrupted by lies and misinformation and submit to a will of the people that is nowhere coherently articulated, yet whose expression may, supposedly, be uncontroversially derived from an absurdly reductionist binary? Stuart Parker Rotherham A few days after the 2010 election, I joined the Labour party. My branch, Crouch End, in Haringey, north London, was moribund: there were no meetings, we had no MP and no councillors. A young climate change activist, Natan Doron, was almost singlehandedly trying to rebuild the party. Five years later, we had an MP and three councillors – Natan, Jason Arthur, a black teacher who had grown up on a council estate, and Sarah Elliott, who had defected to us from the Lib Dems. Their service has been exemplary and it is with sadness that we have observed in recent months how divided and factional Haringey Labour has become. That winning team and the branch and CLP officers who got them elected have been forced out, democratically, of course, but, because of a loophole in the rules, Momentum has been able to campaign for its candidates for months, while sitting councillors were forbidden from contacting members until four days before the selection meeting. We are now in the position where we have a council candidate living nowhere near the Crouch End ward (which voted nearly 80% Remain) who has tweeted that “liberal Remoaners are capitalist stooges”. It will be instructive to see how such Dave Spartisms go down with voters in May and whether the new regime will take aim next at the disloyalty of our excellent MP, Catherine West, who defied the leader’s three-line whip to vote against article 50.

That is what being in the audience during Stormzy’s set at Glastonbury felt like. He seemed to perform the whole thing in a state of stunned disbelief: at the size of the crowd he’d drawn; at the vociferousness of their reaction; at how obviously he held them under his sway, so that the minute he mentioned a moshpit one erupted in front of the stage. But for all his incredulity, you could see why Stormzy has ended up grime’s biggest breakout star. He was both magnetic and appealingly gangly; he radiated charisma and everyman charm. He gave an angry, impassioned speech about the “fuckery” of the Grenfell Tower fire. He seemed like the right pop star for now. When he played Shut Up, the crowd around me erupted into delirium. I didn’t witness another piece of music have that extreme an effect on an audience for the whole weekend; doubtless there were pockets of Foo Fighters fans driven to a similar ecstatic madness by their interminable headlining set, but I didn’t see it. I started thinking about my daughter, about how much she loves this song, about the startled laughter and conspiratorial don’t-mention-this-to-mum glance that passed between us the first time we listened to it together and it got to the end, which I’d completely forgotten about: “Shut your stupid fucking mouths, chatting bare fucking shit, shut the fuck up.” And I started thinking about the weird journey that particular three minutes of music has been on over the last two years: a freestyle over an eight-year-old underground instrumental, filmed in a South London park, filled with references to grime-scene beefs. It wasn’t made for 11-year-girls to dance around the kitchen to, or for vast crowds at festivals to sing along with. But that’s exactly where it’s ended up: a perfect, joyous example of the transformative power of pop. Rag’n’Bone Man Genuine respect from Pink Earlier this year I was in Paris doing a radio event. Radio events are kind of shit sometimes. It’s an audience of people that have won a competition to come to a gig and it wasn’t just me playing, it was other artists as well, so they’re not necessarily a fan of you – sometimes it can be a bit dry. This time it was Pink playing with me and a few French artists in a really small venue called l’Elysée Montmartre – that was nice because Pink pretty much only plays arenas and stadiums. I brought my missus and my little boy, because my missus is a big fan of Pink – she was way more bothered about seeing Pink than seeing my concert. We warmed up backstage and did our set, and then I was at the side of the stage when she came on singing my song. I was like: “It’s fucking Pink, singing your song!” She sang Human – obviously it’s probably the only song of mine she knows. Afterwards, she saw me at the side of the stage and gave me a bow. It was really nice, a genuine connection: I thought, she’s a worldwide superstar and she thinks I’m good. Me and my missus were looking at each other, like “this is my life now – shit like this happens”. She was a bit starstruck – I think she’s still a bit starstruck now. Charli XCX Feeling the pain of Agony by Yung Lean I was on a plane – I don’t even know where I was going to be honest, but flying somewhere – and Agony by Yung Lean came on. This was at a time, which I’m still very much in, where I was feeling very lost and alone. It’s him just singing at a piano and then a kids’ choir comes in. It’s so different, really pure and so emotional. We used to know each other but I haven’t seen him for years, and I really felt his pain in this song. Obviously, I’m really lucky to do what I do and travel so much, but it does definitely take its toll. Recently, I’ve been going at 100, not really doing things that I even want to do that much. Sometimes you can’t really help feeling like you’re on this ride that you can’t get off. That was part of it. There was a little bit of other stuff – I’m somebody who’s always grasping for misery. The song really amplified that and made it feel OK for a minute. It’s not a happy song, it didn’t make me feel better or anything like that, but now it always makes me feel the same way: calm but also very emotional, and empty – three great states. Tim Jonze An enraged Marc Almond I’d like to think I’ve had more meaningful musical moments this year; I’ve certainly had more enjoyable ones. But meeting Marc Almond for about six minutes back in August is the one that sticks in my mind. We were supposed to be meeting for a Guardian Culture webchat, a regular feature in which readers post questions and an artist answers them live. They’re usually pretty relaxed. Almond, however, was not – he was terse and distracted over some aspect of his stage production. Still, I thought, once he sees the questions from readers he’ll come around – there were hundreds of them, covering everything from his avant-garde influences to his new covers album, via his version of The Days of Pearly Spencer (which I was planning on telling him had been one of the first singles I ever bought on CD). Wrong again. After fetching him a drink, I found Almond pacing around the room, theatrically announcing that he simply could not tolerate this any longer. “These questions are facile! It’s like the 80s all over again! They’re not taking me seriously!” I tried to explain to Marc that he could just skip the sillier ones and focus instead on the numerous ones about his artistic process, but to no avail. “I mean, what is this?” he exclaimed, prodding the print-out of questions. “DO I LIKE ALMONDS?” With that, he stormed out. A colleague told me he’d spotted Almond outside, still enraged at the nut-based line of questioning, and tried to persuade him give the webchat another go. He was unsuccessful, which was probably for the best – I’m not sure how Almond would have survived the question that lurked on the other side of the page: “Would you ever consider becoming Marc Marzipan or are you scared of the process?” Craig David Connecting with new fans Last year, when I performed on the Sonic stage, I thought I’d experienced my Glastonbury moment; I never thought the next year I’d get the call-up to be on the Pyramid stage. It was unreal. There was such a widespread demographic of people in the crowd, ones who would have been there when I released my first album Born to Do It back in 2000, and then there was a younger generation who had only just discovered my music. After I finished my set, I was walking back to the dressing room area and two young boys, they must have been about seven or eight years old, ran up to me, proper excited, and asked for a selfie. It quite overwhelming to think I was even on their radar at their age. I always felt like I could write a song, and I hoped that people who grew up with my music would love the new music, and if nothing else they would love some of the throwback stuff from the earlier albums. But I heard kids saying: “Have you heard of this new guy called Craig David, he’s got this song called When the Bassline Drops,” and I’m thinking: “Wow, ‘new guy’!” That was pretty cool. Success is almost better the second time round, because you have all the wisdom of what you learned before, and you realise what’s really important. Harriet Gibsone The magic of Frank Ocean At the risk of disrespecting the thousands of teenagers in attendance at Lovebox 2017, the hour I waited for Frank Ocean’s headline set felt like being trapped inside an episode of Sun, Sex and Suspicious Parents. Only minus the suspicious parents – a bollocking by a disappointed mum might have come in handy, actually. Essentially it was just lots of very sweaty hammered people, shouting, pushing and licking each other. Someone even stole the straw from my drink. Bad energy all round. It should have been a toxic setting for a rare sighting of music’s most enigmatic performer, all sunburned flesh and mad eyes. What happened next was a miracle. Within seconds Ocean had pacified the hundreds of fans in my periphery. He didn’t even play the hits, instead choosing interludes, extended versions – the soulful Stevie Wonder odyssey he took Good Guy on being the specific musical highlight of 2017 – two different takes on Thinking Bout You and a couple of songs that he had released digitally a few weeks earlier. No Pyramids, or Sweet Life. Just the ghostly, modernist orchestrations from Blonde performed by Ocean, guitarist Alex G and two other guys I don’t know the name of. He turned the stage into a bedroom jam session, and in the process enhanced his lyrics about awkward nights out, loneliness and the temperamental navigation of your early 20s. Here were songs we had consumed and interpreted in the privacy of our headphones – with their shifts from dream-like nonsense to explicit pleas – now being interpreted live, with a gloriously cathartic communality. Bathed in celestial floodlights, the crowd that I hated with such vitriol at the start of this experience had evolved into rounded emotional beings. With mad eyes. Michael Hann Transported by the Hold Steady I went to Brooklyn to see all four nights of the Hold Steady’s pre-Christmas residency at the Brooklyn Bowl. During a pre-show Q&amp;A, Rolling Stone’s Rob Sheffield told the audience the band had changed his life, and I rolled my eyes. A middle-aged man saying a rock group had changed his life! How ridiculous! I held that thought for seconds, before it was replaced with the certainty that, well, they really had changed my life. Why else would I be in a club in the late afternoon, still badly hungover from last night’s show, watching them play songs I’d heard them perform dozens of times before? I am not, as my wife will attest, a socially comfortable man. I find talking to strangers, generally, to be an ordeal. But over those four nights, I felt like a different person. I instigated conversations (perhaps helped by pints of frozen margarita) with people who, like me, had spent a huge amount of money not just to see the shows, but to celebrate a community. On the Sunday afternoon after the final show, I joined the Hold Steady’s singer, Craig Finn, in his local bar to watch the Minnesota Vikings. The place was full of his fans who had turned up for a last beer or five before heading off to airports and stations. Each got a hug, and a thanks for coming. Each departed knowing, as I did, that we had all been part of something bigger. And that is music’s greatest gift. Faris Badwan, the Horrors A gender and musical transition My friend Sophie, the electronic producer, and I have known each other since we were 12 – we grew up very close to each other near Northampton. Sophie was the person who first played me David Bowie; she also gave me the first Pixies album. We would swap a lot of records, and we didn’t know that many people who were into the same kind of music. As we got older we lost touch for a few years, and then the next thing I heard from Sophie she was making this completely crazy electronic music that sounded unlike anything else I’d ever heard. We started doing a few things together – we wrote and produced a couple of songs for a band called Let’s Eat Grandma, which are going to come out next year. Recently, Sophie transitioned to become a woman. She released a song called It’s Okay to Cry, and it almost marked the beginning of her new life. It’s the first time you can actually hear her voice properly. The actual music was so moving, and really unusual. I think artists should always challenge themselves and others, and Sophie has done it in a totally unique and brave way. It’s such a crazy thing to watch someone you’ve known for your whole life go through such extreme changes and to come out the other side so much happier. It’s really moving, knowing how challenging that must have been. Sam Richards The Scott Walker Prom Sometimes the Proms’ efforts to reel in classical-music sceptics have been hamfisted; last year’s Bowie Prom was proof that you can’t just slap an orchestra on something, rope in a few random guest singers, and expect it to fly. But this year’s Scott Walker Prom was different – the songs on his four extraordinary self-titled solo albums, released after the breakup of the Walker Brothers in the late 1960s, were already wonderfully orchestrated. This was an unashamed wallow in a world long gone, but what a wallow. Jarvis Cocker was the first of the guest singers to take the stage – he couldn’t sing like Scott, of course, but there was no doubting that he felt every word of Boy Child and Plastic Palace People, two of Walker’s most painfully wistful songs, about the selfishness of dreams versus the drudgery of reality. In whispering the latter song’s poignant final words – “Just hanging there, just hanging there” – his faltering voice was perfect. Scott himself was apparently in attendance, although no one I spoke to could make a positive ID. It seems unlikely he will ever perform live himself again, so this may be the closest we’ll get to experiencing his genius in the flesh. Dave Simpson The power of the sea We used to holiday in the west-coast seaside resort of Blackpool every year. I remember ice creams and donkey rides and the “little dipper” ride (I wasn’t old enough for the bigger version). After Dad died when I was six, we kept going for a while. I felt closer to him there than anywhere. I went back to Blackpool this year for a piece on music in seaside towns, and the young grime MC Afghan Dan told me how deprivation, lack of opportunities and drug abuse had wreaked havoc on the place: “It’s still a postcard seaside resort, but behind the seafront, things are bad.” He told me about his troubles and described how, when things got on top of him, he would head down to the beach and stare at the sea. Later, down on the sand, listening to Afghan’s brilliant track Blackpool describe this experience (“Grab my coat and head for the beach / Stare out to the sea / Shove my earphones in / Phone on silent and that’s me”), I suddenly remembered my dad on our last holiday, staring wistfully into the waves. The following year, as a small boy, I’d done the same, perhaps hoping that if I stared hard enough, he’d come back. Now, I started wondering what it was about the sea that could provide such powerful comfort to a dying tax collector, a mourning child and a grime MC, decades apart. Perhaps the feeling of a timeless force that will be here long after any of us renders everything else insignificant, and somehow that makes everything OK. I started picturing thousands of men, women and children, who must have gazed out in the same way over centuries. And somewhere among them, I saw my Dad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/08/william-h-gass-author-dies-aged-93-tunnel-omensetters-luck","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T14:33:08Z","webTitle":"US author William H Gass dies aged 93","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/08/william-h-gass-author-dies-aged-93-tunnel-omensetters-luck","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/08/william-h-gass-author-dies-aged-93-tunnel-omensetters-luck","fields":{"headline":"US author William H Gass dies aged 93","bodyText":"The US author William H Gass, who explored the boundaries of fiction in novels such as The Tunnel and Omensetter’s Luck, has died at the age of 93. Gass passed away on Wednesday at his home in Missouri, Penguin Random House announced, describing him as “a leading experimental writer, known for abandoning traditional narrative”, and highlighting his influence on writers including Jonathan Safran Foer and David Foster Wallace. Gass published his first novel, Omensetter’s Luck, in 1966. Set in Ohio in the 1890s, it charts the confrontation between a man of great goodness and a crazed preacher. The New Republic called it “the most important work of fiction by an American in this literary generation”, while Gass’s publisher said it was “now a classic in American literature”. Wallace found it to be of the “direly underappreciated” US novels of the late 20th century, describing Gass’s writing as “bleak but gorgeous, like light through ice”. For the next 30 years, Gass taught in the philosophy department at Washington University, writing criticism and short fiction while working on his masterpiece, The Tunnel. Published in 1995, it followed the story of a professor at a Midwestern university involved in writing a history of the Third Reich, as well as a history of himself, as he begins digging a tunnel out of his own basement. It won Gass the American Book award. The writer’s friend Stephen Schenkenberg, editor of the website Reading William Gass, told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that “his seemed like a landmark mind”. “I have a hard time thinking there is another intellectual figure who married a deep connection with literature with a bottomless interest in philosophy … and music and photography and architecture,” said Schenkenberg. This breadth saw three of Gass’s collections of criticism take National Books Critics Circle awards, in 1985, 1996 and 2002. In his 1970 essay Philosophy and the Form of Fiction, Gass coined the term “metafiction” to characterise the work of Borges, Barth and Flann O’Brien, describing it as writing “in which the forms of fiction serve as the material upon which further forms can be imposed”. Interrogating structure was part and parcel of his own work too. In his 1997 essay collection Finding a Form, Gass declared: “My stories are malevolently anti-narrative, and my essays are maliciously anti-expository, but the ideology of my opposition arrived long after my antagonism had become a trait of character.” In 1990, he founded the International Writers Center at Washington University, before retiring from teaching in 1999. The PEN/Nabokov lifetime achievement award followed a year later, but Gass continued to write. His final novel, Middle C, was published in 2013, with a collection of short stories, Eyes, appearing two years later. Writing in the Guardian, Seth Colter Walls suggested: “At 91 years of age, Gass remains anything but accepting of our world as it is.” “Whether you consider him the last modernist or one of the postmodernists,” Walls continued, “you can’t deny the fundamentally tricky nature of Gass’s fiction … though what can pull you through – especially during a mystifying first reading – is the rhythmic verve of Gass’s sentences.” A collection of tips for writers published in the same year saw Gass advising: “Stay away from the machinery of the modern world. It will ruin your imagination. It will shape a heart break and make demands of their own kinds.” And: “Try to remember that artists in these catastrophic times, along with the serious scientists, are the only salvation for us, if there is to be any. Be happy because no one is seeing what you do, no one is listening to you, no one really cares what may be achieved, but sometimes accidents happen and beauty is born.” Despite Gass’s ambivalence about the messy business of connecting with an audience, his wife, Mary Henderson Gass, told the St-Louis Post Dispatch the author had been corresponding with friends this autumn. He was “honoured to be associated with the best writers, ones that he admired”, she said. “That was his aspiration – to contribute something to the greater world of literature.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/08/who-are-charities-supporting-2017-charity-appeal-depaul-uk-naccom-centrepoint","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T13:00:03Z","webTitle":"Who are the charities we're supporting with our 2017 charity appeal?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/08/who-are-charities-supporting-2017-charity-appeal-depaul-uk-naccom-centrepoint","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/08/who-are-charities-supporting-2017-charity-appeal-depaul-uk-naccom-centrepoint","fields":{"headline":"Who are the charities we're supporting with our 2017 charity appeal?","bodyText":"The Guardian and Observer 2017 charity appeal is supporting three charities working with young homeless people and asylum seekers, refugees and migrants facing destitution. Here’s a brief guide to what they do. Depaul UK Depaul UK is a national charity that works to end homelessness and change the lives of those affected by it. Its services include supported housing for homeless young people, family mediation, and leading the Nightstop emergency accommodation network across the UK. Nightstop operates in 34 towns and cities, giving young people a safe place to stay for the night in the spare room of volunteer hosts. Last year the Nightstop network gave 1,390 young people in desperate need a safe place to stay for the night. For many Nightstop guests, their first night in a volunteer’s home is the beginning of their journey out of homelessness as staff work to find safe and sustainable long-term accommodation following their stay. Depaul UK provides support with getting into education, training and employment for all the young people who live in its supported accommodation to help them rebuild their lives. Depaul UK helped 3,107 young people last year but the demand for new services is great. The No Accommodation Network (Naccom) Naccom’s mission is to end destitution among asylum seekers, refugees and migrants with no recourse to public funds living in the UK. It helps member organisations to develop their services and advocate for changes in the system. The network includes more than 40 full-member charities and projects that provide accommodation (including housing, night shelters and hosting schemes) to people who cannot access mainstream support and accommodation. In the last year it accommodated 1,907 people. Naccom will use its share of the Guardian and Observer appeal donations to capacity-build the network and support frontline projects via a selective grants process that will be open to its full members. Members are supported to gather and share data and stories that illustrate the extent and impact of destitution and the positive outcomes that can be achieved. Naccom works with others to ensure collaborative working where appropriate and shared learning across the wider homelessness and refugee and migrant sectors. Centrepoint Centrepoint is the UK’s leading charity for homeless young people. It supports more than 9,200 16- to 25-year-olds each year. It works directly in London, Yorkshire, Manchester and the north-east of England, and partners with other organisations across the UK. It provides a range of accommodation services for young people depending on their needs, including specialist services for single parents, young people leaving care and those escaping violence and abuse. Centrepoint aims to give young people the skills and resilience they need to live independently. The charity employs a team of counsellors and therapists to support young people with mental health and wellbeing issues. It runs healthy living and nutrition workshops and a sports programme to inspire confidence and positive change in young people. Young people are helped to enter or continue with education, training and employment, with support tailored to their needs. It works with young people to influence government policy with the overall aim of ending youth homelessness.

Both Douvan and Un De Sceaux, last year’s winner and his stable companion at the Willie Mullins yard, were missing from the list when the final declarations for the race were made this morning. Initially, there were just four runners declared for the Tingle Creek, a race with a prize fund of £150,000: Ar Mad, Fox Norton, Politologue and Sir Valentino. As a result, it was reopened from 10am until 10.30am and in the absence of Mullins’s entries, it swiftly attracted another three contenders: Charbel, Ordinary World and San Benedeto. Mullins has said this morning that he was “not entirely happy” with Douvan after he did some light work on Thursday, and that no decision has been made on when the star two-mile chaser will make his seasonal debut. On Thursday’s cards, Coeur Blimey (2.05), who is by Winged Love out of Eastender, has more than just a splendid name to recommend him in the two-mile handicap hurdle at Wincanton, not least if he can bring a little extra polish to his jumping on his second start of the season. Sue Gardner’s gelding had enough talent to win a Listed bumper back in December 2015 but not for the first time, there were several mistakes scattered throughout his run into fifth place in a decent race on his handicap debut at Cheltenham last time. He is still a novice this season, and while there were 18 opponents to worry about last time out, he should get more time to measure his hurdles in today’s smaller field. He races off the same mark of 121 here and normal improvement from his first start in 320 days will take him very close. Pink Gin (1.35) made a very solid return to action on heavy ground at Ffos Las last month in a time that suggests he should go well in Wincanton’s feature event, the Silver Buck Handicap Chase. Clondaw Cian (1.55) is the outsider of three at Market Rasen but does not have much to find to be a big player against the favourite Barney Dwan, while Alpine Secret (1.45) makes most appeal on the card at Leicester. The best bet of the day, though, could be this evening at Chelmsford City, where Sibilance (7.00) returns to the all-weather with a record of two wins from two starts on Polytrack and a very workable mark of 88, given the strong company she has been keeping on turf over the summer.

Entrepreneurs aged over 50 employed more people than start-ups run by younger individuals for the first time in 2016, the research found. The trend is likely to continue: the number of over-50s in work is rapidly increasing and those aged over 50 are expected to dominate the self-employed workforce in the UK by 2024. On current trends, this gap will widen over time. “With low productivity continuing to affect many areas of the economy, the message from our research is clear: rather than being a drain on the economy, the over-50s are becoming increasingly important drivers of the UK’s economic growth,” said Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital UK, which commissioned the research. “This age group is setting up and running their own businesses at a faster rate than any other age group, directly employing nearly 10 million people, 2 million more than the under-50s. This gap is only set to widen,” he added. “If we are to rebalance our economy, it is essential that we find more ways to support their economic ambitions.” The data suggests that an increasing number of 50- to 64-year-olds choose not to retire and instead stay active in the labour market, with the rate of employment rising between 2012 and 2016 from around 65% to 71%. CEBR projections show that the number of employed 50- to 64-year-olds will exceed 9 million before the end of 2018. By 2021 there will be 10 million in work. Simon Heyworth, 66, established his reputation in sound mastering at Virgin, then a relatively new music label. He worked as co-producer of Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells and has worked with music legends including Brian Eno, King Crimson, Imogen Heap, Marillion, Nick Drake and Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle. In the summer of 2002 – aged 51 – Heyworth set up his own audio mastering studio in Devon: Super Audio Mastering. “I have never thought of retiring – I can’t afford it – and so when London got too expensive and we moved to Devon, I set up a new business here without giving a second thought to my age,” he said. “The benefit of starting one’s own business later in life is that you bring a wealth of experience and knowledge with you that takes years to build up,” he added. There are a number of reasons why older people turn to self-employment. Older workers can be edged out of employment and find it hard to find new work. Alternatively, older people in employment might feel they have accrued enough expertise to realise a long-held ambition of starting their own business. But Kay Daniel Neufeld, senior economist at CEBR and author of the report, said the growing reliance on older generations to drive prosperity could cause concerns among policymakers looking to incentivise younger prospective business leaders to grow their own ventures. “Self-employment among the over-50s has risen much more quickly than it has for younger cohorts, driven by demographic factors such as the rising average age of UK workers, as well as structural changes in the labour market,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/12/the-best-tv-shows-2017-no-6-mindhunter","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T06:00:25Z","webTitle":"The 50 best TV shows of 2017: No 6 Mindhunter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/12/the-best-tv-shows-2017-no-6-mindhunter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/12/the-best-tv-shows-2017-no-6-mindhunter","fields":{"headline":"The 50 best TV shows of 2017: No 6 Mindhunter","bodyText":"For a show about some of the 20th-century’s bloodiest murderers, Mindhunter doesn’t have that much blood. Or murder, for that matter. Instead, Netflix’s best drama focuses on the birth of criminal profiling in late-70s America. Produced by Charlize Theron and David Fincher – who directed a handful of episodes (as did Asif Kapadia and Borgen writer Tobias Lindholm) – Mindhunter tells the story of two FBI officers awakening to the idea of using the minds of real-life monsters such as Jerry Brudos and Richard Speck to stop similar crimes happening in the future. Fincher isn’t actually the showrunner of Mindhunter (although squint and you’re in Zodiac). That job belongs to British writer Joe Penhall, last seen adapting the Kinks’ songs for the stage in jukebox musical Sunny Afternoon. Penhall took agent John E Douglas’s 1995 book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI’s Elite Serial Crime Unit and used it to recount the invention of serial killing. Well, the term at least. What’s surprising to a modern viewer is that the notion of a serial killer didn’t even exist in 1977. At one point, we see Jonathan Groff’s wide-eyed Holden Ford and his colleagues Bill Tench (Holt McCallany) and Anna Torv’s psychology professor Wendy Carr suggesting alternative terms to use. Pattern killer, perhaps? Groff’s performance is as inspired as it is unusual. We’re used to TV murder detectives being as gritty and damaged as their prey – but Ford is such a milk-drinking ingenue that there’s a recurring joke in the series that no one can believe he was born in New York. From listening to the actor explain it in interviews, he was as surprised as anyone when Fincher flew him out to LA at the end of his stage-stealing turn as catty George III in Hamilton to offer him the part. Groff’s career so far – from Glee to HBO’s Looking and Disney’s Frozen – doesn’t necessarily point towards a show in which a man masturbates into a pair of high heels. But Groff is superb. Weird. Watchable. It’s a multicolour performance almost alien to its grim, grey surroundings. Mindhunter may be sold as a drama about serial killers. But it’s as much about Holden Ford’s relationships. With those rapists and murderers, sure, but also with Tench, with his cynical FBI colleagues and with his girlfriend, Debbie (Hannah Gross). But the central pairing, and certainly the creepiest, may be the bromance (of sorts) between Ford and Ed Kemper. Kemper, as serial killer enthusiasts may already know, is the intelligent, 6ft 9 Californian necrophiliac who murdered his grandparents, mother, mother’s friend and six female students before engaging in acts more despicable than even the darkest mind could conjure. He confessed before the police could catch him. The “Co-ed Killer” is played terrifyingly by the previously unknown Cameron Britton. We watch Ford and Kemper initially dance around each other before establishing a curious bond. One that proves highly useful for their work, but which takes an increasingly emotional toll on the FBI man as the series goes on. There is a risk that Mindhunter could turn into a Who’s Who of infamous American murderers – which monster is it this week? – but that is quickly offset by a format that leaps and weaves. Some weeks we’re in procedural mode, others we’re meeting a murderer and in others we’re exploring Ford and Tench’s screwed-up home lives. The fluidity of streaming allows episode lengths to vary to fit. There’s even a largely silent pre-credits storyline centred on a man about to kill, of whom we know nothing beyond the fact that he’s in Park City, Kansas (I’ve been reluctant to Google the real-life details for fear of “spoilers”). That’s all to be continued – Netflix has renewed the show for a second series. Thank goodness. You’d kill for more.

Where Jack Thorne in the current Old Vic production seeks to explain the source of Scrooge’s misanthropy, David Edgar at Stratford lays stress on Dickens’s anger at social evils. There is room for both but, in the end, I prefer the Old Vic version simply because it has more heart. Edgar, who famously adapted Nicholas Nickleby for the RSC, has had the ingenious idea of making Dickens himself and his editor, John Forster, part of the story. Dickens’s fury at the exploitation of child labour is changed from a tract into a tale only at Forster’s prompting. As the story proceeds, the two men turn from observers into participants, with Dickens taking the role of the young Scrooge at the Fezziwigs’ ball. Dickens even explains to Forster, who would surely have known already, that his childhood experience in the blacking factory could easily have turned him into a robber or vagabond. But, while the presence of Dickens and Forster as quasi-Brechtian commentators reinforces the political message, it also prevents the story gaining its usual unstoppable momentum. There is still much to savour in Rachel Kavanaugh’s fluidly staged production. At one point, Scrooge genuinely seems to put a hand through the spectral Marley’s midriff. Scrooge’s fourposter levitates, like Aladdin’s magic carpet, as the old miser is taken on a night-time whistle-stop tour of sea and land. Stephen Brimson Lewis’s design and Tim Mitchell’s lighting also move skilfully between Technicolor abundance, as in the feast that surrounds the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the monochrome bleakness of drab Victorian tenements. Phil Davis is a very good Scrooge: a dumpy, stumpy figure who seems clenched in misery before he undergoes a transformation that allows him to radiate grotesque, Malvolio-like smiles. John Hodgkinson as Mr Fezziwig has such ebullience that you can believe his calves, as Dickens says, shine like moons. Vivien Parry and Brigid Zengeni make suitably haunting ghosts, and Nicholas Bishop and Beruce Khan as Dickens and Forster keep us duly informed. Catherine Jayes’s music mixes trad and modern, the staging is lively and Dickens’s message about the need to treat poverty as a rectifiable evil rather than a moral failing comes through loud and clear. Yet, for all the political urgency, I never once cried as I did at the Old Vic. A Christmas Carol is at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 4 February.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said that while the officer’s comments could have constituted misconduct, they were not made maliciously and came in the context of what it characterised as a lengthy, good-natured exchange during an appropriate traffic stop. After pulling over DMO Deejay near Piccadilly in central London in January, the Metropolitan police officer told him: “This isn’t racist, it’s a fact. Predominantly, the criminal profile of people who [commit robberies in the area] are black people. “So, naturally, if you see a car full of black lads, maybe dressed in gangster-style clothing or whatever, when they’re driving down there, they’re getting stopped.” The incident was caught on camera and the video showed the officer saying: “We work on criminal profiles. Unfortunately, here, the criminal profile for robberies – what we suspect – is IC3 males, generally from Somalia.” IC3 is the police identity code for black people. The IPCC said it sought to establish whether or not the officer’s comments were appropriate or his actions discriminatory, as well as why the car was stopped. After completing the independent investigation on Thursday, the commission said its lead investigator had “concluded that the comments made about ‘criminal profiling’ could constitute misconduct. However, in the context of the entire 16-minute conversation, they did not appear to be directed at the man maliciously”. It found no evidence that the comments were “intentionally discriminatory or targeted”. The IPCC said the stop had been carried out after the car was spotted changing lanes “randomly without indicating” and was appropriate. Scotland Yard said the officer had received management action and accepted that his language was clumsy. Therefore, the IPCC said, “it was agreed there will be no further action”. DMO Deejay did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. But speaking to the Guardian in January, he said he posted the video online to raise awareness, adding that he wanted to work with police. “I said maybe we can sit down and look at how they are profiling people, and see if we can come to a resolution. They said they wanted to work alongside me, so at least I can get something out of it,” he said. “It’s frustrating and embarrassing, especially if there’s other people around, because it draws attention to you. If you see a police officer with somebody, you automatically think negative things, don’t you? I’ve come to a point where I’ve lost trust in the police because I don’t know what they’re thinking.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/13/the-best-albums-of-2017-no-8-thundercat-drunk","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"The best albums of 2017, No 8: Thundercat – Drunk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/13/the-best-albums-of-2017-no-8-thundercat-drunk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/13/the-best-albums-of-2017-no-8-thundercat-drunk","fields":{"headline":"The best albums of 2017, No 8: Thundercat – Drunk","bodyText":"When the world outside is weird, let’s hear it for an album that processes it with absurdist humour and George Clinton-shaped surrealism. Drunk is the third release by LA jazz dude Steve Bruner, AKA Thundercat, and has finally taken him from being a kooky bass-playing Robin to super-producer Flying Lotus’s Batman all the way to headline solo artist and one of this year’s breakthrough names. It says a lot of his credentials that he convinced soft-rock heavyweights Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins to appear on an album that features fart noises and song dedicated to a pet puss called Turbo Tron Over 9000 Baby Jesus Sally. Or that Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell Williams, Kamasi Washington and Wiz Khalifa guest star. But this 23-track odyssey has also punctured mainstream consciousness because it’s deliriously funky. It turns out that it helps to have slap bass when tackling the confusion of existence. Drunk busts open the Alice in Wonderland door to Bruner’s unsettled psyche and attempts to furrow a trail through consciousness and conscience. The idea, he says, was to express “the dizziness of what we’re dealing with now” – inspired in part by his Grammy-winning work on Lamar’s protest album To Pimp a Butterfly in 2015 – and whether you’re better off coping with it baked or awake. And so the musical mind-soup of spacey soul, stoner R&amp;B, electro-synth and jazz improv flickers with reflections on police brutality (Jameel’s Space Ride), masculinity and gang culture (Walk on By), mortality (Lava Lamp) and, on The Turn Down, America’s race versus class war. Yet at the same time, Bruner emerges as an endearing dreamer who finds respite in comic books and computer games. Perhaps it’s to be expected of an artist who collected the aforementioned Grammy while wearing a lightsaber, but, when a lover is being indecisive about coming over on anti-booty call song Friend Zone, he’d “rather play Mortal Kombat anyway” and in Tokyo, he fizzes about how he’s “gonna blow all my cash on anime”. Drunk isn’t just a triumph of eccentricity, though; it’s an achievement in sound, and a psychedelic homage to the Funkadelic, Herbie Hancock and Doobie Brothers’ 1970s. Its standout tracks, such as Show You the Way, I Am Crazy, Inferno and Them Changes, are bathed in soft rock’s incandescent glow, adding sublimely lit melody to Bruner and co-producer Lotus’s cosmic tumble of ideas and lip-curling basslines. This contrast, where feathery falsetto meets squelchy bottom end, gives Drunk its delicious push and pull, between having your head in the clouds and being tugged down to reality. Bruner’s world is brave and new, and it doesn’t claim to have any answers. It’s surely the safest place to be in 2017. (buy here) This article contains affiliate links to products.

It was the work of an artist whose fame had removed her from the world that inspired her debut, a problem that’s bedevilled everyone from umpteen rappers to the Arctic Monkeys’ Alex Turner. “Pretty soon I’ll be getting on my first plane,” she had sung on Tennis Court, a highlight of 2013’s Pure Heroine, shortly before success catapulted Ella Yelich O’Connor away from suburban New Zealand and into a realm where your choice of boyfriend gets you involved in a Twitter spat with Tyler, the Creator and David Bowie takes your hand at a New York party and proclaims you the future of music. Its making involved the singer jettisoning Joel Little, the Kiwi producer and songwriter who co-authored Pure Heroine – he went on to co-write Khalid’s inescapable, platinum-selling Young Dumb &amp; Broke – in favour of a team of more established mainstream pop figures: among them Taylor Swift and Sia collaborator Jack Antonoff; James Ryan Ho, fresh from working on Zayn Malik’s solo album; Kuk Harrell, of Rihanna, Beyoncé and Katy Perry fame. But if Melodrama looked on paper like the work of an artist who’d had her head turned by success – or worse, a concerted effort to make Lorde a more straightforward, less idiosyncratic pop star – it turned out to be anything but. Whatever other impact success may have had on her life, it hasn’t blunted O’Connor’s observation. The songs on Melodrama that depict the messy entanglements of early 20s life are as incisive, perceptive and shudder-inducingly familiar as the sketches of teenage suburbia on its predecessor. For all their acute drawing of hollow relationships and the fleeting pleasures of hedonism, they’re far too witty and self-aware to fall into that baffling, post-Drake trap of carrying on as if everyone should feel terribly sorry for you because you’re going to parties, taking drugs and having sex. The music, meanwhile, demonstrated both O’Connor’s classic melodic facility (the shadow of glam-era Bowie hung over Liability’s beautiful descending chord sequence; Writer in the Dark was that rarest of things, a Kate Bush-influenced song that didn’t make you want to listen to Kate Bush instead) and her ability to twist latter-day pop to her own ends. Supercut, Green Light and Hard Feelings used some of the basic sonic building blocks of mainstream pop – sparse R&amp;B rhythms, house beats and jangling pianos, Giorgio Moroder synths, the pillowy electronic textures of tropical house or Frank Ocean’s emo-soul – but they never sounded quite like anything else in the charts because of the strength of the character at their centre. Melodrama sounded like a uniquely talented artist imposing herself on mainstream pop rather than having mainstream pop imposed on her. It’s worth remembering that the woman who made it is 21 years old. It’s fascinating to think what she might do next. (Buy here) This article contains affiliate links to products.

Michael Buffong’s relocation of this “fable of Broadway” to Harlem may not quite be heaven, but it certainly rocks the boat with its all-black casting, jazz-infused musical inflections, and choreography from Kenrick “H2O” Sandy of Blue Boy Entertainment that plays its ace when it explodes across the stage in the second half’s craps game. Kenneth Tynan described Guys and Dolls as America’s second-best play (he rated Death of a Salesman higher), and that may not be an exaggeration. This generous crowd-pleaser is full of the loveliest tunes, but it is astute about human psychology, and doesn’t shirk the realities of life on the edge and how it turns the down-on-their-luck into dreamers. Ray Fearon’s Nathan Detroit and Lucy Vandi’s Miss Adelaide – who has been waiting 14 years for a wedding ring – are all the more poignant because they are visibly ageing. When Vandi delivers A Person Could Develop a Cold, it’s not only comic but also a tragic lament for the life she might have led. The production substitutes the fairytale neon of Times Square for something grittier but ultimately no less joyous. And indeed, no less colourful: the gamblers in Nathan’s illegal craps game are a bunch of sharp-suited peacocks clad in rainbow hues. Sometimes the evening feels a little underpowered, and while Ako Mitchell’s Nicely Nicely delivers on Sit Down You’re Rocking the Boat, and Joe Speare is comically menacing as Big Jule – a man who refuses to be a loser – some of the dice players need more definition. Not so Ashley Zhangazha’s Sky Masterson, the high roller who takes the bet that he can persuade mission sister Sarah Brown to accompany him on a date to Havana. He begins with such gum-chewing swagger that his unexpected romanticism when surprised by love is all the more delicious. Abiona Omonua has yet to find the warmth beneath Sarah’s steel. Nonetheless, an evening of many captivating charms. Guys and Dolls is at Royal Exchange, Manchester, until 27 January.

On the one hand, there’s the version of him that made the first War on Drugs album, Wagonwheel Blues – a man in thrall to the freewheeling music made by beloved of and made by 70s heads. On the other, there’s the Granduciel who loves the sleek and shiny sounds of 80s pop rock – on second album Slave Ambient, Granduciel hit on the idea of throwing motorik pace and rhythms into his MOR and classic rock mix, and came up with a style he’s been revisiting and redefining ever since. It’s easy to understand why some people who snigger that the War on Drugs sound like Bruce Hornsby and the Range with more guitar solos. (In some ways, Hornsby is an apt comparison – he, too, saw the attractions of slick MOR and the endless jam, and let’s not forget that he played keyboards for the Grateful Dead.) On tracks such as Holding On and Nothing to Find, Granduciel’s gift for melody (which is what brings those big crowds to the shows) is welded to a propulsiveness that summons up the horizon at the end of a long, straight, flat road. But A Deeper Understanding, the band’s fourth album, was more than music for the drive-time hour. Granduciel doesn’t deal in obvious themes, or a clear notion of time or place: the War on Drugs convey a sense of open-endedness, both in the leisurely way the songs unfold and in his lyrics. He doesn’t ever know what he’s writing about until he steps back from the songs. “I don’t think that, in the moment, I’m ever trying to write about anything specific,” he told me earlier this year. The writing on A Deeper Understanding was simply the result of him getting older, and accepting the decisions he had made. That gives the album an air of overwhelming but vague melancholy, the kind we all recognise. Yet for all Granduciel’s well-documented problems with anxiety and depression, it never tips over into anything more disturbing. Instead, the War on Drugs summoned that most delicious of moods: autumnal, slightly hungover, just a little sorry for oneself. The 11 minutes of Thinking of a Place captures that mood perfectly, right down to the solipsism of its refrain: “I’m moving through the dark / Of a long, black night / Just moving with the moon.” Meaningless, but perfect. Nevertheless, there is one nagging question: how long can Granduciel keep this up?

The unusual thing about it was that the dog was dead. “Had our dog turned into a rug when he died,” the ad read. “Treasured family pet. Has to be sold as new dog keeps trying to hump it. Lookin for 100 pound ONO. Very cosy and unusual piece.” Cosy is questionable; unusual was an understatement. Snoopy’s flattened form and smiling face were considered so shocking that editors on the Telegraph and Argus and the Dundee Evening Telegraph put warnings at the top of their stories. By then the ad had already been howled off Facebook and the owner of the dead pet had backed away into anonymity. What do you do with a dead pet? What is the appropriate farewell to these creatures that psychologists call “self-objects”, so familiar they are almost a part of you, sighing sympathetically while you weep, cavorting idiotically, loving you uncritically. How do you cope without the pet whose lifespan encompassed long-outgrown childhoods and that your kids loved sometimes more than they loved their parents? And why, when we make desirable items out of leather, and admire stuffed animals in natural history museums and pass the mounted head of a stag without a second glance, why does turning this pet into an animal skin seem so ... wrong? Psychologists can explain how we love the way a pet offers uncritical, uncalculating affection in an otherwise conditional world. They talk of pets as witnesses to our lives. I’m with them on that. More than a year after the second of our border terriers died, her earthly remains, along with her mother’s from a couple of years earlier, are still boxed up just as they came from the pet crematorium. They live under a chair, out of sight, but not in any way finished with. For a start, we have yet to summon the courage to say goodbye. And we can’t decide how to do it: burial in the garden, or scattering along the way of a favourite walk? Casual and informal, or with readings and tearful recollections? This is what they call disenfranchised grief. Sam Carr, a psychology lecturer at the University of Bath who is interested in animals and attachment theory, says pets are “there in every page of your narrative. When you lose that kind of figure, there’s a trauma.” It is a kind of bereavement, which demands some formal response. But there isn’t one. “I’ve never met anyone who either skinned or stuffed their pet,” says Carr, “but I can imagine it offered some kind of respectful way of commemorating their life, maybe a tribute or a celebration.” George Jamieson, a taxidermist who works near Edinburgh, describes good taxidermy as “a frozen moment. It’s as if the soul of the animal is still there. It’s somewhere between not being able to let go and wanting to keep something of what was.” Jamieson used to stuff pets, but now he finds it’s too intensive, trying to make a realistic portrait of an animal that is already dead. He doesn’t say so, but I’m left with the impression that people who want their dead pets stuffed are psychologically needy in a way that someone who deals with dead animals for a living finds difficult to handle. Victorians loved taxidermy. Death was a daily threat and the death of a loved one commonplace. Sentimentality seems to have been a way of holding fear close in order to control it. Walter Potter’s Museum of Curiosities exhibited homemade anthropomorphic dioramas of stuffed white rabbits dressed as small schoolchildren sitting in rows in a classroom. Others featured kittens at tea and animal weddings. It was a hugely successful visitor attraction in Sussex (and, more recently, at the short-lived Brooklyn Morbid Anatomy Museum). At Bítov Castle in Moravia, whole rooms are dedicated to the deceased pets of the castle’s last owner, Baron Georg Haas. Unlike the clumsy realisations in the Potter museum, the baron’s dogs, mainly terriers, lie heads up, ears cocked, poised to leap up after a rabbit. A pet, by definition, is an animal without a purpose, kept for love and amusement. They have been kept since at least classical times – we know because their lives were recorded on vases and stellae as lovingly then as they are photographed and painted and memorialised now. Pet owners have been chastised for their excessive attention to their pets in the face of the suffering of the world for just as long. And the negotiation between the pet as an animal (and therefore a creature without a soul, ultimately lesser than a human) and the pet as a family member, which is part of the everyday business of being a pet owner, isn’t resolved by the pet’s death. Yet there has never been any cultural accommodation with the peculiar nature of our attachment to some animals and not others. Most western thought divides all humans from all animals. So although it is widely acknowledged that we can love animals as much as or even more than humans, western society has never developed cultural forms that help us to manage the trauma of animal loss. On the whole, pet lovers who do anything choose burial. Some people really splash out. Pet cemeteries’ offers range from statues and trees to online tribute sites. Frederick the Great, the Prussian enlightenment monarch, built himself a summer palace at Potsdam, where he buried his beloved greyhounds and marked their lives with exquisite calligraphy on marble tablets, and when he died he was buried with them. Peggy Guggenheim, one of the few people since who could match both Frederick’s wealth and his love for his dogs, is interred with her terriers at her Venice palazzo. There is even the “undeath” option: a cloning service is now available in South Korea. More often, though, people try to cheat the fact of death by preserving the likeness of the living. Ronald, the horse that carried Lord Cardigan in the charge of the Light Brigade, has been split up into four feet (inkwells scattered around stately homes in Britain) while his head and tail remain at his master’s home, Deene Park. But something about our sensitivities has changed. The animal rug – let’s call it the Dundee option – is now on the outer edge of commonplace. Although not as far out as the Dutch artist Bart Jansen, who turned his dead cat, Orville, into a drone. Jansen insists he loved his cat, and denies there was an element of revenge in turning him into furry drone even though, when thwarted, Orville was a biter. About the same time as Snoopy went on sale in Dundee, I found an exquisite, unmarked kingfisher that must have flown into a window. The russet and turquoise streak that I have only glimpsed once or twice on the periphery of my vision was lying just outside my house. The desire to preserve it was overwhelming – not an image, but the creature itself, so rarely seen and still more rarely touched. Without really thinking, I found a taxidermist nearby and delivered the small body into her freezer, from where at sometime in the future I hope it will be resurrected. This, I realise, is what Damien Hirst meant when he called his shark the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living. Hirst is not the only contemporary artist who is fascinated by the dead/aliveness represented by taxidermy. Nature morte, the French expression for still life, works better as a literal translation. The artist Polly Morgan uses taxidermy to explore what was called in one of her exhibitions “the poetics of strangeness”. She and Hirst were both represented in a show of 18 contemporary artists in Rhode Island last year. Of course, they used wild animals. We may try to avoid thinking about the reality of stuffing a wild animal, but it is not – yet – an uncomfortable idea. My stuffed kingfisher will not shock. According to Clare Fowler, the taxidermist I took my kingfisher to, people who want their pets stuffed often come to her as I did, in a state of unanticipated bereavement. She thinks that taxidermy serves as a waypost in the process of grieving. The ones who call her in advance – she works in deep, rural Dorset – because they are going to have their pet put down, usually change their minds after they have understood what taxidermy entails. The day I go, she is working on an old lady’s pet cat, the second she has done for this client. It lies on her workbench – or at least the cat’s head, still attached to its empty skin, lies there looking mildly surprised. Fowler will make a fibreglass mould from the body that the fur once encased, and then, after preserving the skin, stretch it back over the artificial form. This one will be a sleeping cat. “I like to do them sleeping. It looks passive, and I think it’s less difficult for the psyche. Sleeping ones are lovely and most people agree and go with it.” Not all pet owners want a grief object. Fowler has mounted the head of a young man’s terrier on a shield. It was an unusual request, but it didn’t upset her. “Some people would be shocked, but no one would think twice about a deer or a game animal. I do get a few people attacking me on Facebook. But people want it done. And I love animals. I think they [her critics] must think I’ve skinned them alive or something, but I love fur and feather and this is about keeping that beauty.” Her worst experience was a woman who first arranged for her cat to be stuffed and then asked her to take it out of the storage freezer and thaw it because she had bought a magical incantation on the internet that was guaranteed to bring it back to life. It didn’t work. And then there was Elfie. Elfie was a cat who was fulfilling an important attachment role for her two owners, Rachel and Matthew, whose relationship was going through a rough patch. Elfie was killed on the road when Matthew was caring for her. “I thought, what would Rach want – I know, I’ll get her stuffed.” The news of Elife’s death was broken to Rachel. In secret, Elfie’s unscathed body was rushed into a freezer, and then transported in an insulated box to Fowler in Dorset. Nine months later, the job was done. By then Rachel and Matthew were happily back together, and Rachel knew about the preservation project. “Rach was over the moon,” according to Matthew, and – this must be why they are together – she says: “I thought it was the most romantic thing ever.” The not-dead Elfie sits alert at the top of the stairs. “She’s been through it a bit, she looks a bit older,” Matthew and Rachel agree. “Some people jump and shriek. The new cat is a bit puzzled. But we don’t get a big negative reaction. I know a lot of people don’t have taxidermy in their house – but we love it.” For nearly a decade, up until about 2012, the British artist David Shrigley used pet dogs and cats, stuffed, often standing anthropomorphically on their back legs holding placards saying: “I am dead”. It was an exploitation of the transgressive idea of stuffing a family member. Shrigley sees the pieces as something between black humour and a conversational gambit about the nature of death. And life. Since he acquired a puppy five years ago, Shrigley has abandoned using pets (although, he adds quickly, he never hurt an animal in his earlier work). He says he wants his work to be more positive (his was the thumbs-up on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square last year). Recently, struck by how the lambs gambolling outside his bedroom window were playing just like his puppy had, he stopped eating meat entirely. “Taxidermy is such a weird thing,” he says. “It’s supposed to be a representation of life. But it’s a representation of death.” Odder still is that as the number of Britons who, like Shrigley, take up vegetarianism rises (6% now), so does the passion for pets and for unusual, unexpected ways of preserving their memory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/why-do-we-hold-on-to-first-impressions-in-a-relationship","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-08T13:30:03Z","webTitle":"Why do we hold on to first impressions in a relationship?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/why-do-we-hold-on-to-first-impressions-in-a-relationship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/why-do-we-hold-on-to-first-impressions-in-a-relationship","fields":{"headline":"Why do we hold on to first impressions in a relationship?","bodyText":"I have been reading Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me) by Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson, a book about cognitive dissonance – the phenomenon that arises, with uncomfortable feelings, when two deeply held internal points of view come into conflict with one another. To avoid such feelings, we resort to self-justification. The book contains a chapter on cognitive dissonance in marriage, which holds this process to be the main culprit in the outcome of relationships. “Misunderstandings, conflicts, personality differences and even angry quarrels are not the assassins of love – self-justification is,” the authors remark. How does cognitive dissonance work? Let’s say partner A has a problem with partner B’s recklessness with money – as they understand it. Perhaps one of the things that attracted them originally was what they thought of as B’s “generosity and spontaneity”. In a relationship, however, the behaviour starts to look irresponsible. How does A resolve the fact that they made a misjudgment about B? One way is for A to accept that they made that misjudgment and that the responsibility is partly theirs. Another way is for A to carry on maintaining the “positive” dissonance, and convince themselves that B is wonderfully, joyfully open-handed even though the joint account is in the red again. But the easiest way, as it avoids damaging their self-esteem, is for A to decide B has betrayed them and is a “bad person”. Such retrospective self-justification applies to the whole spectrum of domestic behaviour from housework to childcare. It’s not, “If I hadn’t seen it, I wouldn’t have believed it”, rather, “If I hadn’t believed it, I wouldn’t have seen it.” What is the “real” situation between a couple? With cognitive dissonance and another related psychological principle, confirmation bias, operating at all times – both affect any particular situation and the writing and rewriting of memory – it is difficult to know “the truth”. But often the price of that truth is the realisation that “I was (at least somewhat) wrong” – usually the most painful way of resolving dissonance, and thus the least palatable. The longer cognitive dissonance worms its way into memory and our understanding of what has happened, the more powerful it becomes as a predictive factor for conflict, because then a relationship becomes more about what a person “is” as opposed to what they “do”. Any behaviour that contradicts that presupposition will be discounted and any evidence that confirms it will be exaggerated. If you form an opinion early in your relationship about the other person, and then use every opportunity to screen out information that runs counter to that opinion, then you have a coherent worldview, but possibly an unreliable view of your partner, who – whether they actually improve or not – is trapped within your prejudices. There is only one solution to this conundrum (one I failed to embody in either of my marriages, both now sadly ended) or rather, three solutions – humility, honesty and good faith. Humility means the ability and courage to say “I may be wrong”, so that every time anything goes awry you don’t self-justify. Good faith is the default position that your partner means well, and is trying, even though they may be failing. Honesty is the hardest, given all the distorting filters our mind provides – but it is at least to be held as an ideal, as a hedge against the temptations of self-justification. These stances have to be mutual for there to be any chance of success – if one side holds good faith and the other does not, or if one side is prideful and the other humble, that is a recipe for the continuation of self-justification on one side and accumulating resentment and frustration on both. Self-justification, one-sided or mutual, is the course most frequently chosen. Other choices are possible. To make them constitutes the difference between a happy and an unhappy marriage. @timlottwriter.wordpress.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/09/bovis-homebuyers-class-action-lawsuit-property-defects","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Angry homebuyers plan class-action lawsuit against Bovis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/09/bovis-homebuyers-class-action-lawsuit-property-defects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/09/bovis-homebuyers-class-action-lawsuit-property-defects","fields":{"headline":"Angry homebuyers plan class-action lawsuit against Bovis","bodyText":"Bovis Homes, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, faces a potential class-action lawsuit from a group of buyers who accuse it of selling houses riddled with defects. Puneet Verma bought a five-bedroom house with his wife for £485,000 in Milton Keynes two years ago but says he still has a list of 120 snags. He is now consulting two law firms, Leigh Day and Slater &amp; Gordon, about taking group action. “I have had a survey done by a chartered surveyor that categorically states the workmanship is extremely poor and that Bovis is not in compliance with building regulations,” Verma says. “Bovis has treated, and continues to treat, its customers appallingly and now the only way to get our problems resolved is to take legal action.” Verma is aiming to raise a £100,000 fund through a £100 contribution per homeowner, assuming 1,000 of the 2,500-strong Bovis Homes Victims group on Facebook sign up. It has been almost a year since the housebuilder issued a profit warning and was accused of paying thousands of pounds in cash incentives to get buyers to move into unfinished homes. As the scandal widened, the company set aside £7m to fix defects and appointed a new chief executive. A year on, some Bovis homeowners say they will be spending Christmas in houses that are riddled with faults, including leaks, moving and creaking floors, lack of insulation and sewage backups, as well coping with shoddy workmanship. Ian Tyler, the chairman of Bovis, apologised to buyers in May for “letting them down” and admitted the firm had been cutting corners to hit ambitious targets. The company says it slowed production to iron out build problems, retrained sales staff and set up an advisory homebuyers panel, which has met once. Dave Howard, who set up the Facebook group with his wife, Ann, and who sits on the panel, doubts whether Bovis has made any progress on improving build standards and customer service. He claims homeowners who report problems are being referred to the National House Building Council (NHBC), the standard-setting body and main home construction warranty provider for new-builds in the UK. But in the first two years after purchase the housebuilder is responsible for rectifying defects. “We have had constructive contact with the new customer experience director, but there are too many people hitting brick walls with Bovis and NHBC,” Howard says. “Some new customers have had better experiences but that seems to have slipped too.” Bovis says: “We have made significant changes to how we operate in 2017 and a growing majority of our customers would now recommend us to family and friends. “We remain determined to make things right for customers who raise warranty items and apologise to those to whom we have not previously delivered the high levels of quality and service they rightly expected.” The company says customer problems in the first two years are dealt with by an in-house team. If they are still not satisfied they can then go to NHBC. Guardian Money spoke to a number of people who have bought Bovis homes in the past two years. Bovis declined to comment on the individual cases, or the possible legal action. Gas safety regulations breached When Tara Grosvenor recently returned from a 10-day holiday in the US to her one-year-old, four-bedroom Bovis house in the village of Honeybourne, Warwickshire, she could smell gas. She alerted National Grid, which immediately capped the gas supply off and condemned it. The gas system, which was installed by a Bovis contractor and signed off by NHBC, was found to be in breach of gas safety regulations. “There were loads of other snagging issues in the house, some of which remain outstanding, but this was potentially life threatening,” Grosvenor says. The 29-year-old credit risk manager asked Bovis to buy back the £325,000 house from her but it refused, so she took legal action. Bovis initially offered £500 in compensation and later raised it to £1,000. She deplores what she calls “the lack of weight the consumer has and the insignificance of their voice to fight their case in these situations against a corporation the size of Bovis”. Sewage smell in kitchen Amanda Clarke also wants Bovis to buy back her three-bedroom detached house in Flitwick, Bedfordshire, after discovering major defects. She bought it 14 months ago for £345,000. Clarke, a 49-year-old content developer, has had blocked drains and says she has had to put up with the smell of sewage in her kitchen and toilet for the past 11 months. Not satisfied with Bovis’s response, she had her own survey done, which identified other major issues such as high levels of moisture across the ground floor. Maggot and fly infestation Alex Atrill, who purchased a four-bedroom detached house at Boorley Park in Botley, Hampshire, at the end of June for £439,000, has suffered a gas leak and a major maggot infestation in his kitchen that turned into a fly infestation. He also has poorly laid flooring. “It’s just been a fight,” he says. “They all say they are really sorry but nothing ever gets done.” More than 100 snags Jenny and Philip Thomas moved into The Winchester, a five-bedroom detached house in Little Wootton, Bedfordshire, in late June. They sold their previous home before Christmas because Bovis promised their new one would be ready in January. But they had to stay in temporary accommodation with two children, one just a few weeks old. They were given two days’ notice before their move-in date. “This is a £600,000 ‘executive’ home – we had better quality in our two bedroom council home seven years ago,” Jenny says. Sewage backed up into their house after plumbing was put in incorrectly, a damp-proof course has been severely breached and the garage floods. “We have had over 100 snags and some major breaches of NHBC standards and building regulation law. Since we have challenged this, with the support of my father-in-law who is an ex-NHBC inspector, and not accepted the offered solutions that are not compliant with the standards, they [Bovis] have totally stonewalled us.” Hole in the living room Karen Stacey-Pope says Bovis has been slow to fix a series of serious defects at the four-bedroom detached house she and her family bought for £335,000 in Banbury last December. She paid £1,100 for a survey by a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors member, but says Bovis won’t accept many of the findings. Defects include damp in the loft, stairs that are too high, missing movement joints (the house is built on a flood plain) and a leak through the kitchen ceiling. She has also had a big hole in the living room near the patio door since March. She is recovering from a breast cancer operation and has an autoimmune disease. Her GP wrote a letter to Bovis, seen by Money, warning about the impact of damp and the issue with the stairs on her health. All the floors move Pete Oldham and his wife, a retired couple, bought a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Cranbrook, Devon, for £234,995 in December 2015. “All the floors move,” Oldham says. “When you walk into a room the furniture moves. They haven’t fitted things properly but are in denial.” He says the floor joists should be 400mm apart, not 600mm. There has been a breakdown in communication with Bovis and he has been referred to NHBC."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/05/germany-accused-over-illegal-deportation-of-afghan-asylum-seeker","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Germany accused over 'illegal' deportation of Afghan asylum seeker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/05/germany-accused-over-illegal-deportation-of-afghan-asylum-seeker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/05/germany-accused-over-illegal-deportation-of-afghan-asylum-seeker","fields":{"headline":"Germany accused over 'illegal' deportation of Afghan asylum seeker","bodyText":"The German government has been accused of breaking its own rules on removing Afghan asylum seekers with a decision to deport a 26-year-old who fears he will be killed if returned. The man, who the Guardian is not naming, is due to be flown out of Germany on Wednesday to a country he has not set foot in since he was five years old. The case has focused attention on Germany’s acceleration of deportations, which have doubled over the past year. In all, 78 people are due to be deported on Wednesday. Amnesty has accused Germany and other European countries of breaking international law by returning asylum seekers to Afghanistan at a time when civilian casualties in the country are at their highest for years. The deportation is part of a controversial policy in which male Afghan asylum seekers can be returned if they have been convicted of crimes or are considered to be “dangerous” suspects. They can also be sent back if they refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities to clarify their identities. However, lawyers defending the man say that he does not fall into any of these categories. “He is not a criminal, is not being observed as a potential terrorist and has cooperated in giving his identification papers,” said Philipp Pruy, an immigration lawyer from BC Legal Lawyers who is handling the case. “He is unfairly and callously being sent back but he has not committed a crime and he has cooperated in making sure the government can identify who he is. “They only told him one week ago that he would be deported. He fears his life could be in danger.” The man, whose asylum application has been rejected and who has lived in Bayreuth, Bavaria, since 2011, told the Guardian that he was stressed at the prospect of leaving and returning to a country he had not been to since the age of five. “I left and went to Iran then and it was when they tried to deport me and send me back to Afghanistan that I fled for Germany,” he says. “I am afraid because I think someone will kill me in Afghanistan. My father was part of the group who fought against the Taliban.” Pruy says he hopes to stop the deportation before Wednesday and is appealing against the decision as an emergency case. “In my opinion, it is illegal because it is against what the federal government told us in August this year, that people would only be deported in exceptional circumstances.” The lawyer fears that his client may be being penalised because the Bavarian government wants to show it is taking a hard stance on refugees. Each state can chose how it applies the government’s deportation policy. Deportations to Afghanistan are controversial in Germany, with refugee charities arguing that the country is not safe given ongoing conflicts between the Afghan government and the Taliban. The United Nations reports that there were a record number of civilian casualties in 2016. According to the news organisation Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND), the number of people deported back to Afghanistan has nearly doubled in recent years, from 145 at the end of June 2016 to 282 at the end of June 2017. Ramin Mohabat, a journalist, is another refugee from Afghanistan whose asylum application was rejected, although this decision was reversed on appeal. He is campaigning against the planned deportations, which he says are causing tension among Afghans in Germany. “The fear is very big in the community at the moment as there are not safe places in Afghanistan and people are very scared of being deported,” he says. “My message to the German government is that they need to say stop playing with people’s lives and stop the deportations because I know everyone being deported now is in danger of their life and having been all over Afghanistan I know all about all the conflicts happening at the moment. “The biggest problem is the Taliban but also Islamic State now and in every city there is different armed groups that just do what they want to do.” The Bavarian ministry that deals with immigration refused to comment, saying it could not give detailed information about deportations before they happened."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/dec/04/police-have-killed-dozens-of-children-in-philippines-war-on-drugs-amnesty-says","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T16:52:49Z","webTitle":"Police have killed dozens of children in Philippines war on drugs, Amnesty says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/04/police-have-killed-dozens-of-children-in-philippines-war-on-drugs-amnesty-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/dec/04/police-have-killed-dozens-of-children-in-philippines-war-on-drugs-amnesty-says","fields":{"headline":"Police have killed dozens of children in Philippines war on drugs, Amnesty says","bodyText":"Police have killed dozens of children in the “war on drugs” in the Philippines in the last 18 months, Amnesty International said. The rights group urged the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into crimes against humanity in the violent crackdown, including the deaths of an estimated 60 young people by police and vigilantes. Some of those killed were deliberately targeted in anti-drugs raids, while others were caught in the crossfire. There have also been “riding in tandem” attacks, carried out by vigilantes on motorcycles, which are often paid for by police, Amnesty said. Relatives of some of the victims told the rights group how they witnessed police fatally shooting children at point blank range as they were begging for mercy. The killing by police of a 17-year-old student, Kian Delos Santos, in August, sparked nationwide protests in the Philippines after CCTV footage emerged of him being dragged along the street by two plain clothes officers, casting doubt on police claims he was shot in self defence. More than 12 police officers have been investigated for the Santos killing after the case received international attention, but no one has yet been held to account. Since Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president, took office in June 2016, more than 3,900 “drug personalities” have been killed in his anti-drugs campaign, although activists say they are suspected users and alleged small-time dealers. More than 2,000 others have been killed in drug-related crimes and thousands murdered in unexplained circumstances, according to police data. In October, amid waning public support for his deadly campaign, Duterte ordered police to end all operations in his anti-drug offensive, and placed the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in charge, saying the shift was to target big networks and suppliers. James Gomez, Amnesty’s director for south-east Asia and the Pacific, said: “How many bullet-riddled bodies must be found dumped on the streets before the international community takes action? “It is time for international justice mechanisms to step in and end the carnage on Philippine streets by bringing the perpetrators to justice. The country’s judiciary and police have proven themselves both unwilling and unable to hold the killers in the ‘war on drugs’ to account. “The ICC must open a preliminary examination into the situation and cast its net widely. Responsibility is not just limited to those pulling the trigger, but also those who order or encourage murders and other crimes against humanity.” The ICC recently indicated that it will investigate and pay special attention to crimes against children. Duterte and other high-level government officials have openly advocated for extrajudicial killings, which could amount to criminal responsibility under international law, Gomez said. One 17-year-old victim was killed after he was woken up in the middle of the night. The victim’s partner, known as O, told Amnesty: “They pointed a gun at my head [and] told me to get out … I heard shouting and three gunshots, then three more shots.” Researchers from Amnesty witnessed large numbers of children suspected of drug-related offences kept in overcrowded and unsanitary holding centres for minors in the Philippine capital, Manila. Some said they had been beaten and tortured by police on their arrest, and claimed police had framed them by forcing them to pose in photographs with drugs that had been planted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/05/museum-of-failure-los-angeles-tidal-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T12:00:12Z","webTitle":"From Tidal to Trump University: the museum that remembers major failures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/05/museum-of-failure-los-angeles-tidal-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/05/museum-of-failure-los-angeles-tidal-trump","fields":{"headline":"From Tidal to Trump University: the museum that remembers major failures","bodyText":"For your viewing pleasure, downtown LA’s new Museum of Failure has gathered together some of history’s most ill-conceived ideas. There’s the Shared Girlfriend, a $45-a-day rental sex doll that the Chinese company Taqu launched in September – and recalled just two days later, due to a government backlash – which sits right across from a small shrine to some of the current president’s shortest-lived ventures. There’s Success Distilled, AKA a bottle of yellow-tinged Trump Vodka (2006-2011); a box set of Trump: The Game, the only version of Monopoly in which you can actually get fired; and a pair of textbooks from Trump University, including Play to Win in Business and Life and Entrepreneurship 101: How to Turn Your Idea Into a Money Machine. “The Trump exhibit could have been much bigger,” says the clinical psychologist and Museum of Failure founder Samuel West. “There’s so many more. What’s interesting is that, whatever you think of him, yea or nay, Trump is a phenomenon. He’s stumbled from failure to failure in business – not evaded failure, but met it full force. He’s a fantastic example that failure is often in our heads, and you can fail extensively without it having to paralyze you.” Although the president’s no-fail attitude could be attributed to his endless financial cushion, West founded his museum last summer in Helsingborg, Sweden, with this same inspirational spirit of destigmatizing mistakes, no matter how epic. Operating on a shoestring, Swedish government-funded budget, the museum opened with 60 artifacts of marketing missteps and what West calls “corporate hubris”, which attracted 15,000 visitors in its three-month run, no small feat in a town with a population that hovers just under 125,000 people. The Museum of Failure, ironically, was a runaway success. The Los Angeles version, open within the A+D Architecture and Design Museum through 4 February, has all the Swedish museum favorites: Blockbuster (“a cautionary tale of not adjusting to disruptive technology”, says West); the tone-deaf Bic for Her pens; and the unfortunately named Ayds appetite suppressants that started to flounder with the onset of the Aids epidemic in the 80s. In the American tradition, the exhibition has gotten bigger, with the addition of 40 more familiar brands: a package of Swedish-fish flavored Oreos; a poster for the Christian Slater movie that grossed $264 at the box office; a tablet with Jay-Z’s streaming service Tidal (not gone, but “on its last breaths”, says West), and a monitor playing classic infomercials, including the pervy seatbelt attachment the Tiddy Bear. The museum posits failure as the essential foil to innovation, an elusive achievement that requires taking a few risks. It also shows that even perfectly good ideas sometimes get defeated. In the loosely thematic display, a few patterns start to emerge. “One reason to fail is immature technology; it’s not always best to be first to market,” says West, referring to the Google Glass on view, which stumbled in both its engineering and its hype. “Everyone wants their marketing campaigns to go viral,” West adds. “They want this hysteria, but the downside is that when expectations are much higher, the fall hurts even more.” And then there are the failures that are objectively, unforgivably bad: Kayla, the bluetooth-equipped talking doll that gathered information on consumer habits in children, or Olestra, the diarrhea-inducing fat substitute. A Lego model of the architect Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye is a stand-in for the failures of modernism to produce the utopian society it promised, citing the building’s notoriously leaking roof. Why the museum resonates with the public is a mystery to West, although he has his theories. “Nostalgia is one reason,” he says, “but out of pure speculation, I think that there’s this feeling that something is sincere and genuine about failure. No one wants you to see it, but it represents something authentic and real.” Next year, the permanent museum in Helsingborg reopens in a bigger space, because the Museum of Failure is always expanding. West already has a wishlist for his collection. “If there’s anyone in Los Angeles with a Juicero, we’re taking donations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/04/panorama-syria-allegations-uk-aid-transparency-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T16:04:25Z","webTitle":"Panorama’s Syria allegations show the UK’s aid needs greater transparency | Kate Osamor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/panorama-syria-allegations-uk-aid-transparency-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/panorama-syria-allegations-uk-aid-transparency-bbc","fields":{"headline":"Panorama’s Syria allegations show the UK’s aid needs greater transparency","bodyText":"The full details of the investigation into aid contractor Adam Smith International in Syria by the BBC’s Panorama are yet to air. But the BBC is claiming that funds meant for the world’s poorest have ended up in the pockets of an extremist group. Adam Smith International strongly denies the allegations contained in the programme and in a separate Times story. The biggest cause for concern would be how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) – the two bodies responsible for the project funding a civilian police force – might have allowed this to happen. We urgently need to know exactly when FCO ministers knew of any problems in the project, what their response might have been and if they have identified challenges in other programmes. We should be in no doubt that when it is spent properly, Britain’s aid budget achieves remarkable results. It makes the world safer and fairer, helps to eradicate poverty and disease, makes millions of lives better, and shows the world that Britain stands for something. The Department for International Development (DfID), responsible for the majority of the aid budget, has world-class standards developed over two decades of experience. It is able to ensure that aid is transparent and effective, and that fraud is prevented and managed properly. But since launching its new aid strategy in 2015, this government has actively sought to “securitise” aid and to increase the use of large private contractors. The government’s strategy explicitly set out to divert our development budget away from DfID and towards other government departments, including the FCO, via the CSSF – with far lower transparency, effectiveness and fraud prevention standards. New figures released last month shows that 26% of aid funds are now spent outside DfID. In August I wrote to then-secretary of state Priti Patel, recommending seven steps to get a grip on the cross-government aid spending chaos – all of which were ignored. The Panorama allegations are so alarming precisely because they concern the government’s direction of travel, and exactly the kind of aid project it has pushed to have more of. Unfortunately, the allegations are also likely only the tip of the iceberg. The CSSF operates with very little transparency in 70 countries, including many with questionable human rights records, such as Bahrain, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Yemen. In August, the Guardian reported that through the CSSF, the UK government was funding Egyptian juvenile detention services accused of human rights violations. In April, parliament’s joint committee on the national security strategy – responsible for oversight of the fund – had even warned that so little information was available, it was neither able to measure the fund’s impact nor to exercise proper parliamentary scrutiny over it. That must now change. The government must now open up its books on the CSSF and prove that money flowing through it is eradicating poverty rather than violating human rights. That requires a full independent forensic investigation and line-by-line budget review of the fund. The public deserve to understand the full scale of the problem. • Kate Osamor is the shadow secretary of state for international development"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/04/the-muslim-director-who-filmed-neo-nazis-i-thought-im-not-going-to-make-it-out","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T17:32:26Z","webTitle":"The Muslim director who filmed neo-Nazis: ‘I thought – I’m not going to make it out’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/04/the-muslim-director-who-filmed-neo-nazis-i-thought-im-not-going-to-make-it-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/04/the-muslim-director-who-filmed-neo-nazis-i-thought-im-not-going-to-make-it-out","fields":{"headline":"The Muslim director who filmed neo-Nazis: ‘I thought – I’m not going to make it out’","bodyText":"Last summer, the documentary film-maker Deeyah Khan started to receive the sort of threats – of being raped, tortured, gassed and killed – that vocal women from minority groups often get with hateful frequency. In a BBC interview, Khan had made the apparently contentious point that Britain was never going to be all-white and that we should build a future where we all belong. She was used to racial abuse – as a child growing up in Norway (her mother is from Afghanistan; her father from Pakistan), she knew of neo-Nazi marches, and her brother was once chased by racists and had to hide under a car. But the abuse she received last year was particularly vile and relentless, and Khan decided she didn’t want to be afraid of this generation of newly emboldened white supremacists any longer. Instead, she thought, she would try to find out what made them think and say the things they did. The result is her film White Right: Meeting the Enemy. It focuses on the rise of nationalism in Donald Trump’s America, from the “alt-right” to all-out neo-Nazis. She spent time with various leaders in the movement, going to their meetings, including the August rally in Charlottesville where Heather Heyer, an anti-racist campaigner, was killed. She hung out with the followers of the movement, going out at night in the car with one as he leafleted a Jewish area with hate-filled flyers. She also met former neo-Nazis. “I’m a woman of colour,” she says at the beginning of the film as she sits down to interview Jared Taylor, a well-known white supremacist. “I am the daughter of immigrants. I am a Muslim. I am a feminist. I am a lefty liberal. And what I want to ask you is: am I your enemy?” She says she felt frightened “many times” during the making of this film. “Even when I started getting comfortable with some of the people [she spent time with and got to know], the people on the periphery could be very unpleasant.” It didn’t make it into the film, but after the rally in Charlottesville, Khan and a colleague joined a neo-Nazi “afterparty” at a compound in the hills, which started to get out of hand. “They were starting to pull their guns. And not just guns, but, like, war-zone weapons. They had just come from Charlottesville and they were amped up from the fighting. I was looking around, going: ‘I’m not going to make it out.’” Her main reason for doing the film, she says, when we meet in a hotel in London, wasn’t “to find out how horrible they are – I already know what they stand for, I’m not interested in their ideology. What I was interested in was trying to find the human beings behind the facade and to see what else there is to these people – and is it possible for me to sit with my enemy and for them to sit with theirs?” Khan says she knows it would have been easy to make a film showcasing only how horrific these extreme views are – and there is plenty of that here – “and then we think we’ve done a really good job, but in a way we haven’t because that’s how they want to be presented. I do believe that it’s possible to hold their opinions in complete contempt and not dehumanise them. I wasn’t looking for them to say and do shocking things, get that on camera and leave. I was looking for something else. The layers and depths of who we are as human beings, that’s what I’m obsessed by. What makes people do the things they do? What makes people who they are?” This is Khan’s fourth film. In Norway, she had a career as a singer, becoming a pop star, but moved to London at 17. Having become more involved in activism, Khan had become frustrated at the lack of Muslim women’s voices in public and set up the online magazine sister-hood 10 years ago, a platform “for people, including myself, to tell the stories that we believe in and to contribute to the wider conversations in our societies and communities.” Khan felt that Muslim women were being talked about but not listened to. “People don’t want to engage. [They think]: ‘Maybe it’s your culture to be beaten or cut, or to be threatened, so we won’t get involved.’ As if my culture is to be abused; as if the only people who get to define my culture are abusive men, not the men who aren’t abusive, or people like me.” It was around the same time that she came across the story of Banaz Mahmod, the 20-year-old London woman of Iraqi Kurd heritage who was killed by her family after divorcing her husband and falling in love with another man. Khan had never made a documentary before, but, with very little money and some Googled instructions on how to use film-editing software, she made Banaz: A Love Story. She planned to give the film away to women’s rights groups until it was picked up by ITV. Her dealings with the TV industry hadn’t been great – one channel said she could be credited as a researcher and they would get a “real director” in. She refused; the film won an Emmy award for best international current-affairs film. In White Right, the men who emerge are strikingly similar to the men in Khan’s previous film, Jihad, which explored what attracted British recruits to the jihadi movement. “Their cause is different, but their motivations and the personality types are the same. You have the guy who just wants violence and wants to find a cause he can dress his violence with. But the vast majority of the people are either lost and looking for a sense of belonging or looking for a sense of purpose. This is true for the jihadis and these guys here. They’re looking for something to contribute to and give to the world – in their opinion – in a positive way.” Khan has come away from her recent experience, she says, both more afraid and less. “What makes me more afraid is how organised, how galvanised [the white far right] are. They truly believe they are the victims. They feel like they have everything to lose and that’s worth fighting for.” But she also feels less frightened, personally, than she did. “I spent my life hounded by men like this and I left liberated from the fear because I realised they’re people who are just as messed up, in pain, broken or struggling as any of us. They just don’t have either the support or means to deal with some of the things they’re dealing with in a healthy way. I absolutely am not asking for people to feel sympathy for these guys – I don’t feel sympathy for them – but that does not exclude my ability to try to empathise with them. Having experienced racism my whole life, I decided that hating them or being afraid wasn’t enough for me any more.” White Right: Meeting the Enemy is on ITV on 11 December at 10.40pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/05/corporate-code-overhaul-backtracks-may-pledge-workers-boards-financial-reporting-council","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T06:01:08Z","webTitle":"Overhaul of corporate code backtracks on May's pledge to workers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/05/corporate-code-overhaul-backtracks-may-pledge-workers-boards-financial-reporting-council","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/05/corporate-code-overhaul-backtracks-may-pledge-workers-boards-financial-reporting-council","fields":{"headline":"Overhaul of corporate code backtracks on May's pledge to workers","bodyText":"Companies would not be forced to appoint workers to their boards and instead be allowed to choose how they intend to heed the views of employees, according to proposals to overhaul boardroom rules. The proposals, to be published on Tuesday, appear to confirm that Theresa May’s pledge to put workers on boards – made during her campaign last year to become Conservative party leader – has been abandoned. Within three months she had started to water down the pledge, while in August the government offered three potential options to give employees a voice in the boardroom. The government said it would ask the Financial Reporting Council – the accountancy regulator that oversees the corporate governance code for all listed stock market companies – to consult on the three options. A consultation published by the FRC includes all three options – to assign a non-executive director to represent employees, to create an employee advisory council or to nominate a director from the workforce. While it does not list other options, it means that the City corporate code will include a provision for employees’ voices to be heard in the boardroom. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said it was “good that the code recognises the key role workers’ voices play within businesses”. “The next step is for the corporate governance code to recognise the important role that unions play in the long-term success of companies,” she added. The code operates across stock market listed companies and operates on a “comply or explain” basis so that companies which ignore its provisions must provide an explanation. The consultation – open until February – also includes plans that would require firms to publish their gender balance, building upon recommendations in the review by Sir Philip Hampton and Dame Helen Alexander, who died in August, in to boardroom diversity. The FRC is proposing that these figures include the first layer of management below the board – and their direct reports – and goes further than suggested by including all companies and not just the 350 biggest listings on the stock market. It does not propose similar disclosure on ethnicity but asks for views on whether it should encourage the release of more information on this issue. The FRC’s latest proposals would also mean that companies which have a 20% vote against their remuneration report would have to explain how they intend to discuss the dissent with shareholders. Sir Win Bischoff, chair of the FRC, said: “At this crucial time and as the country approaches Brexit, a revised code will be essential to restoring trust in business, attracting investment and ensuring the long-term success of companies for ... wider society.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/04/new-zealand-britain-countryside-michael-gove-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T18:06:25Z","webTitle":"Clean, green New Zealand is a lie – and a warning for our post-Brexit countryside | Patrick Barkham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/new-zealand-britain-countryside-michael-gove-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/new-zealand-britain-countryside-michael-gove-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Clean, green New Zealand is a lie – and a warning for Britain’s countryside","bodyText":"There can’t be a more successful tourism marketing campaign than “100% Pure New Zealand”. And New Zealand is seen as a world leader in another respect: how its farmers sell their food globally without government subsidies. But the tension between these two successes has been exposed by Sir Tim Smit, the co-founder of the Eden Project in Cornwall. Smit has sparked a minor international incident by declaring that New Zealand is “so pure the people of Christchurch won’t even swim in the river Avon. Most of the lakes are full of algae. It is like a beautiful person with cancer.” He was speaking to British landowners pondering the New Zealand model for post-Brexit agriculture. British farmers currently receive £3bn in subsidies each year; environment secretary Michael Gove must design a much smaller subsidy system – or scrap it altogether. Smit argues that New Zealand is no inspiration despite its farmers surviving the removal of subsidies in 1984. Their response has been to intensify, and export milk to China. Landscapes that George Monbiot might describe as sheep-wrecked are now cattle-wrecked; the cost, argues Smit, is water quality, as nitrates from fertilisers flood into rivers. Smit’s critique has been endorsed not only by Greenpeace New Zealand but also by the chief executive of New Zealand’s fish and game council, Martin Taylor, who calls the country’s clean, green image “a facade”. Brexit marks a crossroads for the British countryside. Gove believes we can boost agricultural productivity while also enhancing the environment. His vision isn’t so dissimilar from some environmentalists’: subsidy-dependent upland farming will cease (and some land even rewilded) while production is intensified on surviving lowland farms. But the idea that we can have it all – cheap food, pristine environments and profitable farmers – is naive. Without tough regulation and subsidies for farmers to provide public goods such as healthy soil, clean water and carbon storage, we will all, ultimately, suffer. No accounting for nature I suggested the Isle of Man could imitate New Zealand’s “100% Pure” marketing when I visited last week. It was an answer to questions from islanders frustrated that their public image is of 83,000 accountants clinging to a low-tax rock in the Irish sea. I’m always struck by Man’s deliciously clean air, its variety of scenery, from moors to mountains to luminous green pasture, and the fact that the sea is always unexpectedly close. With superb marine nature reserves, the island offers excellent whale-watching; when its skies are clear (not often, in my limited experience) its lack of light pollution makes for superb star-gazing. Clean air, healthy seas, stars – these are our true riches. Unfortunately, it looks like post-Brexit Britain will seek to emulate Man’s financial arrangements rather than its natural wealth. A mammoth mistake On Sunday a new BBC documentary will tell the tragic tale of Jumbo, the 19th-century circus elephant who gave his name to big jets. When Jumbo died in a collision with a train in Canada, his owner claimed Jumbo saved his keeper’s life by deliberately facing down the train. In fact, scientists examining his skeleton have discovered, Jumbo was hit from behind: the maltreated elephant was running away. We may feel good that Britain’s last circus elephant was taken into a sanctuary six years ago. But given elephants’ size and what science is telling us about their sensitivity and intelligence, we shouldn’t be keeping them in zoos at all. I’ve no doubt that a 22nd-century documentary will upbraid us for that. • Patrick Barkham is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/shortcuts/2017/dec/04/winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-billionaires-mark-zuckerberg","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T15:39:41Z","webTitle":"How the Winklevoss twins became the world’s first bitcoin billionaires","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2017/dec/04/winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-billionaires-mark-zuckerberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/shortcuts/2017/dec/04/winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-billionaires-mark-zuckerberg","fields":{"headline":"How the Winklevoss twins became the world’s first bitcoin billionaires","bodyText":"Name: Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

So they’re actors, are they? No. They’re venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. In 2008, they rowed for the US at the Beijing Olympics, finishing sixth. In the film, Armie Hammer played both of them as a kind of two-man master race. As one of them put it in a memorable line of dialogue, “I’m 6ft 5, 220 pounds and there’s two of me.” Nice. But why make a film about them? Because they were at Harvard with Mark Zuckerberg, who they later sued, claiming he stole their idea for a website that they called Harvard Connection, but which he called the Facebook. (Dramatic music.) And did he? Steal the idea, I mean? Oh, God, that’s just too complicated to get into. The Winklevii launched numerous lawsuits about it, and got about $65m (£48m) worth of Facebook stock, which wasn’t much at the time. Oh, yeah. Sure. These guys probably spend $65m on lunch. In fact, they spent $11m of it on bitcoin, so they’ve probably cheered up a bit. Bitcoin. There’s a word I don’t understand. It’s a crypto-currency. There’s another one. Think of it as an electronic token, which can be owned and traded. Like normal money, it has value because other people consider it valuable. The number of bitcoins in circulation is strictly controlled by a clever bit of software that nobody can hack, called the blockchain. Thank you. And the Winklevoss twins like having lots of bitcoins, do they? I’m sure they do at the moment. In March 2013, they bought about 100,000 of them, when each coin was worth roughly $120. After a strong year, and a wild couple of weeks, each bitcoin is now worth … let’s see … $11,826. Holy moly! That’s right. Not counting the value of their other investments, the Winklevoss twins have just become the world’s first bitcoin billionaires. Apart from Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s mysterious inventor, of course.

Many are the reasons that have been offered for Leicester’s fairytale run to the Premier League title in 2016: heartwarming team spirit, a charismatic and quirky manager, the goals of Jamie Vardy, the genius of Riyad Mahrez, a lethal counterattacking style opponents recognised but couldn’t cope with, the reward of carb-heavy pizza in exchange for clean sheets, and the strange inability of each and every one of their major rivals to put them under any kind of pressure. But in the time that has elapsed since Wes Morgan hoisted the Premier League trophy skywards to mark the most fitting of ends to the most implausible of feelgood stories, the significant contribution of one man to Leicester’s triumph has been overlooked. A referee as quick to blow his own horn as he is his own whistle, Mark Clattenburg clearly feels he hasn’t got the credit he deserves for almost singlehandedly winning Leicester City the title and has finally stepped forward to explain how it was him wot won it. Now working in a well paid gig as the head of Saudi Arabia’s referees, Clattenburg was in charge of the bad-tempered draw between Chelsea and Tottenham that eliminated Mauricio Pochettino’s team from the title race and confirmed Leicester’s ridiculously unlikely status as champions. What’s more, speaking in an interview in the USA! USA!! USA!!!, the famously pleased-with-himself official from Durham has announced he more or less made up the rules as he went along on the evening in question, so nobody could blame him for costing Spurs the title on a night when their players completely lost the plot. “If I sent three players off from Tottenham, what are the headlines? ‘Clattenburg cost Tottenham the title,’” he said in an interview with the Men In Blazers podcast. “It was pure theatre that Tottenham self-destructed against Chelsea and Leicester won the title. Some referees would have played by the book; Tottenham would have been down to seven or eight players and probably lost and they would’ve been looking for an excuse.” So there we have it: he had one job. And the job in question? Maintaining control of a game of football by adhering to assorted laws with which, we must assume considering his lofty status, he is very familiar. And yet rather than enforce them and almost certainly ensure Leicester won the title, he preferred to hope that an out-of-control Tottenham with a full set of players would fare no better than an out-of-control Tottenham that had been correctly reduced to seven or eight players. As luck would have it, Clattenburg’s gamble paid off, neutrals got a rollocking white-knuckle ride and Leicester were crowned champions, but that’s rather beside the point.

A longtime staff writer for the New Yorker and bestselling author, Gopnik lives in Manhattan with his wife, Martha, a film-maker, and their two children, and he moves in the kind of circles that allow him to drop casual lines into conversation such as: “As John Updike once said to me …”, although he has the nervy Jewish self-consciousness to follow that with “… if you’ll forgive the namedrop.” The first time I met him was almost exactly a year ago when a mutual friend introduced us in a west London restaurant. He was accompanied by his wife and their 16-year-old daughter, Olivia, abright and precocious teenager who described to me another recent trip she’d been on with her parents with an eloquence that is still beyond me, despite my 20 years head start on her. She didn’t even blink at the various London luminaries who came over to talk to her father; Nigella Lawson and Ralph Fiennes, we were told, might pop by later. The Gopniks smiled calmly: this was all par for the course for them. This time we are meeting in the Chelsea house of a friend of Gopnik’s, where he is staying while promoting the UK publication of his latest book, At the Strangers’ Gate. Despite the jetlag, he is as friendly as I remember, and we begin by talking about his children. Gopnik made his name early on as one of the most brilliant and wide-ranging critics of his generation, and in the past three months alone his subjects in the New Yorker have included Ulysses S Grant, Philip Roth and Alexander Calder. His take on how Seinfeld flipped around the old formulae of Jewish comedy, in that the Jewishness in that show was the background hum and the jokes about middle-class manners were foregrounded instead of vice versa, remains one of my favourite critical takes on comedy. I’d heard that Gopnik reads four books a day, and this sounded totally credible. “Four! Oh no, that’s an exaggeration,” he laughs, and then pauses. “I mean, I’ve done two.” Which two? He looks surprised at the question: “What, most recently?” (The answer, it turns out, is Michel Houellebecq’s Submission and a history of Charlie Hebdo, both in French.) But for mass audiences he is best known for writing about his family, thanks to the huge success of his books, Paris to the Moon (2000), a collection of his writings from Paris for the New Yorker, in which he often wrote about Martha and their then toddler son, Luke. This was followed by the similarly bestselling Through the Children’s Gate (2006), about his and Martha’s life in New York after Paris with their two small children. Interspersed with essays about 9/11 and gentrification he wrote about, for example, Charlie Ravioli, three-year-old Olivia’s imaginary friend who was always too busy to meet her, and the death of her pet fish, Bluie, all in his elegant, accessibly highbrow style. At the Strangers’ Gate is essentially the conclusion to this trilogy, or perhaps the preface, as it is about Gopnik and Martha moving to New York from Canada in the early 1980s as young lovers, living in “a romantic shoebox” as he tried to fulfil his dream of becoming a writer (spoiler: mission accomplished). The publisher is promoting the book as a portrait of 80s New York, and there are little portraits of people from that era, such as Richard Avedon and Jeff Koons. But the book is really about Gopnik’s adoration of his wife: “At 18 she was the prettiest girl I had ever seen, and that she should have found me appealing remains the great event, and mystery, of my life,” he writes. Marital happiness is marvellous in one’s personal life, but it presents a problem in one’s memoir if the worst tension you can mine is the time you and your wife once had a quarrel over how well done a tuna should be. “Writing about how much you love your wife is bad form, it seems like boasting,” he concedes. Or smug? “Yes, smug. It seems smug. And it’s bizarre because if you write about your desperate desire for the forbidden, well, that’s literature. But if you say we have basically been going pretty well for 30 years it is not. It’s partly because happiness is a hard thing to write and unhappiness is easier to write. But I get annoyed when I hear people say, ‘Happiness writes white’ or something like that. I don’t think that’s true. We like reading books of the past with well-constructed domestic scenes – that’s one of the things we love in Trollope.” In Britain, he has been a regular on the Radio 4 programme A Point of View, in which he has discussed subjects as wide-ranging as why religious people feel persecuted by same sex marriage and the relationship between words and music. Gopnik describes the memoir essay as “the least self-indulgent form” because it lets the reader know “that your troubled and confused inner life is no more troubled or confused than everybody else’s”. And yet Gopnik lives, and writes about, a rarefied life. Even when he was just starting out his brilliance meant that he was given opportunities others did not even know existed. Gopnik, who often does live readings of his work, found, for instance, that his anecdote from At the Strangers’ Gate about the time he had to wing a lecture on pluralism and individualism did not get the laughs he expected from audiences because, he concedes, “few people are unexpectedly asked to give keynote addresses”. The stories from Through the Children’s Gate are told firmly through the filter of Upper East Side privilege, with tales of trick or treating at brownstone houses. Even the smell of the debris of 9/11 makes him think of “smoked mozzarella”, as he wrote in one essay at the time. He bristles a little when asked about the potential myopia, saying “privilege is relative” and stresses that when he arrived in New York he had next to nothing. “Look, writing is made of truth to experience, it’s not made of a particular kind of experience. All experience is valid, and Virginia Woolf’s is as valid as DH Lawrence’s. If you submitted writing to a means testing, writing would dissolve, and this is where I will be a little pugnacious because I think this is what separates people who actually care about writing from people who truly only care about politics,” he says. “No good reader reads Proust and says: ‘This is the study of the privileged life of a white man in Paris in the 1880s, who could possibly respond to this?’ We respond to stories of love and memories and desire and disillusionment.” Yet Gopnik’s fondness for writing about his world has made him a target for critics. The now defunct website Gawker went after him relentlessly (“twee little pastry fetishist” was one of their few printable nicknames for him), and in 2007 the critic James Wolcott wrote in New Republic a skin-peelingly brutal 4,500-word attack on him that opened with: “I wonder if Adam Gopnik was put on this earth to annoy. If so, mission accomplished.” Gopnik is by no means immune to criticism. In his 1998 essay, Man Goes to See a Doctor, which is regularly cited as one of the New Yorker’s greatest ever essays, Gopnik says he went into therapy in 1990 pretty much because he was so devastated by some of the criticisms (his therapist reassures him these attacks are merely “banter”.) The night before our interview, he lost a debate to Will Self, and the loss clearly stings a little as he brings it up twice: “Perhaps I seemed too professorial or lawyerly or something,” he muses. How does he cope with the more personal attacks? “You never get entirely immune to it. You’re waltzing along with a relatively acceptable self-image and suddenly you find yourself portrayed as a monster of privilege. I think some of the venom comes from the fact there are lots of people with literary ambitions and there’s a feeling that all the chairs in musical chairs have been taken unfairly by people who had arrived at the game a little earlier,” he says. David Remnick, the New Yorker’s editor, has a different take. Gopnik, he says, “brings to the New Yorker an insatiable hunger for the beautiful”, and suggests that “it might be that his interest in supposedly bourgeois pleasures are an offence. But I think it’s ridiculous, in all. AJ Liebling, MFK Fisher, and many others wrote about pleasure, and maybe they had their sour detractors in their day, but I bet you that Adam’s prose, its delight and intelligence, long outlasts the complaints of his more malicious critics.” An undercurrent to a lot of the criticism is that he is, in some ways, mannered, or false, or deliberately self-aggrandising. When he writes that his immediate response to his wife’s labour during the birth of their first child taking longer than expected was to go out and buy a copy of George Santayana’s book on aesthetics, The Sense of Beauty, it’s hard not to scoff. But this is to misunderstand Gopnik’s roots. Born in Philadelphia and raised in Montreal, Gopnik was one of six, and the grandchild of Jewish immigrants. “My parents got married very young and then discovered in this extraordinary way the world of books and art and learning and science, and we all got educated together. So they exposed us to all of that stuff in a very non-strategic way from the beginning. I still think the greatest gift you can give your kids is easy exposure to interesting things. Not compelling them to go see things, but making them feel that art and literature are just parts of the world,” he says. Certainly his parents’ child-rearing approach produced successful children: Gopnik’s siblings include Alison, a widely respected author and professor of psychology, and Blake, an art critic. But surely they must have seemed pretty precocious as children? “We were so encased within the family ethic and aesthetic that we were probably insanely hateful the moment we crossed outside the family portal but we weren’t aware of it. Martha’s the one to ask about because she has hilarious stories about wandering into my family. She was 19 and she says it was sort of like a cross between the Glass family [from the JD Salinger stories] and the Cullen family in Twilight. It was a very weird group,” he laughs. “But Henry James said once that the only country he felt comfortable in was the James family, and I certainly feel that way about the Gopnik family: it’s the only country I feel comfortable in, and nostalgia for childhood is a very powerful emotion in my stuff.” It’s not hard to understand why some people’s hackles rise at Gopnik’s glowing descriptions of his family life, but to me they read less as smug and more as astonished: the writings of a man shocked by his good fortune at finding such happiness in adulthood after such a blissful childhood. I ask him if that would be a fair description of his feelings and his face softens. “I would not have volunteered that but yes, I can’t believe my luck. You know, we have a drug store across the street and I’m usually sent out there to get mineral water or dog food at midnight and I’ll look up at the windows of our apartment and I’m in a state of teary eyed disbelief that Martha and I live there, we have two kids and all that. I never get over how fortunate I’ve been. I know that sounds disingenuous, I know I’m industrious and have abilities. But I am still stunned, yes.” Before I leave Gopnik insists I say hello to Martha and an elegant woman with long, perfect hair drifts towards us, sleepy with jetlag, still in her negligée, looking like a princess who has just wandered out of a magical wood. “What are you doing today, darling? I have to go to the BBC,” he says. “Oh, to do your interview? Yes, of course. I thought I’d go to the Cézanne exhibition,” she replies, slowly rousing herself. “Oh that’s a nice idea – I’ll meet you at the Cézanne after the BBC,” he says. “Perfect,” she agrees and smiles at him. It really is a lovely life. • At the Strangers’ Gate: Arrivals in New York is published by Quercus. To order a copy for £17 (RRP £20) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

He calls in the midfielders and he breaks a light. Calls in the strikers, breaks a sofa.” One of José Bordalás’s former players tells the tale and, although he’s laughing, he’s only half joking. The Getafe manager began his coaching career in the third division nearly 24 years ago and there are other moments like it, not far beneath the carefully-cultivated impeccable appearance, breaking beyond the tidy beard and smart glasses: benches have borne witness, press rooms too, and that’s just the public displays. There have been fridges kicked and doors punched, tactics boards butted. “He has his foot up against your throat and doesn’t let go,” says Juan Cala. The Getafe defender means it figuratively of course, but another says: “You sometimes wonder if he’s going to hit you.” That player recalls Bordalás’s assistant chasing a team-mate around the training pitch, saying things, trying to wind him up. Before a game, a long time ago now, Bordalás made another hold a pencil between his nose and top lip, and cross his eyes. Now stay like that, he told him. He wanted them to go on the pitch wearing a “crazy face” to “terrify opponents”. Defenders were told to grab strikers, fight them. Every ball is a battle. “You spend the week building to the game, all week. And every game it’s like you’re playing for your life; if you don’t win it’s an absolute disaster,” Cala says. Another footballer calls him “a bit peculiar”, but he’s certainly not stupid. Asked to define him in a phrase, here’s an answer: “Very, very, very intelligent.” As for Cala, he defines Bordalás in a single word: rendimiento. Performance. There is something about him that gets the best out of them. Look at the table and there are Madrid’s “other” teams. Leganés, coached by Bordalás’s one-time assistant Asier Garitano, sit seventh. And, less than three miles from there across the motorway, Getafe are eighth. They sit one and two points off a European place, respectively. So what? So these are clubs whose derby was traditionally played in the third tier, whose only objective is survival, and who arguably shouldn’t even be here at all. A little over a year ago, Leganés were a single place off the relegation zone. Getafe, meanwhile, were second bottom. Of the second division. That was when they turned to Bordalás. Getafe had recovered a little but seven weeks in they still sat 21st. They were about to become Bordalás’s 11th club as a coach and none had been in the first division, which wasn’t his place – or so it seemed. A technical striker nicknamed ‘the Roman’ who retired early because of a knee injury, having been at 11 clubs and never above the third division, he spent most of his coaching career there, working around his native Alicante (where he managed three times), until he moved to Alcorcón. With them, he reached the play-offs to primera in 2012-13 and in 2015-16 he brought Alavés up as champions. The problem was that he didn’t get to go up with them, the job instead given to Mauricio Pellegrino – a decision which seemed to say something about him but might have said just as much about prejudice. In truth, it was as much about tension between him and the board but it also tapped into the idea that, somehow, he was fine for the second division but couldn’t do what he did in the first. The decision, as it turned out, was good for Alavés – they finished ninth and reached the Copa del Rey final – and even better for Getafe. In the autumn, posters started appearing in Getafe showing Bordalás’s face with the slogan “take me to primera”, and he did. A second promotion in a row, with a second club. Yet, ridiculous though it sounds, some wondered if he might face a second sacking. There were still doubts about his continuity, Getafe’s president Ángel Torres cornered on camera and pretty much forced into announcing he would carry on during a TV interview that was conducted mid-celebration and felt like a set-up. But Getafe were back in the top flight and Bordalás was there at last. “Bordalás, a first division manager,” one headline ran, a little pointedly. At the end of the season, Getafe released central defender Cata Díaz, leaving his wife Celeste Marzella attacking Bordalás as “false, a traitor and a coward”, accusing him of having spies in the dressing room. But those who are close to the manager are very close and extremely loyal. It is no coincidence that many of the same players end up working with him again. He is, players insist, an expert in group management. He brings players together – often against some perceived common enemy, from the outside or, sometimes, from within – and is skilled at getting them to understand what he wants. Motivation is key and even those that see oddness see value; they recognise he gets a lot from his squad and there’s fondness too. Bordalás can be angry, wound up, hot-headed, demanding, but the intensity is relieved by the fact that he can be genuinely funny too. “He might transmit nastiness sometimes but even years later people remember the things he said, the amusing phrases,” says one close observer. Bordalás has a strong team around him – fitness coach Javier Vidal is very highly rated – and he is, in the words of one player, “very, very intense”. Cala says: “He controls every aspect: diet, rest, training, tactics. And his training sessions are incredibly pesado, heavy-going. The intensity is unbelievable.” Another says: “He would go absolutely crazy if you didn’t do what he wanted.” He seeks to take advantage of every detail he can, seeing significance in the “other football” – knowing when to break a move down, how to effectively end a game. What he wants always includes not letting the other team play. The message is relentless and it is clear, simple: compete. Getafe have competed so far, that’s for sure. They have lost three times at home this season: 2-1 against Barcelona, 2-1 against Madrid, 1-0 against Sevilla. In all three, they probably deserved more, although they could stand accused – and striker Jorge Molina admitted as much – of perhaps dropping too deep. Their style is simple: tight, aggressive, direct. Not always pretty, but often pretty effective. It can be tempting to see Uruguayan full-back Damián Suárez as the embodiment of that style, at times almost cartoonish in his aggressiveness and risky too; Vicente Guaita has had a superb season in goal; Djené Dakonam has impressed; and the speed and skill of Ángel has been striking. But this is a collective and then there are a couple of other players who particularly stand out. Markel Bergara has given them consistency and a character that is contagious. In 14 games he has also scored more than he did in 146 for Real Sociedad. Then up front they have Molina, one half of Bordalás’s favoured little-and-large approach, top scorer last season with 20 goals and central to everything they do this – the 35-year-old who helps define their style. “He’s the only one in the team who is irreplaceable,” Cala insists. “Ángel can be missing, Markel can be missing, Djene, me … but Jorge can’t. We don’t have anyone else who can do what he does. 60%, 70%, of our game is long ball and the only one who brings it down is Jorge. He battles with the centre-backs, controls it, moves. People say ‘yeah, but so-and-so …’ No, no, no: Jorge. If you’re defending and you can go long to him, that means the world. He gives us life.” There is life in Getafe, where as far as the manager is concerned every defeat is a “death”, week after week after week. Last Monday, Getafe were defeated 1-0 at Espanyol. “After that, the week he gave us … pffff,” Cala says. “Horrific.” Six days later, they became the first team this season to beat Valencia, denying them the chance to close to within two points of Barcelona at the top. It was the kind of game that defines them, for better and worse. Despite being a man down from the 25th minute after Mauro Arambarri got his second yellow, despite suffering at times, Bergara’s deflected shot gave them a lead after 67 minutes. Dani Parejo hit the post with a free-kick, Guaita was sharp and the goal came as Valencia were starting to get behind them and create chances; after that, the game changed. It would be tempting to say it died, which was what Getafe wanted. As the clock ticked away, there were bodies everywhere. Players in blue dropped like flies, if not flies who actually had much wrong with them. Simone Zaza grinned at a ballboy, gesturing to him; the cheeky scamp grinned back. They both knew what he was up to and he wasn’t about to go any faster. There was still time for more opportunities, though: the board went up with five minutes on it – it could have said twice that – and in the very last minute Zaza headed over. At the whistle, the Coliseum erupted, Getafe’s players embracing and punching the air. They really are back. Before the game, Bordalás had gone round telling his players of the importance to make it “uncomfortable” for Valencia and they did that. Afterwards, just as Ivan Rakitic had done a few weeks before, Parejo complained about the state of the pitch, which was dry and cut up. “It looked like they haven’t tended to it all week,” he said. Parejo insisted it was “no excuse”, but it was part of the explanation – even though, while it probably helped Getafe, it has been a problem that some of their players feel they have endured too – just as the way the home side tried to prevent much happening was part of the explanation. Up until the sending off, they had three cards and lots of fouls: “That’s football but it made it difficult for us,” Valencia’s assistant manager Rubén Uría admitted. “Today this looked like the team I want,” Bordalás said, throat hoarse and voice barely audible. “If we don’t compete, we fall a long way. Today they gave everything. What honour! What humility! That’s what I take with me – that and the kilometres they ran.” They had done what no one else could – not Barcelona, not Atlético, not Sevilla either – and beaten Valencia, taking Getafe nine points and 10 places clear of the relegation zone. “Fans are ‘brave’; maybe they’ll start talking about Europe but our only objective at the start, now, and at the end is survival,” Cala said. “And tomorrow Valencia will have gone. Tomorrow he’ll be talking about Saturday again, living the game, like: ‘Bloody hell, we’re playing for our lives here’.” Talking points • “Another train departs,” ran the front cover of AS. On Saturday afternoon, Barcelona departed the Camp Nou, heads down, Sergio Busquets lamenting the two points lost against Celta while Iago Aspas, who was superb, insisted: “It’s never a good day to come here but this time we deserved a draw … in fact, a point might even be too little given that we had another chance to make it 3-2.” By Saturday night, though, the point looked pretty good. “A point the size of a Cathedral,” Sport called it. By Sunday night, it looked even better. The reason was simple: Barcelona drew with Celta, but Madrid couldn’t take advantage. Twice they hit the post and there were opportunities to have won it but they drew 0-0 at San Mamés. After 35 consecutive away games scoring, that’s two in a row that have finished without a goal. Zidane said he was happy, which is what he always says, and Madrid might have won it but yet again this wasn’t just about missed opportunities. As the game went on, so they ran out of ideas, delivering cross after cross that mostly went nowhere in particular. In the pouring rain, the imprecision was alarming – and not just from Athletic. So, Barcelona’s lead over Madrid was retained – and, ultimately, their lead over Valencia was expanded. That said, they lost Samuel Umtiti to a torn hamstring. La Liga’s best defender so far this season, he’ll be out for two months. “Another league starts here,” said AS, and they might be right. Madrid are fourth now, and have next week’s opponents Sevilla just behind them after they won on Saturday. Of the top four, only Atlético got all three points, their first big night at A Stadium Called Wanda ending with an 88th-minute winner to see off Real Sociedad 2-1. For all the doubts, they’re unbeaten this season – a run that goes back 18 games, a club record. • Applause for Asier Garitano. Not only did his Leganés side beat Villarreal, to end a four-match, fearful-fixture packed losing run, he also got into a touchline discussion with Villarreal captain Mario in which he told his opponent not to give the ball back from a throw-in and then told off his fans for whistling him. “We don’t kick the ball out and we don’t ask anyone else to do so either,” he said. • “At last,” said Xavi Aguado. “It was a matter of time,” replied Pablo Alfaro. They both received 18 red cards in La Liga. That was a record once, but not any more. On Sunday night Sergio Ramos got his 24th red card, his 19th in the league. • And Las Palmas won! (Pako Ayesteran was sacked in midweek, in case you’re wondering.)

We're still choking","bodyText":"An estimated 18,000 people die every day worldwide as a result of air pollution. The great majority of the world’s population breathe air that does not meet World Health Organization guidelines. Air pollution has become so bad that it’s said we now have a “fifth season”: this time of year, when lethal smogs envelop some of the most populated parts of the world. Delhi’s atrocious smogs, which caused an international cricket match to be halted on Sunday, follow similar ones last year. But 65 years on from the toxic Great Smog of London that descended on 5 December 1952, and led to ground-breaking anti-pollution laws being passed, the air above the UK still hasn’t cleared. In London alone more than one person an hour dies prematurely from a range of conditions such as congestive heart failure, asthma and emphysema as a result of exposure to particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has called for a new Clean Air Act that would enshrine a right to clean air. Smog Day marks the anniversary of the Great London Smog, and the middle of the international smog season. It grew out of an initiative to share the experiences of people living with air pollution in London and New Delhi, whose air quality is among the worst in the world. In spite of many differences between life in the two capital cities, there are parallels in the experiences of people who work on the streets, runners who exercise along them, taxi drivers, parents and children and the doctors who care for those with breathing difficulties. Progress on air pollution is already being made in many places around the world. The recent Lancet Commission on pollution and health points out that air-quality improvements not only save lives, but have other benefits. Over nearly half a century in the US, every $1 invested in improving air quality has yielded an estimated $30 in additional benefits. Shifting to 100% renewable energy by 2050 would prevent 90 million premature deaths between 2017 and then, according to work by Mark Jacobson at Stanford University. Almost 200 countries are in the process of negotiating a series of resolutions on pollution at the United Nations, and cities around the world are being encouraged to be part of the UN Environment’s BreatheLife campaign to clear their air to meet health targets by 2030. Cities can learn quickly from each other about what works, with transport policies crucial. Curitiba in southern Brazil has been said to set the gold standard in sustainable urban planning, with a comprehensive, high-quality public transport system and bus system used by 85% of local people. In the UK, Nottingham introduced an all-electric park-and-ride service and one of the biggest electric bus fleets in Europe, while Birmingham promotes a “bicycle revolution”, offering free bikes, cycle training and maintenance lessons. Freiburg in Germany coordinated transport and land use to increase journeys by bike threefold, double public transport use, and cut the share of trips by car to less than one third. But how could the UK government deliver a meaningful right to clean air? There could be a nationwide duty on all public bodies to take into account the impact of air pollution and climate change whenever they make a decision about public services or public funds. A precedent exists in the form of the public sector equality duty, which assesses whether the decisions of public bodies will have a discriminatory impact on vulnerable groups, and if so take reasonable steps to prevent discrimination. It is now embedded in almost every public body decision-making process. We urgently need to change how we live, work and run the economy, to stop avoidable, premature deaths, tackle climate change and advance visions of a world in which the air is fit to breathe. Today’s awareness-raising Smog Day is a step in the right direction. • Andrew Simms is an author, analyst and campaigner"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/21/last-minute-christmas-drink-shopping-wine-cider-rum-aldi-marks-and-spencer-booths-fiona-beckett","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"Drink: better late than never – the secret to last-minute Christmas wine shopping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/21/last-minute-christmas-drink-shopping-wine-cider-rum-aldi-marks-and-spencer-booths-fiona-beckett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/21/last-minute-christmas-drink-shopping-wine-cider-rum-aldi-marks-and-spencer-booths-fiona-beckett","fields":{"headline":"Drink: better late than never – the secret to last-minute Christmas wine shopping","bodyText":"There was a time when I used to enjoy taking Christmas food shopping right to the wire, leaving everything until Christmas Eve and seeing what I could pick up on the day. Maybe it’s a sign of advancing years, but that now seems an unnecessary level of stress, so I’m hoping I’ll be done and dusted by the time you read this. Except I know I won’t. However well organised you are, there is always something you forget, whether it’s a present for your brother-in-law or a bag of ice for the G&amp;Ts. And it’s sod’s law that someone in the family will have already helped themselves to that special bottle you were saving for Christmas Day. If you’ve forgotten the festive fizz, head for Aldi, which has an impressive magnum of Champagne Philizot Premier Cru (12% abv) for £31.99. (And it’s better than Lidl’s, FWIW.) While you’re in there, you might as well load up with some back-up bottles in case you run short: the Gavi di Gavi 2016 (£7.99; 12% abv), a smooth Italian white, is always a reliable favourite, as is the latest (2017) vintage of the Exquisite Collection Clare Valley Riesling (£6.99; 12.5% abv), which would be good with any spicy riff on turkey leftovers. The Exquisite Collection Ribera del Duero 2016 (£6.29; 13% abv) is an equally foolproof red, but I’m not sure I’d go for the 40-year-old tawny port Aldi’s been touting, the problem being that after this period of time, it’s more about the wood than the fruit. Marks &amp; Spencer is always good for a gift bottle, and it’s stocking some pukka rums this year, including a delicious Guyana 10-Year-Old (£26; 40% abv) in a dinky 20cl bottle. I also like M&amp;S’s Spiced Christmas Cider, which is mixed with clementine juice – a lighter option at 4% abv, and good value at £2.50 a bottle. If you’re lucky enough to live near a Booths, it’s selling a strikingly original Japanese gin from Kyoto called Ki No Bi (£44.50, also at Master of Malt for £45.50; 45.7% abv), which is flavoured with Japanese botanicals including yuzu and sansho pepper, and which should nail it for the gin obsessive who has everything. And nothing is more Christmassy than a bright red bottle of Lazzaroni Amaretto Autentico (24% abv), which is made with amaretti di Saronno biscuits. I’m thinking of its culinary possibilities as much as its drinking ones: it would be superb in an almond cake or some frangipane mince pies, say. You can get it at Majestic for £21.10 a bottle, or £18.99 on the mix-six deal. It’s definitely better than cheaper imitations. matchingfoodandwine.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2017/dec/05/avengers-infinity-war-marvel-cinematic-universe-superhero-movies","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T13:00:13Z","webTitle":"Avengers: Infinity War – which superheroes are about to meet their doom?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/dec/05/avengers-infinity-war-marvel-cinematic-universe-superhero-movies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2017/dec/05/avengers-infinity-war-marvel-cinematic-universe-superhero-movies","fields":{"headline":"Avengers: Infinity War – which superheroes are about to meet their doom?","bodyText":"It’s easy to forget, almost a decade into the phenomenally successful Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), that there was a time when studio bigwigs worried about audience recognition. Next year’s Avengers: Infinity War will have a roster of superheroes so populous that it’s easy to imagine lesser-known costumed crime fighters (we’re talking about you, Hawkeye and Falcon) struggling to squeeze into even the widest of widescreen shots. It’s going to be crowded. And yet it’s unlikely the studio will bother to enlighten those viewers who have watched only a handful of the saga’s 18 (so far) episodes. And, while it’s possible to pity the fool who goes into Avengers: Infinity War cold (“Why is a talking space badger bantering with a moody teenage tree monster?”), it’s not as if the other movies aren’t out there for the uninitiated to dive into at their leisure. However, the overpopulated nature of this pioneering cinematic universe suggests that, to retain the natural ebb and flow of the macro-saga that has made Marvel such a surprisingly organic experience, some of these characters will have to be put out to pasture in order for new heroes to get more screen time. The emergence of Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange means we now have three potential rivals for the mantle of Avengers alpha, along with Chris Evans’ Captain America and Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man. And that’s before even newer figures such as Chadwick Boseman’s Black Panther or Brie Larson’s soon-to-arrive Captain Marvel are taken into consideration. All in all, it might be a good thing that the Earth is about to come under attack from a demigod who in the comics is obsessed with death. For Josh Brolin’s Thanos might be just the alien despot to help reduce an ever-expanding list of superheroes to more manageable numbers. There are even clues in last week’s debut trailer for Infinity War that some of the Avengers are about to get popped. Can Paul Bettany’s Vision survive having the Mind Stone, one of six Infinity Stones that Thanos needs to gain ultimate power over reality itself, pulled from his bonce? What brutal horrors are Tony Stark and Tom Hiddleson’s Loki crying over? After the events of Thor: Ragnarok, many fans were left wondering if Bruce Banner’s personality had become fully submerged into that of the Hulk, though the trailer suggests we’ll get to see at least one more turn for Mark Ruffalo in human form. Still, the line from Ragnarok in which Banner worried about being lost for ever if he transformed into the great green meanie again must surely have been flung in for a reason. Might Infinity War see the Hulk’s human alter ego finally meeting his own demise? It’s worth remembering that we’ve been here before. Captain America: Civil War was widely predicted to see at least one Marvel big beast cop it, but all Tony Stark and Steve Rogers managed to do was beat each other to bloody pulps. Avengers: Age of Ultron featured a trailer in which Stark predicted there was “no way we all get through this” – yet they all did. The MCU has been remarkably averse to killing off or phasing out any of its major players, in contrast to the comics, where Captain America has been killed off (though he was later revealed to have been phasing in and out of time) and Jean Grey of the X-Men has copped it at least twice. The death of Phil Coulson in The Avengers may have been built up into a major event, but we should probably bear in mind that Stark once bore so little regard for the SHIELD deputy that he insisted his first name must be “Agent”. In any case, Coulson was subsequently revived for the Agents of SHIELD TV show. There is an argument that Marvel’s refusal to get rid of its best-known heroes is inevitable in the cinematic universe format. The oldest trick in Hollywood is to shoot down a major character to deliver dramatic tension, but it’s hard to do it when your big hitters will be needed in three movies a year for the next decade. Moreover, these are decisions that studios and audiences usually come to regret. This year’s Kingsman: The Golden Circle was ruined before a single frame had been shot by the preposterous call to bring Colin Firth’s Harry Hart back from the dead, and all the silly technical gimmickry required to make any sense of that development. Superman’s self-sacrifice in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was wasted because no one believed for a moment that Kal-El was likely to remain dead when Warner Bros had only just embarked on its own superhero universe. So perhaps Marvel should be praised for refusing to cater to its audience’s blood lust. And yet, returning to the trailer, it is tempting to wonder how Iron Man is going to react to being smashed in the face by the god-like Thanos while he’s wearing the Infinity Gauntlet (albeit on the other fist). And more tempting still to wonder if there is a morality to these ornate comic-book tales. If anyone deserves to meet their demise in the MCU it is surely Tony Stark, a figure who created Ultron through his own egomania, then broke up the Avengers (Earth’s best defence mechanism against future aggressors) as he tried to right his own wrongs. Even as recently as this year’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, Stark came across as a terrible mentor to the young Peter Parker, the ultimate absentee father figure. Would Marvel have the nerve, especially as Downey Jr is easily the MCU’s most recognisable figure? That would be the ultimate test of audience recognition, not to mention proof that this cinematic universe has become bigger than any of its stars. • This article was amended on 7 December 2017.

Is it simply, as its subtitle “The Year 1905” suggests, a party-approved memorial to a failed uprising against the tsar, a composer selling out, at least publicly, in the face of continuing pressure from the Soviet authorities? Or is it, as Shostakovich’s alleged memoirs, the controversial “Testimony”, would have us believe, something darker and altogether more subtle: a coded elegy for the victims of the crushed Hungarian uprising of 1956, a protest against the regime cleverly disguised as pro-Soviet propaganda? Interpretation – and conviction – matters: this symphony and its companion piece the 12th have proved stumbling blocks for many otherwise laudable interpreters of Shostakovich’s music, who have seemingly lacked belief in the musical and ideological merit of the work. On the strength of this performance, Alexander Vedernikov is not such a musician. Conducting the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, in what was surprisingly the orchestra’s first performances of the work, Vedernikov showed himself to be an economical master of this music. This was a performance full of character but decidedly lacking in histrionics. From the outset, where glacial strings provide a backdrop for the recurring ghostly tattoo on the timpani – surely one of the most atmospheric of symphonic openings – this was a measured, almost cool performance that emphasised the work’s Mahlerian scope and scale. There was superb playing from the orchestra, with some standout solos, from the clarion call of Mark O’Keeffe’s trumpet to the lyrical beauty of the violas quoting a revolutionary song lamenting the fate of fallen comrades. During James Horan’s account of the perilously exposed cor anglais solo towards the end of the symphony you could have heard a pin drop in the Usher Hall. Vedernikov’s approach to the symphony’s frenzied closing bars was resolute and almost mechanistic: the great machine of the state overwhelming the people, be they anti-tsarist or Hungarian protesters. It was powerful, menacing stuff, and there was a sense that the Sunday-afternoon Edinburgh audience was more shellshocked than appreciative. Perhaps they had been lulled into a false sense of security by the more benign Russian world of the opening work in the concert, Tchaikovsky’s familiar first piano concerto. Denis Kozhukhin was the soloist, giving a performance of crystalline clarity that downplayed the sentimentality in favour of understated lyricism, but with plenty of bravura power where it was needed. • The Glasgow performance of this concert is available on BBC iPlayer until 30 December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/04/milein-cosman-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T15:06:05Z","webTitle":"Milein Cosman obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/04/milein-cosman-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/04/milein-cosman-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Milein Cosman obituary","bodyText":"Milein Cosman, who has died aged 96, drew many of the greatest artistic names of the 20th century. Working on commission for publishers, magazines and newspapers, she sketched Benjamin Britten, Yehudi Menuhin, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Sir Thomas Beecham, TS Eliot, Francis Bacon, Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore, among others. She drew primarily from life, and her subjects were mostly artists of various kinds, and above all musicians. Into this she was led by a love of music, but also by her almost 40-year-long collaboration with her Viennese husband, the musician, musicologist and broadcaster Hans Keller. Their book Stravinsky at Rehearsal (1962), which combined his words with her drawings, is a classic of a genre they largely devised themselves; he analysed the music, while she captured the musicians in the midst of its creation. Cosman worked in ink, pencil and conté, and was never inhibited by the fame of her subjects: she drew Thomas Mann while he was lecturing; Sir Arthur Bliss conducting and John Ogdon at the piano. She worked extraordinarily swiftly, saying: “I can only draw fast. If I draw slowly, I almost always get it wrong. I think all the Stravinsky sketches were done in one day.” She also did many paintings, subjects including Stravinsky and Mstislav Rostropovich, the artist Fred Uhlman, and, most often, Keller. In his appreciation of Milein’s work, published in the catalogue of her show of drawings and prints at the Belgrave Gallery in 1996, Sir Ernst Gombrich commented: “Posterity will be grateful to Milein Cosman above all for the sureness of her eye, with which she has succeeded in capturing the unique quality of so many of our distinguished contemporaries.” She claimed, however, that: “What I really like to draw best are people who work: fishermen and road menders. Yes, it must be said, that really a lot of people have quite wonderful faces.” Emilie Cosmann (her brother nicknamed her “Milein” and she dropped the last letter of her surname when she came to Britain) was born into a comfortable German-Jewish family in the small town of Gotha, in Germany. She was educated largely in Düsseldorf, where she organised a pupils’ anti-fascist group and for her last two school years attended the Ecole d’Humanité and the International School in Geneva. In 1939 she followed her brother, who was already installed in Scotland, to Britain. Thereafter, Milein always referred to herself as an émigrée rather than a refugee. Refugee was not the only label she refused to accept. “I’m not religious, I was brought up without religion, my religion is the arts,” she said, and: “I am not a ‘Jewish’ artist.” After she gained entry to the Slade School of Fine Art – by turning up in person with her portfolio – she lived in a leaky garret behind the Ashmolean museum, Oxford, where the Slade was evacuated for the duration of the war. She studied drawing under Randolph Schwabe and lithography with Harold Jones, and in 1943 she alternated evening classes with Bernard Meninsky at Oxford Polytecnic with giving art classes for the Workers’ Educational Association. She supported herself by delivering milk with a pony and trap and teaching French at a convent school. It was at Oxford, too, that she met Iris Murdoch, then a student, and was invited back for “cocoa at Somerville” after an evening lecture given by Graham Sutherland. Milein drew Murdoch’s portrait, commenting on the sharp features in the baby face, and the acute intelligence they revealed. This was the first lithograph Milein made, and demonstrated her ability to get under the skin of her subjects, to perceive more than perhaps they were aware of exposing. While at Oxford, she met a constellation of musicians, artists and writers. The poet Sidney Keyes fell in love with her and dedicated some of his work to her. He was not the last poet to be struck by the tiny, lively-minded woman with birdlike movements and sharp intelligence. Years later, Dannie Abse was so impressed by a chance encounter in Zwemmer’s bookshop that he followed her all the way up the Charing Cross Road to pursue their conversation. Milein moved to London at the end of the war, where she worked as an illustrator and began to submit sketches to magazines and newspapers. She became a regular contributor to the Radio Times, supplying portraits of the next week’s interviewees. Of Imogen Holst she said: “She looked quite funny, you know, in her sandals and ankle socks. She had the face of a Flemish Madonna.” Sometimes she generalised: “I find on the whole women quite difficult to do. They often have softer features – and very few of them are conductors”; of the cellist Rostropovich, she said: “He was marvellous to draw, as I believe cellists almost always are, crawling all over their instruments like beetles.” In 1947, while working on a commission, she met Keller, who became her most frequent subject; his keenly angular, impish face adorned the small spaces of wall between the vast living-room windows of the Hampstead house which they bought in the 1960s, and where Milein stayed on alone after his death in 1985. With its unfolding rooms – French windows and a kitchen verandah giving on to a long front garden scattered with fruit trees – it had a German ambience often enhanced by the aroma of fresh poppyseed cake wafting through the open-plan modernist interior. In 1958 Milein worked on a schools’ television series about drawing for ITV and in the 60s she joined Camden Printmakers, participating in numerous group shows. Her work was acquired by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Jewish Museum in London, and internationally by the universities of Texas, Pennsylvania, McMaster, Canada and Kanagawa, Tokyo. Her cousin Leo Goldschmidt established the permanent exhibition of her work in the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, where he was the director, and there is another at Milein’s beloved Wigmore Hall, where she was a regular attender. In 1986 Milein’s illustrations appeared in Klemperer on Music, and in 1998, in the John Heath-Stubbs 80th birthday issue of Aquarius. As a sideline she devised a series of animals to which she added ludic descriptions: a Bird Flautist, Dancing Kangaroos, Dream Camels. She drew Britten’s parrot, for which she had to obtain not only Britten’s permission, but also that of his ill-tempered housekeeper, Miss Hudson, for access to “her” kitchen. In 2006 she established the Cosman Keller Art and Music Trust to support education in these fields, and to preserve her work and that of her husband. It has recently bequeathed her drawings and prints of musicians to the Royal College of Music in London, drawings and prints of dancers to Salzburg University and a selection of drawings and prints to the arts academy in Berlin. Despite encroaching blindness from the 90s onwards and a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in 2011, Milein carried on working for as long as she could. In 2014 she attended the opening of a major retrospective of her work in Gotha, and a documentary on her life, directed by Christoph Böll, was funded by the city. An exhibition of her work is due to be held at Clare Hall, Cambridge, in 2019. As she said, swiftly sketching a young child who came to her annual apple-picking party in 2003: “There’s always the thrill of the ink and the pen on the page.” Then, cocking her head to peer at what she’d just done: “It is a good drawing, isn’t it?” Milein is survived by three nieces and a nephew. • Milein Cosman, artist, born 31 March 1921; died 21 November 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/09/blind-date-michael-tom","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T05:59:16Z","webTitle":"Blind date: ‘I went through his dating apps and swiped on his behalf’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/09/blind-date-michael-tom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/09/blind-date-michael-tom","fields":{"headline":"Blind date: ‘I went through his dating apps and swiped on his behalf’","bodyText":"Michael on Tom What were you hoping for?

The group was a vehicle for the singer and lyricist Mark E Smith, who has died aged 60 after an extended period of ill health, including respiratory problems. He formed the Fall after seeing the Sex Pistols perform their famous concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall, Manchester, in June 1976. This became dubbed “the gig that changed the world”, because, as well as Smith, it was witnessed by future members of Joy Division, the Smiths and Buzzcocks, who all left with a burning urge to create their own band. Smith assembled the Fall in his home town of Prestwich later that year. Aside from the inspirational spark of the Sex Pistols, the band cited the German group Can and the Velvet Underground as chief influences, both of whom fully exploited the hypnotic power of repetition as a stylistic device. One of the Fall’s early songs was even called Repetition – “the three Rs are repetition, repetition, repetition,” lectured Smith. A fondness for rockabilly was also discernible in their early work, earning them the label Country &amp; Northern from fans. However, while Smith would remain the band’s constant central factor for more than 40 years, his musicians fell by the wayside, often not voluntarily. During the group’s career, Smith performed with a total of 66 band members. One of them was Marc Riley, now a DJ on BBC Radio 6, who was sacked by Smith on his wedding day in the early 80s. Though Smith was notoriously difficult to work with, his acidic tone, deadpan black humour and unswervingly confrontational attitude (fuelled by his copious intake of alcohol) lay at the heart of his perverse appeal. In 1998, his violent mood-swings briefly landed him in jail in New York after he was charged with assaulting the keyboard player Julia Nagle. He was sent back to the UK for rehab. Smith never viewed commercial success as his prime objective, but the Fall’s tally of 31 studio albums and 32 live albums represented a kind of triumph in itself. They topped the UK independent album chart with Grotesque (After the Gramme) in 1980 and again with Perverted By Language (1983), Reformation Post TLC (2007) and Your Future Our Clutter (2010), and occasionally flirted with wider chart success. The Frenz Experiment (1988) reached 19 on the mainstream album chart, Shift-Work (1991) went to 17, and in 1993 The Infotainment Scan climbed to No 9. Though Smith’s tuneless, declamatory delivery and the group’s clattering, grinding rhythms generally made them the antidote to singles bands, the Fall nonetheless scored high on the indie chart with such singles as Totally Wired, How I Wrote “Elastic Man” and Kicker Conspiracy, and even had a genuine Top 30 hit in 1987 with a cover of R Dean Taylor’s 60s classic, There’s a Ghost in My House. Smith’s work defied categorisation, combining as it did elements of satire, social commentary, grumbling misanthropy and an abiding enthusiasm for cunning wordplay. The range of his references seemed to know no bounds, and took in literature, philosophy, the occult and football. How I Wrote “Elastic Man” (1980) put listeners inside the mind of a struggling writer burdened by the albatross of his past success. In It’s a Curse (1993), Smith took an oblique but caustic swipe at music critics. Gross Chapel – British Grenadiers (1986) was an extraordinarily menacing piece partly constructed from the old British Grenadiers marching song. In Rowche Rumble (1979), he delivered a furious rant about tranquillisers made by the Swiss drug company Roche. Theme From Sparta FC (2003) was a punchy battle hymn for the obscure Greek football team of the title – Smith’s third wife, Elena Poulou, is Greek – complete with fake-bouzouki sounds. The slow, bluesy Hip Priest (1982) might have been autobiographical, while also sounding like a parody of Jim Morrison and the Doors. Born in Broughton, Salford, to Irene (nee Brownhill) and Jack Smith, Mark moved to Prestwich with his family while he was young. His father was a plumber who had served in the Black Watch infantry regiment at the end of the second world war, and had an ancestor who fought at the battle of Rorke’s Drift during the Anglo-Zulu war. He passed his 11-plus and went to Stand grammar school, but quit at 16 and took a job as a shipping clerk on Salford docks. At night, he took an A-level class in literature and numbered Kurt Vonnegut, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell and HP Lovecraft among his favourite authors (the Fall was named after the Albert Camus novel La Chute). He took an interest in politics and, after a spell as a Labour supporter, veered further left and joined the Socialist Workers party. This never stopped him from expressing illiberal or conservative views. The Fall’s first live show, with the original fellow band members Una Baines (Smith’s then partner), Tony Friel and Martin Bramah, and Steve Ormrod as the very short-lived first drummer, was in the basement of the North West Arts office on King Street, Manchester, on 23 May 1977, and their first recordings appeared on a Virgin Records compilation called Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus. Their first single, It’s the New Thing, was released by Step Forward Records in November 1978, and their debut album Live at the Witch Trials followed in April 1979. Their career would be for ever associated with the DJ John Peel, a staunch supporter for whom the Fall recorded 24 radio sessions between 1978 and 2004, though Peel and Smith never became close. “Me and John had an agreement,” Smith said. “We never were friends or anything like that.” In 1983, Smith married the American guitarist Brix Smith (born Laura Salenger, now Brix Smith Start), whose tenure with the Fall helped move them in a more polished and commercial direction. Before she left both her husband and the band in 1989, they had enjoyed both critical and commercial success with albums such as The Wonderful and Frightening World of the Fall, This Nation’s Saving Grace, Bend Sinister, and especially, The Frenz Experiment, all on the Beggars Banquet label. In 1986 Smith also found the time to write a play, Hey, Luciani, on Pope John Paul I, which ran for two weeks at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, starring Smith and the performance artist Leigh Bowery. He then went on to write the music for the Michael Clark ballet I Am Curious, Orange, recorded as the Fall album I Am Kurious Oranj (1988). During the 90s, as the Fall enjoyed more success with albums including Shift-Work, Code: Selfish and Middle Class Revolt, Smith undertook a variety of guest roles. He featured on the D.O.S.E. single Plug Myself In (1996) and collaborated on projects with Elastica, the Clint Boon Experience, Edwyn Collins and Long Fin Killie. He made his first appearance on Top of the Pops when he performed with Inspiral Carpets on their 1994 hit I Want You. His first solo album, The Post Nearly Man, was released in 1998, and his second, Pander! Panda! Panzer!, in 2002. He formed Von Sudenfed with the electronic duo Mouse on Mars, and they released the album Tromatic Reflexxions (2007). With Mark Blaney, he made the albums Smith and Blaney (2008) and The Train Part Three (2009), and he appeared on Gorillaz’ album Plastic Beach (2010). In 2005, BBC4 aired the documentary The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of Mark E Smith. Three years later, Smith published an autobiography, Renegade: The Lives and Tales of Mark E Smith, written in collaboration with Austin Collins. Smith’s second marriage, to Saffron Prior, ended in 1995. He married Elena in 2001. She became the Fall’s keyboard player the following year, but left in 2016. The Fall had continued to make albums at a remarkable rate, The Unutterable (2000) being the first of 11 over the next 17 years, concluding with New Facts Emerge (2017). • Mark Edward Smith, writer, singer and musician, born 5 March 1957; died 24 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/04/roy-moore-trump-backs-alabama-senate-candidate","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T18:05:54Z","webTitle":"'Go get 'em, Roy': Trump backs accused child molester Moore for Senate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/04/roy-moore-trump-backs-alabama-senate-candidate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/04/roy-moore-trump-backs-alabama-senate-candidate","fields":{"headline":"'Go get 'em, Roy': Trump backs accused child molester Moore for Senate","bodyText":"Donald Trump has thrown his full support behind Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race, tweeting his endorsement before calling the controversial candidate to say: “Go get ’em, Roy!” Trump tweeted early on Monday: “Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!” Referring again to the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, the president added: “Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes, tough on crime, strong on military and borders...&amp; so much more.” Moore has lost the backing of many top Republicans since the Washington Post first reported allegations of sexual misconduct with young women decades ago. Trump praised him in recent weeks but had not formally backed him. Several hours after his tweets, Trump called Moore. The call was announced by the Alabama Republican’s wife on Facebook. “Judge Moore just got off the phone with President Trump,” Kayla Moore wrote. “We have his full support! Thank you Mr President! Let’s MAGA!” The Moore campaign confirmed to the Guardian that the conversation had taken place. In a follow-up statement, a spokesperson said: “President Trump called Judge Moore a ‘fighter’ and expressed his eagerness to have Judge Moore fighting for his agenda in Washington. The president wrapped up the call with a ‘Go get ’em, Roy!’” The White House later issued a statement in which a spokesman, Raj Shah, said: “The president had a positive call with Judge Roy Moore during which they discussed the state of the Alabama Senate race and the president endorsed Judge Moore’s campaign.” The White House has said the president has no plans to make campaign appearances with Moore but he has agreed to headline a campaign-style rally in Pensacola, Florida, less than 20 miles from the Alabama border, just four days before the vote. The special election, to fill the seat vacated by Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, will take place on Tuesday 12 December. Trump supported Luther Strange, the appointed incumbent, in the primary but Strange was beaten by Moore, a controversial hardline conservative who had the backing of Steve Bannon, Trump’s former senior White House strategist, who is mounting a challenge to the party establishment. Bannon is due to hold a rally with Moore on Tuesday. Moore has defied calls to step down over the allegations by a number of women, one of whom alleges he initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 and he was in his 30s. Moore denies all the allegations and said last week they were the result of a conspiracy that included “lesbians, gays, bisexuals and socialists”. Even before the allegations, Moore was a controversial figure. He has suggested that “homosexual conduct” should be criminalized and was twice removed as chief justice of the Alabama supreme court for defying federal court orders. On Monday morning, he tweeted: “Thankful for President Trump’s support. The America First agenda will #MAGA. Can’t wait to help him #DrainTheSwamp.” The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who has said he believes Moore’s accusers, has now taken a slightly different position. “I think that at this point, we’re just going to let the people of Alabama make their decision,” McConnell told the Associated Press on Sunday, adding that he believed the Senate ethics committee would take up an investigation if Moore were elected. “The ethics committee will have to consider the matters that have been litigated in the campaign should that particular candidate win,” McConnell said on ABC’s This Week. “And I’m confident they’ll come up with the right conclusion.” However, some Republicans continued to express their outrage over Moore. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump critic, tweeted on Monday afternoon: “Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity.” Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, is a prosecutor who helped to convict two Ku Klux Klan members over the 1963 bombing of an African American church in Birmingham in which four young girls were killed. Moore had fallen to level with or behind Jones in the deep red state, before, observers believe, sexual harassment allegations against the prominent Democrats John Conyers and Al Franken swayed the minds of some voters. The realclearpolitics.com polling average for the Alabama race now gives Moore a three-point lead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/09/grandparents-wedding-roxanne-drinkers-crab-sandwiches","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T06:45:00Z","webTitle":"Family life: My grandparents’ wedding in a cafe toilet; Roxanne by the Police; crab sandwiches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/09/grandparents-wedding-roxanne-drinkers-crab-sandwiches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/09/grandparents-wedding-roxanne-drinkers-crab-sandwiches","fields":{"headline":"Family life: My grandparents’ wedding in a cafe toilet; Roxanne by the Police; crab sandwiches","bodyText":"Snapshot: My grandparents’ wedding – in a toilet I have been going to Dublin for 40 years, first to visit my student boyfriend, Seán, who became my husband, and then living there in the early 80s. During many years of family holidays in Kerry in the 90s, we would always come up to Dublin for a weekend and in this century, two of my daughters went to Trinity College. One of them subsequently made her life in Dublin and played rugby for Ireland and Seán ended his working life in Dublin. In all those years, I had never been to the Avoca cafe in Suffolk Street and had only visited the associated shop on one occasion. One day in September I was visiting my daughter Ailis, and we decided to go out to have lunch. I waited for her to suggest somewhere, as she is the Dubliner, and when no suggestion was forthcoming, found myself proposing the Avoca. On washing my hands in the ladies cloakroom, I looked up at the framed photos on the walls. There was a series of framed vintage photos with labels in French, such as “A ma tante”. Looking at the one labelled “A mes grandparents”, I thought how fitting the frame was and then my brain caught up with what my eyes were gazing at. There on the wall was a photo of my Scottish paternal grandparents on their wedding day, 28 January 1921, in Colombo, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon)! I have this photo of Norman Chisholm and Florence (Flora) Kelly in an album at home. Shocked and hardly believing what I was seeing, I looked at the adjacent photo, which was of their wedding party, a copy of which I have on my wall at home. Included in this image is Leo, Flora’s brother, who had introduced his friend Norrie to Flora. Rejoining my daughter at our table in the cafe, I tried to convey to her the unbelievable coincidence that had occurred and I had to return immediately with my phone to take photos to ensure that this wasn’t just my imagination. Talking to the staff in the shop after lunch, we were told that the photos had been bought at a fair in either France or the UK but they could give me no further information. The story sounded so fantastical that I was surprised they believed me. Something compelled me to go to the Avoca that day and I still feel a little shiver of amazement when I think of the coincidence. I call in every time I am in Dublin now to check to see if Granny and Grandad are still there … Morag Egan Playlist: Sting took the bite out of our police raids Roxanne by the Police “Roxanne you don’t have to put on the red light / Those days are over you don’t have to sell your body to the night” In the late 1970s, I was a rookie cop in a northern English city centre. Despite the poverty, deprivation and unemployment, the youngsters knew how to enjoy themselves in the pubs and clubs. At weekends they would stand shoulder to shoulder in the crowded, hot, dark, alcohol-scented atmosphere. Overtime was the norm in those days: completing an arrest, appearing in court, football matches and special events all brought in extra money, but the long unsocial hours and hard work made it difficult to be acquainted with the pop scene. So you latched on to a particular tune, only heard occasionally and in snippets. Roxanne was a favourite of mine: an unusual catchy melody sung by local boy Sting who was making it big in the pop world. Each Friday and Saturday evenings overtime was offered on a task force van, consisting of several uniformed officers, to help keep order in the busy city centre. However, before the serious fighting began, the task force visited pubs seeking out underage drinkers. It was difficult gauging the ages of girls in particular – some 14 or 15-year-olds could pass for 18, 19 or 20. Even if you spotted a likely group, most had their alibis ready: dates of birth making them just over 18; those more prepared had memorised the birthdays, addresses and full names of older sisters and cousins. Roxanne was often playing as the task force went into the pubs. Our mission was made more difficult as the bouncers quickly got the message to the management that the police had arrived (this in the days before mobiles). The underagers distanced themselves from their drinks or made for the sanctuary of the toilets. Even if we saw this, we were often impeded by the sea of people who seemed to swirl in a tidal current, sweeping us away from the suspects. Officers merged into this involuntarily, having to slowly sway in unison with everyone and usually to the reggae-cum-rock-cum-slow ballad rhythm of Roxanne. It was several weeks before I realised that as the task force approached pubs the bouncers signalled to the DJ, who quickly put on Roxanne by the Police, so alerting everyone inside that the real police were arriving. Roxanne has convivial memories for me: it made for an amicable atmosphere in the early evening among the drinkers, inclining the police, too, to be more affable. And pub managements were happy that no underage drinking had been discovered to threaten the liquor licence, while youngsters were relieved to have escaped prosecution. For me it was my first lesson in policing: there are no coincidences. Stewart Hamilton We love to eat: Grandad’s crab sandwiches Ingredients Freshly cooked crab White unsliced loaf of bread Cornish butter Pepper Malt vinegar I’m not sure my staunchly Methodist mother ever approved of my grandad naming his fishing boat Playboy, the Hefner overtones probably seeming a step too far for her liking. But for me, as a child growing up in the 60s, the name seemed to capture the essence of everything that I loved about him: the grandad who hid Fox’s Glacier Mints in the hedgerows between our houses for my sister and me to find; the grandad who made a mysterious molasses sweetmeat called locust every Christmas that none of us ever knew the recipe for but devoured enthusiastically; and the grandad who would sit us on his knee and tell us stories of the oranges he picked from the trees when he was stationed in Italy as a young soldier during the first world war. My grandad’s expeditions in Playboy kept us plentifully supplied with fish in summer. Setting off from the inner harbour of Polperro in Cornwall, he would steer out to sea, past the majestic Peak Rock and on to the best fishing grounds known to the locals, where an abundance of pollack and mackerel could be caught with the most basic rod and line. Catching a crab, however, required more skill but was not beyond his capability and when one of the prized creatures was brought home it was often my job to assist with the preparation. After cooking and cooling the crab, my grandad would prise off the large claws. Then, sitting me at his kitchen table, he would furnish me with a large metal weight and a fork, which I would use to crack the shells open and pull out the chunks of precious white meat. The temptation to eat some of the spoils during this operation was often too great, but finally a reasonably sized bowlful would be ready. Taking a fresh, white loaf, my grandad would remove the crust from one end and then butter the exposed surface before deftly cutting off a thick slice. This step would be repeated until there was a neat pile stacked up and we could begin assembling the sandwiches; the only accompaniments were a sprinkling of white pepper and a few drops of malt vinegar. The final ingredient was the Cornish landscape. We would put the sandwiches on a tray and take them outside to eat in the sunshine. We would munch in silence, downing glasses of non-alcoholic Whiteway’s Cydrax and listen to the gulls crying overhead.

It was the blockbuster that breathed, the film replicant made flesh. In returning to the source material of the original Blade Runner (itself adapted from Philip K Dick’s 1968 novel), director Denis Villeneuve could by rights have got away with ticking the appropriate boxes and contentedly riding a wave of shared nostalgia. Instead, he opted for full immersion, a deep dive into the subject matter, even at the risk of losing his bearings. I’ve rarely seen a film so dazzled and entranced by its own possibilities. Scripted by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, Blade Runner 2049 alights in dystopian LA three decades after the end of the Ridley Scott classic. Ryan Gosling plays K, a replicant cop on a four-year time clock, charged with hunting down the last of the more durable early models. In the dust-blown grounds of a protein farm, he finds a box of bones. The box, in turn, points the way towards a missing child and a vast existential mystery that could conceivably be a new creation myth. His boss, Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright) is outraged by the discovery. If replicants can reproduce, does that not make them human? “This breaks the world, K,” she says. “Do you know what that means?” And K believes that he does, at least up to a point. But after that he’s working blind because the implications of the bones strike close to home, calling into question his very self. It’s hard to dispassionately investigate a mystery when the mystery is you. Scott’s 1982 original was a beguiling cyber-noir, perfectly realised and tightly wound, opening up in its final section to leave a trail of tantalising loose ends. Villeneuve’s film duly resolves some of those outstanding questions, tracking down hard-boiled Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) to a ghostly Las Vegas that appears to have been refashioned as a pop-culture dustbin. But, crucially, it also piles in with fresh questions of its own. The script’s reference to Nabokov’s Pale Fire (“cells interlinked with cells interlinked”) made me think of the studies that claim the majority of body cells regenerate every seven years to the point where we become almost wholly different people. Blade Runner 2049, perhaps, is the cinema equivalent: a prog-rock extrapolation of the earlier film, rapturous, transformative and endlessly self-questioning. Even during its fraught fights and chases, one has the sense that the picture (like its hero) is examining itself in the mirror, wondering what it is and just where it fits in. Small wonder that some of the old elements sit awkwardly on its frame. When it was released in October, Villeneuve’s film drew criticism for cleaving to the original’s 80s-era gender politics, laying on a spread of soft-porn commercials and scantily clad sex-bots. And fair enough; these trappings could be jarring. But the sequel was at least smart enough to acknowledge that such sexual shorthand may itself be a construct – or a crude algorithm by which the users are eventually able to form a genuine bond. Returning to his poky apartment, K (a replicant) is greeted by Joi (a hologram). K and Joi are false; their life is phoney – and yet this relationship is arguably the film’s warmest and most human interaction. Their love is a program, but that doesn’t mean it’s not love. Is it redundant to note that a film about artificial life should itself be artificial? Do we need to be reminded that the world on screen is fake? Those rainswept urban canyons were concocted by technicians and beautifully framed by the cinematographer Roger Deakins. So Villeneuve’s movie is a simulacrum, an artificial landscape staffed with paid performers, just like every other fiction film ever made. That’s the deal, it’s what cinema does. But it’s so layered and textured that it infects us, transports us. And somewhere along the way we become like K and Joi, immersed in their drama, “more human than human”. This is surely the key test of every great movie. Audaciously, Blade Runner 2049 suggests it may be the key test of life. If we believe in the illusion, it means that, for us, it is real.

As Peter Stöger took his final bow in front of the Köln fans who had travelled to Schalke on Saturday, doffing his cap, he was given the warm send-off his work over the last four-and-a-half years has deserved. Teenage defender Tim Handwerker wasn’t the only player wiping tears from his eyes as they said goodbye to the coach. When the team coach arrived back at Rhein-Energie Stadion on Saturday evening, a throng of fans applauded Stöger off as he emerged. Quite rightly. Only the legendary Hennes Weisweiler – who gave his name to the club’s famous billy goat mascot – had been at the helm longer. When Stöger’s immediate replacement Stefan Ruthenbeck, who steps up from the under-19s until the winter break at least, said: “I’m not trying to fill his shoes” after Sunday’s training session, he was not overstating. “They are too big to fill, anyway,” Ruthenbeck concluded. As Ruthenbeck starts the new week, there will be two training sessions on Monday as he attempts to galvanise the squad with a bit of tough love. For while Stöger’s last hurrah on the Effzeh bench was a worthy one – as they gutsily twice came back from a deficit to prise a point from Gelsenkirchen – and his name deserves to be cherished in the context of the club’s history, the new coach has a steep climb to negotiate. Even after Saturday’s game against an in-form side, Köln sit bottom with no wins and only three points. No team in Bundesliga history has stayed up with such a low tally at the same stage. Seyrou Guirassy’s brace at Schalke is responsible for a third of their league goals, and statistically they have the worst defence (conceding 27) as well as the weakest attack. Given that Stöger’s team had the sixth-best defence last season, with 42 scored against them, their form at the back is perhaps even more concerning than their lack of punch up top. At least there’s an easy explanation for the latter with Anthony Modeste, scorer of almost exactly half their Bundesliga goals last season and of 40 league goals in two campaigns, having left for Tianjin Quanjian. If this season had been about regression to the mean, that would be fair enough. The delirium of the club’s return after 25 years, wildly celebrated in this most optimistic of footballing cities, long kept scrutiny of the team’s domestic form on the back burner. Too much so, perhaps, as things have spiralled out of control. It’s great to see a team embrace the Europa League rather than moan about it, but when even at crisis point on Saturday, local attentions quickly switched to Thursday’s ‘decisive’ tie in Belgrade against Crvena Zvezda (Red Star Belgrade), you couldn’t help but ask if more attention to the home front might not be in order. That is surely inevitable now, but it could be too late. This is a passionately followed club but a volatile one, where wobbles can quickly be followed by a descent into chaos. Sunday’s press conference to announce Stöger going was a nod to this, with president Werner Spinner and managing director Alexander Wehrle on one hand laudably frank and on the other perhaps too open about the doubt that has existed. Sporting director Jörg Schmadtke went on 24 October, and Köln have appeared to drift ever since. Wehrle admitted they told Stöger they were looking at alternative candidates in early November, after the loss to Hoffenheim. In the days following another home defeat to Hertha, they let him know they were moving on – three weeks after initially marking his card. The city’s newspaper Express, which broke the news of Stöger’s exit on Saturday night, also reported ex-Hamburg man Dietmar Beiersdorfer as the new frontrunner to replace Schmadtke after he was spotted in town. “Maybe he was here for the Christmas market?” Spinner suggested glibly. This appointment is more than window dressing. In fact, the appointment of the right sporting director is arguably even more important than the next coach. Horst Heldt, Hannover’s Köln-born sporting director, had been expected to take over but his release couldn’t be negotiated. The new man, whether Beiersdorfer or someone else, is going to have play a blinder in this transfer window to give Stöger’s successor at least a fighting chance of staying up, because the current squad simply don’t look capable. To (at least nominally) replace Modeste, Jhon Córdoba was brought in from Mainz. The Colombian has plenty of merit, but never stood a chance of matching the Frenchman’s goal output. The widespread perception was that the club had wasted €15m on a forward who had never scored more than five in a league season. Money was spent for the future, bringing in Jorge Meré and Jannes Horn, but the present looks bleak with so much confidence drained. In that sense, maybe European qualification could be a fillip rather than mere placebo. The coaching search will not be straightforward either, with the club’s preferred candidate Markus Anfang (another Köln native) of Bundesliga 2 leaders Holsten Kiel apparently held to an enormous €10m release clause by the club’s president Steffen Schneekloth. Perhaps by default, Ruthenbeck has an opportunity to carve himself a future. It’s extraordinary to think that, had the timing been slightly different, 51-year-old Austrian Stöger could have been in charge at Dortmund. He belatedly made BVB’s three-man shortlist to replace Thomas Tuchel – a list that has proved a kiss of death, with all three enduring difficult starts to the campaign. The talk in France was that Lucien Favre, Dortmund’s first choice in the summer, was set for the boot had Nice lost at Toulouse on Wednesday (they eventually scored twice in the last 10 minutes to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 win). Peter Bosz’s own struggles are well documented, of course. Stöger could well bounce back in time, and few would argue against that being a good thing. He pulled Köln up from the second tier, stabilised them and took them to the giddy heights of fifth last season, earning himself an impromptu champagne bath from his giddy players in his final post-match press conference of the season. It’s sad that it all fell apart, but those travelling fans at the weekend know exactly what he did, and will continue to remember the good times. Talking points • Bosz is still in work, with Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc saying after the 1-1 draw at Leverkusen that “we want to achieve a turnaround with Bosz,” but they really played with fire. The coach might owe Wendell a bottle of something bubbly after the defender’s red card for a dreadful tackle on Gonzalo Castro just before half-time helped stem the Leverkusen flow. Until then, it had been fortune and a magnificent display from the maligned Roman Bürki that kept Heiko Herrlich’s side to a one-goal lead. Andriy Yarmolenko’s equaliser gives Bosz something to work with, though the additions of Maximilian Philipp and Castro to a big injury list are added headaches before the trip to Real Madrid. • Again, Bayern Munich extended their lead at the top – now six points – without excelling themselves. They had to battle to beat Hannover, but there were two big picture pluses for Jupp Heynckes. Thomas Müller was sublime on his return from six weeks out with a muscle injury, while Franck Ribéry was also back to play his 235th Bundesliga game for the club, becoming the club’s leading foreign appearance maker in the league. André Breitenreiter’s side could consider themselves a touch unlucky, denied an equaliser at 1-0 when Nicklas Fullkrug was harshly made to take a penalty again after scoring, before missing the retake. • Bayern have Hoffenheim to thank for their cushion, with Julian Nagelsmann’s side excellent in dismantling Leipzig 4-0. They also did FC Hollywood a turn in beginning to get the best out of loanee Serge Gnabry after an injury-affected start to the season – the former Werder man scored twice, including a sublime chip from some 45 yards with Peter Gulacsi not even that far off his line. • It was after the Lord Mayor’s Show for Mönchengladbach at Wolfsburg, where Dieter Hecking’s current side fell to his old one and became the latest victims of the Bayern curse – the last nine sides to have beaten the behemoth in the Bundesliga have gone on to lose their following match. All credit to Martin Schmidt’s team, however, who were excellent and have now lost just one of 10 games under a coach not greeted by universal approval. • Kevin-Prince Boateng’s beautifully struck late winner at former club Hertha helped his present one, Eintracht Frankfurt, establish the best away record. Three cheers too for Augsburg, whose win at Mainz – incorporating two fine finishes from Alfred Finnbogason – put them level on points with sixth-placed Dortmund. There was also more fuel to the campaign for Philipp Max to get a Germany call-up, after his seventh assist of the season from left-back. • It’s now two home wins in two for Werder Bremen’s interim coach Florian Kohfeldt, with Max Kruse hitting a stylish winner to beat Stuttgart after quick thinking by Fin Bartels, who played him in from a free-kick. The points were even more vital after fellow strugglers Freiburg and Hamburg cancelled each other out in a tense goalless draw. Results: Hertha Berlin 1-2 Eintracht Frankfurt, Wolfsburg 3-0 Mönchengladbach, Mainz 1-3 Augsburg, Leverkusen 1-1 Dortmund, Bayern 3-1 Hanover, Schalke 2-2 Cologne, Hoffenheim 4-0 Leipzig, Werder Bremen 1-0 Stuttgart, Freiburg 0-0 Hamburg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/05/qa-detention-regime-is-designed-to-break-refugees-says-gillian-triggs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T20:24:19Z","webTitle":"Q&A: detention regime is designed to break refugees, says Gillian Triggs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/05/qa-detention-regime-is-designed-to-break-refugees-says-gillian-triggs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/05/qa-detention-regime-is-designed-to-break-refugees-says-gillian-triggs","fields":{"headline":"Q&A: detention regime is designed to break refugees, says Gillian Triggs","bodyText":"Former human rights commissioner Gillian Triggs has described Australia’s offshore detention regime as designed to “break” refugees, warning the inhumanity on Manus Island had reached such a point that “as a nation, we have to respond”. The plight of the hundreds of men on Manus Island provoked a fiery debate on ABC’s Q&amp;A on Monday night, after a question from Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Muhamat. Labor senator Lisa Singh, whose party reopened offshore detention centres in 2012, said they may not have done so if they had known the situation would reach this point. “I think if we were to reflect on where we are now, that this is not the point we would have agreed to have been at,” Singh said. “And I don’t think that ever was the intention.” She said the government’s refusal to accept New Zealand’s offer to take 150 men suggested they wanted people to suffer or die. That provoked outrage from Liberal senator Eric Abetz, who labelled the comment as “highly offensive”. The Institute of Public Affairs director of policy Simon Breheny also dismissed any notion that the government was intentionally mistreating or inflicting cruelty on those in offshore detention. But Triggs, a vocal critic of the policy, said the evidence suggested otherwise. “This program is designed to break these people. And to send them back,” she said. Abetz labelled the proposition as “preposterous”. He asked why Australia could not at least celebrate stopping the boats and stopping drownings at sea. Triggs said offshore detention regime had now become Australia’s shame. “It’s a difficult decision for both political parties,” Triggs said. “But I think the inhumanity has reached a level where we, as a nation, we have to respond.” Earlier, a young Muslim woman became emotional while telling the panellists of the the far-reaching impacts of Donald Trump’s retweeting of far-fight group Britain First, which had tweeted inflammatory anti-Islamic content. “It’s definitely a struggle when you’re living in a society where you think you’re welcomed and you think the people around you are going to be there,” she said. Breheny, of the IPA, dismissed the discussion about Trump’s tweets, as “extraordinary” and lacking substance. He wanted to talk about Trump’s proposed corporate tax cuts instead. Singh, the Labor senator, attacked him for what she described as flippancy. “That the president of the US, the leader of the free world is targeting a certain group within our society and that’s having effects on the women here that have shared that experience with us tonight here in Australia,” Singh said. “That’s outrageous. It’s terrible. And we can’t be flippant about it.” Singh was later asked whether Australians should be concerned about creeping foreign influence in the political system, given the recent revelations about Labor senator Sam Dastyari and Chinese donor Huang Xiangmo. The panel questioned the timing of the stories about Dastyari, given the many months that have passed since his meeting with Huang Xiangmo. Singh suggested Australia’s intelligence agencies may have been “politicised”. “If our intelligence agencies are being politicised in some way by, willingly or unwillingly by the government, that is a huge concern, a huge concern,” she said. Earlier, Triggs was confronted by Calum Thwaites, one of the students involved in the infamous racial discrimination case at the Queensland University of Technology. Triggs said she thought the commission handled the complaint excellently, and was constrained by a lack of contact details for the students and the university’s insistence that they not be contacted, among other things. But Thwaites said: “I can’t understand Professor Triggs, how you think the commission acted excellently when seven students weren’t told about the complaint for 14 months, regardless of what the university may or may not have said, when it wasn’t their responsibility, statute or otherwise, to inform us,” he said, “As a result of this seven students almost had their lives ruined.” Triggs said she deeply regretted that the case was not settled. She said the commission’s role was to deal with such complaints before they made it to court, which had failed in this instance. “But had we not made that, played that role of trying to achieve a conciliation between the parties, the complainant would have gone to the federal court in any event,” she said. “So the role of the commission is really to provide an access to social justice, a way of solving a problem that avoids going to court... that failed in this case.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/12/spinning-tillie-walden-review-portrait-of-adolescence-on-ice-graphic-novel-skating-memoir","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"Spinning by Tillie Walden review – portrait of adolescence on ice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/12/spinning-tillie-walden-review-portrait-of-adolescence-on-ice-graphic-novel-skating-memoir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/12/spinning-tillie-walden-review-portrait-of-adolescence-on-ice-graphic-novel-skating-memoir","fields":{"headline":"Spinning by Tillie Walden review – portrait of adolescence on ice","bodyText":"Spinning, the fourth book in two years by the Ignatz award-winning cartoonist Tillie Walden, is surely her best to date. A memoir of the decade Walden spent as a competitive skater – having taken to the ice as a small girl, she did not abandon it until shortly before she graduated from high school – it conveys brilliantly not only the dedication involved in mid-level competitive sport, but also the occasional (and sometimes more-than-occasional) loathing. In a longish afterword, Walden, the acclaimed author of The End of Summer, insists that her latest comic “ended up not being about ice-skating at all”. But I disagree. Yes, Spinning touches on bullying, her complex relationship with her parents, and her sexuality (for which reason it would, I think, make a brilliant Christmas present for a teenage girl). Nevertheless, the rink is always centre stage. How could it be anywhere else when it’s the place she goes both to lose and to find herself? When the book opens, Walden is 10, and her family has just moved, somewhat abruptly, to Texas from New Jersey. Theoretically, skating should represent a kind of continuity: just as before, she will attend figure classes when the rest of the world is still asleep, and practise with her synchronised group at the other end of the day. But this isn’t exactly how it works. What skating means now is yet more unfamiliar faces; and while her fellows on the ice need to work out how much of a threat this talented newcomer presents, she in turn must learn a fresh set of technical terms (what her Texas synchro group calls a “splice”, for instance, she knows only as an “intersection”). Why, then, does she keep going, enduring both the early morning alarm calls and the feeling that she will never be quite good enough? It’s to do, perhaps, with those moments when she is overtaken with a sudden sense of ease: “The only hard part of a spiral was finding your momentum. Once you were moving fast enough and your leg was in the air, it felt like you could go on for ever.” Walden’s memoir is, at 396 pages, quite a long read. But it’s never anything less than wholly absorbing, her interest lying not in medals, certificates and all the rest of the paraphernalia that come with the world it depicts, but in what it really felt like to win and to lose; to spend so much time alone in hotel bedrooms at such a young age; to wear all that makeup, not to mention those hateful tan tights (even as she disdains the “princess” look, she is drawn to it). And it’s a beautiful book, too, the muted blues she has used to draw her strips bringing to mind old bruises, which could hardly be more appropriate in the circumstances. Intimate and charming, Spinning already has the feeling of a coming-of-age classic – and yet, amazingly, its talented author has only just hit 21. • Spinning by Tillie Walden is published by SelfMadeHero (£14.99).

According to sources, MEPs were told by the chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, that Theresa May had conceded after days of intense talks that the province would be treated as a special case. A draft of the text of a 15-page joint statement between the European commission and the British government is said to include a commitment in paragraph 48 that “in the absence of agreed solutions the UK will ensure that there continues to be continued regulatory alignment” with the internal market and customs union. Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, told RTE News that Ireland had been reassured that there would be no re-emergence of a hard border. “Certainly the indications we have is that we are in a much better place than we have been in Brexit negotiations to date,” Coveney said. “We have now a language that gives us the safeguards we need.” It is understood Ireland sees the phrase “regulatory alignment” as providing the highest degree of comfort to both sides, allowing talks to move to the next phase while at the same time giving room for manoeuvre for negotiations in the second phase. The UK still hopes that an ambitious and unprecedented trade deal will be struck with the EU in the future that makes the agreement struck on Monday academic. However, the formulation that appears to have been struck by London and Dublin would in effect keep Northern Ireland in keys aspects of the single market and customs union in event of a less generous trade accord being settled in the future. Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists, reiterated her party’s stance that the province must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the the UK. “We will not accept any form of regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom,” Foster said in a strongly worded statement. “The economic and constitutional integrity of the UK must not be compromised in any way.” One senior DUP source described the text of the joint statement as an “Irish government-inspired” leak, though no formal statement from the party has been issued. Sammy Wilson, the MP for East Antrim, stressed that he and the other nine DUP MPs in Westminster “had the leverage” to block an unacceptable deal given Theresa May’s dependence on the party for a working majority in the Commons. In a sign of the risk posed to the government by the Irish border issue, Scotland’s first minister and the mayor of London were quick to call for special treatment too: Emerging from a meeting with Barnier and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Monday morning, the leader of the Greens in the European parliament, Philippe Lamberts, said that he had seen the joint text and Britain had accepted the “reality” of their situation. “The pie is almost ready. It was a surprise to me,” he said. “But it is a matter of [Britain] facing reality. I think agreement is there.” The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, tweeted: “Tell me why I like Mondays! Encouraged after my phone call with Taoiseach on progress on #Brexit issue of Ireland. Getting closer to sufficient progress at December #EUCO.” Tusk had earlier in the day cancelled a planned trip to the Middle East in order to concentrate on the Brexit talks and make preparations on the EU’s guidelines for a future trading relationship with the UK. He is seeing May later on Monday. A final sign off in the joint text will be made by May and Juncker at a lunch in Brussels on Monday. Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, called a special meeting of all party leaders to update them on Brexit at lunchtime. A statement planned for 2.30pm was postponed. At the regular morning No 10 lobby briefing May’s official spokesman had insisted there would be no difference in the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. “The PM has been clear that the UK is leaving the EU as a whole, and the territorial and economic integrity of the UK will be protected,” he said, refusing to elaborate further on what that meant. Beyond the issue of the Irish border, Lambert said there was “still some fine tuning to be done” on citizens’ rights, but not enough to hold up talks on trade. EU sources said the UK has conceded on allowing EU nationals living in the UK to continue to export social security benefits such as the winter fuel allowance to their home countries. It is holding out on charging applicants for settled status and there are still some technical discussions ongoing about the role of the European court of justice in protecting the rights of EU nationals, it is understood.

The main piece, covering that game, is here. But the rest of the weekend turned out to be rather lively as well … Talking points • Unless you’ve been under a rock, you’ve probably heard by now about Benevento’s draw with Milan, and more specifically about the manner in which the game ended. After losing the opening 14 games of their first-ever top-flight campaign, the Witches snatched a draw in the 95th minute with a header from their keeper, Alberto Brignoli. There are so many sub-plots with this one, but it is only right to start with the goalscorer himself. Brignoli is a man who professes to be a bit of a wimp about heading the ball in general, yet when Benevento won a free-kick just outside the area with time ticking down, he charged forwards despite being commanded by his manager, Roberto De Zerbi, not to. “The boss didn’t want me to go up,” acknowledged Brignoli afterwards. “He can be stubborn but I’m even more so. I said: ‘I’m going. I’m going, and that’s that.’ I leapt like a goalkeeper, not an attacker. They tell me that I looked like Aldo in the scene from [the movie] ‘Tre uomini e una gamba’ (Three men and one leg), and they are right. I was a bit crooked. I closed my eyes.” Brignoli is only the fifth keeper to score in Serie A – joining Michelangelo Rampulla, Antonio Rigamonti, Lucidio Sentimenti and, most recently, Massimo Taibi. He wasn’t even Benevento’s starting keeper at the beginning of this season, taking over from Vid Belec in October. It was hard not to warm to him, though, as he paused during post-game interviews to express solidarity with the keeper he scored against: Gianluigi Donnarumma. A point might have been the least Benevento deserved for a game in which they had more shots than Milan and held the ball, on average, much higher up the pitch. As desperate as their league standing is, performances had been improving even before this. Four of their previous five games had been lost by a single goal – including the one away to Juventus – and there have been some especially cruel twists along the way. At Cagliari they grabbed a 93rd-minute equaliser only to concede again in the 94th. Benevento thought they had earned a draw with Sassuolo as Domenico Berardi’s penalty hit the bar in injury-time. Instead, Federico Peluso headed home a winner for the Neroverdi moments later. So perhaps we should have seen this result coming. It was naive to imagine that there would be some immediate transformation for Milan under Rino Gattuso. The new manager has a modest coaching CV, and it will take more than his competitive fury to fix a team boasting plenty of talent but no clear tactical vision. As Gattuso himself observed afterwards: “It won’t help, right now, for me to raise my voice and smash my fists on the table.” This result, though, will leave a mark. “It would have been better to be stabbed than concede this goal,” added Gattuso. “The lads in the changing room were desperate.” • As Milan licked their wounds, the neighbours went top of the table. Juve’s win at Napoli had created an opportunity for Inter, who seized it eagerly with a 5-0 demolition of Chievo. Their 39 points from 15 matches equals a club record set under Roberto Mancini back in 2006-07, when they cruised to the Scudetto. Back then, though, the field had been decimated by Calciopoli. It is hard to overstate what a fantastic job Luciano Spalletti is doing as manager, in a far more competitive field. And if any one player best represents the transformation of this team, it might be Ivan Perisic – who grabbed a hat-trick on Sunday. Next up comes the small matter of a trip to Turin to take on Juventus. The last time they met, back in February, Perisic was sent off in a 1-0 defeat. • Roma rolled over Spal on Saturday, but Lazio kept hold of their coattails in the race for Champions League places, with a come-from-behind win away to Sampdoria. Not for the first time this season, it was Sergej Milinkovic-Savic who made the difference, scoring his team’s 80th-minute equaliser before setting up Felipe Caicedo’s winner with a clever reverse pass into the box (even if it did take a bit of a scramble from there before the Ecuadorian could bundle it home). • Not a happy return to Serie A for Beppe Iachini, whose first league game since replacing Cristian Bucchi as manager of Sassuolo ended in a 3-0 defeat at Fiorentina. But more encouraging signs for this young Viola team, for whom Giovanni Simeone (22 years old), Jordan Veretout (24) and Federico Chiesa (20) grabbed the goals. Results: Roma 3-1 Spal, Napoli 0-1 Juventus, Torino 1-1 Atalanta, Benevento 2-2 Milan, Bologna 1-1 Cagliari, Fiorentina 3-0 Sassuolo, Inter 5-0 Chievo, Sampdoria 1-2 Lazio.

The petition claimed that the metro, if built, would “breach the magnetic circuits” of two Zoroastrian fire temples, thus “diminishing their spiritual powers” and unleashing “dark forces”. Signed by 11,000 people, the petition concluded that, the temples being “living, vibrant ... intermediaries between God and mankind” as they are, if these “holy fires are defiled, the backlash from nature will not spare those responsible”. The third phase of Mumbai’s metro network will pass under some of the oldest, swankiest and most built up enclaves of south Mumbai – and will indeed tunnel close to two sacred Zoroastrian fire temples and a well invested with boon-granting powers. The dwindling Zoroastrian or Parsi community might number fewer than 45,000 in Mumbai (and just 56,000 in all of India) of the city’s roughly 18 million residents. But they are a high-profile group – and many of them have begun to see Ashwini Bhide, managing director of the Mumbai Metro Railway Corporation (MMRC), as an unlikely fifth horsewoman of the apocalypse. Nor is it just Parsi priests fighting the metro. The project faces the ire of environmentalists, heritage activists – and, perhaps most vocal of all in this most Indian of cities, cricketers. Mumbai desperately needs its new metro to begin to salvage its disastrously inadequate public transport system. Today the bulk of the burden is borne by the colonial-era commuter train network, which takes seven million passengers a day – seven times its intended capacity. On 29 September, 22 people died after a stampede on a footbridge at Prabhadevi, a station grossly ill-equipped to service the business towers that have risen above the former textile district of Lower Parel. The first two phases were relatively uncontroversial. Phase 1, managed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority and a joint venture between Reliance Infrastructure, the French company Veolia and the Maharashtra government, is an 11.5km east-west elevated railway that opened in 2013. Phase 2 is 40km elevated suburban train line that is currently half-built. Only the third phase is underground – and only the third phase passes under South Bombay, or SoBo, a pampered district where tolerance for intrusive metro construction is lower because so few of the rich residents need to use it. The stakes for approval of this phase, however, are high: it’s a $3.6bn (£2.7bn) partnership between the Indian government and the state of Maharashtra, with loans from the Japan International Cooperation Agency and hefty contracts for Indian agencies, as well as Chinese and Turkish infrastructure giants. Bhide insists that the metro won’t damage the Parsi temples. At a meeting brokered by the state’s chief minister between the metro authorities and a Parsi delegation that included the two clerics who put forward the petition, Bhide pointed to government studies that declared the construction safe. “We explained to them that the tunnel was going nowhere under the sanctum sanctorum,” she says. “Even the wells from which water is drawn for ceremonies are safely distant from the alignment. Moreover, they are embedded in the soil layer, and there’s a large buffer between that and the tunnel which bores through the basalt rock below.” Firoz Kotwal, who presided for several decades over the Wadia Atash Behram temple in question, confirmed as much. “The MMRC team convinced us with concrete proof that there was no danger at all to the fire temple, and the chief minister gave us a personal assurance of safety. So the hue and cry is baseless,” Kotwal says. “Neither Zoroastrianism nor its rituals are in any danger from the metro tunnel.” Kotwal also says that the “mystic circuits” cited in the petition are not a part of the ancient texts of Zoroastrianism in its 6th-century incarnation, but were introduced by the 19th-century Kshnum cult. Nevertheless, the idea has stuck. “And the minute you bring in religion, the government also panics.” The high priest of Zoroastrianism’s holiest shrine (at Udvada in neighbouring Gujarat) and the community’s representative in the secular National Commission for Minorities is similarly concerned that the petition is fear run amok. “It is the work of a minuscule group with nothing better to do,” says Dastur Khurshed Dastur. “How to deal with eccentric people with closed minds out to whip up a fear psychosis?” The Parsi Times has devoted several issues to clearing up what it calls “misinformation” regarding the 187-year-old temple, including pointing out that the MMRC certified that the temple was structurally sounder than most of its peers in Girgaon, a congested retail district. (Eight-five of the 348 buildings surveyed by MMRC were identified as having structurally problems ranging from “severe” to “very severe”.) But the petition diehards aren’t letting up. “What about spiritual integrity?” says Hanoz Mistry, one of the signatories. “An Atash Behram [temple] is a composite whole, not just the consecrated fire enthroned in the sanctum sanctorum. There is no such thing as safe distance. “Would one take the risk of constructing a metro line under a nuclear reactor, even though the concerned engineers may give all kinds of assurances on safety and structural stability? An Atash Padshah (imperial fire) is far, far more delicately and sensitively balanced and spiritually exalted.” One compromise proposed by the delegation is to move the tunnel so that it passes just outside foundations of the fire temple wall. But that would just be the first of the metro’s obstacles. Public hysteria has grown around the idea that the metro’s maw would swallow 20 cricket pitches from the public green of Azad Maidan, equally hallowed ground to some sports fans in this city. The powerful Maharashtra Cricket Association complained that the field would be lost to thousands of players young and old. They also note that the Mumbai police have commandeered an additional patch, to accommodate the group of protesters recently evicted from their traditional rallying ground, near the government secretariat – again, because of the metro construction. Bhide argues the cricketers have the facts wrong. “Only 3.5 hectares of the 20 hectare [green] would be affected, and that, too, only during construction. The state’s cricket association has relocated some of these, and staggered timings for play.” There have also been controversies centred on the MMRC’s commandeering of a 25-hectare tract of the green belt in the Aarey Milk Colony for a car depot, challenged by the National Green Tribunal, since 3,130 trees would be affected. And, more recently, about insufficient soil-testing on a stretch of tunnel below the “heritage mile”, an area of grand stone mercantile buildings. In August, a 100kg cornice fell off the JN Petit Library, a 119-year-old neo-Gothic building that has been recognised by Unesco. Activists blamed the metro for the accident, and in October the Bombay High Court issued a two-month stay on metro construction work to reinforce the Petit building. Several other buildings, meanwhile, have developed cracks. It is difficult to determine whether this has anything to do with the tunnelling: unlike Kolkata’s challenging soft-soil conditions, which stymied the construction of India’s first metro for years, Mumbai is built on basalt rock, and the metro will pass 25 metres below the surface. But the MMRC is not helping its cause by dragging its feet over inquiries made under the Right to Information Act. Whatever the validity of the protests and dangers, tunnel vision might be the bigger enemy. “The city will come to a standstill in a few years” without the metro, Bhide says. And phase three will almost certainly go forward regardless of the controversy: 14% of the civil work is complete, three tunnel boring machines have been lowered into the ground and another six are ready to go. Magnetic circuits and dark forces might delay completion beyond the planned opening date of 2021, but the existential question for the metro is when, not if: with 1.7 million commuters expected daily there is, quite literally, too much riding on the outcome.

Exhibitions Thomas Bock Born in Sutton Coldfield in 1790, Bock learned his trade as an engraver in Birmingham before being convicted of “administering concoctions of certain herbs … with the intent to cause miscarriage” and sent to Tasmania. There he worked as an engraver and illustrator before he was pardoned in 1832 and became one of the most sought-after portrait painters. Quite the life. Plus, he was one of the first Australian artists to experiment with photography. At the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, from 6 December A New Era Ever wondered what Scottish artists’ reaction was to fauvism, cubism, surrealism and abstraction? Well, wonder no more. The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art Two hosts this major exhibition – full title: A New Era: Scottish Modern Art 1900-1950 – to 10 June. Featuring more than 100 paintings from the likes of William Gillies, JD Fergusson and Alan Davie, it’s a fascinating insight into an unsung chapter of art history. Theatre Feline Intimate Australian cabaret queen and Olivier award winner Meow Meow – whose voice has been described as “honeyed cream studded with razor blades” – makes her long-awaited return to Manchester at HOME on 6 December Feline I.

Cumbrian poet Kim Moore’s The Art of Falling covers everything from her experiences as a trumpet teacher to her father’s profession as a scaffolder, as well as the suffragettes and a tattoo inspired by Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own. In My People, she writes of how some “swear without knowing they are swearing … scaffolders and plasterers and shoemakers and carers, the type of carers paid pence per minute to visit an old lady’s house”. The collection’s central sequence, however, How I Abandoned My Body to His Keeping, tells of a woman in a violent relationship and, said Moore, draws from personal experience. “The first time I wrote them they came out really raw, like therapy. But I rewrote them again and again. I started to look at other poets who write about violence. I read Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and that’s when it all came together,” she said. “It’s not a narrative sequence, saying this happened and that happened, so it doesn’t feel revealing in that way – I’m not telling the story of it. It’s more metaphors for violence … The poems feel almost like little shields I can hold in front of me at a reading.” The judges, poets Gillian Clarke and Katharine Towers, and the New Statesman’s Tom Gatti, said that Moore’s poems “accrue force and vigour as they speak to each other across the pages, delivering a thrilling encounter with language at its most irresistible and essential”. They added: “There is admirable ambition and a generosity that takes in the whole of the world, affirming it all to be worthy of poetry’s invigorating attention. Rarer still, perhaps, is Moore’s command of a poem’s closing moments – she knows when to leave quietly and when to jolt the heart. Few write as well as Moore of the limitations and transformations of the body – its animal nature that speaks to the crow or wolf; its ability to internalise the landscape (to ‘grow a sloping woodland in your heart’); its fragility and ability to attract and absorb pain, to be ‘translated by violence’.” Moore, who was born in 1981 and worked as a trumpet teacher for 13 years before focusing on poetry, is currently writing a new collection, looking at everyday experiences of sexism. “I started trying to write about the small, annoying things that women just put up with, to see what happened if I turned them into poems, put space around them. And I found that actually, they looked really bad,” she said. “These poems are a bit more angry, a bit darker, than in my first collection, which had a lot of lighter pieces.” The Geoffrey Faber prize, which is worth £1,500, is given in alternate years to a volume of verse and a volume of prose fiction “of the greatest literary merit”. It has been won in the past by Seamus Heaney, Tony Harrison, JM Coetzee and Eimear McBride."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/brain-flapping/2017/dec/01/its-a-sex-robot-but-not-as-you-know-it-exploring-the-frontiers-of-erotic-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T07:30:36Z","webTitle":"It's a sex robot, but not as you know it: exploring the frontiers of erotic technology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2017/dec/01/its-a-sex-robot-but-not-as-you-know-it-exploring-the-frontiers-of-erotic-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/brain-flapping/2017/dec/01/its-a-sex-robot-but-not-as-you-know-it-exploring-the-frontiers-of-erotic-technology","fields":{"headline":"It's a sex robot, but not as you know it: exploring the frontiers of erotic technology","bodyText":"In an old church somewhere in South London, senior computing lecturer Dr Kate Devlin lies down on top of a sleeping bag and submits to a hug from a robot. But it doesn’t look how you’d imagine a robot to look: it has no face, no hands, and none of the porny characteristics common to sex robots we see in the mainstream media. It’s a pile of plastic inflatable tubes on top of a sleeping bag, which wrap around you and pulse with air – squeezing and hugging whoever has been brave enough to lie down and try it. In my opinion it’s one of the sexiest things to come out of the Goldsmith’s sex tech hack. Although only in its second year, the sex tech hack has already managed to throw out ideas that radically challenge the way we think about sex and tech. Broadly, the products we’re used to seeing on sale offer a recognisable upgrade to our current sex toys – vibrators that connect over the internet to allow long-distance play, or sex robots which are basically sex dolls plus a simple Siri-style AI. But at the sex tech hack, the participants’ vision of the future is altogether more unusual: exploring the edges of sensual pleasure, and taking a new look at how we communicate intimately. The sex “robot” that Dr Devlin was testing came from the imaginations of team Sense Me – they wanted to create a machine that didn’t feel like a machine: something soft that could envelop you in a hug. The inflatable plastic straps wrapped around the user, squeezing and pulsating, to give a sense of comfort and restraint. Team SucCUMb explored the idea of full-body touch too, encouraging people to explore the detail of their own bodies the way they’d explore the details of an intimate partner. The product they prototyped combined augmented reality with multiple tiny vibration motors. The user would lie on a bed, looking up at a screen, where they’d see their own body in a different environment – think American Beauty, with actress Mena Suvari lying naked on a bed of falling rose petals. As the rose petals “drop” from the screen, the user feels tiny vibrations on their body. To heighten the sense that your body is not your own, they also played moaning sounds to the user, simultaneously triggering a vibrator on their throat, to make them feel as if the noises were coming from their own mouth, giving the user the strange feeling of having their pleasure led by a machine. In a similar vein, Team Fake It ‘Til You Make It explored the ways in which sex noises can enhance our experience. While there’s no hard and fast rule about what people will enjoy in bed, many of us get off more intensely if we can either make noise ourselves, or hear a partner vocally enjoying it. As the team put it: do we moan because we like it, or do we like it because we moan? The answer appears to be “a bit of both”. They trained a neural network using audio porn, and programmed a vibrator to respond with more intense vibrations when it heard what it identified as a moan. So far we’ve mostly talked about solo sex, but one of the key themes the teams were invited to explore was intimacy, which doesn’t always have to be physical, after all. I was particularly taken with Touch Pairing – an app which would pair phone screens, and display your touch gestures to another phone via colourful trails of light. The person you’d paired with could then trace your gestures back to you, and share a fingertip touch over a long distance. Other teams focused on current problems within the world of sex toys and products: team Softdongs identified an issue with packers, which are soft silicone penises worn to give yourself a bulge. But off-the-shelf it’s not always easy to find a packer that suits your body and style. This team built a tool that would allow you to design your own packer, then look at it from all angles in a virtual environment, and 3D print a mould to create your own out of silicone. “VR Sexperiments” created a series of virtual reality games that allowed users to do sexual things in a virtual world. They ranged from the curious (watching a disembodied dildo run up and down your own virtual arm, while the real-life operator ran his finger along the same line, a sexy virtual demonstration of the rubber hand illusion) to the sensual (stick this controller in your belt and pleasure this virtual robot). It’s easy to see how virtual reality could allow us to live out fantasies that would be impossible in the real world. In the virtual world, I had a penis with which I could pleasure my robotic companion. Equally I could change my body to make me larger, smaller, or completely different in some other respect. Ever wanted to have sex with a cartoon tentacle monster? In virtual reality, you can make that dream come true. Other projects explored things like fetishisation of objects, how to encourage people to pay for porn, or how to improve bedroom communication using gesture recognition. Last year’s ideas featured everything from a peacock tail that responded to physical arousal, a bra that output different colours depending on how turned on you were, and a robot that wrote its own porn. Everything the teams came up with was created over a weekend, and although most of the projects will never come to market, all of them demonstrated that new tech can help us radically reimagine the way we give and receive pleasure. Why is it that the things they created look so unlike some of the sex toys we see on the market today? Partly, I suspect, it’s because of the difference in the brief. Sex toy companies (barring some of the more innovative ones – a couple of which sponsored the hack itself) are generally looking to do “the same, but better” – creating more powerful vibrators, more intense masturbation sheaths, etcetera. They’re also driven by the market – in which consumers are wary of something that looks wildly different to what they’re used to. But the sex tech hack is a window into what’s possible when we’re not chained to ideas we’ve had in the past. When we’re not seeing “sex robots” as humanoid women or “sex toys” as things you just rub on your genitals. With the sex tech industry getting more attention, and consumers fascinated by stories of robots and gadgets and wifi-connected butt plugs, there’s a huge opportunity here. And where sex toy companies are – to some extent – hampered by consumer expectations, events like the sex tech hack highlight just how exciting the future can be. Not just better versions of the toys we’re used to, but sex toys that make us examine the edges of what we enjoy, and give us a new way to explore pleasure.

The New York Times profile, which focused on a 29-year-old Holocaust denier’s pop culture tastes and listed items in his wedding registry, has been criticized as painting a neo-Nazi in an overly sympathetic light. Many readers argued it should not have been published at all. Münzer, who volunteers at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, thought the profile lacked some crucial context. But he also believed it told an important story. “The fact that there are really ordinary people who have beliefs that are really so reminiscent of Nazi Germany is absolutely frightening,” said Münzer, whose two older sisters and father died in Nazi concentration camps. “This is not just a crazy fringe.” Münzer has been increasingly disturbed by what he has seen in the US over the past two years: a presidential campaign driven by racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic rhetoric and policies; hundreds of neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching openly through the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, in August; a president who had to be prompted to explicitly condemn those neo-Nazis, rather than casting blame for violent clashes on “many sides”. Then on Wednesday, as Americans debated the ethics of giving media attention to hate groups, Donald Trump tweeted three pieces of anti-Muslim propaganda from a fringe Islamophobic group, Britain First. “To me, it’s incredible that an American president would retweet hate messages like that,” Münzer said. “It’s just totally incredible.” Trump’s tweets sparked international headlines about a racist group with a few hundred members which is best known for harassment campaigns. A rightwing terrorist shouted “Britain first” before killing MP Jo Cox last year. The party’s deputy, found guilty last year of religiously aggravated harassment, received just 56 votes in her last run for parliament. Britain First was recently deregistered by the UK election watchdog, after failing to update its paperwork. Like neo-Nazi groups in the US, Britain First has used stunts, harassment and digital provocation to attract attention and build its profile, despite having a tiny membership and no political power. Covering such groups, which try to weaponize even negative media coverage as a recruiting tool, has been a constant challenge for journalists. Critics have questioned whether the prominence and volume of such coverage has only served to make fringe groups more powerful. In the US, neo-Nazi leaders have rejoiced at the coverage they have received, with three prominent far-right racists gushing on a podcast a year ago that the coverage had been “very good, all the things they’re doing are so good”. “The coverage only has one effect, which is the normalization of our ideas. And it doesn’t take a political scientist to figure that out. If it isn’t purposeful, then it is absurd incompetence,” said one neo-Nazi internet troll. “I think in a weird level the left, like, secretly wants us to rise,” said Richard Spencer, who was profiled in 2016 as America’s blazer-clad, “dapper white nationalist”. Such profiles of Spencer, who has degrees from elite American universities, sparked the first major wave of public outrage at news articles about white supremacists that portrayed them as bizarre and fascinating characters rather than dangerous threats. Americans of color have been quick to raise concerns about this kind of coverage, said Whitney Phillips, a digital media scholar who studies trolling, conspiracy theories and hate groups. Some coverage of white supremacists is implicitly filtered through a white perspective, she said, providing white audiences with shocking stories of “wayward white folks” rather than focusing on the danger or anxiety faced by communities of color. Part of the problem with the New York Times profile of the “Nazi next door” was that “they didn’t talk to that guy’s black neighbors”, Phillips said. “They weren’t asking questions of the groups that these ideologies create a hostile environment for.” The crucial question when profiling a neo-Nazi is “who have they harmed”, she said. Heidi Beirich, who leads the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups and individual extremists, said white supremacist groups must be covered by the media “because they are a threat to democracy, a threat in terms of domestic terrorism and hate crime”. Despite criticisms of the volume of media coverage of white supremacist groups, white supremacist violence is not covered well, Beirich said. It tends to treat white supremacist killers as individuals, rather than portraying their violence as inspired by a single ideology and the result of a process of radicalization, as coverage of Islamic State-linked terrorism tends to do. “It’s like they’re all one-offs,” Beirich said. “We are very reluctant to look at ourselves, our own culture, as a font for this violence. It is a lot easier to point the finger at something coming from Iraq or Syria.” Some Americans on both left and right continue to ask why fringe hate groups are being covered by the media at all, arguing that their views are ludicrous. Beirich, like other experts who study racist extremists, contested such assumptions. “The US, people have to remember, was founded on white supremacy and slavery, and it didn’t dismantle white supremacy as its form of government until the mid-1960s,” she said. “Black people and people of color were legally discriminated against. Hate groups – their views, most of them, would have been considered totally normal in 1965.” ‘A reverberating effect’ Joan Donovan, a researcher at the Data and Society institute who studies how white supremacist groups manipulate the media, says articles about hate groups should be treated with the same caution as articles about suicide, where the wrong kind of coverage runs the risk of causing real harm. News coverage of extremist groups may have “a similar kind of reverberating effect”, Donovan said, adding that white supremacist activists run media-based movements and no matter how ostensibly negative news coverage might be, any mainstream attention provides validation and fodder for their activism. Donovan recommends that journalists use “strategic silence” when covering hate groups. “If there is no newsworthy event compelling you to cover this, it’s not a good idea to go searching for these stories,” she said. Local neo-Nazi rallies, like a recent one in Shelbyville, Tennessee, should primarily be covered locally and not as a major national story, she argued. Phillips, who has interviewed 50 journalists for a project on the difficulties of covering conspiracy theorists and hate groups, studies the way media coverage can “amplify” dangerous lies and hoaxes, helping them spread and become entrenched. Media coverage of bigotry and falsehood is not a neutral force, she said. A news article about a harassment campaign, for instance, will prompt even more harassment of the original target, “and it will increase the likelihood that those tactics will be used in the future”. The way news coverage can amplify harassment, rather than put an end to it, was clear earlier this year during a campaign of neo-Nazi abuse directed towards Jewish residents of Whitefish, Montana, a town where Richard Spencer’s family owns a vacation home. Whitefish residents said each wave of news coverage seemed to spark a new round of abuse. Neo-Nazi trolls used lurid claims – suggesting they bus in skinheads to hold an armed hate march in the middle of January – to prompt continued press attention and international coverage. But Phillips said that simply not covering harrassment may not be the right choice, either. “If you have a rise in far-right extremism, you can’t just turn away,” she said. In an onstage interview on Thursday, the New York Times editor, Dean Baquet, defended the paper’s neo-Nazi profile, saying the degree of outrage it had inspired was “the most ridiculous overreaction to a story” and that the piece had been right to provide a portrait of modern extremism that was not driven by “guys who live in the hills of Alabama smoking pipes”. ‘Playing with fire’ Münzer, the Holocaust survivor, did not express particular interest, as the Times’ article’s author had done, in the “obscure” soul of one neo-Nazi and how he had gone astray. He thought the the article should have pushed more into questions of collective responsibility. “Where did these feelings come from?” he asked. “What did we do wrong? How does this represent a failing of the schools? Or the failing of the way we teach history? A failure really to communicate what happened or the dangers of Nazis and the danger of racism – and that they can lead to murder?” It was not news to him that citizens with otherwise normal-seeming lives could become Nazis. It was an ordinary man, and a secret member of the Dutch Nazi party, who turned in Münzer’s sisters, eight-year-old Eva and six-year-old Leah, to the authorities. The two girls were sent to Auschwitz. The man’s wife, who had tried to protect the girls, was also sent to prison. Münzer said journalists should focus more on ordinary heroes willing to confront the rise of fascism. When Münzer grew up in hiding in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands, it was a Dutch Indonesian family who took him in and a Muslim nanny who served as the Jewish baby’s surrogate mother. There were people of five religions in the household that risked their own safety to protect him. The Muslim woman who cared for him slept with a knife on her pillow, ready to defend his life. “Hatred, whether it’s directed against Jews, against Muslims, against anyone who is perceived as the other, is dangerous, and can really be a prelude to murder,” he said. “I think this is really playing with fire. It’s stoking the fires of hatred.” At the same time, he said: “I’m seeing more people willing to stand up and speak up. People are beginning to really confront the hate. I see that among young people, and that’s very encouraging.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/30/wayne-rooney-halfway-line-goal-best-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T12:53:04Z","webTitle":"Was Wayne Rooney’s halfway line goal the best in Premier League history? | Ed Aarons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/30/wayne-rooney-halfway-line-goal-best-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/30/wayne-rooney-halfway-line-goal-best-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Was Wayne Rooney’s halfway line goal the best in Premier League history?","bodyText":"David Beckham, Paul Robinson, Tim Howard, Charlie Adam, Maynor Figueroa and Wayne Rooney (x2) – the list of players to have scored goals from the halfway line in the Premier League is an exclusive club. But which one was the best? We rank each goal in order and invite you to let us know your thoughts. 1. Wayne Rooney – Everton v West Ham United, 29 November 2017 “I’ve never struck a football better in my life,” Rooney admitted after his first-time effort flew over the stranded West Ham goalkeeper Joe Hart to seal his hat-trick in the 4-0 win on Wednesday. With the ball travelling at a rate of knots from Hart’s clearance, the technique shown by the former England captain to make such a clean connection with his laces and propel the ball at the perfect trajectory to take it over the despairing jumps of Winston Reid and Cheikhou Kouyaté certainly takes some beating. Rooney knew it was in from the moment he made contact, while the look of panic on Hart’s face when he realised who the ball was heading directly towards told its own story. Distance: 61 yards 2. Charlie Adam – Chelsea v Stoke City, 4 April 2015 Having already scored from a similar position in a reserve‑team game for Blackpool against Accrington in 2009, Adam had no qualms about trying again on a much bigger stage six years later. With Stoke trailing Chelsea after only nine minutes had been played, the Scotland international was passed the ball by Jon Walters midway in his own half and took two touches before unleashing a powerful strike with his trademark left foot. The ball flew in a straight line over Thibault Courtois, with the Chelsea goalkeeper’s last-ditch attempt to push it over the bar in vain. “Let’s not forget that when Pelé tried that, he missed,” tweeted the comedian David Baddiel of the longest-distance strike to be scored by an outfield player in the Premier League. Distance: 66 yards 3. Maynor Figueroa – Stoke City v Wigan Athletic, December 2009 A goal that probably has not been given the credit it deserves. A few weeks after they had been thrashed 9-1 at White Hart Lane, Wigan arrived in the Potteries looking to end a dismal run of away form. They went drawing 1-1 just after the break when Figueroa – the Honduran left-back who spent five years in Lancashire – spotted his opportunity after his side were awarded a free-kick. With the ball a few yards inside his own half, Figueroa surprised everyone by taking it quickly, sending the ball on a flat trajectory over Thomas Sorenson and into the corner of the net. It was eventually chosen as Match of the Day’s Goal of the Season. Distance: 60 yards 4. Xabi Alonso – Liverpool v Newcastle United, 20 September 2006 Previously the holder of the longest-distance goal until Adam came along, the Spain midfielder also had previous form. Alonso’s stunning strike from inside his own half had capped off an FA Cup victory against Luton Town in January 2006 so Newcastle goalkeeper Steve Harper should really have been wary nine months later. After casually taking possession of the ball with a perfectly timed tackle, he manoeuvred the ball onto his more favoured right foot and launched a shot that left Harper stranded. “I was thinking of telling him off when he didn’t pass to Steven Gerrard who had made a good run forward,” Rafael Benítez admitted. “He practises it all the time.” Distance: 63 yards 5. David Beckham – Wimbledon v Manchester United, 17 August 1996 According to Gary Neville, the goal that launched ‘Brand Beckham’ was premeditated. “He practised that in training every single day – striking the ball towards a goal from the halfway line,” said Neville. But that does not take away from its beauty. With United already winning 2-0 at Selhurst Park, Brian McClair played the ball into Beckham’s path, took a brief look up and proceeded to float the ball perfectly over Neil Sullivan in the Wimbledon goal. “I have never seen it done before,” admitted Sir Alex Ferguson afterwards, although Adam’s effort probably just trumps it. Distance: 59 yards 6. Wayne Rooney – West Ham United v Manchester United, 22 March 2014 While the pedants may point out that this effort was struck from around 10 yards inside the West Ham half, Rooney’s anticipation of what he was about to do began a few moments earlier. Ashley Young’s skied clearance was misjudged by James Tomkins, allowing the United forward to position his body in readiness for the ball to drop. With a swish of his right foot, the ball arced towards high the goal, catching goalkeeper Adrián unaware as it sailed over his head and into the net. It perhaps loses marks for landing just in front of the goal-line, although Rooney deserves credit for even attempting it. Distance: 48 yards 7. Tim Howard/Paul Robinson/Asmir Begovic The goalkeepers’ scoring club is even more exclusive than this one and the three to have managed it in the Premier League era deserve a mention. None can seriously claim to have intended to score, however, with the increasingly light footballs in use today perhaps an explanation for how they were possible. In terms of distance, Begovic’s effort from just outside his own six-yard box against Southampton in September 2014 was the furthest out and earned a place in the Guinness World Records book, although Robinson could claim to have been almost as far away for his goal from a free kick against Watford in 2007. Howard’s effort against Bolton in January 2012 owed much to the windy conditions on Merseyside that afternoon – a fact the American was keen to point out afterwards in solidarity with opposite number Adam Bogdan. “It was cruel,” he said. “You saw the back fours and the keepers not being able to believe balls all night, and at the back one wrong step and it can be a nightmare.” Distance: 92 yards (Begovic)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2017/nov/30/evolution-row-ends-as-scientists-declare-sponges-to-be-sister-of-all-animals","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T17:00:19Z","webTitle":"Evolution row ends as scientists declare sponges to be sister of all other animals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/30/evolution-row-ends-as-scientists-declare-sponges-to-be-sister-of-all-animals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/nov/30/evolution-row-ends-as-scientists-declare-sponges-to-be-sister-of-all-animals","fields":{"headline":"Evolution row ends as scientists declare sponges to be sister of all other animals","bodyText":"A longstanding row in animal evolution has come to a head, with a team of scientists claiming they have ended the debate over which type of creature is the sister of all other animals. Researchers have been torn for years over whether sponges or marine invertebrates known as comb jellies were the first type of creature to branch off the evolutionary tree from the common ancestor of all animals. Now researchers say the debate is over: the sponges have won. “We need to try to understand the sponges much better if we want to understand the nature of animals’ – and our own – deepest ancestry,” said Davide Pisani, co-author of the research and professor of phylogenomics at the University of Bristol. The finding, say experts, is no trivial matter, as it could have drastic implications for what the last common ancestor of all animals looked like. “Sponges are simple – humble, in a sense – creatures that live at the bottom of the sea; they are filter-feeders, they don’t do much,” said Pisani. “The comb jelly is a very different creature. They are extremely pretty and rather complicated,” he added, pointing out that comb jellies look a bit like jellyfish and can propel themselves through water, create patterns of light and have both a simple nervous system and a gut – including a mouth and anus. “If the comb jellies are the sister of all of us, then we either are in a situation where the last common ancestor of all the animals was quite complex, [having] a nervous system, a gut and muscles and then the sponges [lost these features] or all these things we see in the comb jellies … evolved multiple times in animals,” he said, adding that the scenario also posed other puzzles such as what the ancestral creature would have preyed on. “If the sponges are the sister group of everything else … then we can assume a much simpler scenario,” said Pisani. “Then the assumption is we evolved from a filter-feeder organism.” With different models of evolutionary relationships applied to the same genetic data throwing up either a triumph for the sponge side of the debate or the comb jellies, the researchers of latest study turned to statistics to resolve the issue. “With this type of approach you can evaluate the extent to which alternative models are capable of describing a dataset, so you can say ‘this model is good for this specific dataset and this model is not good’,” said Pisani. The results, published in the journal Current Biology, were clear, he said. “Models that provide a much better description of the data invariably find the sponges at the root of the tree, for all of the datasets that have been published up to now.” That, he adds, ties in well with the fact that the closest living relatives of all animals are filter-feeding aquatic organisms called choanoflagellates. But the findings he said, should offer us all food for thought. “I think part of why people love this debate so much is the comb jellies are beautiful and the sponges are somewhat ugly. The sponge is the underdog in a sense,” he said. “So it is quite nice to know that we have really humble beginnings, rather than this glamorous start.” While Pisani believes proponents of the comb jellies might continue the debate, he says the wrangle is drawing to a close. “From my perspective, yes, this is the last word,” he said. Antonis Rokas, professor of biological sciences and biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University, and who has previously published studies supporting the idea that comb jellies are the oldest sister group to all other animals, welcomed the research. “[It] is a great step in the right direction toward resolving the debate,” he said, adding that the analyses comparing the accuracy of models are insightful. But, he said, the new approach brings with it its own difficulties, leading him to believe the jury is still out. “With this study, the authors have significantly tipped the balance toward the sponges-sister hypothesis,” he said. “But I will eagerly await to see what are the effects of adding additional genomes from both sponge and ctenophore lineages, as well as models that do not reduce the information provided from the data, before considering the debate solved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/world-on-a-plate/2017/nov/30/indigenous-crops-and-smallscale-farms-ruth-oniango-on-africas-agricultural-future","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T13:15:02Z","webTitle":"Indigenous crops and smallscale farms: Ruth Oniang’o on Africa’s agricultural future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2017/nov/30/indigenous-crops-and-smallscale-farms-ruth-oniango-on-africas-agricultural-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2017/nov/30/indigenous-crops-and-smallscale-farms-ruth-oniango-on-africas-agricultural-future","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous crops and smallscale farms: Ruth Oniang’o on Africa’s agricultural future","bodyText":"When Ruth Oniang’o was working as a nutrition researcher in 1980s Kenya, she noticed an ominous change in the country’s agricultural landscape: regions that had once provided a diversity of nutritious food crops were being turned over to cash crops like sugarcane. Grown mostly for export, these crops were usurping land and soil that was intended for feeding people. Spurred on by what she witnessed all those years ago, today Oniang’o--a professor of nutrition and a native Kenyan--leads the Rural Outreach Program, a nonprofit that champions the role of indigenous African crops and smallholder farmers in safeguarding food security. With the ROP, Oniang’o visits hundreds of farming communities in Kenya and helps them access, grow, and share seeds for indigenous crop varieties like sorghum, cassava, arrowroot, and jute mallow--foods that are not only nutritious, but also disease-resistant and climate-resilient. This year, these efforts got her recognised as the joint winner of the 2017 Africa Food Prize. Aside from the practicalities of nutrition and food security, she’s motivated by the desire to help smallscale farmers realise their importance, she says: “If farmers were to go on strike for a season only, we would starve. Then maybe we would value them.” Here, Oniang’o shares her thoughts on commercialising African agriculture, the COP23 climate conference, and the trouble with that now-ubiquitous term, ‘orphan crops’. Why do you choose to work with Kenya’s smallholder farmers? Most of the voters are in the rural areas. Most of them are agricultural, and most of them are the poorest of the poor. So for smallholders to wield power they have to be organised. If they aren’t organised and they work individually, they’ll always be misused, and ignored. So I work to raise income for smallholder farmers, to raise their dignity, and their voice. You place a special emphasis on women in your work: how is that connected to farming and nutrition in Kenya? The main aim is to address rural poverty, through agriculture, and more than three-quarters of people doing agriculture [in Kenya] are women. So my focus is rural poverty and improved family nutrition, especially through women. But as I went along, I realised I needed to figure out how to bring in the men too. When we started, our field days would be mostly women, discussing women’s affairs. But now we have men attending, because they see how the women have transformed. Women have become village elders, and chiefs. A woman needs the support of the family, the spouse, the whole community; you all have to rally around her for her to feel comfortable being a leader. So when men [come to me and] say ‘I want my daughter to be just like you,’ I say you, ‘start by making your wife feel good. Then we can talk.’ What do you think about the calls to commercialise African agriculture? The whole idea of commercialising African agriculture has been around for a long time. When Kenya became independent in 1963, it was feeding its population--OK, so it was only about seven million then--on subsistence farming, through smallholder farms. Then we saw the commercialisation of agriculture. I was one of the researchers in the late 80s, [looking into] how farms were being commercialised, going into cash crops and so on. And yet people were becoming hungrier, and nutrition was being compromised. That’s why the area where I started doing my interventions were sugarcane growing areas. With all the land going to sugar cane as a monocrop, people had to import food for family food consumption. And the money they were getting from sugar cane was not enough to actually purchase family food. So all I can tell you is that we haven’t capitalised on African smallholder farming. We still have a lot of smallholder farmers in Africa, and Kenya feeds people from subsistence farming. We haven’t seen its full potential, but we have seen the bad impacts of commercialising. And yet, you’ve supported the idea that in the future, Africa should become a major exporter of food. The reason I said ‘in the future’ is that our governments must realise that you must feed your people first, then you can look at what we can give to the rest of the world. India is now asking Africa to feed them pulses. But Africa also needs pulses for nutrition. If we don’t give farmers incentives to feed into the local food system they will export that food, or go into commercial crops, which aren’t necessarily food crops. So it requires a well-thought-out plan by government. Give us way forward, on how we feed our people. It’s not something that you just leave open to a free market--especially when the markets are not understood by the majority of your people. When it comes to food, you must have self interest in your people. It seems that indigenous crops are gaining recognition in the African farming context--something you have been advocating for, for decades. Yes that’s true. They’re being called orphan crops--a term that has come onto the scene, and suddenly everybody has adopted it. Personally, I have an issue with that terminology. Why is that? Well, it’s how we see orphans--as an unfortunate situation. In this case we virtually neglected these crops, and yet, they are our foundation. And, they are also still there. We have tuber crops, sweet potatoes, yams, and arrowroot. And then you have cassava--now being promoted much more as an industrial crop, to produce starch and byproducts, for example for animal feed. But we know that as a food it’s also critical, and drought-resistant, growing with very little rain. We have the grains, finger millet, sorghum, which are mostly drought-resistant, using very little water. And they’re nutritious. We also have insects--we know which ones can be eaten. We have mushrooms, and fruits from the wild. The other day I was in Mombasa, and I really enjoyed tamarind juice. So culturally, we need to identify with these foods; they should be given prominence. With COP23 having unfolded earlier this month, how optimistic are you that it will translate into benefits for smallholder farmers? I’m wary of these huge conferences, where resolutions come out, and commitments are made, and huge amounts of money are put forward. Yet, if you try to apply for that kind of funding, you don’t get it. Maybe there are just too many demands on what’s available. That said, what I do like about the conferences now is that there is a global agreement, so there’s political will. But for those of us who work with farmers on the ground level, we aren’t seeing resources. That’s something I would really like to see--bringing it down to where it really matters. Climate change has really, practically, affected smallholder farmers. They now don’t even know when to plant. They’ve stopped believing in the climate itself. So I need to follow the resources, and bring to them to the ground. That’s where I’m happiest--making a difference on the ground."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/30/donald-trump-menacing-talk-north-korea-us-isolated","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T16:43:48Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump's menacing talk on North Korea is leaving the US isolated","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/donald-trump-menacing-talk-north-korea-us-isolated","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/donald-trump-menacing-talk-north-korea-us-isolated","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump's menacing talk on North Korea is leaving the US isolated","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s latest threat to destroy North Korea’s regime by force produced an angry response from Russia on Thursday. Yet elsewhere, the menacing talk from Washington was mostly met with uncomfortable silence. While there is no shortage of international concern about Kim Jong-un’s latest, “breakthrough” missile test on Wednesday, Trump’s bellicose talk of war is rendering the US increasingly isolated. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, appeared to voice doubts shared by other countries when he claimed on Thursday that Trump was deliberately pushing Pyongyang towards military confrontation. “It seems they have done everything on purpose to make Kim lose control and make another desperate move,” he said. Lavrov rejected imposing additional sanctions demanded by Trump. Lavrov suggested previously unscheduled US military exercises in December were part of an undisclosed plan to trigger a conflict. “The Americans need to explain to us all what they are actually up to. If they seek a pretext to destroy North Korea, they should openly say so.” Reacting to Wednesday’s test, Trump’s ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, upped the ante again, pinning blame wholly on Kim’s shoulders. “If war does come, it will be because of continued acts of aggression like we witnessed yesterday … If war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed,” she said. It’s a view rejected by China which, like Russia, has repeatedly urged Trump to halt the military buildup and start talking. The official China Daily said opportunities created by Beijing to launch a dialogue had been “casually wasted” by the US. By re-designating North Korea as a sponsor of state terrorism, Trump had reignited a crisis that had abated since September, the paper said. Trump’s uncanny ability to lose friends and alienate people makes it unlikely Xi Jinping, China’s president, will heed his latest appeal, made in a personal telephone call, for a full oil embargo on North Korea. Trump continues to taunt Kim. Speaking in Missouri this week, he added the insult “sick puppy” to his previous, mocking description of Kim as “little rocket man”. This kind of playground name-calling and casual presidential rudeness is becoming familiar to allies as well as foes, as Theresa May discovered this week. Whatever his military advisers may be telling Trump about the feasibility of “taking out” Kim’s regime, there seems scant understanding in Trump’s White House of the human, political and diplomatic consequences of forcible regime change. The US relationship with Xi’s China would be wrecked by any unilateral, potentially illegal military action in Beijing’s backyard. It could dash Trump’s hopes for more balanced economic ties. It might also induce China to increase defence spending and redouble its efforts to supplant the US as the Asia-Pacific’s leading military power. Russia would take full advantage of such a rift, which could extend to the US-Europe and Nato relationships. It cannot be assumed the western alliance, frequently denigrated by Trump, would support the US in such a scenario. On past form, France and Germany would be reluctant to back what most of the world would certainly view as US aggression against a weaker adversary. The split over Iraq in 2003 might be magnified many times over. An outbreak of hostilities undoubtedly risks large-scale loss of life. Even if North Korea failed to retaliate effectively – a big if – public and political outrage in South Korea and Japan would seriously damage America’s regional interests. Japan’s hawkish prime minister, Shinzo Abe, a Trump golf buddy, would be likely to face a fierce backlash. There would be renewed pressure to close US bases in both countries. Meanwhile, the negative effect on the global economy, stock markets, oil prices and business can only be guessed at. Trump’s obliviousness to the possible consequences of his actions is the main reason why international support for Washington’s increasingly menacing stance seems to be weakening, even as the North Korean conundrum intensifies. By threatening Armageddon, Trump may ensure Kim wins."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/30/videos-tweeted-by-trump-where-are-they-from-and-what-do-they-really-show","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T16:08:58Z","webTitle":"Videos tweeted by Trump: where are they from and what do they really show?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/videos-tweeted-by-trump-where-are-they-from-and-what-do-they-really-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/30/videos-tweeted-by-trump-where-are-they-from-and-what-do-they-really-show","fields":{"headline":"Videos tweeted by Trump: where are they from and what do they really show?","bodyText":"Re-captioned, retweeted and, in effect, hijacked by anti-Muslim, nationalist, alt-right and far-right websites since 2013, the clips retweeted by Donald Trump are ammunition in an online infowar. The three videos posted by the Britain First deputy leader, Jayda Fransen, purport to show Muslims committing acts of violence: two assaulting people, one destroying a statue of the virgin Mary. Fransen’s characterisation of one, however, “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!”, does not describe what the film shows. Her captions for the other two mislead by failing to explain the circumstances in which they were shot. The first video appeared originally on Friday 12 May this year on a Dutch website, Dumpert.nl, under the title (in Dutch) “Your anger trigger for today: guy on crutches gets a cowardly beating”. It showed a teenage boy attacking another on crutches, knocking him over and kicking him while he lay on the ground. The following day, Dutch police issued a statement saying two 16-year-olds had been arrested in connection with the incident, one on suspicion of assault. Neither was identified, by police or local media, as Muslim or a migrant, and the video was subsequently taken down at the request of the police and the victim. After Trump retweeted the film on Wednesday, the public prosecutor’s office in North Holland province and the Dutch embassy in the US said the attacker was “born and raised in the Netherlands” and had completed a programme for first-time young offenders. A spokesman for the prosecutor’s office said it was not policy to comment on an individual’s religion, but the leading Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad said the youth “as far as is known did not have a Muslim or migrant background”. On the day of the boys’ arrest, however, the video was tweeted by a pro-Trump account, StockMonsterVIP, who captioned it “Migrant beats up helpless Dutch boy on cruches b/c he can”, Buzzfeed reported. It was retweeted more than 5,000 times. From there it made it to a Reddit forum called The_Donald, and then to the website of Pamela Geller, who prefaced the caption with the word “Muslim”. The Southern Poverty Law Centre has designated Geller’s American Freedom Defence Initiative, also known as Stop Islamisation of America, as an anti-Muslim hate group. The myth-busting website Snopes said the clip appeared on other rightwing sites before it was tweeted by Fransen first in October and then again this week. It is thought Trump saw it after it appeared in the feed of the conservative commentator Ann Coulter, reportedly one of the 45 Twitter accounts he follows. A second video retweeted by Trump, captioned by Fransen “Muslim destroys a statue of virgin Mary!”, shows a Syrian radical Islamist cleric, Abo Omar Ghabra, then a member of the group Jabhat al-Nusra. The footage was shot in October 2013 in northern Idlib province, according to the New York Times, which spoke to a villager who was there. Ghabra later joined Islamic State before being captured in Aleppo, the man told the paper. Several websites including InfoWars, run by the rightwing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, carried the footage, rarely adding that moderate Muslim groups around the world have overwhelmingly condemned extremists’ destruction of religious icons. The final video, characterised by Fransen as “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!”, was also filmed in 2013, in Alexandria, Egypt, during fighting between supporters and opponents of the recently overthrown president, Mohamed Morsi. According to Egyptian media, one man in the footage – seen carrying a black flag bearing the Islamic declaration of faith, a common symbol of Islamist militant groups – was later found guilty of murder and executed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/30/labour-leads-drive-for-equality-impact-assessment-of-tory-policies","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T16:19:52Z","webTitle":"Labour leads drive for equality impact assessment of Tory policies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/30/labour-leads-drive-for-equality-impact-assessment-of-tory-policies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/30/labour-leads-drive-for-equality-impact-assessment-of-tory-policies","fields":{"headline":"Labour leads drive for equality impact assessment of Tory policies","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn is leading a cross-party effort to force ministers to publish details of the impact of their policies broken down by gender, race, age, disability, class and region, after analysis showed women continue to bear the brunt of austerity. The Labour leader has signed a letter with 126 other MPs, including members of his own party, the Liberal Democrats, SNP and Greens, calling for an immediate equality assessment of all government policies. The letter to the education secretary, Justine Greening, whose brief covers equalities, accuses the government of failing in its duty to sufficiently consider the impact of its actions on all groups in society. Labour said its analysis showed that men received 46% more spending in Philip Hammond’s autumn budget. A financial model developed by Yvette Cooper, the senior Labour backbencher, and House of Commons library statisticians found that 86% of savings to the Treasury from tax and benefit changes since 2010 had come from women. Labour said the latest budget did nothing to change that, meaning women had been hit six times harder by austerity measures than men since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. The letter, co-signed by Corbyn, Dawn Butler, the shadow equalities secretary, Jo Swinson, the deputy Lib Dem leader, Angela Crawley, the SNP spokeswoman on equalities, and Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Greens, said: “If the government continues in this manner there can be no public confidence that the public sector equality duty is being fulfilled. “We are calling on the government to undertake and publish a comprehensive cumulative equality impact assessment of all government policies. This assessment must include analysis of the impact of all its policies in relation to gender, race, age, disability, class and region. “We urge the adoption of this proposal as a matter of urgency so the government can assess the overall impact of its policies on the population as a whole and specific groups sharing protected characteristics.” Labour is committed to auditing every budget for gender impact and promoting gender equality at the heart of economic policymaking. Butler said the budget had not once mentioned women and was “more of the same from the chancellor, with women and our diverse communities again being forced to bear the brunt of this failed Tory economic project”. She said: “Despite Theresa May herself warning in 2010 that cuts would disproportionately impact on those with protected characteristics, her government continues to pursue an economic agenda based on discrimination and inequality which has hit women the hardest.” A spokesman for the government said the Treasury considered the equality impacts of individual policies on those with protected characteristics – including gender, race and disability – in line with its legal obligations and what it said was its strong commitment to equality. “We are fully committed to equality and carefully consider how those with protected characteristics are impacted by government policy,” he said. “About 1.4 million more women are in work since 2010, and the full-time gender pay gap is at a record low. We publish comprehensive distributional analysis at every budget, which shows that the state continues to be highly redistributive.” The Treasury said analysis published by others tended to exclude spending on public services that directly benefited households, such as the NHS, and could assume that all households fully take up all benefits to which they are entitled and exclude tax measures for which there was not sufficient data to attribute the impact to individual households. It said analysis published by other organisations trying to show the impact of policies by gender made strong assumptions about how income was shared within households."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/01/christmas-decorations-the-best-artificial-trees","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T10:29:17Z","webTitle":"Christmas decorations: the best artificial trees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/01/christmas-decorations-the-best-artificial-trees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/01/christmas-decorations-the-best-artificial-trees","fields":{"headline":"Christmas decorations: the best artificial trees","bodyText":"Balsam Hill trees, from £69 balsamhill.co.uk For those with allergies, worries about fire risks or just over enthusiastic pets and small children, artificial trees for Christmas are a must. And long gone are the days when that meant a clearly-plastic, threadbare monstrosity - modern artificial trees can be so realistic-looking that your guests will insist on stroking the branches to check you aren’t fibbing. And the most realistic we’ve found are those from Balsam Hill. Each tree is designed to be as realistic as possible, down the the design of individual fax-needles, and you can chose from a variety of both types (eg the specific variety of fir or pine) as well as sizes. Prices for good artificial trees are not cheap, but a quality one can last for 10, 20 years, making it a lot more cost effective in the long run than dragging in a dying, needle-shedding fir every year. They aren’t, of course, the most environmental option as most are made from plastics, but that’s only in the short term: a few years of transporting, using and disposing real ones soon tots up the carbon footprint of the real kind - not to mention all the many trees that are dumped by the side of the road come January. Balsam Hill’s trees come in a huge variety of sizes and styles - or rather variety of tree types - and can be purchased with or without lights. Those with lights built in have them very well strung throughout the tree, and with light connections inside the trunk, all you have to do is plug in and get on with the mulled wine. If you aren’t sure which variety of the many would best suit your room, you can get a branch sample in the post to examine first. Assembly is easy, though of course you will need to have the space to store it for the other 11 months of the year. Cheaper options are also available from Tesco (£50) or John Lewis (£45) but be aware that once you get a little closer, the difference in quality is very noticeable.

That gives Rian Johnson’s film the second-best opening ever, slotting in behind only its predecessor, The Force Awakens. The Disney blockbuster became just the fourth film to open above $200m in the US. Aside from The Force Awakens ($248.8m), the others are The Avengers ($207.4m) and Jurassic World ($208.8m). The Last Jedi is off to a similar start overseas, too, with $230m in international ticket sales, said Disney. That brings its three-day global haul to $450m. The film topped the box-office charts in a number of territories, including the UK, Germany and Japan. The opening also gave the Walt Disney Company the opportunity to flex its muscles on the heels of the deal announced last week for it to purchase 21st Century Fox for $52.4bn. As part of the deal, Disney will take control of 20th Century Fox, one of Hollywood’s six major studios. “The weekend that we’re in is a byproduct of the foresight and vision from our CEO Bob Iger to bring Lucasfilm into the fold,” said Disney distribution chief Dave Hollis, alluding to Disney’s 2012 purchase of Lucasfilm. “So as we think about the possibility of other things being added, you can’t help but be excited about the possibilities.” Fox, as it happens, was the only studio to open another new wide-release film against The Last Jedi in the US. Its animated comedy, Ferdinand, grossed $13.3m. Another family film, Pixar’s Coco, took third place, bringing its four-week total to over $150m. While JJ Abrams’ reboot capitalised on a decade’s hiatus for Star Wars, Johnson’s sequel didn’t have the same benefit of freshness. It follows not only The Force Awakens (which ultimately grossed $2.1bn) but last year’s spinoff, Rogue One. That release opened with $155.1m, and grossed in total just more than $1bn globally. Critics gave Johnson’s film a 93% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences endorsed it, too, with an A CinemaScore.Signalling its faith in Johnson’s course for Star Wars, Lucasfilm earlier announced that Johnson will develop the next trilogy for the franchise, the first of which he’ll write and direct. Abrams is set to return to direct Episode IX after he was brought in to replace Colin Trevorrow. A separate spinoff, centred on a young Han Solo, is due out next summer. The massive debut for The Last Jedi singlehandedly brightens what has been a disappointing year for Hollywood. The weekend was far and away the highest grossing of the year. According to comScore, the industry was down about 3.9% from last year, before this weekend. Now it’s 2.9% off the 2016 pace. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore, estimates the year will end about 2% down with a little over $11bn in ticket sales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/30/us-court-alleged-iran-scheme-avoid-sanctions-turkey","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T13:28:35Z","webTitle":"Erdoğan knew of alleged Iranian scheme to evade sanctions via Turkey, court told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/30/us-court-alleged-iran-scheme-avoid-sanctions-turkey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/30/us-court-alleged-iran-scheme-avoid-sanctions-turkey","fields":{"headline":"Erdoğan knew of alleged Iranian scheme to evade sanctions via Turkey, court told","bodyText":"A scheme Iran allegedly used to evade sanctions through a state-owned bank in Turkey has been detailed in court by a businessman who claimed the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had been aware of the billion-dollar operation. In a case that has strained relations between Turkey and the US, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, described a sprawling money laundering network that allowed Iran access to international markets from 2010 to 2015 in violation of sanctions over its nuclear programme. He told jurors in New York on Thursday that Erdoğan, who was prime minister of Turkey at the time, had personally authorised a transaction on behalf of Iran. Zarrab said he had bribed the then Turkish economy minister Zafer Çağlayan and the former head of the state-owned Halkbank. Zarrab had faced charges including bank fraud and money laundering, but court papers revealed on Tuesday that he struck a deal last month with prosecutors to plead guilty and testify against his former co-defendant in the case, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a former deputy chief of Halkbank. The Turkish government had repeatedly raised Zarrab’s case with the US, demanding his release before the plea deal was made public. Senior Turkish officials have in recent weeks condemned the trial as a plot engineered by Fethullah Gülen, a Pennsylvania-based cleric accused by the government of orchestrating an attempted coup last year. In its first reaction to Zarrab’s testimony, Bekir Bozdağ, the Turkish deputy prime minister, described the trial as “theatre” and a “plot against Turkey and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan”, adding that justice could not be expected. Erdoğan was quoted by CNN Türk on Thursday as saying Turkey did not violate US sanctions against Iran and “did the right thing”. In Turkey, the trial has been dismissed by senior officials and pro-government media as a conspiracy based on evidence gathered illegally by members of Gülen’s movement in the police and judiciary. When asked about the possibility that the trial could implicate Ankara in the violation of sanctions, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said: “Why should I be concerned? “If something is fabricated, we also have something to say. This is an indictment prepared by [Gülen’s] people … it means that the case is very much politically motivated.” Despite the public dismissals, the case is likely to prove embarrassing for Erdoğan’s government if prosecutors provide compelling evidence linking Zarrab to other senior officials. It could also have a damaging effect on the Turkish economy if his revelations hurt the banking system at a time when the Turkish lira’s value is falling. Relations between the US and Turkey, the two largest armies in Nato, have been greatly strained over the past few years, beginning with the former’s reluctance to intervene forcefully against Bashar al-Assad early in the Syrian civil war. Recent US support for Kurdish militias fighting Islamic State in Syria has further angered Ankara, which considers them affiliates of the Kurdish insurgency in Turkey. Visa services for nationals of both countries have been suspended in recent weeks over the arrest of US consulate personnel in Turkey accused of having links to the Gülen network. Çağlayan resigned in late 2013 over corruption claims. The Erdoğan government alleges that the investigation against him that year was orchestrated by the Gülen movement, and it marked the total break in ties between that organisation and the ruling Justice and Development party. On Thursday, the pro-government newspaper Daily Sabah published a rebuttal with the headline: “Fabricated evidence, a pro-[Gülen] judge, a clear plot against Turkey: all about the Zarrab case.” It accused the judge overseeing the caseand the former prosecutor who indicted Zarrab of having links to the Gülen movement. Atilla has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Victor Rocco, told jurors in an opening statement that Zarrab was “a liar, a cheat … a one-man crime wave”, while his client, by contrast, was not corrupt and took no bribes. Halkbank issued a statement on Thursday insisting that it “strictly adheres to national and international regulations” in all businesses and transactions. “Foreign trade transactions and money transfers are conducted in an open, transparent manner and can be monitored by the relevant authorities,” it said. Zarrab was arrested in March 2016 when he flew to Florida with his wife, the Turkish singer Ebru Gündeş, and his daughter, for a trip to Disney World."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/01/electric-cars-already-cheaper-to-own-and-run-than-petrol-or-diesel-study","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T17:00:00Z","webTitle":"Electric cars already cheaper to own and run than petrol or diesel – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/01/electric-cars-already-cheaper-to-own-and-run-than-petrol-or-diesel-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/01/electric-cars-already-cheaper-to-own-and-run-than-petrol-or-diesel-study","fields":{"headline":"Electric cars already cheaper to own and run than petrol or diesel – study","bodyText":"Electric cars are already cheaper to own and run than petrol or diesel cars in the UK, US and Japan, new research shows. The lower cost is a key factor driving the rapid rise in electric car sales now underway, say the researchers. At the moment the cost is partly because of government support, but electric cars are expected to become the cheapest option without subsidies in a few years. The researchers analysed the total cost of ownership of cars over four years, including the purchase price and depreciation, fuel, insurance, taxation and maintenance. They were surprised to find that pure electric cars came out cheapest in all the markets they examined: UK, Japan, Texas and California. Pure electric cars have much lower fuel costs – electricity is cheaper than petrol or diesel – and maintenance costs, as the engines are simpler and help brake the car, saving on brake pads. In the UK, the annual cost was about 10% lower than for petrol or diesel cars in 2015, the latest year analysed. Hybrid cars which cannot be plugged in and attract lower subsidies, were usually a little more expensive than petrol or diesel cars. Plug-in hybrids were found to be significantly more expensive – buyers are effectively paying for two engines in one car, the researchers said. The exception in this case was Japan, where plug-in hybrids receive higher subsidies. “We were surprised and encouraged because, as we scale up production, [pure] electric vehicles are going to be becoming cheaper and we expect battery costs are going to fall,” said James Tate, who conducted the research published in the journal Applied Energy with Kate Palmer and colleagues at the University of Leeds, UK. “It is a really good news story.” Pure electric cars receive a sales subsidy of about £5,000 in the UK and Japan and £6,500 in the US. “The subsidies are reasonably expensive at the moment but they are expected to tail off,” said Tate. He estimates that an electric car such as the Nissan Leaf will become as cheap to own and run as a petrol car without subsidy by 2025. Renault expects this to happen in the early 2020s. The push to roll out electric cars, which produce less climate-warming carbon emissions, has been supercharged by concerns over air pollution, particularly from diesel cars. In the UK, where toxic air is at illegal levels in most urban areas, sales of diesel vehicles have plummeted by 30% in the last year while sales of electric cars have soared by 37%. At current rates, sales of electric cars could outstrip diesel cars as early as May 2019, according to analysis by Matt Finch, at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit in the UK: “This date is incredible, as clearly it is only 18 months away.” Tate said: “The challenge is whether the manufacturers have the capacity to generate these vehicles. Demand significantly outstrips supply.” Viktor Irle of analysts EV-Volumes.com said there are now good electric car options at the low cost end, like the Nissan Leaf, and high cost end, like the Tesla Model S, but not in the middle range, where family cars usually sit. “There are no good options there at the moment,” he said. “I guess the traditional car manufacturers are a bit afraid it will cannibalise sales of their conventional cars, which are bestsellers.” Air pollution concerns are especially acute in China, which is now the biggest market for electric cars and growing rapidly, mainly driven by domestic manufacturers including BYD, Geely and Beijing Auto. “China is stealing the march on everybody and they will be the leaders of that market,” said Tate. “The European and US motor industry have been caught napping.” However, Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said the UK electric car market remained small at present: “There are 32m cars in the UK – only around 120,000 are ultra-clean [electric]. The petrol and diesel juggernaut will take some halting.” He also warned that governments could in future start taxing electric vehicles to recoup the large sums lost from falling fuel duty. “And cost [of ownership] isn’t everything,” he said. “Practicality and usability are key. We need a public charging network that is extensive, reliable and offers recharging at the speeds car owners require.” The government announced £200m in funding for charging infrastructure on 22 November, to be matched by industry. Transport minister Jesse Norman said: “The UK now has over 11,500 publicly accessible charge points, including over 900 rapid charge points. This is one of the largest rapid networks in Europe.” Tate said one aspect which also needs addressing is social equity, as wealthier people who can afford the upfront cost of an electric vehicle and who have off-road parking for home charging have easier access to cheaper motoring.

The Match of the Day and BT Sport football host Gary Lineker, who has faced criticism for taking on the role after previously speaking out against Fifa over its various corruption scandals, will be co-presenting with the Russian journalist Maria Komandnaya. The 32 teams who have qualified will be split into eight four-team groups, drawn from four pots. The groups will contain one team from each pot. Teams have been placed in the pots according to their position in the Fifa world rankings for October. The exception to that are the hosts Russia, who are automatically in pot one. So Pot One contains the seven highest-ranked teams plus Russia, pot two has the next eight teams in the rankings, and so on. England are in pot two. England can face only one other European team as there can be a maximum of two European sides per group. No other football confederation can have more than one team in a group, so no South American sides will go head-to-head in the group phase for example. The lineup of the pots is Pot one Russia (hosts), Germany, Brazil, Portugal, Argentina, Belgium, Poland, France Pot two Spain, Peru, Switzerland, England, Colombia, Uruguay, Mexico, Croatia Pot three Denmark, Iceland, Costa Rica, Sweden, Tunisia, Egypt, Senegal, Iran Pot four Serbia, Nigeria, Australia, Japan, Morocco, Panama, South Korea, Saudi Arabia The four pots will be emptied by drawing the eight teams they each contain one by one and placing them in the eight groups of four teams (Groups A to H). Russia, as hosts, will occupy the top position in Group A, while the seven other seeds will occupy the top spots in Groups B to H. The positions of all the other teams (from pots two, three and four) will be decided when they are drawn. As is customary at final draws, a ball will be drawn from the team pots and then another from the group pots to determine the position in which the team in question will play. England’s worst-case scenario Based on the latest Fifa rankings Germany, Costa Rica and Nigeria. Guardian verdict Brazil, Iceland and Nigeria. Best-case scenario Based on Fifa rankings Russia, Senegal and Saudi Arabia. Guardian verdict Poland, Tunisia and Panama. Lineker and Komandnaya will be assisted at the draw by eight major names from World Cups past: France’s Laurent Blanc, England’s Gordon Banks, Brazil’s Cafu, Italy’s Fabio Cannavaro, Uruguay’s Diego Forlán, Argentina’s Diego Maradona, Spain’s Carles Puyol and Russia’s Nikita Simonyan. In the UK, if you can’t watch BBC Two then you can listen to it on Radio 5 Live.

Doctor’s orders’","bodyText":"Look closely at the AFC Fylde kit when the National League side take on Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup on Friday night, and you will find the extent of the club’s ambition is worn on their sleeve. A 15-year plan was put in place when new owners became involved in what was then Kirkham and Wesham in 2007, one that envisaged Football League status being achieved by 2022. Five promotions later, Fylde stand on the threshold of their dream. The next promotion will make it come true, and just to make sure no one loses sight of the objective, 2022 is woven into the players’ shirts. This is precisely the sort of structured planning and growth that persuaded the former Tranmere Rovers captain Dave Challinor to leave Colwyn Bay to throw in his lot with Fylde six years ago. It seemed a backward step for a young manager at the time – Fylde were two divisions lower – but everything sketched out at his interview has since come to pass, including the gleaming new stadium the club moved into last season. “Colwyn Bay had been great but success there amounted to staying in the same division all the time,” Challinor explains. “I’ve always wanted to be a Football League manager, and I knew that to move upwards I was going to have to test myself. Coming here gave me an opportunity to progress and put me in the shop window a little bit. I’ve been managing for seven years now and I’m still learning but I believe I’m better at the job for seeking out new challenges to overcome and different sorts of pressures to handle. I hope so anyway, because we’ve got five years to get out of this division, according to what it says on our sleeves.” Challinor has overseen three promotions in his time in Lancashire, and the seasons in between have taken the club to play-offs. “We’ve had six really good years,” he says. “Everything has gone as well as we all hoped at the start.” Fylde are mid-table, still adjusting to playing at a higher level, and a couple of games behind most of their rivals because of their Cup run. “I think, this season, we can let the romance kick in,” Challinor says. “To even dream of reaching the third round is enormous for this club. Promotion was the be-all and end-all last year. We didn’t give up on the cups but at the back of your mind you were always thinking about the next league game or worrying about picking up injuries. “We are not on such a great run this season, we can enjoy the Cup and hopefully use it as a springboard. That said, we are facing the toughest draw we could have been given. Wigan are top of League One at the moment and I thoroughly expect them to win that division and get back into the Championship. Cooky [Paul Cook] is doing a great job.” The two managers know each other from time spent at Prenton Park in the 90s when Tranmere were knocking on the door of the Premier League and regularly causing cup upsets. Challinor captained them at Wembley in the 2000 League Cup final against Leicester and picks a couple of quarter-finals as his favourite FA Cup memories. “We played Newcastle at home and Liverpool at home,” the 42-year-old recalls. “I’m a Liverpool fan, so that was great for me. We had a really good team back then though; I can remember lots of great games. We once beat West Ham in a cup match when they had Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand in their side.” Now, in stark contrast, Tranmere find themselves providing the Boxing Day opposition for Fylde in the National League, something Challinor understandably finds himself conflicted about. “I’m proud that our club have reached that far but sad to see Tranmere out of the Football League,” he says. “I think they are going to find it hard to get back in too, because if you don’t do it in the first couple of seasons it becomes a lot tougher when the parachute money runs out. They might be in reduced circumstances but they are still a big scalp at this level. “Our ground will only have a capacity of 6,000 even when it is finished but Prenton Park can hold 16,000. They might not get those crowds any more but the players in this league rise to a situation like that. Opponents won’t be daunted, they’ll love playing there, and that’s what is going to make life hard for Tranmere. Speaking for myself though, I still live in that area and Tranmere are still my team. I went to the play-off final last season as a fan, because I’d like to see them back where they belong. I would have loved them to win but when they lost I knew I would be going back to Prenton Park as a manager. That will mean a lot – you could say I’ve been looking forward to it since the fixtures came out. It will be really enjoyable going back, especially at Christmas.” While indulging in Prenton Park memories it would be remiss not to bring up Challinor’s particular area of expertise. One especially effective part of Tranmere’s armoury two decades ago was the long throw, at which the present Fylde manager was chief exponent, indeed a record breaker over a formally measured distance in his time. Does he still sling them in from the touchline in training sessions, just for old time’s sake? “Not really,” he says. “I suppose I could throw the ball further than most of our team, though that’s not saying a lot. It’s weird because all the time I was playing I never had any problems with my back or my shoulders, but since I stopped I’ve had to have operations and injections, and I can only imagine that’s a result of taking thousands of throw-ins. It was never a feat of massive strength, it was just a technique that came naturally, in the same way that some people find they can throw a javelin a lot further than others. I could do it when I was at school. It was particularly effective at junior level in fact, because on smaller pitches you could get it right under the crossbar, you couldn’t be offside, and goals would be scored. “We got a lot of success from it at Tranmere, though I think it ended up detracting from the ability we had in our team. People became obsessed with the one aspect. Suddenly we were long-throw specialists, even though we had some really good players. I still look out for long throws – it’s a test of any defence and something even the best teams can find difficult to deal with, but I don’t do it any more. Doctor’s orders.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/07/phantom-thread-review-daniel-day-lewis-paul-thomas-anderson","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-07T17:00:16Z","webTitle":"Phantom Thread review – Daniel Day-Lewis bows out in style with drama of delicious pleasure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/07/phantom-thread-review-daniel-day-lewis-paul-thomas-anderson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/07/phantom-thread-review-daniel-day-lewis-paul-thomas-anderson","fields":{"headline":"Phantom Thread review – Daniel Day-Lewis bows out in style with drama of delicious pleasure","bodyText":"A brilliant English couturier of the postwar age: fastidious and cantankerous, humourless and preposterous – and heterosexual, in that pre-Chatterley era when being a bachelor and fashion designer wasn’t automatically associated in the public mind with anything else. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us his cinema swansong in this new film from writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson. He is Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock, celebrated dressmaker to the debutantes of Britain, but now under pressure from the New Look and influences from across the Channel. He treats us to a fine display of temper on the subject of that unforgivably meretricious word: chic. Just when he is at his lowest, Woodcock falls in love with a shy, maladroit German waitress at the country hotel where he happens to be staying. This is Alma, played by Vicky Krieps. With his connoisseur’s eye, Woodcock sees in her a grace and beauty no one else had noticed, certainly not Alma herself. Dazzled, she comes to live with him as his assistant and model in the central London fashion house over which Woodcock rules with his sister and confidante Cyril, played with enigmatic reserve by Lesley Manville. But, as Woodcock becomes ever more impossible and controlling, submissive Alma must find new, more dysfunctional ways to re-establish her emotional mastery over him. Day-Lewis gives a performance of almost ridiculously charismatic outrageousness, the sort only he could get away with. He is Hardy Amies and Norman Hartnell with a dash of Tony Armstrong-Jones – certainly Hartnell’s relationship with his sister and business partner Phyllis is evoked here. It’s a study in cult leadership to compare with Anderson’s The Master and a portrait of entrepreneurial loneliness to put alongside his appearance in Anderson’s There Will Be Blood. Woodcock is a preening exquisite, theatrical, highly strung, with a borderline bizarre speaking voice, sinuous and refined: an acquired style perhaps hinting at a humbler beginning than any he will admit to now. This Woodcock has the etiolated grace of a dancer, the misanthropy of an artist, and also the careless hauteur of the nobleman. It’s the kind of character Day-Lewis has played in other films – the one who nurses a politely unvoiced contempt for the lack of integrity he sees in everything and everyone around him, especially here the vulgar, moneyed women on whose patronage he is forced to rely. He is the definition of a gentleman: someone who never gives offence accidentally. I couldn’t watch Day-Lewis without grinning all over my face at this creation. But he is not supposed to be funny or camp. Krieps matches this as best she can with an intelligent, subdued naturalism, just as she did playing Jenny Marx in Raoul Peck’s new film The Young Karl Marx. Yet there is no question of who is in the spotlight. Joseph Losey is an influence, particularly in the superb scene-setting created by production designer Mark Tildesley and Mark Bridges’s costumes. The other influence of course is Hitchcock, with Krieps in the Joan Fontaine role from Rebecca and Day-Lewis the patrician Max de Winter, as played by Olivier. Manville is a combination of Mrs Danvers and Rebecca herself. There are no sugar-rush jukebox 50s hits on the soundtrack to establish the sentimentality of the period, or, for that matter, newspaper hoardings about Suez or Profumo. We stick strictly to a generalised sense of time and place and an orchestral score by Jonny Greenwood with classical pieces. It all creates a feeling of heightened reality, like a dream, particularly when a madly jealous Woodcock goes looking for Alma at a raucous New Year’s Eve party. But is it a nightmare or a swoon, a reverie? There is such pure delicious pleasure in this film, in its strangeness, its vehemence, its flourishes of absurdity, carried off with superb elegance. And Woodcock’s sartorial creations have a surreal quality, decadent, like dishes at a Roman banquet. Can this really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final performance? He’s said that it is, and he is not someone for speaking casually. We have to assume that this is goodbye. Maybe this is how onlookers felt at Nijinsky’s last public performance in 1917, which reputedly made Arthur Rubinstein burst into tears. It’s a wonderful high note for Day-Lewis to end on: I feel a mixture of euphoria and desperate sadness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"community/2017/nov/30/may-was-right-to-condemn-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T11:17:40Z","webTitle":"'May was right to condemn': your best comments on the Guardian today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/nov/30/may-was-right-to-condemn-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/nov/30/may-was-right-to-condemn-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","fields":{"headline":"'May was right to condemn': your best comments on the Guardian today","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s Twitter comments directed at Theresa May after she condemned his Britain First retweets were much discussed on site today.

To join in you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. MPs to debate Trump’s Twitter jibe at Theresa May Donald Trump rebuked the prime minister’s criticism of his sharing anti-Muslim propaganda by tweeting to a user with the same name, but the message was clear, and it seems to have put a strain on the “special relationship”. You shared reaction in today’s live blog as MPs debated. ‘Our isolationism is becoming even more apparent’ Theresa May was right to condemn Trump’s retweet of hard right racism emanating from Britain First, in fact she had no choice, it seems that the whole country was demanding something from her. Jeremy Corbyn and other senior politicians had already done so. The resulting response from Trump is typical of his belligerent and unthinking behaviour. Yet, if we had not voted to leave the EU, we could have counted on their support with regard to this difference of opinion with Trump. We don’t know how this spat between Trump and our government will pan out but one thing is sure it will have muddied the waters somewhat. As I’ve said May was right, she had no choice but leaving the EU has made our live doubly difficult in the wider world. thewash ‘May clearly chose a middle ground between doing the right thing and trying not to offend him’ It’s just a pity that Theresa May’s ‘rebuke’ of Trump was so pathetic. She clearly chose a middle ground between doing the right thing and trying not to offend him, forgetting she was dealing with a man who has the mental age of a six-year-old. Oh and what is with news channels giving [airtime] to Ann Coulter? Channel 4 last night, Today programme this morning. That’s not balance, that’s giving airtime to a media trained version of the raving racist nutter on the bus. PopeGregoryTheNinth NHS leaders meet to discuss cutting services amid funding gap - live updates We are live blogging as a critical meeting of NHS leaders takes place today to discuss a response to last week’s budget, which has worried practitioners. ‘This is the level that the most moderate Tory minister has stooped to’ When the request for more money for the NHS was low key, the Government insisted that it had given the NHS all it had asked for. This time, a more strident request for more money was met with a fit of pique from the the Chancellor who cut the money he had “intended to give it” because he was angry at [NHS England chief executive] Simon Stevens. This is the level that the most moderate Tory minister has stooped to, what hope can we have that this Tory government as whole will rise above the level of infantile tit for tat and name calling and “get on with the job”? The trouble is they don’t know what the job is so they descend into squabbling so they don’t have to face the ugly truth that they are utterly incompetent. SteveRP ‘They don’t want to hear that the majority of British people are prepared to pay higher taxes for the NHS’ This is exactly what the Tories want, in order to demonstrate that the NHS model is now totally out of date and needs root-and-branch reform - i.e. replacement by a private-insurance system. The fact that the majority of British people are prepared to pay higher taxes, provided that the money is earmarked for the NHS, is something they don’t want to hear. All who voted Conservative in June knew at heart that this was what they were enabling. The collapse of the UK is their doing. Pedrog The best city breaks in Germany: readers’ travel tips You’ve been adding to readers’ tips on some of the best cities to visit in Germany, from lesser-known to well trodden. Dresden, well and good, but if you are going that far, go further east into the Upper Lusatian area, particularly the town of Bautzen, where street signs (and others) are bilingual, Sorbian and German. The border cities of Zittau and Görlitz are also well worth visiting. Re Speyer: it should be added that the whole region (Pfalz - the Palatinate) is worth a visit, as it is a wine region rivalling Alsace for quality. eidos3 Very pleased to see the Guardian giving Germany a travel boost. Its a stunning country to visit as I have many times over the years. Spent a week in Dresden this year and compared with my last visit just after the Wall came down its stunningly restored to its former glory. Lots to see and do and eat and drink. Gets rather hot in the summer though! A city missed from this list is Heidelberg. Cute, lively bars, good cultural scene, lovely villages on the Necker. Also on Hamburg the Railway Wonderland Museum was missed out – I have no interest in railways but on a recommendation spent a fantastic few hours in this place. medicallyretired Comments have been edited for length.

The Guardian has been reporting on the lives and deaths of the young victims in its Beyond the Blade project but we want to continue to highlight this problem in 2018. To properly understand knife crime we felt it was important to reach voices that are beyond our usual readership, so we set up a callout asking people to share their experiences with us. We have heard from those whose family or friends have been caught up in knife crime and also from workers on the frontline trying to tackle the issue. Many responses tell the same story: that fear and desperation among young people may be fuelling an increase in the number carrying and using knives. Here, we share some of those experiences. Jude Lanchin, senior associate, criminal defence at Bindmans LLP It seems knife crime is no longer just a “gang” thing – if in fact it ever was, given the questionable definition of a gang used by the police (another issue that needs looking at urgently). That’s very concerning. There seem to be so many young people carrying knives now – they may have got into an unexpected conflict and never thought they would be going down that road, but now have a knife for protection. Even those who haven’t had conflict are scared of being attacked and might take a knife out with them. These are kids who are going to college or university and living ordinary lives, but they’re still carrying knives. Many young people involved at a deeper level have such a fatalistic view. They don’t think they will make it to their 25th birthday, or if they do, it’s likely to be in prison. It’s become a way of life, driven by “kill or be killed”. I work as a lawyer and community activist, and from what I see, things are definitely worse than before. I often feel pessimistic about the future. Although there is currently a lot of government talk about “knife crime”, those at ground level in the community, with different ideas and possible solutions, aren’t really listened to or given the resources to take things forward in any meaningful way. And it’s so clear that the punitive approach to knife crime taken by the government simply isn’t working. Jay, student, north London People don’t get into crime because they want to, most of the time. You live on the estate, Mum can’t pay the bills – are you going to do nothing? Most would sell drugs – thankfully I never had to. Once you get into that, you have to protect yourself and that’s where the knives come into play. Even if you don’t need the money any more, it’s going to be very hard to leave that life. You may not be able to. If you want to join a gang, you sometimes have to do initiation. Once you’re there you can’t leave. They know your family, where you live. At the end of my road someone was beaten to death. When that happens you’re going to be scared. You learn to show respect, show you’re not involved in anything. If you’re asked for a phone you just give it to them. You never know if someone has something. The biggest problem is that people feel they are in danger. They don’t feel safe when they go out. My parents still worry, my mum calls when I go out. I’d rather stay at home. I didn’t go out and play football because the parks were thought to be more dangerous. I think it’s getting worse. I’d be out a lot when I was younger, when I was too stupid to be safe, though I made sure I was out with friends. A metal detector was brought into our school, everyone had to go through. It came one morning, it was a bit random. One guy at school got stabbed, and then we had a few days off. The people that sold drugs in my year were the smart kids, very polite. No teachers had issues with them. They were good in class, in the top sets. They’re still dealing. Most people I know don’t like university. Uni is so boring, there’s such a lack of culture. Where I live is so much more interesting. It’s like Stockholm syndrome, we all want to come back. We know it’s dangerous but everyone still does it. People want to do bad stuff, they’re tempted by the thrill. Student, London As a young man, I seriously think that knife crime is getting out of control in London and the crime rate is rising a lot. I live in a dangerous area, and I have heard and seen a lot of things that I shouldn’t have. Knife crime is rising because young people are being influenced by other young people into living the life of a “roadman” or selling drugs. This type of thing happens from a young age. Many secondary school students start getting into gangs there. Schools might think everything is safe and that their students are great but outside of the classroom they are very different. I’ve seen it many times. To really stop knife crime you have to do something about gangs or young people who want to have a “gang life”. Kids are killing each other because of very stupid things and that is 100% not acceptable. The way things are going it will just keep getting worse. Youth worker, London I am a single female parent of Caribbean descent and my three children and I have done well. Now I work with young people because I understand not everyone is as lucky as we are. My work is about addressing the reason young men carry knives, and helping change their reasoning. When my son was in his mid-teens he thought he would be safer with some kind of weapon when he went out. Even young people from safe, secure homes can carry knives, so imagine what it’s like for those who don’t feel safe at home. I spoke to a young person recently who was exceptionally articulate about why he carried a knife. I felt his fear and his feeling of helplessness that the inevitable would happen to him if he did not protect himself or at least put up some show of strength. Often it’s not the tough ones that get hurt, it’s the ones on the periphery because they’re more scared. I do understand their fear. I’m a black woman, I have a son and I worry about the police. My son’s been stopped and searched and you can go from stop and search to being dead – if my son steps out of the door, I’m afraid. We’re afraid for our children and they’re afraid. When he was younger and went out, I couldn’t sleep. I was so scared all the time that after a while I had a breakdown. It’s better now he’s an adult. Government funding for youth provision, school policies, parents and police all have roles to play in combating knife crime. The way the media report knife crime perpetuates the feeling of fear in adults and young people, and then people who are afraid protect themselves with a knife or with prejudice. Anonymous, south London Both my sons have been stabbed. My eldest son was really badly injured: his lung was punctured, it was quite horrific. He was in hospital for two weeks. My other son is more of a street boy than his elder brother. He has been caught up in troubles and stabbed but luckily it wasn’t life threatening. One of his friends was stabbed and killed two years ago. He was such a lovely boy. It was on the high street, it made me so angry thinking it could have been my son. I think knife crime is happening for a variety of reasons, such as the breakdown of family and the wider community. It’s not our culture: a lot of our parents were married, there are a lot of single parents now. Why would you take someone’s life who looks like you? You don’t think much about yourself – the education system doesn’t teach what’s good about being black. I think the way the police treat young black men is questionable. The community are trying as hard as they can to rebuild the support system. In south London it’s happening to second- and third-generation black British men ... why should these young people be dying every week? Young black males need attention and positive interaction with black men in our community to be shown how to be a responsible man. Many of these young people have no respect for their fathers because they have not been in their lives. These young people lack self regard and are low on self esteem. They’re taking each others’ lives without remorse. My son’s social media profile was brought to my attention by other parents. My son was involved in something and their son was a target. We got the boys together and they ended up speaking about it and not hurting one another, but this doesn’t happen very often. Parents don’t know how to access social media – I had no idea. Now we’re burying our young people and what’s our future if we don’t do anything? Anonymous My brother is on remand suspected of stabbing someone earlier this year. There are others also on remand as my understanding is that none of them will confess or say who did it. He is still a teenager, and has a previous allegation of knife crime too. He was always a sweet young boy who would show so much love and affection. He was intelligent but didn’t really know how to apply it at school – he was always acting the class clown. I never thought he would be caught up in this. I believe that knife crime is on the rise because it’s easy to get involved in the cycle but difficult then to get out. You must always be thinking: “Is it me next?” The reasons behind a lot of attacks are actually really pathetic: silly words that quickly lead to someone losing their life. I don’t know how you can stop knife crime because I feel it’s almost become the norm to some people. As scary as it is for me to imagine, I know that carrying a knife is as normal to some people as it is for me to leave the house with my keys, phone and wallet. Teacher, south-east London I was on a jury for a knife crime murder trial. I hadn’t been aware of the issues that exist among young people. For example, how they would wear two pairs of trousers to conceal a knife. It scared me, as a teacher, to think about how these children and young adults felt like they needed to protect themselves in such a way. Although I have not physically been a victim of knife crime, it changed my life and views forever. These young people are referred to as being in “gangs” but to each other they are their own little families and to risk being excluded from that must be very scary. I genuinely believe that the majority of these young people don’t carry knives to hurt or murder, they carry them because that’s the “done thing” or to protect themselves without considering the stark reality of what it could result in. The camaraderie between these young people is astounding. They laughed, slept, joked around during the trial like it was a TV programme, like it wasn’t real. I’ve heard and read that some gang members/young people see a jail sentence as a badge of honour, and to some extent that is what I witnessed. That also scared me: how could committing a murder or being associated with one not make you flinch? How have they been conditioned to be like that? Claire van Helfteren, Capital Conflict Management I am a specialist in conflict resolution, working with knife crime in London. A serious concern is that gangs are glamourised. Ex-gang members are now celebrities. We should be dealing with kids much younger, at the lower end of secondary school, and also with young people in pupil referral units. We need resources in schools but they can’t afford it. My organisation set up a mentoring arm three years ago. We’re dealing with about 200 kids. The numbers have gone up and the incidents have gone up but the resources haven’t. Resources have gone down and crime has gone up. Young people fear for their future. They’re all carrying knives. We see the hopelessness. They feel they have no future and no ambition, and they are more dangerous because they care less. No consequences scare them; they can’t change anything to make it better. Some of the problems are cultural. For example, in first generation immigrant families, there can be problems if a child’s mother isn’t integrated. The child goes off to school and they then have two lives: their culture at home, and then in school where they don’t feel they fit in. And then comes the third life, where they feel they belong. Mediation is a win-win. Getting people round a table is the biggest thing through all conflicts – you’ve got to talk to each other. Headteacher, LondonI grew up close to the school where I now work. It’s always been an area for gang-related crime but not so much as during the last five years. That’s because of a huge range of factors, including the closure of youth services, there being less for young people to do, and the rise of social media and use of smartphones. There are now more ways to communicate negatively and things can escalate very quickly. Lots of threats are now made in a public forum, and even when those threats are minor – such as arguing about Fifa on the PlayStation – it’s a problem because other people can see them. It’s about saving face and avoiding being slighted in any way. Lots of young people come from families with difficult socio-economic backgrounds and language issues, so they feel isolated. They’re not really interacting or learning those education skills. It’s left to schools to fill the gaps. The school at which I’m a senior leader is for those with social, emotional and mental needs. I completely back social services, but they’re so stretched. Child and adolescent mental health services are fantastic, but they don’t have the resources in our area. They’re massively overworked. The police are fantastic – they follow up on every little thing. We did have a situation where a threat to stab a pupil was made on social media. The person who made the threat was known to the authorities, as was their family. When the young person arrived at the school, I managed to de-escalate the situation by reasoning with them. It’s only afterwards you think of your own safety and consider: “What if I’d said the wrong thing?” The myth of gangs is spread on social media, but most gangs are scared teenage boys with lots of bravado. Some kids who get excluded treat it like a badge of honour. I have one young man at risk of exclusion from us, but then he’ll go to a pupil referral unit, and then he’s more at risk."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/01/no-sweets-here-your-best-homemade-advent-calendars","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T10:42:44Z","webTitle":"'No sweets here': your best homemade advent calendars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/01/no-sweets-here-your-best-homemade-advent-calendars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/01/no-sweets-here-your-best-homemade-advent-calendars","fields":{"headline":"'No sweets here': your best homemade advent calendars","bodyText":"December has arrived and – at least in the sense of a modern calendar – this means the beginning of advent. In 2017 the liturgical date may be 3 December, but that won’t stop many of you beginning a tradition that seems to have been taken over by confectionery giants and luxury gift sellers. Guardian writers recently looked at some of the most outlandish creations on sale this year, but here are a few of our favourite home made calendars that you’ll be opening windows on in the coming weeks. ‘I have created my children an advent calendar that I hope will inspire them to make the world a better place’ This year I have created my children an advent calendar (pictured at the top of this article) that I hope will inspire them to make the world a better place. Each little jar contains a challenge and a jelly bean – there had to be a sweet involved somewhere! The challenges range from things like “hug your mum” (very difficult for my 13-year-old daughter) to bake a cake, donate something to charity or tell a friend a joke. “Read a poem” might be a struggle for my 9-year-old daughter, who thinks books are boring! So in all there are 24 different challenges each, some coinciding with the sibling’s calendar. Currently both of my children are excited about the advent calendars and I hope that at least a few memories will be created... Even if it turns out in time that my children reminisce about the home made advent calendar that in order to get one lousy jelly bean they had to wash their nan’s car! beckywoll ‘Illustrations just just seem so much more appealing to me’ I’m an illustrator and artist and made this calendar to sell, because I really like a traditional paper calendar as opposed to the chocolate or gift based ones. I’m looking forward to a little scene each day – it just seems so much more appealing to me. It’s based on the Exeter landmark the House that Moved, a medieval house they literally carted down the street during urban regeneration in the 1960s. I quite liked the idea of a bunch of kids being in control of it. The windows include scenes from A Christmas Carol, the Box of Delights and Mr James having a Christmas tipple with a ghost, as well as an alien delivering presents and an ice skating duck. Despite the obvious local angle (I live in Devon, a few miles from Exeter), I have had orders from as far afield as Sheffield, Uganda and New Zealand. Sarah Coomer ‘My mother ensured that we treated the model with great respect’ This Danish advent calendar was sent to me at Christmas in 1951 by relatives in Copenhagen. At that time I was a child living in England. It shows Nisse men, in their red hats and grey jerseys, waiting in line and taking turns to ride down the Rutschebane or slide chute in a little cart. Nisse men are part of Scandinavian folklore, and are considered guardians of the farmyard. To us they were also associated with Christmas. Every year I helped assemble the cardboard model and then we opened a door a day to find the little picture inside – no gifts or sweets here! In between times I could run the little wagon down the chute. The model stands about 50cm high from the floor to the top of the flag. It was always very special to me for some reason and not only because it signified Christmas. My mother ensured that we treated the model with great respect, and every New Year it was carefully packed away again. She kept it safe in a thick cardboard folder which also contained the original envelope the calendar came in. It is 66 years old now and a little frail, with sticky tape and staples in places, but with care it can still be assembled. Jo Wicht ‘Each envelope features images of his adorable grandchildren’ My Dad had an accident three and a half years ago that left him a tetraplegic. He needs 24 hour care and after nine months in hospital is now in a care home. He is a shadow of his former self and suffers from depression. He hasn’t been home ever since his accident, and Christmas is an especially tough time for him. I made this advent calendar for my Dad last year. Each envelope features images of his adorable grandchildren, paired with uplifting quotes. It brought much optimism to him over the dark winter days. Feng Ho Typographical Christmas Took me some time but wanted something special year after year for my son – the little pockets can hold all manner of surprises. Gwenyth Lloyd A little less effort went into this one, but it’s all in good spirit Home made jellybean calendar. I made it after a couple of beers with friends. I can’t remember why, but my kids thought it was hilarious.

These guys just get football, on a different level to most of us. This is why they are the custodians of the game, and safer hands there could not be (though Gordon Banks, who will pluck a few balls in Friday’s draw, had a pretty decent pair. Of hands.) The draw will surely prove this to all of us. Held in the State Kremlin Palace, a 6,000-capacity arena, there will be 1,500 journalists and 1,400 guests, 465 volunteers, 210 performers, 30 coaches (representing all but two of the qualified nations: Australia don’t currently have one and Uruguay’s Óscar Tabárez doesn’t seem to be bothered) and 10 “football legends” including two from England, the co-host Gary Lineker and the aforementioned Banks. Meanwhile, Fifa proudly announces, 162 bins and containers will be used to separate and recycle waste. Hang on, 162 bins and containers? And this number is interesting how exactly? Sure, it’s good that they’re there – no “football legend” wants to hang around in an arena strewn with empty crisp packets and apple cores – but with statistics like this it seems nothing will stop Fifa from littering the world with mundanity. This isn’t even a one-off. At the end of the 2014 World Cup – where “specially trained volunteers” were “responsible for waste separation” – it proudly announced that “420 tonnes of recyclable waste was collected from the stadiums and additional World Cup-related facilities”. During preparations for the preliminary draw for the 2018 tournament, held in St Petersburg back in 2015, Fifa announced that “a tailor-made system of 150-200 waste bins will be used to ensure that non-recyclable waste is separated from recyclable material such as paper, plastic, glass, batteries, food waste, cardboard, cans [and] packaging materials”. It turns out that this number was not only woefully imprecise but wildly inaccurate. A subsequent release declared “recycling a success at Russia 2018 preliminary draw” and announced that “more than 300 containers were used”. “In total, 655kg of packaging made from various forms of polyethylene was sent for recycling, along with 790kg of cardboard and paper, 350kg of glass, 107kg of plastic bottles, 77kg of organic waste and 6kg of batteries,” Fifa trilled. “In addition, more than three tonnes of decorations will be reused at civic events.” The Fiver would like to make it absolutely clear that recycling is important. We do not wish to belittle it. But let’s just consider this boast for a moment. An empty plastic water bottle weighs about 19 grams. A single piece of paper weighs about 4.5 grams. So Fifa got through 5,632 non-reusable bottles and threw out 176,000 pieces of unnecessary paper, and then declared its sustainability program “a success”. The scamp. Fifa’s statistical breakdown of tomorrow’s ball-plucking concludes that “the draw to establish who the competing nations will face during the group stage” will offer “arguably the most important numbers of all”. In Fifa’s world, the idea that the most important bit of the World Cup draw is the World Cup draw is in some way “arguable”. Tomorrow’s schedule in brief, then: at 2pm local time (11am GMT/12pm CET) the 30 coaches and other members of the team delegations will attend a “team seminar” where they “will learn about the key operational aspects of next year’s showpiece event” (fascinating bin statistic ahoy), and at 6pm local time (3pm GMT/4pm CET) the draw itself will start, whereupon we will finally learn the identities of the national sides destined to take the starring roles in the ease-through-qualifying-crumble-at-the-finals drama that England seem so keen – and Fifa will appreciate this – on endlessly recycling.

Glitzy product announcements, probably; warehouse-tall HD screens presenting groundbreaking pieces of technology or paradigm-shifting ways to communicate. On the less hyperbolic end of the scale, you might assume that most attendees would be fully clothed. That’s not always the case, however, as the debacle that was the Digital Entrepreneur Awards (DEA) neatly illustrates. No high-tech displays or feats of ingenuity here: instead, guests were greeted by corset-wearing showgirls and regaled with offensive jokes from Love Island voiceover star Iain Stirling. Apple keynote this was not. A team from the University of Bradford has even handed back the prize it was awarded for most innovative use of video. The director of external affairs at the university, Mark Garratt, told the Times that attending the event was like “going back to the days of Bernard Manning”. Digital comms agency Lab – DEA’s agency of the year – described the event as “like seeing toxic waste being dumped on a beautiful beach”. A friend of mine was also there. “The show basically revolved around ‘jokes’ about wives giving blowjobs to their husbands,” she told me. “They had an opportunity to challenge the stereotypes of working in tech and they failed. They failed massively.” After an extensive social media backlash, the organisers were forced to agree: “Our aim was to celebrate tech and never to undermine the incredible women in the industry or do anything to negate the work everyone in the industry is doing to promote equality and redress the balance,” they wrote in an apologetic blogpost. Bad-taste, misogynistic jokes at a minor awards ceremony are, in the grand scheme of things, a fairly trivial thing. But, forming a small part of a bigger picture as they do, it’s not trivial at all. Yes, sexism sometimes comes in the comparatively harmless form of jokes even Jim Davidson would consider passe. But at other times it manifests as demeaning remarks in the workplace: as sexual harassment, as systemic imbalances of power – all things that women in tech are putting up with on a daily basis, and which are preventing them from getting ahead. The reputation the tech industry has for being dominated by “bros” hasn’t come out of nowhere. Despite all its lofty talk of innovation, tech is often a hugely unwelcoming place for women – from graduates just starting out to those occupying more senior roles. Ellen Pao, previously interim CEO at Reddit, has written extensively about the sexism she encountered in the world of tech: her new book, Reset, looks at her self-proclaimed “fight for inclusion”. Similarly, earlier this year, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler detailed the sexism that reached the very top of the company, encountering systemic failings from management to HR. These are just the women speaking out: many more remain silent. When women working in tech are faced with jokes like those told at the DEAs, it’s a slap in the face: a reminder that no matter how hard they work or how seriously they take their careers, they will always be considered second best. So while it might seem to bystanders that a backlash over some misogynistic jokes made at an awards ceremony is yet another storm in a social media teacup, it’s not. The outrage has not been manufactured – it’s genuine, and it’s because women in tech are sick of being treated as if they themselves are a joke. They’re also tired of being told to put up and shut up. Fowler was asked by an HR manager whether she might “be the problem”. My friend attending the DEAs told me she was made to feel “like I was in the wrong for calling it out, like I should have felt privileged to be included in the old boys’ club”. Speaking out is fiercely discouraged, which makes women such as Pao, Fowler or even just anonymous tweeters at badly organised awards ceremonies all the braver. Obviously, we’re nowhere close to vanquishing the overwhelmingly sexist culture of the tech industry – inequalities are embedded into the very structure of the industry. It’s also worth noting that most of those who feel able to publicly take a stand are privileged already. Whether it’s their white privilege or their financial situation, many of these women have a safety net to fall back on, meaning the voices of some of the most vulnerable women in the industry remain unheard. But the fact that women are speaking out and fighting back isn’t going to change – which means, sometime soon, the party’s going to be over for the toxic world of the tech bros. • Emily Reynolds is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/01/christmas-jumper-out-time-for-christmas-suit-opposuit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T14:03:47Z","webTitle":"The Christmas jumper is out.

Time for the Christmas suit!","bodyText":"First it was the onesie, then novelty knitwear reigned supreme during the festive season. Now the Christmas suit, the sartorial equivalent of wrapping paper, arrives in stores in time for the festive season. The brash suits come with reindeers, sleighs and snowmen printed on the technicolour shades of green and red traditionally favoured by elves. John Lewis has already sold out of a bright red women’s suit emblazoned with Santa’s sleigh and giant snowflakes. Celebrities including the chef Jamie Oliver, the former cricket Freddie Flintoff and former One Direction member Niall Horan have blazed the trail, but the trend is moving into the mainstream after the suits, made by Dutch clothing brand OppoSuits, were picked up by major high street names including Next, Asos and Topman. OppoSuits co-founder Jelle van der Zwet said it created women’s and children’s versions because couples wanted to up the ante over the festive season by “twinning” their looks or kit out the entire family in matching outfits. Van der Zwet said: “The Christmas jumper has been around for seven or eight years so it makes sense that there is a new product. The suits appeal to the [social media] super-sharing culture ... everyone is looking for something new so they can stand out from the crowd.” The popularity of Facebook and Instagram has created demand for novelty gear with retailers increasingly selling props – another example is the trend for kitsch pool inflatables – to help Britons compose the ultimate social media shot. The supermarket chain Asda, for example, has created matching pyjamas for the entire extended family to wear on Christmas Eve, with the “Dad elf” set already sold out in extra large. Van der Zwet said wearing one of his company’s suits drew a huge amount of attention but added that going down the matching outfit route resulted in an even bigger wow factor: “It makes people more confident if they wear them together and it’s a much bigger statement.” At the start of the decade it was the onesie which was in demand as celebrities ranging from the actor Brad Pitt to the boy band One Direction OKed the adult romper-suit trend. The Christmas jumper usurped the onesie as the joke du jour in 2013 but the festive knit’s moment in the sun was shortlived reaching a peak two years ago. Despite entire sections devoted to Christmas jumpers in charity shops around the country, John Lewis said there had been no let up in demand for novelty fashion pieces. The department store said it expected a run on Christmas suits when the office party season gets under way in earnest. OppoSuits expects sales to double this year, shifting up to 750,000 as the trend gathers momentum both here and across the Atlantic. Dan Cooper, Christmas buyer at John Lewis, said: “The Christmas jumper trend has been rising steadily over the last few years. But while most of us will have a novelty jumper stashed in a cupboard, the Christmas suit is really taking it to the next level. I think it appeals to customers who have embraced the Christmas jumper but are a bit braver and looking for something that really makes a statement.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.

The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has invited local police officers to conduct the inquiry into how the chemical was smuggled into the high-security courtroom in The Hague. A spokeswoman for the war crimes court said: “An independent investigation is ongoing which has been initiated by the Dutch authorities at the request of the ICTY. We will cooperate fully.” She did not reveal whether anybody had yet been arrested or what type of chemical or toxic agent Praljak drank. A Dutch prosecutor, Marilyn Fikenscher, confirmed that the phial from which Praljak drank was found to have held a deadly poison. “There was a preliminary test of the substance in the container and all I can say for now is that there was a chemical substance in that container that can cause death,” Fikenscher said. A prosecution spokesman said an autopsy would be carried out shortly. Praljak, 72, consumed the contents of the bottle in full view of the cameras filming the hearing, seconds after a UN appeals judge had confirmed a 20-year sentence against him on Wednesday. “I just drank poison,” he informed the astonished judges. “I am not a war criminal. I oppose this conviction.” He was rushed to hospital by ambulance and died later. The ICTY’s website declared before Wednesday’s hearing: “All persons entering the building are subject to security checks of themselves and their belongings.” Recent adverts for security officers at the ICTY specified experience in “use of technical screening equipment to prevent prohibited items from entering the tribunal premises”. Candidates were required to have a high school diploma or equivalent. There are questions about how Praljak acquired the substance, and whether it was supplied to him by a visitor to the fortress-like UN detention centre in Scheveningen, near The Hague, where Praljak was being held. Under court rules, everyone entering the detention centre is subject to tight security “irrespective of his or her status, nationality, function or age”. Everyone must pass through security scanners and there may also be a search of clothing.Detainees are allowed to have access to their medications, administered under the supervision of the chief medical officer. They are allowed approved visits from personal doctors. The Dutch newspaper NRC said many of the suspects there were elderly and “suffering from all sorts of illnesses”. It said it was “not unusual that he could have brought his medication to hearings”. Praljak’s lawyer, Nika Pinter, was quoted by Croatia’s Hina news agency on Thursday as saying: “It has never occurred to me that he could do something like that.” Pinter described Praljak as “an honourable man who could not live with the war crimes conviction and leave that courtroom handcuffed.” Praljak was convicted in 2013 of crimes including murder, persecution and deportation for his role in a plan to carve out a Bosnian Croat mini-state in Bosnia in the early 1990s. In the Croatian capital, Zagreb, MPs observed a minute’s silence. The parliament’s speaker, Gordan Jandroković, called on members to remember “all victims of the wars in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina”, including civilians and “the killed and missing Croatian defenders”. “All victims have to remain forever in our collective consciousness and yesterday’s death of General Praljak should remain the last act of the tragic events of war,” he said. Two MPs were reported to have received death threats on social media after refusing to attend the commemoration. Hundreds of Bosnian Croats lit candles in public squares around the country in memory of Praljak. Photographs of him were put up on walls. There was a heightened police presence in many cities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/03/happy-end-review-beautifully-bleak-gallows-humour-michael-haneke","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T08:00:36Z","webTitle":"Happy End review – gallows humour for all the family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/03/happy-end-review-beautifully-bleak-gallows-humour-michael-haneke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/03/happy-end-review-beautifully-bleak-gallows-humour-michael-haneke","fields":{"headline":"Happy End review – gallows humour for all the family","bodyText":"Michael Haneke’s new film gleams with cold gallows humour. There’s blunt, rasping comedy to be found in its thematic grimness (Happy End might also be titled Death Wish), though the Austrian director’s bleak worldview won’t be to everyone’s taste. The plot begins with 13 year-old Eve (Fantine Harduin), who is forced to stay with her father Thomas (Mathieu Kassovitz), in Calais, with his new wife and their young child after her mother overdoses. Also living in the Laurent family home is Thomas’s sister, severe real estate developer Anne (Isabelle Huppert), and their depressed father Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant of Haneke’s Amour), who at a robust 84 is “too healthy” to qualify for the assisted suicide he seeks, and so must make alternative arrangements. Eve moves quietly, watching the adults around her. One of the most interesting things about Happy End is the way Haneke’s camera captures the act of watching; always interested in technology and surveillance, here he often favours fixed perspectives, trailing his characters over the shoulder or looking with detachment from an unmoving vantage point. A fist-fight plays out from a voyeuristic, clinical remove, while the film’s opening takes place via a series of darkly funny Snapchat-style videos. Eve discovers her father’s laptop and a series of sexually explicit messages on a Facebook-style website. It’s pretty upsetting stuff, but we’re encouraged to laugh, and to see the Laurents as a parody of bourgeois selfishness (Haneke inserts BBC News footage to highlight how glaringly unaware the family are of the refugee crisis taking place on their doorstep). There are some brilliantly zany comic moments too; an interpretive dance sequence set to Sia’s Chandelier, Huppert’s Anne dislocating somebody’s finger, and a magnificent final set piece filmed on an iPhone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/nov/30/bbc-radio-4-defends-ann-coulter-interview-on-today-programme-nick-robinson","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T19:04:39Z","webTitle":"BBC Radio 4 defends Ann Coulter interview on Today programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/30/bbc-radio-4-defends-ann-coulter-interview-on-today-programme-nick-robinson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/nov/30/bbc-radio-4-defends-ann-coulter-interview-on-today-programme-nick-robinson","fields":{"headline":"BBC Radio 4 defends Ann Coulter interview on Today programme","bodyText":"Nick Robinson has been forced to defend BBC Radio 4’s Today programme for its decision to interview the rightwing US commentator Ann Coulter after a backlash against her appearance. The Today programme presenter said the BBC invited her on to the programme to “explain and scrutinise” Donald Trump for retweeting far-right videos and his response to criticism of his actions. Robinson tweeted after the show: “For those criticising BBC Radio 4 Today for interviewing Ann Coulter – we did so to reveal and explain &amp; scrutinise the source of the Trump tweet.” Coulter is one of 45 people that Trump follows on Twitter and it is thought he may have retweeted the videos after seeing them on her feed. She was interviewed by Robinson on Today about the president sharing three videos posted by the deputy leader of the far-right group Britain First and then fighting back against criticism from Theresa May, the British prime minister. Coulter said Trump could not be expected to check the biography of people he retweeted and that “the video is the video, it’s not a faked video”. She also defended his response to criticism from the UK, saying: “I think he has only given as good as he gets. I think he has been verbally attacked from the mother country for a lot longer than he has been attacking Britain, starting with that petition to ban him.” Robinson called for Coulter to “answer the question” about whether Trump should have criticised May, and Coulter responded by telling Robinson that she had a “little tip for him” – that he should spend time on Twitter and “figure out” that people retweeting videos do not research the biographies of the people who originally shared them. The BBC has strict impartiality rules which mean it has to consider a range of views when broadcasting news. Presenters and journalists such as Robinson have revealed that the BBC can spend hours agonising over how to guarantee impartiality before broadcasting a story. If the BBC receives a complaint – as seems likely after the Coulter interview – then its executive complaints unit could consider again whether the organisation met impartiality and accuracy rules with the broadcast. “I have seen the costly, wasteful, debilitating hours that are spent parsing this or that phrase into how to answer a complaint about an item that was broadcast weeks if not months earlier,” Robinson said in speech in September when he called for the BBC to be more transparent about its dedication to impartiality. “Let’s not leave the editorial debate we had on the metaphorical cutting room floor along with the footage we didn’t use but pin at least some of it up and then – when complaints do follow – point to what we said and did at the time.” The BBC’s interview with Coulter reignited the debate about how the broadcaster approaches impartiality. In the past it has been criticised for giving too much weight to contested or even false claims – such as during the Brexit referendum and when debating climate change. Remainers have complained that the BBC gave too much airtime to leave arguments in the run-up to last year’s vote and did not do enough to question claims that Britain paid £350m a week to the European Union which could be used to fund the NHS instead. James Harding, the outgoing director of news at the BBC, dismissed these claims in an article for the Guardian last September. He said the BBC “should be open to those who may challenge a consensus” at all times. Coulter also appeared on Channel 4 News on Wednesday evening and ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Thursday. However, her appearance on Today – which has a weekly audience of more than 7 million people – generated the strongest reaction. The BBC was criticised on social media for choosing Coulter to defend Trump and also for broadcasting a defence of the US president and the videos. Sarah Ditum, a columnist, said: “Ann Coulter on Today. If they’re interviewing people who retweet racist shit, there’s a guy I went to school with who lives in Spalding now they should talk to.” Chris Bryant, the Labour MP, added: “Sometimes I’m really taken aback by an interview. Ann Coulter was hectoring, mendacious and full of spite. I fear for the world when people like her have the ear of the world.” Coulter has appeared on the BBC before. In 2006 she appeared on Newsnight to promote her book Godless: The Church of Liberalism. Jeremy Paxman started the interview by saying: “Your publishers gave us chapter one, Ann Coulter. I’ve read it. Does it get any better?” • This article was amended on 1 December 2017 because an earlier version said that Today has a daily audience of more than 7 million people.

The tropical lope of Banana Clip is so brilliantly realised it makes Miguel’s nudge-wink metaphors about shooting firearms seem like the height of sophistication, even romance.

He has forced reappraisals of neglected works and composers, most notably, perhaps, Alexander Zemlinsky, whose music he has assiduously championed. It is, however, to one of Zemlinsky’s contemporaries, the Austrian composer Joseph Marx, that Jurowski has now turned, offering the UK premiere of the latter’s An Autumn Symphony in his latest concert with the London Philharmonic. Marx (1882-1964) is best known for his sensuously attractive songs, which have recently been taken up by, among others, Renée Fleming and Angelika Kirchschlager. Dating from 1921, An Autumn Symphony, however, is a grand statement about ripeness, plenitude and transience, post-Romantic in idiom and enormous in scale, requiring no less than 10 percussionists, for instance. Its four movements broadly trace a narrative trajectory from dawn to sunset over a single day. The scherzo, entitled Dance of the Noon Spirits, suggests Nietzsche’s idea of the Great Noontide of human aspiration. The mood is prevailingly Dionysian. The symphony is, however, deeply problematic. Marx’s thematic inspiration is at best uneven, and occasionally derivative: the striking, bitonal opening with its rippling harp dissonances and low chromatic strings is so closely modelled on the the prelude to Schrecker’s opera Die Gezeichneten as to seem unoriginal. Marx’s equation of autumnal plenitude with orchestral excess, meanwhile, results in heavyweight, bloated scoring with very little textural variation or contrast. Still, you could fault neither Jurowski’s commitment nor the grandeur of the LPO’s playing. The decibel count in the finale, when Marx finally deploys all 10 percussionists, was overpowering. But by then, it’s too late: satiety sets in all too quickly here, and the symphony fails to sustain itself over its 80-minute span. Jurowski prefaced it with two short works for violin and orchestra – Chausson’s Poème and Respighi’s Autumn Poem – played by the excellent Julia Fischer. The Chausson was all restrained lyricism and warmth. Respighi says more, perhaps, about autumn in 15 minutes than Marx manages in over an hour, and his mastery of orchestral textures is, of course, second to none: the closing pages, as colour drains from the score and the harshness of winter looms, are both exquisite and deeply touching."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/30/knife-crime-epidemic-cross-government-programme-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T10:29:51Z","webTitle":"Knife crime is an epidemic.

Do we care enough to look for a cure?","bodyText":"The figures revealed by the Guardian on Tuesday, which show knife deaths among children and teenagers approaching a 40-year high, should shock us all. What’s more, this year is no outlier. Knife crime is back on the rise in a big way. Last year hospital admissions for knife assault wounds jumped by 21%, which followed a 13% rise the previous year. And the majority of these victims? Young people. Police forces across the country are seeing a rise in knife crime: 38 of the 44 police forces in England and Wales have reported an increase. And the age of those carrying knives is getting younger. When 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds are walking around with knives, something has gone very wrong. Behind these numbers, behind every headline, are communities and families in shock. In my area in Croydon, where two teenagers have been killed in recent months, every single youth organisation is reporting increasing anxiety and trauma from the young people they work with. So why is it getting worse? Police cuts are a major issue of course, but we can’t arrest ourselves out of this problem. We brought young people to parliament last week to meet MPs and talk about their experiences of knife crime. The issues go deep – from mental health to social media, from poverty to fashion. Deterrents and punishments are important of course, but they aren’t the only answer to tackling this in the long term. Youth centres are closing and schools are under huge pressure, leading to the “managed moves” of difficult children – often regardless of undiagnosed special needs. Youth workers regularly talk about the “PRU to prison pipeline” of disengaged young people in pupil referral units getting into a cycle of trouble. Social media is having a big impact, intensifying the cycle of violence and enabling widespread bullying. Many people want to see technology companies take more responsibility for how their platforms are used, but we also need to look at the channels collating and sharing inappropriate content. What do we need to do to turn this around? First we need to recognise that this is a public health crisis. For too long we’ve been focused on the symptoms – we need to look at the causes, not just the crime. We need a cross-government programme of action with multiple departments and long-term ambitions. Five months ago, the prime minister promised me action – but she has yet to deliver anything meaningful. On Wednesday in prime minister’s questions I called again for government intervention. To place youth workers in all major trauma centres in England would cost as little as £6m a year. These interventions are proven to be highly effective at taking young people out of the cycle of violence. I know from experience how important this is. My local police force saved the life of a young man, putting their fingers into stab wounds in his neck to stop the flow of blood. A week later he was caught on the streets with a stab vest and a knife, looking for revenge. And of course, the justice system is important here. There is more to be done in banning certain horrific knives, improving the use of electronic tagging and cracking down on moped crime, reflecting the changing nature of crime. But ultimately we need to treat this as an epidemic and cut it off at source. Violence breeds violence. Mental health, social media, youth services, education and poverty are all part of the problem and we need to decide if we care enough to act. How much do we really value these young lives? • Sarah Jones is Labour MP for Croydon Central and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on knife crime"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/30/how-have-you-been-affected-by-nhs-cuts-in-england-share-your-experiences","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T11:11:00Z","webTitle":"How have you been affected by NHS cuts in England?

Race organisers initially took advice from the Italian foreign ministry to describe the start point as west Jerusalem, due to competing Israeli and Palestinian claims over the city. Israeli politicians, led by the controversial culture and sport minister, Miri Regev, threatened to withdraw support, claiming the race was in breach of its agreement. At 9am on Thursday, the Giro’s official website still carried the disputed wording, but by the afternoon, organisers had revised it to describe the start point for the first stage as Jerusalem. At the heart of the controversy is the fraught status of the city. Following the capture and later annexation of the eastern side of Jerusalem by Israeli troops during the six-day war in 1967, Israel has claimed it as its united capital. Most international opinion, however, has declined to recognise that assertion, while Palestinians claim the Israeli-occupied east of the city as the capital of a future Palestinian state. It was into this long-running conflict that the Giro’s organisers interposed themselves when they decided to stage the first departure outside of Europe in the history of the race, which first took place in 1909. The Giro, which was condemned by Palestinian campaigners for opting to hold the first stage in Jerusalem, found itself under fire from Israel as it tried to negotiate the politics of half a century of occupation. The race, the first three stages of which were scheduled to begin in Israel before returning to Italy for the remaining 18, had been announced to great fanfare this year as the first time a European Grand Tour would start in Israel. Mauro Vegni, the Giro’s director, said he was aware of the political sensitivities around the status of Jerusalem. “The reality is that we want it to be a sports event and stay away from any political discussion,” he told the Associated Press. Leading the charge against the decision to change the description of the start was Regev, who said in a joint statement with the tourism minister, Yariv Levin: “In Jerusalem, Israel’s capital, there is no east or west. The change to the wording was later welcomed by Regev and Levin. “Following our response to the Giro management, we are pleased to see the prompt reaction of the organisers in removing the name ‘west Jerusalem’ from their official announcements,” they said. The staging of the Giro, in which Chris Froome, the three-time British Tour de France champion, is expected to compete in his attempt to win the first Tour-Giro double in two decades, was seen as a boon for Israel, which has an enthusiastic road racing community. According to reports in cycling media, Israel paid €10m (£9m) to bring the event out of Europe for the first time, with Froome, who confirmed his planned participation in a tweet, reportedly receiving an additional fee. The race, which is scheduled to open with a 10.1km individual time trial in Jerusalem on 4 May followed by two flat road stages, was criticised in September by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which said it represented a “sports-washing of Israel’s occupation and apartheid”. Sharaf Qutaifan of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel said: “Starting the Giro in Israel to all intents rewards Israel for its decades-long human rights abuses against the Palestinian people, including athletes.” • This article was amended on 4 December 2017.

Having been notified of the “huge” security hole on Tuesday, the company’s security engineers raced to fix the problem, releasing an update that was pushed out to users of macOS High Sierra on Wednesday afternoon. Unfortunately, that fix introduced another bug, this time within the file sharing system of macOS, preventing some users from authenticating with or connecting to file shares, which are used both in business and on home networks. The company quickly acknowledged the problem, releasing a support document guiding users through how to fix the problem caused by the critical bug patch. Unfortunately, to perform the necessary repair, users have to use an advanced feature of the operating system called the Terminal and perform command line actions: Open the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder. Type sudo /usr/libexec/configureLocalKDC and press Return. Enter your administrator password and press Return. Quit the Terminal app. Despite the straightforward explanation and commands provided by Apple, many Mac users will not have experience of running commands within Terminal, a program designed to give advanced users direct, text-based access to underlying systems within macOS. Some took to Twitter to vent their frustration. Others were more pragmatic, saying that breaking file-sharing tools was better than leaving the root-access bug unpatched for longer. Apple apologised on 29 November for the original bug, saying that security was still a top priority for the company and that it had “stumbled” with macOS High Sierra. A spokesperson said: “We greatly regret this error and we apologise to all Mac users, both for releasing with this vulnerability and for the concern it has caused. Our customers deserve better.

But that traditional caution is hard to detect in relation to Thistlecrack, back in action in Newbury’s Long Distance Hurdle today. It’s less than 10 months since he was found to have a tendon tear, which is a pretty impressive recovery time, for all that Colin Tizzard maintained from the outset that his star would be back by Christmas. It would be great to see him win the King George, looking just as good as he did last Boxing Day. But are we going to back him at 11-10 for today’s return to action, his first hurdles run for 20 months, taking on high-class staying hurdlers at their own game? I’d say not, bearing in mind that this is primarily a run to set him right for the Kempton race. At his hurdling peak, he’d be easily the best in this field but now he’s a beaten-up chaser, last seen taking second prize in one of the hardest-fought battles I’ve witnessed, behind Many Clouds at Cheltenham. I think I’ll go with one of the specialist hurdlers with no recent injury problems, thank you very much. The problem is, which one? Cases can be made for Wholestone or Colin’s Sister but I’m going with Unowhatimeanharry (3.00). He’s had 10 wins from 11 starts since joining Harry Fry and you don’t often get 15-8 about a horse with that kind of profile. I think they might have got the wrong favourite for the earlier novice chase. This is a bit of a recovery mission for Yanworth, who fell over himself under no pressure at Exeter the other day. He’ll be ridden accordingly and I think that presents a winning chance to Willoughby Court (1.50) at 9-4. He wasn’t entirely convincing on his chasing debut but jumped to his left, which was unhelpful at right-handed Huntingdon but won’t be such a problem here. He made hard work of beating three other finishers but two of them have won since and he should be straighter this time. The nap is Monbeg River (2.00) at Doncaster, where he’s 11-4 for a five-runner handicap chase. He nearly pinched a Wetherby race last time, eventually going under by a neck to a well handicapped rival who has since been second in a more valuable contest at Ascot. From the same mark, Monbeg River could take this from Master Burbidge, penalised for winning a soft race at Plumpton.

She believes the art there is influenced by three forces: nature, power and religion.

Before the conquistadors arrived, the art of the Teotihuacan and Aztecs was closely linked to this dramatic landscape. Ellen E Jones Handmade in Mexico 10pm, BBC Four Debut of a three-part series celebrating distinctly Mexican artworks, and meeting the artisans who still produce them.

Maybe this is a brilliantly orchestrated inside job. Maybe halfway through the World Cup draw in Moscow, as the balls are divvied up and shark-like Fifa men with faces as blank as the polished granite interior of a Panamanian bank vault yawn behind their hands, Gary Lineker will wink at the camera, drop the mask of sickly corporate piety and get on with trashing the place. This is how it might have gone down. Swiping the autocue to one side, Lineker wrenches the World Cup ball machine from its dais, whirling it above his head as the world’s elite football nations are disgorged from its plastic sphincter and sent spinning across the marbled floors. Bulky men with earpieces begin to surge through the crowds. On stage Lineker shouts “death to all dictators” and rips off his shirt to reveal the words End Slavery carved with a scalpel across his chest. As the cameras zoom in for a final close-up Lineker leaps across the benches, seizes a quivering, weeping Gianni Infantino in an unbreakable headlock, pulls out a permanent marker and daubs the words “end the corporate pillage of global sport also don’t bother with VAR it’s far too much trouble” across the Fifa president’s gleaming pate. At which point the first taser bolt sinks into the side of Lineker’s neck. His face sags, his legs crumple, his bowels evacuate spectacularly as the TV feed cuts out. His work is done though. Around the world crowds spill on to the street in exultation. And in that moment the first flames of revolution, of a genuine, lasting rejection of Fifa-led corporate corruption are kindled. It probably won’t work out like that. Indeed if you’re reading this after the World Cup draw there’s a fair chance you’ll have noticed most of the above didn’t happen. A raised eyebrow, some mild self-ironising – “Me? In Russia? Plugging Fifa?” – is probably the extent of what we can expect. Which is a genuine shame because Lineker presiding over the Russia 2018 World Cup draw is one of the more baffling spectacles you’re likely to come across, even in an industry where the phrase “complete moral volte-face” tends to draw blank looks for more reasons than one. This is of course the same Lineker who has been one of Fifa’s most visceral critics. The same Lineker who three years ago said Fifa’s “nauseating” corruption made him “feel sick”. Who advised all “clean” countries to boycott the World Cup. And who has in the last few years made great personal capital out of his emergence as a lucid high-profile voice kicking against the pricks – as one of us, not one of them, unafraid to call out the goons and vested interests. At which point, fire up the band and wheel out the vast groaning buffet table. Gary’s here! This same Lineker will now be standing there at the executive plinth, fondling Fifa’s velveteen ball sack and essentially legitimising the entire enterprise with his presence, transformed now into the friendly public face of World Cup Russia 2018. This comes at a time when Russia is still suspected of a mass state-imposed doping programme, and when Fifa is still in effect on trial in a New York court for mind-boggling and indeed blood-stained acts of corruption and gangsterism. Although in fairness they did give Gary a birthday cake on Thursday. So there is that. It would be easy to be hard on Lineker here, to recall the words of the comedian Bill Hicks on bands who abandon their resistance to the Man and become “just another whore at the capitalist gang bang”. “Everything you say is suspect and every word that comes out of your mouth is now like a turd falling into my drink,” Hicks suggested, which is perhaps a bit strong in this case. Lineker has at least explained his slightly startling change of mind. Firstly, he is confident there is now a new Fifa guard in place. He sees only “good football people” like Marco van Basten, Zvonimir Boban and er, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of good old Bahrain. And secondly he believes fronting up Fifa’s World Cup draw for a global audience having relentlessly criticised its structures and governance “is not political”. All of which is a bit of a shame, because it is basically nonsense. The idea Fifa is cleansed, that all is now well certainly goes against the view of the departing members of Fifa’s own governance committee. The former UN high commissioner for human rights Navi Pillay has described Infantino’s Fifa as “an institution whose officials violate the norms and standards of good conduct” with a “deeply embedded” culture of finagling and grey areas. This was two months ago. But, you know, Van Basten is on the phone so it’s probably all fine. Most unhelpful is the effect Lineker’s approval will have on those still committed to scrutinising football’s governing body and calling it to account, who are instantly made to look troublesome and ridiculous. Clearly Fifa is aware of this too, luxuriating in the cloak of legitimacy provided by parading Lineker as its star guest. Come on guys. Even Gary’s on board now! Most baffling of all is the idea offering approval to a corrupt global organisation you previously eviscerated has nothing to do with politics. Politics isn’t just protest. It exists even more powerfully in acquiescence too. Doing nothing is a political act. Going with the flow, refusing to rock the boat, consorting with Qatar – like Pep, like Zinedine Zidane, like Bayern Munich – is also a powerful political statement: a statement that says, this is fine, I endorse it, I will not dissent. None of us are perfect. There are degrees to which we are able to resist, on a personal level, even something we know to be wrong. But on a scale of one-to-Colin Kaepernick, agreeing to preside over Fifa’s prize draw puts you squarely at one end, decisively and publicly in the camp of the largely unexamined status quo. And so Gary will not be overturning the tables, or cleansing the temple, or shooing the usurers from his father’s house. He will instead be smiling at his plinth, making untranslatable dad jokes and dispensing his legitimising charm in a global TV role last filled by Jérôme Valcke, who is currently banned from football for 10 years over assorted corruption allegations. The journey through the next two tarnished, Sepp Blatter-stinking World Cups begins here. It was always likely to be complex and compromised, with a temptation to blur the lines, to be drawn along by the same old tenacious hidden interests. Small details matter. For a man who chose to project himself so recently as the public hammer of Fifa this feels like a mistake, and in its own way a kind of betrayal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/01/tenancy-overhaul-in-scotland-hailed-new-dawn-private-renters-housing-landlords","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T12:05:58Z","webTitle":"Tenancy overhaul in Scotland hailed as 'new dawn' for private renters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/tenancy-overhaul-in-scotland-hailed-new-dawn-private-renters-housing-landlords","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/tenancy-overhaul-in-scotland-hailed-new-dawn-private-renters-housing-landlords","fields":{"headline":"Tenancy overhaul in Scotland hailed as 'new dawn' for private renters","bodyText":"Housing campaigners have hailed “a new dawn for renters” as sweeping reforms to tenants’ rights have come into force across Scotland. From Friday, anyone beginning a private let will sign a private residential tenancy, which brings with it significantly improved security far outstripping that available to those renting in England. The tenancy gives individuals longer notice periods and indefinite security of tenure, meaning an end to “no-fault” evictions, as well as limiting rent increases to once every 12 months. Landlord and tenant disputes will be heard at a new specialist tribunal and, from January, letting agents will be required to register and adhere to a code of practice. Graeme Brown, the director of Shelter Scotland, welcomed the changes. “Today represents a new dawn for all private renters in Scotland. These new laws bring unprecedented security of tenure to private renters, with landlords now needing a good reason to evict tenants.” He said Shelter Scotland was working with the Scottish government on a campaign to ensure everyone involved in private renting understood their new rights and responsibilities. The private rented sector makes up 15% of homes in Scotland, having increased by a third over the last two decades. The latest English Housing Survey found similarly that the private rented sector had almost doubled since 2002, from 10% to 19%. By contrast, the social rented sector had nearly halved, from 31% of all households in 1980, to 17% in 2014-15. Craig Paterson of Living Rent, Scotland’s tenants’ union, described the changes as “an important first step”, but called on the Scottish government to consider implementing a “winter break” from evictions. In France, trêve hivernale prevents landlords evicting tenants from 1 November to 31 March, reducing homelessness during winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/01/uk-factory-orders-hit-four-year-high","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T11:56:05Z","webTitle":"UK factory orders hit four-year high","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/01/uk-factory-orders-hit-four-year-high","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/01/uk-factory-orders-hit-four-year-high","fields":{"headline":"UK factory orders hit four-year high","bodyText":"Britain’s factories are enjoying the best business conditions for more than four years as strong demand at home and abroad boosts order books, production and jobs. Comfortably beating expectations in the City, the monthly health check of industry from the research firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply was the most upbeat for the sector since the summer of 2013. The purchasing managers index – seen as a guide to the performance of manufacturing in the months ahead – rose from 56.6 in October to 58.2 in November, with all parts of manufacturing in upbeat mood. IHS said it was the 10th best showing in the survey’s 26-year history. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: “UK manufacturing shifted up a gear in November, with growth of output, new orders and employment all gathering pace. On its current course, manufacturing production is rising at a quarterly rate approaching 2%, providing a real boost to the pace of broader economic expansion. Despite concerns that uncertainty about the UK’s departure from the European Union was holding back capital spending, the Markit/CIPS report said UK producers of investment goods had seen the sharpest increase in orders since 1994. Dobson said: “The breadth of the rebound is also positive, with growth strengthening across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods industries. Of real note was a surge in demand for UK investment goods, such as plant and machinery, with new orders for these products rising to the greatest extent in over two decades. This suggests that capital spending, especially in the domestic market, is showing signs of renewed vigour. “ The release of the UK PMI followed an even stronger report from the eurozone, where manufacturing has posted its second best performance since the single currency was founded in the 1990s. The final eurozone PMI stood at 60.1, slightly up on the flash estimate of 60.0. Any reading above 50 indicates that manufacturing is expanding. Ruth Gregory, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said that the strength of the UK PMI pointed to manufacturing output growth of 2% in the final three months of 2017, but warned that the surveys were not always a good guide to the official figures. While accounting for only 10% of UK output, the recent strength of manufacturing has offset the dampening effect of the weaker pound on consumer spending. Currency movements since the Brexit vote in June 2016 have made exports cheaper but imports dearer, rebalancing the economy away from its previous reliance on consumption. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, said: “The survey points to everything coming up roses for manufacturing in the closing months of the year, with robust increases in production levels and solid growth in new orders from both UK customers and overseas. With the European manufacturing PMIs showing levels of expansion at multi-year highs, the benefits for UK exporters are clearly evident, whilst the rebound in manufacturing investment globally is driving activity growth across capital goods manufacturers in the UK.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2017/dec/01/inequality-and-children-at-work-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T12:36:03Z","webTitle":"Inequality and children at work: your best comments on the Guardian today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/dec/01/inequality-and-children-at-work-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/dec/01/inequality-and-children-at-work-your-best-comments-on-the-guardian-today","fields":{"headline":"Inequality and children at work: your best comments on the Guardian today","bodyText":"A youthful theme to some of the topics that have provoked the most interesting conversation today, with stories on education, health and nutrition and children in the workplace all below.

Children as young as two grouped by ability in English nurseries Half of nursery teachers surveyed for this piece said they separated under-fives for reading, raising fears over impact on children’s confidence. You’ve been sharing your reaction in the comments. ‘Setting by ability has nothing but a detrimental effect on the least able children’ Research conducted in British schools since the 1980s has overwhelmingly concluded that setting by ability has nothing but a detrimental effect on the least able children and has no impact on middle ability children. Given that we now know that academic intelligence can grow given a favourable context, if we continue to ability group them we are condemning two thirds of our children to a learning experience which inhibits their progress. Seekingsomesense ‘Children don’t learn or develop when they’re stressed’ Finland has the best education system in the world and they have no ability grouping, or indeed exams, until the age of 18. Children don’t learn or develop when they’re stressed. Stop this insanity. Autonova1 Children in poor areas exposed to five times as many fast food takeaways You’ve also been sharing your thoughts beneath an article that says increasing numbers of fast food takeaways are springing up close to schools in England, with pupils in the most socially deprived areas exposed to five times as many outlets as their richest peers. ‘Even as an adult I struggle to buy something healthy on the high street’ Won’t schools in a densely packed urban environment have more of everything located closer to the school? I would bet they have more convenience stores, coffee shops and charity shops within 400m as well. Deprived or not, give a kid money for lunch and they will likely but junk food. If these places are removed, is the assumption that kids will suddenly purchase healthy food? Where from? Even as an adult I struggle to buy something healthy for lunch on the high street. RDUK123 ‘It seems that priorities are very skewed in some families’ I worked as a teacher in what would be considered a deprived area. A great number of the children who came to school got their main meal in the school. Their parents didn’t cook for them or provide them with a healthy diet. The children would get school dinner and then supplement their diet with whatever fast food they found on the way home. The issue is not that these families are too poor to buy healthy food and thus have to turn to junkfood (although recent studies have found that, in the long run, it’s cheaper to eat healthily) it’s that due to either poor education or laziness, on the parents part, these children are suffering. It seems that priorities are very skewed in some families. limu Why should work be a baby-free zone? This piece argues that with the right provisions the workplace should positively welcome mothers who would like to bring their infants with them. Here’s some of your reaction: ‘Why does anyone think the kid wants to be in an office?’ Why are parents more special than anyone else? Why does anyone think the kid, who has no choice in the matter, wants to be in an office with desks, scratchy carpets and a throughput of strangers walking past. Why should other workers who all have their own issues, elderly parents, sick relatives etc not bring dad with dementia into the office as well? Why are you so special that your kids should be forced into spaces with other people who don’t want to be responsible for them? No thanks. Person77 ‘Babies do not just sleep and breastfeed’ I, like many others, have sensory issues. Babies do not just sleep and breastfeed. They cry, loudly. They shriek. Toddlers are as bad, constantly yelling for attention, which they never seem to get, even when mum isn’t working. These are all creatures that have not learned to moderate their volume in public, and see me avoiding many “public” spaces as a result. I’ve had enough of needing to leave an otherwise decent coffee shop because some caregiver can’t be arsed to manage their brat. This can only be more difficult if said caregiver is working.

The prime minister, Charles Michel, called a meeting with Prince Laurent, younger sibling to King Philippe, in response to his unauthorised appearance in full naval uniform at a Chinese state celebration of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army. Laurent sent a sick note to excuse himself from the meeting about the incident, the latest in a series of unapproved events with foreign dignitaries. But in a seven-page letter handed to the Belgian prime minister by the prince’s lawyer, Laurent, 53, went on the attack, claiming the government’s attempts to limit his meetings with the representatives of foreign states amounted to a breach of article 8 of the European convention on human rights as it would force him into “social isolation”. The leaked letter goes on to suggest that the government’s announcement of action against the prince before he has had a chance to defend himself is illegal. “It goes without saying that the court of human rights would make short work of such violations of the right to a fair trial,” the lawyer writes. Laurent’s lawyer insists that “in humiliating ways” the prince has been stopped all his life from getting a job, in a manner damaging to his “image and, dare I add, his health”. “In this traditional view, a prince was not allowed to work (it would testify to ‘a desire for money’, a reproach that some people dare to repeat today, which is the world upside down!),” the lawyer writes. The letter adds that the questioning of the prince’s endowment in the media has caused “great uncertainty for the prince and his family, contrary to fundamental rights”, and the state should now offer some “social security or pension rights”. Laurent’s camp said that rather than cut his endowment by up to 15% as suggested – which would in effect “deprive him and his family of all livelihoods” – the royal could in future commit to giving the government 10 days’ notice of any intended meetings with foreign officials. Laurent’s previous diplomatic freelancing has involved jetting off to see President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who, after 16 years in power, refuses to stand down on the grounds that the country cannot afford elections. He also enjoyed frequent visits to Libya between 2008 and 2010, where he had been hoping to go into business with one of Muammar Gaddafi’s sons. Laurent was given a final warning last December after he went on an unauthorised visit to see the prime minister of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe. The prince’s letter has caused uproar in Belgium, where Laurent had until now been warmly regarded as an eccentric but harmless figure. His appearance at the Chinese embassy in Brussels to celebrate the founding of the People’s Liberation Army earlier this year might have gone unnoticed had he not tweeted a picture of himself at the ceremony. Theo Francken, a senior government minister from the Flemish nationalist party, suggested the prince needed to live up to his responsibilities. “If you break the vase, you pay for it,” he said. The country’s interior minister, Jan Jambon, said: “Perhaps the law should be clarified to him [the prince]. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but everyone is also bound by the legislation.” Barend Leyts, a spokesman for the Belgian prime minister, declined to be drawn on the prince’s allegations. “As the prime minister has announced in parliament, the case is being examined legally,” he said. Last year, after a critical report from the Belgian court of audit, the financial watchdog for the country’s public institutions, Laurent was forced to repay €16,000 to the Belgian state for claiming expenses for a ski holiday, supermarket bills and the school fees of his three children. The youngest son of the former king and queen Albert II and Paola has previously taken to Belgian television to attack his family, with whom he is barely on speaking terms, claiming they are like the Stasi secret police and have sought to sabotage his career. “My family has never supported me,” he complained. In 2011, Laurent, who trained in the army and navy before becoming a helicopter pilot, lost his driver’s licence after being caught speeding at 20mph above the limit through Brussels in his Fiat Abarth Punto. The prince, whose wife is British, declared there should be “a special licence for those driving a fast car”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/01/jeremy-corbyn-fronts-cover-of-gq-but-rejects-campbell-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T08:30:13Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn fronts cover of GQ – but rejects Campbell interview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/01/jeremy-corbyn-fronts-cover-of-gq-but-rejects-campbell-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/01/jeremy-corbyn-fronts-cover-of-gq-but-rejects-campbell-interview","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn fronts cover of GQ – but rejects Campbell interview","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has been revealed as the latest cover star of GQ, but refused to be interviewed by Alastair Campbell for the men’s magazine. The editor, Dylan Jones, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he had to use an alternative interviewer, the senior commissioning editor Stuart McGurk, after the Labour leader turned down a meeting with Campbell, who was Tony Blair’s head of communications. Jones – who has previously written about his support for the Conservative party and penned a book with David Cameron – said Corbyn and his “gatekeepers” did not understand the process of conducting a magazine interview and photo shoot. “When he turned up for his shoot it was almost like he was being pushed around like the grandpa for the family Christmas photograph,” Jones said on Friday. “He wasn’t particularly aware of what was going on.” In the interview, Corbyn talks about the EU referendum, Donald Trump and Blair. The apparently airbrushed cover portrait has received mixed reactions, with supporters praising Corbyn’s polished look and some Tory MPs mocking him. Jones said McGurk approached the interview as a fan of Corbyn but was “quite quickly disillusioned”. He found Corbyn to be a “bit of a Wizard of Oz” character. The leader was not able to name any of his business advisers, the editor said, and could not identify a book or film he had read in the last year. “He’s not fantastic on detail,” he said. “He’s the most divisive character in Westminster at the moment. He does have an air of authenticity about him and his myopic view is quite appealing.” • The Corbyn cover issue of GQ will be on sale from Monday"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/dec/03/ashes-2017-18-australia-england-second-test-day-two-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T10:34:24Z","webTitle":"Ashes 2017-18: Australia v England second Test, day two – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/dec/03/ashes-2017-18-australia-england-second-test-day-two-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/dec/03/ashes-2017-18-australia-england-second-test-day-two-live","fields":{"headline":"Ashes 2017-18: Australia v England second Test, day two – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s the full story on day two in Adelaide. England will resume tomorrow afternoon on 29 for one, 413 runs behind Australia. They need to bat all day to stay in the match and the series. Whatever happens, it won’t be dull. Thanks for your company today, bye! The outfield is still pretty wet and the umpires have called time. That’s a bit of a bonus for England, who were being used as a punchbag by the Australian fast bowlers. While you wait for some more Ashes joy/misery (delete as appropriate), why not read about Ben Stokes’ return to action? It’s still raining, albeit lightly, and the covers are still on. This is an unexpected bonus for England. Could this stay of execution be the turning point of the entire series? (Clue: no.) The rain has started to ease off. They should be back on in 10-15 minutes. “Not sure about the assertion that the Adelaide Oval redevelopment was not universally popular with members,” says Liam. “There was nearly an 80% yes vote to the development. That’s a good result for any binary question, as Britain would know...” I’ll touché to that. Here’s Bill Hargreaves. “Sean Boiling asks an interesting question, I think: ‘Does the difference between 135 kmh and 145 kmh make a difference?’ Those old plough hands got it just about right with the length of the wicket at a chain (22 yards, the distance from an ox’s nose to the end of the plough handles that it pulls). By my maths, this gives a batsman between 0.312 seconds and 0.277 seconds to react, by the time 200ms have been removed for reaction time (thank you Jimmy Wales). It doesn’t sound a lot, but in his prime this was enough for IT Botham to finish a cheese sandwich, have a draught of nutty ale and get into position for a hook shot. By such small margins, etc...” The older I get, and the more the world changes, the more I realise that Beefy was the most ridiculous, magnificent beast. He could have the kind of drinking session that would leave most of us bedridden for a month and still take a wicket in the first over of the day. It would have been so good to see him in his prime. Still, I’ll always have his Trevor Hohns moment. “Morning Rob, greetings from a quiet beach in Thailand and following the game via the Guardian,” says Dave Laybourne. “Having a cold beer with an Aussie who reckons Cook will be batting again by the second session tomorrow. What’s the score to avoid the follow on?” It’s 243. They should avoid the follow on, all things being equal, but they’ll do very well to avoid defeat. Unless it rains for three days, which would be a terrific shame. 9.1 overs: England 29-1 (Cook 11, Vince 0) Pat Cummins replaces Hazlewood and has a huge shout for caught behind against Cook with his first ball. It was a stunning delivery that jagged off the seam, squared Cook up and clipped the thigh on its way through to Tim Paine. That’s brilliant umpiring from Aleem Dar because it was a seductive appeal. Australia decided not to review, and seconds later the players were charging off the field because of a sudden downpour. 9th over: England 29-1 (Cook 11, Vince 0) When James Vince signed up for a second crack at Test cricket, this wasn’t in the brochure. His first ball is a sizzling yorker from Starc that he does well to defend, and his third snakes past the outside edge. This is a serious test of the England batsmen, so much so that I think it’s time to sagely observe that this is why it’s called Test cricket! 8th over: England 29-1 (Cook 11, Vince 0) Cook is fighting his technique and trying to get his feet moving. So far he looks reasonably good. England really need him to be at the crease when play resumes tomorrow afternoon. Ideally in the first innings. “Morning Rob,” says Kimberley Thonger. “My subconscious has been working overtime during a particularly detailed dream. It’s predicting an easy England victory by tea on the fifth day. Double hundreds for Vince and Malian in a 750 run first innings total, complied at a steady 4.5 an over, and then Root declaring with an hour to play on day 4. Six wickets for Anderson and Broad in that hour with the pink ball under lights, and then Overton bounces the tail out on the morning of day five. Oz all out for 94. On waking up, my conscious mind is more concerned about the chances of Smith enforcing the follow on when we’re all out for 193. I believe this is called cognitive dissonance?” 7th over: England 29-1 (Cook 11, Vince 0) “Adelaide Oval is a lovely ground - a tough two days so far - but the redevelopment was not universally popular with those SACA members who did not like AFL, according to my friend and host for this trip,” says Nick Donovan. “The scoreboard, the trees behind the Cathedral End, and the view of the Cathedral are all protected as part of it.” Stoneman has gone, flicking around a very full delivery from Starc that hit him on the pad in front of middle and leg. Stoneman decided to review it in the hope it was going down leg. It wasn’t. Wasn’t even Umpire’s Call, so England have lost review. He was so deep in his crease that the ball didn’t have far to travel, and replays showed it would have slammed into leg stump. 6th over: England 28-0 (Cook 10, Stoneman 18) Cook gets his first boundary, clipping Hazlewood through square leg. There’s an excellent graphic on BT Sport, contrasting the pitch maps of England and Australia in the first five overs. Australia have bowled much fuller. When Hazlewooddrags his length back, Stoneman flashes just over gully for four. He has raced to 18 from 20 balls, though not without alarm. 5th over: England 17-0 (Cook 5, Stoneman 12) Cook is beaten, chasing a wide one from Starc. This is the torrid session we expected. He plays a nice shot later in the over, flicking crisply through midwicket for three. As Michael Vaughan says on BT Sport, Cook is the key here. If he bats long, England will draw strength from him and might save this game. If he doesn’t, this match will take a deal of drawing. “There’s been some criticism of BT Sport’s coverage of this Ashes series,” says Niall Mullen. “I, for one. am extremely grateful that they are showing it. I haven’t seen a single ball...” I’m already regretting the decision to make myself available for the fourth and fifth Tests. I’ve already OBOed two whitewashes! It would be a terrific shame if there was a mysterious BT outage in my area from December 26 to January 8. 4th over: England 12-0 (Cook 2, Stoneman 10) Stoneman survives a huge LBW appeal after flicking across the line at Hazlewood. It pitched miles outside leg, but these are nervous moments for Stoneman. He digs out a yorker and breaks his bat in the process. “Get ready for a broken fucken bat” and all that. Australia are bowling a lot of full deliveries, something England failed to do yesterday morning. They really made a balls of that session. Stoneman survives an even bigger LBW appeal off the last ball of the over; again it pitched well outside leg. “G’day Rob,” says Sean Boiling. “Genuine question, do England need faster bowlers? Does the difference between 135 kmh and 145 kmh make a difference?” A huge difference, especially when there’s not much sideways movement. 3rd over: England 12-0 (Cook 2, Stoneman 10) It’s getting hot out there. Stoneman, squared up by Starc, gets a leading edge that flashes just past the diving Khawaja at gully and runs away for four. Two balls later he tries to drive and is beaten. Starc is all over him like a cheap cliche. “Morning, Rob,” says James Higgott. “Rather than Sunday morning telly, I may settle down with the copy of Willie Rushton’s W.G. Grace’s Last Case that I found in a local charity shop yesterday. According to the setup, the blurb involves the mysterious death of a bowler at Lord’s from an arrow in his back. Shades of the crossbow bolt incident at the Oval earlier this year? The bowler’s name is “Castor Vilebastard (pronounced ‘Villibart’)“ so I know exactly the level of humour I am in for.” 2nd over: England 7-0 (Cook 2, Stoneman 5) Josh Hazlewood, the interrogator to Starc’s hardass, starts at the other end. Cook works a single off the pads and Stoneman half plays at a ball that zips past the outside edge. This is an excellent start from Australia, full of intensity and purpose. It’s also been a good start from Stoneman, who looks busy and intent of scoring rather than surviving. When Hazlewood overpitches a touch he drives crisply through mid-off for three. An eventful over ends with Cook playing and missing at a jaffa that snaps past the outside edge. “This is depressing,” says Mike Grant. “Going back to bed to read. Currently enjoying Scoundrels - not explicitly about cricket but there’s a very funny bit on Douglas Jardine shattering someone’s knee cap during a school visit in 1934. Could have done with him on this tour.” 1st over: England 2-0 (Cook 1, Stoneman 1) Mitchell Starc breaks 90mph with his first delivery, which zips through outside Alastair Cook’s off stump. Cook and Mark Stoneman trade singles but it’s an encouraging first over for Starc, with good pace - the last ball was 94mph - and a soupçon of swing. “Well, what with it being handed out to us, and only likely to get worse, I’m not sure we’re on the front foot to take on the Aussie rules fans as well,” says Jon Millard. “I’m going for a long run in the pouring rain as punishment, listening to a relentlessly grim, harrowing historical tale on my phone. And when TMS finishes, I’ll switch back to the biography of Guy Burgess which is also on there.” Don’t forget, England fans: the entire Dawson’s Creek boxset has just reappeared on All 4! You may have heard that Ben Stokes played some cricket today. Sure, he only scored two runs and took no wickets. But he played some cricket today. Shaun Marsh shoves England deeper into the dirt, smacking Stuart Broad for 14 in three deliveries. He mowed four to midwicket, Natmegged another to long leg and then launched a sweet straight hit that went all the way. Broad nodded his head respectfully at that last shot. The end of the over is the end of the innings, with Steve Smith deciding to declare. Shaun Marsh ends on 126 not out, a high-class innings that should secure his place for a while, and England’s batsmen have 32 torrid overs to endure before the close. 148th over: Australia 427-8 (Marsh 111, Lyon 10) Lyon gets off the mark with a six, hoicking Overton to long leg, and prompts one of the biggest cheers of the match. Later in the over he top-edges a big yahoo straight over the head of Bairstow. This is a thoroughly miserable experience for England. 147th over: Australia 416-8 (Marsh 110, Lyon 0) Stuart Broad returns to the attack and goes straight round the wicket, with a field that suggests Nathan Lyon won’t be getting many drive balls. Lyon drags the first ball onto his shoulder and misses a roundhouse swing at each of the next four deliveries. The last ball is full and driven to deep cover, with Marsh turning down a single. 146th over: Australia 416-8 (Marsh 110, Lyon 0) Overton could sneak a debut five-for here. He has three wickets and Australia will play their strokes with a declaration in mind. Marsh slashes him over the slips for four more. Bloody hell, England have bounced out a tailender. It was the second ball after dinner, a good one from Overton that followed Cummins off the pitch. He was cramped for room and swatted the ball to straight to third man, where Malan took an easy catch. In other news... “Something to keep an eye on is the India/Sri Lanka Test,” says Manoj Joseph. “The air quality is so poor that the Lankan bowlers are falling ill, unable to bowl. I don’t understand why the powers-that-be don’t call for a halt in play. Nothing is worth the lasting damage to the health of the players and even the spectators that is being caused by breathing the noxious smog that passes for air at the Kotla.” Crikey. Somewhere in the world, Ted Dexter smiles knowingly. Dinnertime chit-chat “Question for you as Shaun Marsh brings up a wonderful ton,” says Alistair Gillett. “What can England do to revitalise their bowling, this game and the series? I don’t see 20 wickets falling to their bowling as we sit here watching right now.” All they can do is draw this game and see where it takes them. I’d expect Mark Wood to play at Perth – he is genuinely quick, if sadly injury prone. A pace attack of Broad, Anderson, Stokes and Wood would have been pretty good in these conditions. The other thing they really need on their side is scoreboard pressure. “Only a successful Watto LBW review could make this worse for England,” says Patrick O’Brien. 145th over: Australia 409-7 (Marsh 103, Cummins 44) “What can England do?” says Geoff Boycott, before answering his own question: “I don’t know.” What England have done is drop Shaun Marsh. Woakes got one to kick from a length and take the splice before looping between Cook at slip and Vince at gully. They both dived to take the catch and the ball ended up on the floor. Cook had it in his grasp before Vince knocked it out. Ricky Ponting, who was there in Kandy in 1999, points out that the collision could have been a lot worse. That was the last over of the session. It’s time for dinner, with England’s top order on the menu as a digestif. See you in half an hour for what should be a pulsating session. 144th over: Australia 405-7 (Marsh 102, Cummins 41) Overton replaces Moeen. There’s nothing left for England bar random bowling changes, impotent rage and the desperate hope that Alastair Cook will bat for three days. Overton almost strikes, with Marsh inside-edging a drive just wide of leg stump. England haven’t had much luck in this innings. Meanwhile, heeeeeeeeeeeere’s Gary! (Gary Naylor, that is.) “In response to Sarah’s point (137th over) my comment re “for shame” is not the parochial point of a Little Englander, but a lament that some of the great cricketers who have played at one of the world’s cricket venues have been crowded out when stands were named a similar way that a grand cricket old cricket ground has been buried under a gigantic multi-use stadium. I know things change, but am I right in thinking it looks more like a footy putsch than a marriage of equals?” 143rd over: Australia 402-7 (Marsh 100, Cummins 41) Shaun Marsh pulls Woakes smoothly for four to reach an outstanding century. He has played immaculately, with so much maturity and class. It took 213 balls and included 12 fours. Even Geoff Boycott, who doesn’t always suffer Australian centuries gladly, describes it as “fantastic” on BT Sport. “Right then Rob,” says Rob Lewis. “Change glasses and mark some student essays. Should be more fun than following the foot on throat drama.” And don’t forget, if you’re in England, Tim Lovejoy’s Sunday Brunch is on Channel 4 at 9am! How did we survive before Twitter, part 413904254 142nd over: Australia 396-7 (Marsh 95, Cummins 40) Cummins whips the struggling Moeen through square leg for four, and then Marsh flat bats another boundary through extra cover. Batting looks throughly easy at the moment, and Cummins completes the over with another boundary. Fourteen runs from the over! You know what they say: never judge a pink ball until both sides have batted against it. By the close we’ll know whether England have a chance of drawing this match, or whether they are facing yet another pounding in Australia. 141st over: Australia 382-7 (Marsh 90, Cummins 30) Chris Woakes averages 24 with the ball at home and 70 away. That would be considered a problem in some cultures. I’m not suggesting he should be dropped, not with Stokes and Wood unavailable, but it’d be swell if he could bring that average down a touch. “Australian Football is the reason that Australia’s cricket grounds have such large capacities - Australia is unique in that the highest-drawing sporting code here is played on large elliptical playing arenas (because they began by playing on cricket ovals,” says somebody called Rocket Rocket. “Contrast this with England, NZ, South Africa where the “quaint” stands at the small cricket venues are dwarfed by the large capacity soccer and rugby stadia. So I think the famous South Australian footballers deserve their names on those grandstands - grandstands which almost certainly would not be there if not for Australian Football.” 140th over: Australia 380-7 (Marsh 89, Cummins 30) Moeen replaces Root, in accordance with the Titanic Deckchair Principle. Two from the over. There are around 25 minutes to dinner, after which you’d expect Australia to unleash the beasts. 139th over: Australia 378-7 (Marsh 88, Cummins 29) I remember a time - a distant, more innocent time - when the words ‘Shaun Marsh’ made England cricket fans laugh uncontrollably. 138th over: Australia 378-7 (Marsh 88, Cummins 29) Cummins, whose fledgling series average is in the 70s, chips Root lazily down the ground for four. That’s a lovely shot. The last ball is put downb by the stretching Stoneman at short leg; Root seems to think it was a bat-pad chance, though replays are unclear. 137th over: Australia 372-7 (Marsh 88, Cummins 23) Marsh steers Woakes for four more. This is sadistic stuff from Australia, who are allowing England’s misery to marinate for as long as possible. They have been superb. “Why ‘for shame’, Gary (127th over)?” says Sarah Bacon. “Because you don’t know the names on the stands, or that AFL players are lauded at all? Australian Football, after all, was originally conceived as a winter game, in order to keep CRICKETERS fit during the off-season. The fact that it went on to become such a revered sport in and of itself, is due to the respect and love it attracts, but we should never forget that cricket should be thanked for its origin!” 136th over: Australia 368-7 (Marsh 84, Cummins 23) Cummins heaves Root round the corner for another boundary. This is the turning into a miserable day for England. All they can is to try to Brisbane 2010 their way to a draw, but that looks pretty unlikely at this stage. We’re all doomed! “You can’t beat the magic of the Ashes, can you, Rob?” says Guy Hornsby. “It’s clear batting is easy on this Adelaide track, so whatever the folly of putting Australia in, Cook and Stoneman should find this a walk in the park. If Shaun Marsh can nudge his way to a ton, we shouldn’t have any problem at all, right. RIGHT?” 135th over: Australia 361-7 (Marsh 83, Cummins 17) A short ball from Woakes is slammed through the covers for four by Cummins, which brings up a fine fifty partnership. Woakes is becoming a problem for England in this series. He’s nothing like the bowler who had such a great 2016. 134th over: Australia 357-7 (Marsh 83, Cummins 13) Root replaces Moeen and hurries through an over that costs two. Australia’s scoring rate in this series is 2.73, their lowest in a home series since 1997-98. No that was a compliment. I think the patience and maturity of their batting has surprised England. It’s been a clever, two-paced approach: slow and calm with the bat, fast and furious with the ball. 133rd over: Australia 355-7 (Marsh 82, Cummins 12) Woakes returns to the attack. Nothing happens. With each passing day, England have to further compromise their plan to retain the Ashes. Two days ago, they had to win at Adelaide. Now they would happily take a draw and put their faith in the law of averages for the next Test at Perth. It’s not a good position to be in, especially not this early in the series. 132nd over: Australia 354-7 (Marsh 81, Cummins 12) Moeen continues, nursing a series average of 80-odd. Australia are toying with England, who know their batsmen are going to face a torrid last session. Thanks Jonathan, morning everyone. If you’re an England fan, I have a message for you: The Secret History of the British Garden is on BBC2 at 7.35am. Trust me, it’ll be kinder to your serotonin levels. 131st over: Australia 350-7 (Marsh 78, Cummins 11) Marsh is the transcendent figure out there now, seeing the pink ball like a watermelon, dismissing Overton for four through midwicket and then finding more runs with a thick edge towards third man. He has occupied the crease, ridden his luck, and now he’s cashing in. Cummins joins in the fun, chipping a checked drive just beyond the outstretched arm of the bowler to bring up the 350. That’s enough from me for today. Rob Smyth is your man until the close. 130th over: Australia 340-7 (Marsh 71, Cummins 8) Cummins doubles his score with a handy swipe down the ground for four. Moeen causing no problems whatsoever for this pair at the moment. Closing in on the drinks break of this middle session of the day. After that break you shall be in the safe hands of Rob Smyth to see you through to the end of play. 129th over: Australia 335-7 (Marsh 70, Cummins 4) England’s frustration grows as this partnership slowly builds. Marsh milking singles at will, Cummins blunting England’s attack, Overton the latest to send down an over that will not last long in anybody’s memory. Brian asks a question I’m sure someone out there can Google the answer to pretty quickly. “Pat Cummins’ innings makes me think: what is the highest number of dot balls faced by a batsman before getting out for 0? (although as I type this he has scored his first runs).” 128th over: Australia 334-7 (Marsh 69, Cummins 4) Moeen turns up for his first bowl since Tea and his presence is greeted warmly by Marsh who whips him to midwicket for an effortless four. 127th over: Australia 329-7 (Marsh 64, Cummins 4) Overton gives Broad a spell and he suffers the indignity of watching Cummins score his first runs after 40 barren minutes at he crease. It’s a neat boundary from the number nine too, leaning back and guiding a late cut through the vacant gully region. The latter Gary. As this link explains. http://www.adelaideoval.com.au/newsdetail/16/27/sa-greats-honoured.aspx 126th over: Australia 324-7 (Marsh 63, Cummins 0) Deary me, what has James Anderson done to upset the Gods? (Don’t answer that). A routine outside edge from Cummins fails to reach Bairstow behind the stumps and the umpteenth opportunity of a horribly frustrating day goes begging. Cummins continues to rack up the dots, reaching 34 without troubling the scoreboard. This meandering session probably suits both sides in a roundabout way. England will want to delay batting under lights but suffer minimal scoreboard damage along the way. Australia will be happy to drag the game closer to dusk and set up the possibility of a declaration. 125th over: Australia 323-7 (Marsh 62, Cummins 0) Cummins showing plenty of patience out there, continuing to allow anything wide from Broad to sail through to Bairstow, and presenting a perpendicular defensive bat to anything straight. 28 balls faced without scoring now for the big quick. 124th over: Australia 322-7 (Marsh 62, Cummins 0) Anderson is confident with an LBW shout against Marsh. It’s given not-out on-field with question marks over where it pitched. Root REVIEWS but DRS doesn’t last long as it reveals the ball pitched outside leg stump. It’s a testing over from Anderson who hits Cummins in his box on a couple of occasions. 123rd over: Australia 321-7 (Marsh 62, Cummins 0) Another maiden from Broad to Cummins spent largely with the batsmen executing a textbook forward defensive. There was a sniff of a caught and bowled chance among the dots, suggesting the off-pace delivery is gripping in the pitch. 122nd over: Australia 321-7 (Marsh 62, Cummins 0) Marsh is looking to get onto the front foot and attack Anderson, and after five false starts he finally gets a half volley to square drive through point for four. 121st over: Australia 317-7 (Marsh 58, Cummins 0) Broad is fuller to Cummins this over who looks tidy getting in line and presenting a proud bat-face to block out a maiden. Jay Collins takes umbrage with some adjectives. “How has the cricket been ‘turgid going’ (5.44)? Torpid, perhaps, or possibly turbid, but hardly turgid.” 120th over: Australia 317-7 (Marsh 58, Cummins 0) Australia yet to get going since Tea but that’ll help, Marsh unfurling a magnificent cover drive to a good length Anderson delivery on the up that skips away to the boundary. The rest of the over contains little of note. 119th over: Australia 313-7 (Marsh 54, Cummins 0) Broad going short to Cummins three times in a row. I’m not sure whether this is in order to get him out, or therapy following Brisbane. Either way most deliveries are left alone in a largely theatrical over. 118th over: Australia 312-7 (Marsh 53, Cummins 0) Anderson bowling in tandem with Broad to start the session and after Marsh accepts a single into the offside he has first go at Cummins. The number nine (he should be number eight really) looks as composed here as he did in Brisbane though and navigates the over successfully. 117th over: Australia 311-7 (Marsh 52, Cummins 0) Broad with the first over after Tea and as well as the wicket it contains Marsh’s ninth Test 50 and second in successive innings, one that’s taken 138 balls to accumulate. It’s been an excellent knock through two testing spells last night and this morning. He has an excellent chance to add to his four hundreds and cement his place once again in Australia’s top order. For the second time today Broad strikes in the first over of a session. This time he beats Starc for pace as the big left-hander tries to pull, succeeding only in scooping a catch to Anderson at mid-on. I think Australia won’t be unhappy either way. This next session will be one of cat and mouse, with neither side really wanting to bat under lights. England will probably look to slow up the scoring so they face as little as possible of Starc &amp; co this evening. Don’t rule out a funky-looking declaration either if Smith really fancies playing the alpha. England struck in the opening over of the day but thereafter it became Australia’s session. Shaun Marsh played the anchor role, Tim Paine the aggressor, and between them they rode their luck with two LBW decisions overturned on review, edges not reaching fielders, and no shortage of plays and misses. Most of these nervy moments arrived early in the afternoon when England looked threatening with the new ball. After the first hour had been seen off and Broad and Anderson were replaced by the supporting cast things became considerably easier for the hosts. The total is already a handy one, setting up a late acceleration ahead of England facing trial by floodlight later in the day. 116th over: Australia 306-6 (Marsh 49, Starc 4) Root brings himself on for the free over before Tea and he almost accounts for Marsh first ball. There’s turn from around the wicket and England think there may be an edge but if there was it’s shelled by Bairstow. Replays indicate there probably wasn’t any contact so the inquest’s over. Starc blocks out the rest of the over to send Australia into a very healthy position at the first interval of this day’s play. 115th over: Australia 305-6 (Marsh 48, Starc 4) There’s increasing turn and bounce for Moeen, which isn’t what England really want to see considering Nathan Lyon’s form. He beats Marsh on the outside before almost getting one beyond the inside-edge of Starc. One more over before Tea. 114th over: Australia 300-6 (Marsh 45, Starc 2) Overton toiling with little penetration against this pair of left-handers. Three singles, two of which are squirted off inside edges near the toe of the bat, contribute to the 300 coming up for Australia. 113th over: Australia 297-6 (Marsh 43, Starc 1) Starc continues to be watchful in the shadows of Tea, treading carefully as Moeen probes from around the wicket. 112th over: Australia 296-6 (Marsh 42, Starc 1) Overton continues his productive spell, ploughing a furrow outside Marsh’s off-stump on a decent length. Out of nowhere he finds one to climb on the batsman that’s unlucky not to find a glove. Speaking of luck, Starc is two metres short of his ground for a run-out opportunity but Stoneman can’t hit the pegs running in from cover. 111st over: Australia 295-6 (Marsh 41, Starc 1) Starc was unexpectedly patient against Overton, how will be be against Moeen? Remarkably composed, as it happens, bunting away a sedate over until he’s beaten by a ripper that turns and bounces past the shoulder of his defensive prod. 110th over: Australia 295-6 (Marsh 41, Starc 1) Overton has Starc on strike to begin the second over of his spell but he can’t get anything beyond the left-hander. Starc does look a threat of being caught in front of the wicket though, with his hard hands pushing at the ball, which accounts for the placement of a short mid-off in his eyeline. Overton should have a maiden on his figures but a misfield from the last ball of the over gets Starc off a duck. 109th over: Australia 294-6 (Marsh 41, Starc 0) Moeen with a rapid maiden to Marsh from around the wicket. 20 minutes until Tea. Can England snag a couple more? 108th over: Australia 294-6 (Marsh 41, Starc 0) England bowled well enough earlier today to earn a clump of wickets, then when they’re going through the motions and Australia are scoring for fun they burgle one. Funny old game. Overton recalled into the attack to play the enforcer, banging the ball in short and asking different questions of Australia’s batsmen. The first question is answered emphatically by Paine who carves him over point for four. But four balls later the plan works! A pretty ordinary looking long-hop has Paine pulling, and pulling hard, but straight to Moeen just inside the midwicket boundary. A gift from England, but that shouldn’t detract from a terrific innings from Paine. 107th over: Australia 290-5 (Marsh 41, Paine 53) Moeen continues his line to Paine from around the wicket and it continues to not look like bearing fruit. Australia taking the game away from England every over. Their logic might have been flawed but their decisions have been justified so far. 105th over: Australia 286-5 (Marsh 40, Paine 50) Tim Paine brings up an excellent counterattacking 50 with a straight drive for two - his first half-century in Tests since October 2010! It’s another so-so over from the ineffective Woakes. 104th over: Australia 281-5 (Marsh 39, Paine 48) Moeen now around the wicket to the right-handed Paine, a symptom of how this innings is drifting away from England’s grasp. Never mind drifting, it’s racing away from them with Paine hoicking a six with a lazy swish over midwicket to conclude the over. 104th over: Australia 275-5 (Marsh 39, Paine 42) Better from Woakes who’s decided to pitch the ball up but it doesn’t take long for Marsh to adjust, waiting on the crease and then leaning into one that beats Broad’s dive at mid-off. That’s Marsh’s first boundary in over an hour but he’s still doing a terrific job for his side - and he’s doing so without a chunk of his bat with a fat splinter coming away from the toe during a mistimed drive. 103rd over: Australia 271-5 (Marsh 35, Paine 42) Not a lot happening in that Moeen over. England need to shake things up somehow because Australia are now cruising. 102nd over: Australia 270-5 (Marsh 34, Paine 42) Woakes continues to be too short, allowing both batsmen the opportunity to leave more than they play until Marsh drills a nice three down the ground. At the start of this over this partnership was up to 58, but Marsh had only made 11 of them, having scored just two singles in the last hour. 101st over: Australia 265-5 (Marsh 31, Paine 41) Paine might be troubled by his finger but he’s not troubled by Moeen who he slaps dismissively over cover for four. Australia have seen off England’s early assault and are bedding in for a healthy score. 100th over: Australia 260-5 (Marsh 31, Paine 36) Woakes resumes his spell but he remains comparatively innocuous, failing to hit the required full length or generating any lateral movement. It’s an issue bemusing Ian Reynolds. “We’ve all been watching England bowl 20% too short 20% of the time for 20 years. What are they watching on those laptops - or is it NSFW? Chunter, chunter, rhubarb, rhubarb, etc.” 99th over: Australia 259-5 (Marsh 31, Paine 35) We’ve just had a drinks break and Australia will be happy losing only one wicket during the opening hour after a testing spell of English bowling. Moeen Ali has been brought on and he is so unlucky not to get Marsh. He slides one into the left-hander’s front pad from around the wicket two balls before ripping one on the same line and length that catches the outside edge but only reaches Root at slip on the bounce. What do England have to do!? Paine received plenty of treatment on his finger during that interval. Let’s hope a man beset by injuries avoids another serious one. 98th over: Australia 257-5 (Marsh 30, Paine 34) Woakes into the attack for his first spell of the day and he immediately find’s Paine’s outside edge but it doesn’t carry to second slip. Thereafter he’s much too short, failing to take advantage of the conditions. As this ball reaches its 18th over, England may be watching their opportunity of bowling their way into contention in this match slipping away. 97th over: Australia 257-5 (Marsh 30, Paine 34) I’ve only just noticed the speed gun for Overton who’s registering in the mid-to-high 120kph range. It’s noticeable to Paine who seems almost to be waiting for the ball to reach him after getting in line. Despite this he’s struck again on his right index finger, and this time he doesn’t look happy at all. This could be a big story brewing for Australia. Paine manages to get off strike and Marsh, who’s barely scored a run all afternoon, plays and misses twice outside off. 96th over: Australia 256-5 (Marsh 30, Paine 33) Anderson just wavering slightly from the immaculate line and length of recent overs, allowing Marsh to see off any danger without much concern. TV replays show that during the previous Overton over Paine was struck on his right index finger, the one he broke in 2010 derailing his promising career. He seems fine for now though. 95th over: Australia 255-5 (Marsh 30, Paine 32) England have applied a stack of pressure in recent overs, curtailing Australia’s counterattack, but this Overton over will have the batsmen breathing a little easier again. There are four byes gifted early with the ball trampoline bouncing beyond the fingertip parry of Bairstow and away to the boundary. A couple of singles rotate the strike and take the score beyond 250, which already looks a handy total. 94th over: Australia 248-5 (Marsh 30, Paine 29) Can Anderson’s luck turn? Not during this over of probing good length deliveries to Paine. He beats the outside edge twice with classical deliveries that hold their line, while the batsman does enough to repel the ones angled in. As Andrew puts it in his email, “Jimmy’s got the ball talking. Unfortunately it’s saying “I don’t feel like hitting the wicket today.” 93rd over: Australia 247-5 (Marsh 30, Paine 28) Overton’s turn now to appeal for a wicket with Paine again rapped on the inside thigh of his front leg. His appeal is declined though and replays show the ball was bouncing over. Overton persists with a straight line and Paine adjusts, milking runs to the leg-side. 92nd over: Australia 244-5 (Marsh 30, Paine 25) Torture for Anderson! Again he beats an Australian’s defence, again he’s awarded an LBW and again DRS saves the batsman. Paine this time survives a decision that looked plumb on-field but ball-tracking indicated would have bounced over the stumps. England cursing their luck. A further appeal for LBW is rejected because of a healthy inside edge. 91st over: Australia 241-5 (Marsh 29, Paine 23) Overton resumes his line and length, keeping the ball full to both batsmen, but he’s lacking a touch of magic to provoke a false stroke. 90th over: Australia 240-5 (Marsh 29, Paine 22) Anderson wasn’t cooling his heels long, he’s back on swiftly in place of Broad from the Cathedral end. And he takes only three deliveries to strike, trapping Marsh in front LBW. It looks plumb, striking him on the knee-roll bang in front, and the finger’s raised. MARSH REVIEWS and DRS indicates the ball was bouncing over. Oh my days, that is unbelievable. It looked a nailed on dismissal in real time and the review was speculative, maybe hoping to benefit from the ball pitching outside leg stump, but Marsh escapes. 89th over: Australia 240-5 (Marsh 29, Paine 22) Sniff of a caught and bowled first up from Overton but instead it becomes a straight-driven four for Paine. The ball was in the air a few inches from Overton’s dive but it wasn’t really a chance in the end and credit has to go to the batsman for a crisp stroke. Dots thereafter. 88th over: Australia 236-5 (Marsh 29, Paine 18) The least eventful over of Broad’s spell this afternoon. Anything straight Paine played with a straight bat, anything he needn’t play at he avoided. The quick single from the final delivery of the over reflects his proactive approach since arriving at the crease. Nice busy little innings so far from the wicketkeeper. 87th over: Australia 235-5 (Marsh 29, Paine 17) Joe Root has stamped his authority on this England team already and has withdrawn his star paceman from the attack after just two iffy overs. Overton replaces Anderson and he immediately settles into a lovely line and length that’s just waiting for the surface to offer some assistance to generate a chance. Some extra bounce almost does just that but Marsh is able to manipulate the ball off the shoulder of his bat away from danger. Good start from the debutant. 86th over: Australia 233-5 (Marsh 29, Paine 15) This is developing into an entertaining spell of cricket. Broad is on the money but Marsh and Paine are counterattacking, acknowledging the conditions are not in their favour and looking for runs whenever they can. Marsh takes four by leaning on a meaty cover drive before a couple of singles keep the scoreboard ticking over. In between Broad beats Paine’s bat with one that reminds anyone yet to be convinced that a full length is paramount. 85th over: Australia 228-5 (Marsh 24, Paine 15) These are ideal conditions for Broad and Anderson to bowl in, but Anderson can’t string enough decent deliveries together to maintain the pressure. He opens with a beauty that squeaks past the outside edge of Paine’s bat but his follow up is way too short and it’s punished to the midwicket fence. There’s more humdrum before a wide loosener is slapped over point for another four. 84th over: Australia 220-5 (Marsh 24, Paine 7) Broad is fuller, bowling to Marsh from around the wicket. The batsman is watchful to begin with, surviving a half-hearted appeal for caught behind to a jaffa that seamed away from the outside edge like Flintoff to Gilchrist in 2005. He clips the final delivery of the over nicely through midwicket for a boundary. Matt Carley is right. “The nightmare scenario for England is to take a session and a half to bowl out the Aussies so we start batting as dusk falls and the ball starts talking, we could lose five or six in no time at all. In other words they need at least three in the first 45 minutes.” One down... 83rd over: Australia 216-5 (Marsh 20, Paine 7) Anderson squares Paine up with his first delivery of the day, getting plenty of movement off the pitch with the new ball. Paine survives with a couple through the gully region though and backs it up with a comprehensive pull for four as Anderson fails to persist with a fuller length. England have to pitch it up at all costs while there’s pace and movement in the wicket. 82nd over: Australia 210-5 (Marsh 20, Paine 1) Terrific over from Broad, worked Handscomb over before the wicket ball, and then he’s full to both Paine and Marsh, forcing false strokes from both. That dismissal will do nothing to quieten the critics of Handscomb’s idiosyncratic technique, playing as he does so deep in his crease. What a start for England! Plenty of pace and carry for Broad who’s into his work early. He beats Handscomb’s nervy backfoot prod first up, and then raps him on his thigh with one that cuts off the pitch. Third delivery strikes! Handscomb back onto his stumps can’t get his bat down in time to another one that jags in. No review. Broad jubilant, England back into this contest. Here we go then, Stuart Broad from the Cathedral end with the second pink ball just one over old... Ten minutes is the call, which means play will get underway at 1.40pm local time, 2.10pm AET, 3.10am UK. The covers are coming off again. We’ll miss the scheduled start, but not by much. Andrew Benton has checked in. “England will need to take the game to Australia today,” he writes, “they’ll need some early breakthroughs and have the Aussies all out around teatime, otherwise they’ll be on the road to Ashes defeat. Also wondering - why do England keep Cook? Is it out of respect for what he’s done as captain (which would be understandable)? He doesn’t do much that someone else couldn’t, and shouldn’t, have a go at, these days.” It’s easy to reach that conclusion but Cook’s average this calendar year is still 39, last year it was 42, and the year before that 55, so despite him falling below his previous lofty standards he’s not yet a liability. Moreover, he’s seen enough partners come and go to disprove the notion he deserves to lose his place to a rival as none are making a compelling case for selection. In other words, he remains one of England’s best two opening batsmen. Hmmm, the big covers have just been pulled on to augment the hessian already down. I can’t see us starting on time any more. Still, there’s enough blue sky to indicate it won’t be a long delay. I don’t know what to tell you about the weather because the covers keep coming on and off seemingly by the minute as the TV crews dissect yesterday’s play out in the middle. Rain is drifting across the arena with the breeze despite large patches of blue sky. We may not hit the scheduled start time but if we don’t it shouldn’t be by much. The good news is the forecast for the rest of today is much drier than yesterday. In fact there’s little prospect of further rain for the remainder of the Test. It’s still on the chilly side though with a stiff southerly ensuring temperatures are unlikely to push beyond the teens. As Martin Turnbull emails: “Absolutely would not want to be Anderson or Broad when it is their time to bat.” They’re sure not to face the gentle looseners the Aussie pacemen are sending down in the nets at the moment. In case you haven’t been paying attention, the Ben Stokes circus rolled into Canterbury yesterday with the England allrounder failing with the bat... ... and now struggling with the ball. We’re making a big deal of the pink ball during this Test, here’s why. Phil Sawyer has sent in the opening email of the day. “Morning/evening Jonathan. Have been out all night with some friends playing poker (lost) and drinking beer (won - well, I’m claiming a win). Just got back. It seems naive to think if I go to bed now I’ll wake up at a decent enough hour to catch any play, so instead I’m going to stay up and see how far I get into today’s play. I may carry on drinking. In tribute to the England cricket team, it’s not much of a plan, but it’s the only plan I’ve got and I’m sticking to it.” Good luck Phil and drink responsibly. I think you may have more fun watching England bowl with a new ball tonight than see them contend with Australia using one of their own under lights tomorrow morning. The panelists on Channel Nine are of like mind that the game is very much on Australia’s terms. This is due to the combination of Australian runs on the board and the likelihood of England having to spend the early portion of their first innings under floodlights. If you like your information disseminated in pictorial form here’s some of yesterday’s best snaps. From an Australian perspective the story of the opening day was one of false starts with David Warner, Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja all getting in before getting out. Khawaja in particular will rue the missed opportunity to cement his status as his side’s number three, as Adam Collins discusses. One of the most notable elements of the Adelaide Test is the festival feel of the place for the five days. Around the beautiful arena there are myriad hospitality options patronised by thousands of fans who make the pilgrimage as much for the event as the cricket. It’s a summer celebration for South Australia like a day at the races or an enormous fete. And they do it so well, promoting the region superbly as a tourist destination and source of incredible produce. If you ever get the chance to go, take it. It’s a sporting occasion worthy of the hype. The star of day one for England was arguably Craig Overton. The Somerset seamer received his maiden England cap from John Embury before play and went on to snare the hitherto immovable Steve Smith as his first Test wicket. Not a bad day’s work. Hello and thank you for joining us for live OBO coverage of day two of the second Ashes Test from Adelaide Oval. At 209-4 Australia have their noses in front - just - following an engrossing first day’s play featuring a controversial toss call, plenty of niggle, some unwelcome showers, and no shortage of excellent cricket. We’ll cover off the big ticket items as we build towards the resumption of play at 1.30pm local time (2pm AET, 3am UK). This is half an hour earlier than scheduled in a bid to make up the nine overs lost to rain yesterday. As always feel free to direct the conversation using the contact details at the top of the page. Day one was always likely to be a feisty affair after the English and Australian camps spent a week exchanging barbs, and so it proved, with the row between England’s attack and Steve Smith continuing to simmer. Jonathan will be here soon.

It is not to be mistaken for the story of the princess with a dodgy stepmum and an over-developed talent for housework who hangs out in the forest with seven small men. This is the one about two loving sisters who invite a bear into their home, only to discover he’s a prince living under a curse. The story-loving Snow White (Helen Goalen) and Rose Red (Abbi Greenland) keep reminding us that they are women, not girls. They go adventuring, they rescue the prince (Tom Penn), they redeem the wicked Graham (Edward Wren), whose heart has been frozen by tragedy, and they face down a terrifying creature that might simply be fear itself but comes in the guise of a show-stopping puppet. Like Matilda, the pair take control of their own story and write their own happy ending – one that doesn’t conform to the original Brothers Grimm conclusion in which the sisters both marry princes and live happily ever after. Threaded through with some terrific songs, and some sly musical winks to Frozen, the tale is told with a metaphorical shrug of the shoulders. The Snow Angel (Becky Wilkie) does a nice line in irony. There is a lot to like here for all ages, although the tone is sometimes uneven. The opening segment in the sisters’ cottage is a real pleasure, and delivers just the right kind of scary for a family audience with the arrival of the bear who has “a predilection for a flowery note in his tea”. Just when things should become really exciting, as the sisters get out of their cosy cottage and face danger, the storytelling loses its thread. Although it’s always charming, the narrative lacks clarity and momentum, and the wordy encounters between the sisters and Graham become overextended and repetitive. With a little less dash and a little more dramaturgy the show may yet find its own way through the wood. •At Battersea Arts Centre, London, until 30 December.

A friend from their days at Oxford University together, Green had been one of her closest allies in cabinet. The 61-year-old was investigated by the Cabinet Office after he was accused of inappropriate behaviour towards a young Conservative activist, Kate Maltby. Separately, two former senior Scotland Yard officers claimed that pornography was found on his computer when he was in opposition. The discovery was made in 2008 when Green was shadow immigration minister as part of Operation Miser, an investigation into Home Office leaks. Green had strenuously denied both inappropriate behaviour towards Maltby and accessing pornography on his work computer. He now admits that his lawyer discussed the pornography with police in 2008 and 2013, and he has also apologised to Maltby for any distress caused. Kate Maltby The 31-year-old Conservative activist and journalist wrote an article for the Times claiming Green had touched her knee in 2015 and, one year later, sent her a suggestive message. Maltby, a family friend of Green, said that when she met him in a pub in Waterloo, he suggested he could help her start a political career. Green mentioned that his own wife was “very understanding”, Maltby claimed and she then “felt a fleeting hand against my knee – so brief it was almost deniable”. Angered by the incident, Maltby said she had no further contact with Green until he sent her a text message a year later saying he had “admired [her] in a corset” and inviting her for a drink. Sue Gray The head of propriety and ethics at the Cabinet Office led the inquiry into allegations against Green, which was launched on 1 November. Gray has been described as one of the most powerful people in the country. In his memoir, David Laws, a Liberal Democrat member of the coalition cabinet, said: “Unless she agrees, things just don’t happen. Cabinet reshuffles, departmental reorganisations, the whole lot – it’s all down to Sue Gray. Our poor, deluded voters think the prime minister holds the reins of power. Wrong! The truth is our real leader, Sue Gray, sits at a small desk in the Cabinet Office.” Gray’s inquiry was told about pornography being found on Green’s computer, but Whitehall sources denied that Green’s computer records were being examined as part of the process. Sir Paul Stephenson The Metropolitan police commissioner between 2009 and 2011 when the Home Office leak inquiry was conducted. He confirmed he was briefed about the pornography on Green’s computer but regarded it as a “side issue”. He said he regretted that its existence was in the public domain. Speaking to the BBC, Stephenson said it was not Scotland Yard’s role to “police the workplace”. He was interviewed as part of Gray’s inquiry. Bob Quick As former Met assistant commissioner, Quick led Operation Miser, the police inquiry into Home Office leaks. He told the Sunday Times that “extreme” pornographic material was found on one of Green’s Commons computers when the MP was shadow immigration minister. Quick has also given evidence to Gray’s inquiry. Green initially dismissed Quick’s claims and suggested they were biased. The MP said: “I can only assume that they are being made now, nine years later, for ulterior motives.” But he has now admitted that his lawyers discussed the pornography with police in 2008 and 2013. Neil Lewis A former Scotland Yard detective who specialised in examining digital devices for evidence. He told the BBC that thousands of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Green’s computer. “The shocking thing as I was viewing it, I noticed a lot of pornography – thumbnails, which indicated web browsing,” he said. Lewis said he was motivated to come forward when he heard Green denying claims by his superior Quick. “His outright denial of that was quite amazing followed by his criticism of Bob Quick,” Lewis said. Lewis faces an investigation by the Met’s professional standards department into his decision to go public about Green."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/01/zimbabwe-military-officials-given-key-jobs-post-mugabe-cabinet-emmerson-mnangagwa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T16:54:45Z","webTitle":"Zimbabwe opposition promises push for reform after new cabinet revealed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/01/zimbabwe-military-officials-given-key-jobs-post-mugabe-cabinet-emmerson-mnangagwa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/01/zimbabwe-military-officials-given-key-jobs-post-mugabe-cabinet-emmerson-mnangagwa","fields":{"headline":"Zimbabwe opposition promises push for reform after new cabinet revealed","bodyText":"Opposition activists in Zimbabwe have said they will launch a fresh campaign to bring democratic reforms to the impoverished southern African country after the new president announced a fresh cabinet with key roles for veterans of the ruling Zanu-PF party and senior soldiers but no posts for the opposition. Emmerson Mnangagwa took power after a military takeover and popular protests ousted Robert Mugabe last week, and many had hoped the 75-year-old would give leading opposition politicians significant roles in an “inclusive” government in line with his promises to reach out to all “patriotic Zimbabweans” and build a “full democracy”. Opposition figures and activists reacted strongly to the announcement. Tendai Biti, a former finance minister and opposition politician, called the move a betrayal. “We are now dealing with a junta. We have the answer to if the coup was done to give Zimbabwe a chance or to protect the private interests of certain individuals and the ruling party,” Biti said. “Now we the citizens have to regroup and [fight] for a normal elected political authority.” Doug Coltart, a human rights activist, said the new cabinet did not represent a new Zimbabwe but “the entrenchment of the old failed political elite”. “It’s very concerning. It’s a very hardline … government. Very little changes for the struggle that is ongoing to open up political space,” he said. “A lot of people feel a lot more concerned this morning than they ever felt under the Mugabe regime.” Mnangagwa’s appointment of party loyalists and the military – as well as leaders of the powerful war veterans – will concern international observers hoping for widespread reforms after 37 years of Mugabe’s autocratic rule. It will also complicate negotiations for the massive financial aid Zimbabwe needs to repair the damage done to the once-thriving economy over recent decades. The British government, which wants to engage in southern Africa through its former colony, will be particularly disappointed. Hours before the cabinet announcement, the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said the UK could take steps to stabilise Zimbabwe’s currency system and extend a loan to help it clear World Bank and African Development Bank debts, but such support depended on “democratic progress”. Zimbabwe is due to hold elections next year. The new cabinet includes controversial figures such as Obert Mpofu, a wealthy Zanu-PF veteran, and Patrick Chinamasa, a former finance minister who has been reappointed to his former post. Piers Pigou, a Johannesburg-based analyst at International Crisis Group, said: “It does not bode well, certainly. Those who were drinking the kool aid that this was a new broom will have to temper their enthusiasm for the moment. We will have to wait and see what the [new ministers] actually do but it does not bode well.” The new cabinet underlines how the end of Mugabe’s rule was driven by a redistribution of power and patronage within the party and its allies within the military, not by popular calls for reform and economic regeneration. The trigger for the move against Mugabe by the armed forces was the firing of Mnangagwa on 6 November at the behest of the 93-year-old dictator’s wife, Grace, and her supporters within Zanu-PF. The party was split by a bitter battle over the succession to Mugabe. With Mnangagwa forced to flee overseas, Grace Mugabe, 52, appeared to have a firm grasp on power. She is now under house arrest in the sprawling residence she shares with her husband in Borrowdale, an upscale neighbourhood of Harare, but is covered by an immunity deal negotiated with military authorities. Mnangagwa’s allies outside the party have been rewarded for their support. Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo, who read a statement announcing the military takeover on national television on the night the armed forces took power, becomes foreign minister. Perence Shiri, a senior air force officer accused of gross human rights violations in the early 1980s, will be land minister. Chris Mutsvangwa, who leads the war veterans and played a key role in mobilising protests against Mugabe, takes charge of the information ministry. The announcement comes after a series of court judgments sent mixed signals. Former associates of Mugabe have been hit with fraud charges and are in custody, but one well-known democracy activist was acquitted on Thursday of charges of subversion. Evan Mawarire’s #ThisFlag movement last year organised the biggest demonstrations in a decade against Mugabe over a deteriorating economy, cash shortages and accusations of government corruption. He was arrested in September and faced up to 20 years in jail if convicted. But on Thursday a high court judge upheld the confiscation of computers taken by police from a satirical news programme’s Harare headquarters on the day of the military takeover. A legal bid by Magamba TV to challenge the constitutional validity of the search and seizure was rejected. An employee of the network, which produces an immensely popular weekly online political comedy show, has been accused of subversion and will face a court hearing next week. Samm Farai Monro, the network’s creative director and one of Zimbabwe’s best known comedians, said: “That these baseless and trumped-up charges are still sticking is a very worrying sign about how the new government views freedom of expression. “We hope it does not signify the beginning of a clampdown on freedom of expression and social media users ahead of elections next year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
