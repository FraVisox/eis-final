But the human services minister, Michael Keenan, has accused Labor of “scaremongering”, saying the government acted quickly and transparently to refund the money and fix the problem. Guardian Australia this week revealed basic errors in a system that calculates the means-tested care fee for residents of aged care homes. The fee is imposed on those individuals who are deemed able to pay more for the costs of their own care. The fee is supposed to be capped – $63,759 for life and $26,566 per year – but the system failed to automatically detect when those caps were reached. That left it up to aged care residents, some of whom are highly vulnerable, to realise they were being wrongly charged. In one case, a 94-year-old woman was overcharged $33,000 after the government kept imposing the fee 10 months later than it should have. The shadow ageing minister, Julie Collins, became aware of the issue in the middle of last year. Collins wrote to the government in July, warning the system needed urgent review. “One example supplied to me states the resident is owed around $16,000 in July, [2017] even though the department was advised that the lifetime cap would be reached in early 2017,” Collins wrote. “I’m sure you would agree that this is an unacceptable process whereby residents are still being charged even though they are reaching their annual or lifetime caps.” She did not receive a reply for two months, when former human services minister Alan Tudge wrote to her and told her the issue had been resolved and only affected a small number of people. The fee is calculated by the government but imposed on the resident through a convoluted and confusing reconciliation process involving the company that owns the aged care facility. The companies, however, have no legal obligation to monitor residents’ progress towards their annual and lifetime caps. That leaves it up to the government to recognise when an individual has paid the maximum amount. The government alerts the provider, who is then obliged to stop charging their residents the fee. Tudge, in his letter to Collins, acknowledged that the department’s system’s were failing to recognise when people were reaching the cap. “The department has systems in place to identify when annual and lifetime caps are reached,” he wrote. “However, a system constraint has been identified that resulted in a small number of cases reaching the annual or lifetime cap without triggering the required fee reduction. “The department is investigating options to improve the processes monitoring annual and lifetime caps, and will work closely with aged care providers.” Collins has now urged the government to reveal the full extent of the problem. She wants to know how many people have been affected, and how much they were overcharged. Collins also wants to know when the government first realised the system had failed. “This is an unacceptable situation for older Australians who are paying the price for the Turnbull government’s mismanagement,” Collins said. “The Turnbull government must reveal how many older Australians have been impacted by these failings. It is not good enough to say there has only been a ‘small number of cases’.” Keenan criticised Labor for its comments. He said within two months of identifying the issue the government had written to the affected individuals and paid their aged care homes additional subsidies, which were then passed on as refunds to the residents. He said the system issue had been fixed. “Labor needs to get its facts straight and stop scaremongering,” he said. “The government responded to this issue quickly and has been open and transparent with impacted individuals and Aged Care providers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/21/manchester-united-paul-pogba-jose-mourinho-criticism-champions-league-sevilla","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T22:53:30Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho questions focus on substitute Paul Pogba after Sevilla draw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/21/manchester-united-paul-pogba-jose-mourinho-criticism-champions-league-sevilla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/21/manchester-united-paul-pogba-jose-mourinho-criticism-champions-league-sevilla","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho questions focus on substitute Paul Pogba after Sevilla draw","bodyText":"José Mourinho refused to be drawn on the absence of Paul Pogba from his starting lineup in Seville where Manchester United held on for a dogged scoreless draw. Instead United’s manager had praise for the “fantastic” performance of Scott McTominay, who started in Pogba’s place, and called on Old Trafford to produce “a big Champions League night” in three weeks’ time. “I think we finished the game with more space than we had in the beginning, more close to the possibility of scoring a goal,” Mourinho said, batting away the suggestion United might have been relieved to emerge with a clean sheet after David de Gea again produced a series of fine saves. “The only moment we felt relieved was at the end of the first half, where by a couple of mistakes in possession they had a couple of good situations that gave this fantastic stadium the emotion they normally have for 90 minutes. Apart from that the game was even. Sometimes you have 15 shots but 13 of them are what I call statistic shots. So I feel the result reflects what the game was. Was it a good result? It’s not good, its not bad. Now we have one match to decide everything at Old Trafford. Old Trafford needs a big Champions League night and it’s going to get it.” Mourinho had already told the TV cameras that the presence of Pogba on the bench for United’s most significant game of the season to date was due to the player not “feeling one hundred per cent”. He also suggested once again it had been Pogba’s “own decision” not to play against Huddersfield at the weekend. After the game in Seville, the United manager suggested the focus from the media on Pogba’s absence was “a bit strange”. “If I was one of you [the media] I would ask if the Manchester United manager agrees that Scott McTominay had a fantastic performance. My answer would be yes he looked a senior player with great maturity, tactical sense, good in possession, good in pressing. “Paul made a big effort to try to give me what I asked. Paul replaced Ander [Herrera] and tried to give the game the same qualities. He lost a couple of possessions, but he gave us also stability. We had a good percentage of the ball and that means control of the game, and Paul had the responsibility for that.” Herrera limped off after 17 minutes with what Mourinho described as “a bad injury”, and the United manager appeared to be unhappy with his own club’s medical staff. “I think it is a bad injury,” Mourinho said. “He had a small injury that stopped him from playing the last couple of matches, but the medical department said he was 100% ready for last Saturday [against Huddersfield Town]. We didn’t play him to give him more time to work and more protection, but it looks like he was not fully fit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/21/stormzy-asks-may-wheres-the-money-for-grenfell-at-brit-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T23:01:28Z","webTitle":"Stormzy asks 'Theresa May, where's the money for Grenfell?' at Brit awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/21/stormzy-asks-may-wheres-the-money-for-grenfell-at-brit-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/21/stormzy-asks-may-wheres-the-money-for-grenfell-at-brit-awards","fields":{"headline":"Stormzy asks 'Theresa May, where's the money for Grenfell?' at Brit awards","bodyText":"The south London MC Stormzy, fresh from winning two of the biggest awards at the 2018 Brits, delivered a furious attack on Theresa May in a show-closing freestyle. “Theresa May, where’s the money for Grenfell?” he asked the prime minister, adding that the government “just forgot about Grenfell, you criminals, and you got the cheek to call us savages, you should do some jail time, you should pay some damages, we should burn your house down and see if you can manage this.” The MC was one of those featured on the charity single to raise money for the victims of the fire which killed 71 people in June 2017, when it broke out in the west London tower block. At Glastonbury festival that year, he called out the response to the tragedy, saying: “We urge the authorities to tell the fucking truth, first and foremost. We urge them to do something. We urge the fucking government to be held accountable for the fuckery, and we ain’t gonna stop until we get what we deserve.” In his Brits freestyle he added that “MPs sniff coke, we just smoke a bit of cannabis, they’ll get me for this so be woke”, and castigated the Daily Mail, saying the newspaper could “suck my” – leaving little doubt over the next word. Paired with the line about cannabis, it continued his criticism of the newspaper – he previously wrote on Twitter “just admit you’re anti-black and fuck off you tramps” after the paper published a news story with the headline “Popular grime artists such as Stormzy are fuelling the use of ‘skunk’ by treating cannabis as ‘product placement’ in their chart-topping songs, researcher warns”, in December. Elsewhere in his performance, he praised black British model Jourdan Dunn, Oscar-nominated black British actor Daniel Kaluuya, and celebrated the fact he was “raised up by black girl magic”, via his sisters and mother."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/live/2018/feb/21/cnn-town-hall-gun-control-debate-live-florida-students-nra-marco-rubio","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T05:59:40Z","webTitle":"Florida survivors confront NRA spokeswoman in heated town hall meeting – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2018/feb/21/cnn-town-hall-gun-control-debate-live-florida-students-nra-marco-rubio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2018/feb/21/cnn-town-hall-gun-control-debate-live-florida-students-nra-marco-rubio","fields":{"headline":"Florida survivors confront NRA spokeswoman in heated town hall meeting – as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks for following our live coverage this evening. We’re closing the blog with two final reports from the event. Guardian columnist Richard Wolffe has published his analysis of what the evening meant for Marco Rubio, and here is senior reporter Lois Beckett’s summary of the night: Rubio, the only national Republican politician who agreed to answer questions from the Florida shooting survivors, seemed to watch the political ground of the gun debate shift under his feet. At one point, he argued that it did not make sense to ban only a subset of semiautomatic rifles based on certain cosmetic military features. “You would literally have to ban every semi-automatic rifle that’s sold in America ...” he began, before being cut off by huge whoops and cheers from the crowd. “Fair enough, fair enough,” Rubio said. “That is a valid position to hold.” More here: The town hall has come to a close. Here are some key moments and comments from the event: Student Cameron Kasky asked Senator Marco Rubio if he would stop taking donations from the NRA, and the Republican refused to make that commitment, drawing a loud and angry reaction from the crowd. Rubio did, however, say he would reconsider his position on high-capacity magazines, a noteworthy statement given his $1m boost from the NRA in 2016. Rubio also said he did not support arming teachers, which President Trump suggested earlier in the day. Some students and gun control advocates thanked the GOP senator for showing up, noting that Governor Rick Scott and President Donald Trump had refused. NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch tried to blame the shootings on mental illness and law enforcement, drawing backlash from inside and outside of the town hall. There was emotional testimony and questioning from a number of parents who lost children in the massacre and students who survived, including from father Fred Gutenberg who began the event by telling Rubio he was “pathetically weak”, and mother Lori Alhadeff, who ended her speech with a scream of pain and fury. Scott Israel, the Broward County sheriff, repeatedly stood up to Loesch and the NRA, at one point saying, “I don’t believe teachers should be armed, I believe teachers should teach.” Linda Schulman, the mother of a geography teacher who died in the shooting, questioned Loesch on the constitution, saying, “The second amendment was talking about muskets. We’re not talking about muskets. We’re talking about weapons of mass destruction.” There were numerous tense exchanges about assault rifles, with the crowd at one point cheering for a ban on all semi-automatic rifles. The event closed with an emotional musical performance and a reading of a poem recently written by one of the students killed during the shooting. Here’s footage of Max Schachter, father of Alex Schachter, a student killed in the shooting, reciting a poem his son recently wrote. It was called Life is Like a Rollercoaster” Here’s the text: Life is like a rollercoaster. It has some ups and downs. Sometimes you can take it slow or very fast. It may be hard to breathe at times, but you have to push yourself and keep going. Your bar is your safety. It’s like your family and friends. You hold on tight and you don’t let go. But sometimes you might throw your hands up, because your friends and family will always be with you. Just like that bar keeping you safe at all times. It may be too much for you at times – the twists, the turns, the upside downs. But you get back up. You keep chugging along. Eventually it comes to a stop. You won’t know when or how. But you will know that it will be time to get off and start anew. Life is like a rollercoaster. “We refuse to be ignored by those who will not listen,” says one student. They encourage those watching to get involved and take action. #NeverAgain #DouglasStrong After a series of heated exchanges, Dana Loesch’s strategy has become clear – shift the focus onto “mental illness” and cast blame on law enforcement for not stopping these shootings. She has repeatedly deflected attention away from firearms. Some have pointed out that the NRA spokeswoman appears to be contradicting previous statements she has made as well as official positions of the rifle association: Here’s footage of the mother of Scott Beigel, a teacher killed in the shooting, addressing Loesch: Now students of the Stoneman Douglas drama club are singing and performing a song they wrote for their friends. It’s called Shine. They really are a remarkable group of people. Max Schachter, whose son Alex died in the shooting, reads a poem written by Alex shortly before he died. He says he wants everyone to hear his son’s words. The poem is called Life is like a rollercoaster. We’ll hope to get the full poem here shortly. Linda Schulman, the mother of Scott Beigel, a geography teacher who died in the shooting, addresses Loesch. She says the constitution gave her son the right to life. Why is this not protected as fiercely as the right to bear arms? Loesch says there will be “good guys with guns” in schools protecting children. Schulman continues: The second amendment was talking about muskets. We’re not talking about muskets. We’re talking about weapons of mass destruction. Loesch disputes this. There were more powerful weapons then, she says. But she says she wishes Beigel had not lost his life. A reminder from the founder of Moms Demand Action that people with mental illness are more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators, and that people with mental illness commit a very small fraction of offenses: Jim Gard, a math teacher who taught three of the victims, speaks next. He wants to know about the tips given to the FBI about the gunman before the school shooting and why no further action was taken. There is no representative of the FBI at the town hall; they declined an invitation. But Sheriff Scott Israel addresses the issue of red flags and the multiple police call-outs to the killer’s home before the attack. He says the Broward sheriff office received tips about the killer. They’re now reassessing to see if they could have acted differently. But he says lawmakers need to give officers more powers to compel a person to receive mental health treatment in a facility and to remove their weapons. Loesch says there was enough evidence before the shooting for police to have taken the killer’s weapons. She says there were 39 police visits to his home. You’re completely wrong, Israel tells her. He disputes the 39 figure. Some of Loesch’s rhetoric doesn’t seem to match the official positions of the NRA. The spokeswoman has talked about “stronger background checks”, but the association has said it opposes expanding firearm background checks: Loesch says the NRA has resources and suggestions, but “it’s up to the schools” to implement them. It’s up to schools and parents if they want armed guards, she tells Alhadeff, or if they want a system that doesn’t involve firearms. Israel says the country needs to do something different. What I think we need to do in America … is have less guns on our streets, not more guns. Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was killed at Stoneman Douglas. She was not able to be identified until 2am the next day. I am tired of people doing nothing … Where are our metal detectors? Where is our bulletproof glass? Where are the school psychologists? And why hasn’t anything been done since Sandy Hook? I don’t want to see another parent lose a child in this senseless way. Alhadeff ends with a scream of pain and fury. She wants to know what plans the NRA has to put any of the talk into action. Dana Loesch is facing backlash for using language like “crazy” and “nuts” to refer to mental illness: Loesch says she knows of teachers who want to be armed. If you’re old enough to vote and drive a car, you’re old enough to own a firearm, she adds – but only if you’re not a threat to yourself and your community. Here’s footage of Broward County sheriff Scott Israel getting a large ovation after criticizing Dana Loesch: Israel says the US needs gun control reform. An 18-year-old should never have a rifle, he says. Bump stocks should be illegal, he says. Semi-automatic rifles should be illegal. He’s with Emma Gonzales on this issue, he says. He’s calling BS. Diane Wolk Rogers, a teacher who survived the shooting, talks about witnessing the bodies of her students. She, like the young survivors, believes in #neveragain, she says. Our kids have started a revolution and I’m proud. She asks Loesch to explain – “using supporting detail” – why a teenager with a military weapon is part of a “well-regulated militia”, as the second amendment puts it. Loesch says the militia includes every man and every woman in the US, “in the context of the time”. But the Florida gunman should have been barred from buying a firearm. “He bought it legally!” someone shouts from the audience. Loesch says he should not have been able to. (Incidentally, she has been using terminology – “nuts”, “crazy”, “insane” – that many find inconsistent with the argument that a better focus on mental illness is the way forward.) Israel says police ought to be able to help people before they hurt others, and be able to take weapons away from people who could be a danger. He is not a member of the NRA, he clarifies to host Tapper. Loesch says the background check system is flawed. That’s not the question, Gonzales reminds her. She wants to know if Loesch thinks it should be harder to get semi-automatic weapons. Sheriff Israel isn’t happy. You’re not standing up for these survivors, he says to Loesch, until you agree that society needs fewer weapons. Senior student Emma Gonzales has a question. She is met with massive applause. She addresses NRA representative Dana Loesch directly. What restrictions would she accept on gun sales and bump stocks and background checks? Loesch says nobody, on any side of the issue, should deny Gonzales her voice. But, she adds: I don’t believe that this insane monster should have been able to obtain a firearm. She says the NRA does not support “people who are crazy … getting their hands on a firearm”. The NRA does not want this to happen again, she says. The crowd is booing Loesch but Gonzales asks them to be quiet: If I can’t hear, I can’t make a rebuttal! Some background on Dana Loesch: Earlier in the day, an NRA television host told her: “You’re very brave to go down there ... It’s being put on by CNN, that I don’t have any trust in. The deck is going to be stacked against you.” Broward county sheriff Scott Israel has now joined the town hall. I don’t believe teachers should be armed. I believe teachers should teach. He says such pronouncements are “exactly what’s wrong with this country” – decisions made in Washington without talking to teachers. Several of the Parkland students have acknowledged that Rubio – for all they disagree with him on gun control and the NRA donations to his campaigns – made the right decision in turning up to the town hall to face their classmates. Annabel Quinn Claprood, a sophomore student, speaks next. She says she won’t return to school until she is assured that something will change. Ted Deutch reflects how sad it is that she should have to ask that question. But he says action on background checks need not take long, and banning bump stocks should’t be something that needs thinking about: We need to do it next week! Rubio says that on Monday politicians could unanimously take action on background checks. He believes there is a majority to restrict bump stocks in the Senate. He says he worries that the national attention span is short; we can’t allow that to happen here, he adds. Chris Grady, a senior who recently enlisted in the army, is speaking now to Senator Rubio: “We might not see eye to eye on a lot of these issues, but we need you and your colleagues on both sides to come together with us and find compromise...” He asks about large-capacity magazine: “Would you agree that there is no place in our society for large-capacity magazines?” Rubio responds: “I traditionally have not supported looking at magazine-clip size ... After this, I’m reconsidering that position. While it may not prevent an attack, it may saves lives. ... We can reach a compromise.” He said attacks could be less lethal. Lapidot isn’t satisfied. She’s heard all this before. Why wasn’t the first school [this happened to] the last one? Nothing changes, she says. All these lives have been lost. Nothing has been done. Lapidot wants to know why schools and children are not better protected. Should they have Kevlar vests? Why don’t we get the assault rifles off the street so students feel more secure, is Senator Bill Nelson’s response. Children shouldn’t need protective vests to go to school, he says. You’ve got to continue to be strong and speak out, Nelson says, addressing Lapidot and her fellow students directly. First-year MSD student Michelle Lapidot says her school will not be just one of the many school shootings to have taken place this year: My school is going to be the last … My friends did not die for nothing. She wants to ask the NRA: Was the blood of my teachers and my classmates worth the money? Because the NRA representative (Dana Loesch) isn’t here, Jake Tapper moves Lapidot on without an answer. So she has a second question: how does she return to school and feel safe after an event like this? Rubio’s argument was that the NRA donates to him because of his pre-existing agenda – not that NRA money influences that agenda. He resists all of Cameron Kasky’s efforts to distance himself from the NRA, saying: They buy into my ideas. I don’t buy into theirs. Student Cameron Kasky is speaking now, asks: “Senator Rubio, can you tell me now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?” Rubio: “I do support the Second Amendment... I do support any law that would keep any guns out of the hands of a deranged killer. ... The influence of these groups come not from money.” Rubio is repeatedly refusing to answer the question of whether he will take NRA donations: “I will always accept the help of anyone who agrees with my agenda.” The Republican senator has continued to speak of policies and won’t address Kasky’s question. Robert Schentrup, who lost his sister Carmen in the massacre, asks why – when most Americans support strengthened background checks – such a bill has not been passed. Ted Deutch says he doesn’t have an answer to that. Every person who buys a gun should have a background check, he argues. Democracy is broken when gun lobbyists can buy influence to stop such measures from being passed, Deutch adds. No matter how much money the NRA spends on political campaigns … here’s why our democracy is great. Everything we’ve seen is leading a movement that is so much stronger. That’s why democracy can be fixed and will be fixed. Rubio now faces a question from a Stoneman Douglas teacher – a Trump supporter and a second amendment defender, she says. But she shielded students during last week’s attack. Is she now supposed to be armed in her classroom, she asks? (The president, of course, earlier suggested this as a potential solution.) Rubio says he is not in favour of arming teachers in the classroom. Loud applause for high school senior Ryan Deitsch, who said this to Rubio: Marco Rubio and Ted Deutch are now having a tense exchange about assault rifles. Rubio is saying the proposals to ban assault rifles have loopholes, adding, “You would literally have to ban every semi-automatic rifle.” Though not Rubio’s intent, the line earned loud applause: Samantha Grady, a student who was injured and survived, asked the next question, saying: “I was shot twice. My best friend was killed right in front of me.” She asked what would be done to prevent this from happening in the future. Senator Nelson responded saying he supported closing the gun show loophole and improving criminal background checks. He added: When you get right down to it, the gun is what is going to do the killing... An AK-47 and an AR-15 is not for hunting. It’s for killing.” Fred Gutenberg, whose daughter Jamie was killed last week, earned a standing ovation telling Senator Rubio that his comments have been “pathetically weak”, adding, “Look at me and tell me guns were the factor in the hunting of our kids… Look at me and tell me you will work with us to do something about guns.” Rubio said he supports raising the age to buy a rifle to 18 years old and that he supports the banning of “bump stocks”. But the senator said he does not support an assault rifle ban: If I believed that law would have prevented this from happening, I would have supported it.” Gutenberg responded: “My daughter running down the hallway … was shot in the back with an assault weapon, the weapon of choice. It is too easy to get. it is a weapon of war.” Some selections of opening remarks. Representative Ted Deutch, a Democrat: It is not too soon. It is too late for the 17 lives that were lost. It is too late for the grieving families, too late for the injured, too late for the ... survivors of what happened. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat: We are all grieving. What we’re facing is what’s going to be done. There ought to be some commonsense solutions, like getting the assault rifles off the street. … having criminal background checks on every acquiring of a gun. You have been so strong. Keep it up and keep hope alive. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican: I think all of us would like to see action… We are a nation of people that no longer speak to each other. We are a nation of people that have stopped being friends with people because of who they voted for … We are a nation of people that have isolated ourselves politically and to a point where discussions like this have become very difficult... We cannot reverse what happened seven days ago, but we can make sure one of these events never happens again… CNN’s Jake Tapper is beginning the town hall, where an estimated 7,000 people are attending: “We’re here tonight to facilitate your desire to speak directly to your leaders.” Students and parents will get an opportunity to directly ask elected officials questions. Tapper said President Donald Trump and Florida governor Rick Scott both declined to participate in the town hall. Just two years ago, the National Rifle Association (NRA) spent more than $1m during a single election cycle to support the re-election of the Florida senator Marco Rubio. Today, Rubio is trying to position himself as a Republican seeking compromise on gun control laws. He agreed to join CNN’s town hall to discuss – with angry, grieving student survivors – what needs to be done after a school shooting left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida. More specifics from Guardian reporter Lois Beckett: President Trump, who is facing criticisms for suggesting that teachers should be armed, has posted video of his full listening session today, adding, “We must keep our children safe!” You can watch here: Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat from Connecticut, is speaking with CNN before the town hall begins. Asked about Trump’s proposal to arm teachers, he said: It’s a recipe for disaster … You put a whole mess load of guns close to kids that can be used accidentally. You can create crossfire... There’s no evidence to suggest that this actually works, anecdotally or empirically. ... This is simply a talking point from the gun industry. They are desperate to sell more guns.” Read more about America’s gun violence epidemic in Break the Cycle, the Guardian’s in-depth series challenging the orthodoxy that gun control is simply too difficult. Lois Beckett, the Guardian’s senior reporter covering gun policy, has background on Dana Loesch, the NRA spokeswoman attending tonight’s town hall: A longtime conservative talk radio host, Dana Loesch sparked outrage last year for an NRA recruitment ad in which she railed against the left for using “their media to assassinate real news” and said NRA members needed to confront “this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth”. The ad sparked a broad backlash, with one critic calling it “a whisper shy of a call for full civil war”. “This NRA ad is an open call to violence to protect white supremacy,” Black Lives Matter activist Deray McKesson wrote in response. “If I made a video like this, I’d be in jail.” Shannon Watts, a leading gun control activist, criticized CNN’s choice to include Loesch in Wednesday’s discussion. In a preview video just released, Loesch said she’s hoping for a “civil debate ... without anybody screaming murderer at me”. Read more from Lois here: Robert Runcie, superintendent of Broward County public schools, is speaking before the town hall officially begins. He earned loud cheers for comments opposing the proposals to arm teachers with firearms, which President Trump suggested earlier today. Runice said: We don’t need to put guns in the hands of teachers. We need to arm our teachers with more money in their pocket.” Runice also said the school will reopen next week, adding: “Our goal is to get back to normalcy.” He further said it’s time for the gun debate to move “beyond thoughts and prayers and sympathies to real action”. Here’s a quick summary of some of of the policy ideas that have emerged over the last week since the massacre: Donald Trump suggested arming teachers with guns during a “listening session” that was broadcast live at the White House on Wednesday. Trump also has called for regulations to ban bump stocks and other devices that enable semi-automatic firearms to fire at close to the rate of a machine gun. That is by some measures considered “one of the smallest possible steps forward on gun control”. Some have called for an assault weapons ban, but a proposal for state legislation in Florida already failed. Others have suggested that laws allowing police and family members to obtain restraining orders barring people from possessing guns could help prevent tragedies like the shooting in Parkland. People on both sides of the debate have also discussed efforts to improve background checks on gun buyers. Here is some further context and statistics to consider about gun violence and school shootings, from the Guardian’s gun policy reporter Lois Beckett: Welcome to our live coverage of CNN’s town hall, where students who survived last week’s mass shooting at a Florida high school will be speaking live with lawmakers and a representative of the National Rifle Association (NRA). The event, titled Stand Up: The Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action, is bringing together victims’ classmates, parents and community members to speak with US senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, Florida state representative Ted Deutch and Broward County sheriff Scott Israel. The NRA’s controversial spokeswoman Dana Loesch also agreed to participate. In recent weeks, Rubio has faced intense pressure and protests over his inaction on gun policy and acceptance of NRA money.

Speaking to Sky News on Thursday, the Australian prime minister sought to play down a more hostile approach to China by the US, rejecting the “out-of-date cold-war prism” of seeing the two superpowers as in competition. Turnbull said the aim of the trip – which will include regional security talks and a delegation of Australian premiers and business leaders attending the National Governors Association conference – is to “broaden and deepen” the relationship with the US. Asked if the US viewed China as a “strategic threat”, unlike Australia, Turnbull replied that “a threat is a combination of capability and intent”. “China has enormous capability, and of course it’s growing [as it becomes] more prosperous … but we do not see any hostile intent from China,” he said. “We do not describe China as a threat.” Turnbull said Australia and US president, Donald Trump, did not view the Asia-Pacific region “through an out-of-date cold-war prism”, citing Trump’s business experience to demonstrate he “understands the economic significance of China’s rise and its opportunity”. “Of course there are issues between Washington and Beijing, and there always will be. But the two leaders – and I’ve had privilege of being with both of them – see those issues and address them in a very clear-eyed and candid way.” Despite the rhetoric of not viewing China as a threat, the Turnbull government has introduced a package of foreign interference bills to ban foreign donations and register foreign lobbyists, which has sparked diplomatic backlash from China. Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister, has accused the Turnbull government of “neo-McCarthyism” and an “anti-Chinese jihad” in its rhetoric. Asked about a joint regional infrastructure scheme being developed by Australia, the US, India and Japan as an alternative to China’s belt and road initiative, Turnbull said the media always looks for cold war-style rivalry but “that’s not the way we see the region”. “We want to maintain the rule of law, the rules-based order, that has enabled this international growth and prosperity,” he said. Turnbull said the region needed “trillions of dollars of additional infrastructure investment” and to widen the pool of investors by improving legal and governance frameworks. He said the TPP11 trade agreement would achieve greater economic integration and was “structured so other countries can dock in” and plenty of countries, including the UK, had expressed interest. “It would be great if the US were able to rejoin – but I don’t think that’s going to happen any time soon.” “Overwhelmingly” the biggest strategic threat was the “risk of conflict, even nuclear conflict” with North Korea, he said, and the other critical challenge was “the threat of Islamist terror in the region”. Asked about Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric on North Korea he defended his “very cut-through style” and said he had been able to achieve “very strong sanctions” on Pyongyang with support from Australia and the permanent members of the security council, including Russia and China. Turnbull said he had “a great relationship” with Trump and the two “get on very well”. With the text of the TPP11 released on Wednesday, unions have attacked the weakening of labour market testing. As Guardian Australia reported in December the agreement will allow employers to hire workers from Canada, Mexico, Chile, Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam in 435 occupations without first advertising jobs to Australians. The trade minister, Steven Ciobo, told Radio National that few workers from TPP countries came to Australia on temporary skilled 457 visas and most related to transfers within a corporation. Ciobo said that “several years ago” as few as 200 of the 50,000 visa applications came from TPP countries and businesses would “hire an Australian worker first if [they] can find someone”. He said the labour market provisions “flow both ways” and Australian workers would have better access to other markets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/23/russian-bots-us-election-coup-d-etat","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"The hysteria over Russian bots has reached new levels | Thomas Frank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/russian-bots-us-election-coup-d-etat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/russian-bots-us-election-coup-d-etat","fields":{"headline":"The hysteria over Russian bots has reached new levels","bodyText":"The grand total for all political ad spending in the 2016 election cycle, according to Advertising Age, was $9.8bn. The ads allegedly produced by inmates of a Russian troll farm, which have made up this week’s ration of horror and panic in the halls of the American punditburo, cost about $100,000 to place on Facebook. A few months ago, when I first described those Russian ads in this space, I invited readers to laugh at them. They were “low-budget stuff, ugly, loud and stupid”, I wrote. They interested me because they cast the paranoid right, instead of the left, as dupes of a foreign power. And yet, I wrote, the American commentariat had largely overlooked them. Now that Robert Mueller’s office has indicted the Russian actors who are allegedly behind the ads, however, all that has changed. American pundits have gone from zero to 60 on this matter in no time at all – from ignoring the Facebook posts to outright hysteria over them. What the Russian trolls allegedly did was “an act of war ... a sneak attack using 21st-century methods”, wrote the columnist Karen Tumulty. “Our democracy is in serious danger,” declared America’s star thought-leader Thomas Friedman on Sunday, raging against the weakling Trump for not getting tough with these trolls and their sponsors. “Protecting our democracy obviously concerns Trump not at all,” agreed columnist Eugene Robinson on Tuesday. The ads themselves are now thought to have been the product of highly advanced political intelligence. So effective were the troll-works, wrote Robert Kuttner on Monday, that we can say Trump “literally became president in a Russia-sponsored coup d’etat”. For thoughts on the finely tuned calculations behind this propaganda campaign, the Washington Post on Saturday turned to Brian Fallon, a former Hillary Clinton press secretary, who referred to the alleged Russian effort as follows: “It seems like the creative instincts and the sophistication exceeds a lot of the US political operatives who do this for a living.” Of what, specifically, did this sophistication consist? In what startling insights was this creativity made manifest? “Fallon said it was stunning to realize that the Russians understood how Trump was trying to woo disaffected [Bernie] Sanders supporters ...” The Post added a few suspicious examples of its own. The Russian trolls figured out that battleground states were important. And: they tried to enlist disgruntled blue-collar voters in what the paper called the “rust belt”. Okay, stop here. Since when is it a marker of political sophistication to know that some states are more persuadable than others? Or to understand that blue-collar voters are an important demographic these days? If you’re one of those people who frets about our democracy being in serious danger, I contend that the above passages from the Post’s report should push your panic meter deep into the red. This is the reason why: we have here a former spokesman for Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, one of the best-funded, most consummately professional efforts of all time, and he thinks it was an act of off-the-hook perceptiveness to figure out that Trump was aiming for disgruntled Sanders voters. Even after Trump himself openly said that’s what he was trying to do. For a veteran politico to be stunned by this unremarkable fact, one of two things has to be true: either Democratic “political operatives” are incredibly bad at what they do, or else they are feigning amazement in order to get themselves off the hook for the lousy job they did in 2016. They themselves blew millions and came up empty, but to this handful of bargain-basement Russian trolls they ascribe all manner of ability. Clinton’s glittering Jedi army was simply powerless against them. It is worth noting that the indictment itself, as the deputy US attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, said on Friday, declines to attribute any actual election results to the Russian ads. It is also important to acknowledge that I believe Mueller’s indictment is probably correct in its particulars. Everyone can see that we are living in an age of rampant propaganda, that conspiracy theories have never travelled faster. But no thanks to a new cold war. Yes, go after the Russian trolls. Prosecute them for their alleged crimes. Punish Putin if he tried to jack with us. But understand that this sort of operation is not going away. Its extremely modest price tag guarantees it, as does the liberals’ determination to exaggerate its giant-slaying powers. This is rightwing populism’s next wave, and in an oligarchic world, every American plutocrat will soon be fielding his or her own perfectly legal troll army. Those of us who believe in democracy need to stop panicking and start thinking bigger: of how rightwing populism can be undone forever.

Leicester won promotion from the Championship that season after their owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who owns Thailand’s duty-free company King Power, had invested more than £100m since his 2010 takeover, and subsequently they won their unlikely Premier League title in 2016. The Football League’s then-new FFP rules, aimed at improving its clubs’ financial sustainability particularly in the Championship, set out sanctions including heavy fines for clubs which made losses greater than £8m in 2013-14. Leicester, spending heavily on players’ wages, made a £34m loss in 2012-13, then reduced it to £21m, partly due to receiving a large increase in income from a marketing deal signed with Trestellar Limited, a company run by the son of the former Premier League chairman Sir Dave Richards. That deal, under which Trestellar sold the sponsorship of the club’s shirt and stadium back to King Power, is understood to have been under investigation by the EFL when considering whether Leicester breached the rules. Leicester argued they had not breached the rules, which make allowances for expenditure on youth development, a stadium and other infrastructure, and that the Trestellar deal had been concluded following “an extensive tender process” to find the best partner to market the club worldwide. The club then stated it was not only disputing any findings against its own losses, but “the legality” of the FFP rules themselves. Queens Park Rangers, who were also found to have made excessive losses, challenged the rules’ legality but an arbitration panel found for the EFL in October The EFL and Leicester announced the £3.1m settlement in identical statements, which gave little detail about the issues considered. The statements made clear that: “In reaching the settlement, the EFL acknowledges that the club did not make any deliberate attempt to infringe the rules or to deceive and that the dispute arose out of genuine differences of interpretation of the rules between the parties.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/feb/22/benching-paul-pogba-mind-game-own-goal-jose-mourinho","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T00:04:09Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho continues bizarre and divisive power-play over Pogba | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/feb/22/benching-paul-pogba-mind-game-own-goal-jose-mourinho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/feb/22/benching-paul-pogba-mind-game-own-goal-jose-mourinho","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho continues bizarre and divisive power-play over Paul Pogba","bodyText":"Well, we got there in the end. Grudgingly, belatedly and against the manager’s better judgment. But with 17 minutes gone in this Champions League first leg, on a breezy, boisterous night in Seville, José Mourinho found himself forced by circumstance and bad luck into playing his most talented midfielder in his favourite position. It is, of course, important not to be drawn too deeply into another Mourinho psychodrama. On a scale of one to Ramos the current half-glimpsed friction with Paul Pogba is hardly likely to rate a top-10 mention in the all-time annals of toxic José-dom. Plus, Mourinho was correct to suggest after this 0-0 draw that the return leg at Old Trafford will be an entirely different occasion; and that this was a good result, albeit on the back of another choked and sputtering performance as United were pushed back repeatedly by an increasingly assertive Sevilla team. But something odd is clearly stirring here, a friction between manager and star player that seems to reflect Mourinho’s own wider struggle at United, a club where the basic idea of what football is supposed to look like has always seemed an odd fit with the manager’s own furiously guarded, cussedly Mourinho-shaped notion of how to win. On a micro level it still isn’t clear exactly why Pogba-Mourinho should have hit such a pronounced patch of turbulence. Pogba isn’t a selfish player, or an ingénu, or a footballer who lacks the kind of qualities Mourinho admires. And yet here we are all the same, being treated over two puzzling days in Seville to a bizarre and divisive pre-match power-play. At his press conference Mourinho had spoken in weird gnomic riddles about Pogba’s status and availability, before opening up the back-end of training to the public eye. His intentions only became clear when his startling XI landed 24 hours later with no Pogba to be seen. It turned out what Mourinho had been saying was, “Look, this player is fit. Whatever passed between us in the last week, it’s not me or you. It’s him. And just to be clear, the manager picks the team round here.” At the end of which it is tempting to wonder in which parallel universe of José-shaped egomania this is a fight worth picking. Mourinho is still trying to build a champion team on the hoof, to conjure another rising red tide out of the last few years of retrenchment. Quite how Pogba could be an obstacle, or a bad fit or an odd man in these circumstances is far from clear. The presence of Paul Pogba on the playing staff: this is not your problem. The question instead is how to get the most from a player with the ability to make any kind of pass, and also to drive through the clinches and physically dominate an opposition. The best thing about Pogba is just that he so obviously loves playing, lifting his team-mates with his presence, and looking so often like a man who is basically having a ball out there. Except, of course, when he’s not. In Seville it was an oddly chastened Pogba who came striding on to the pitch after Ander Herrera left the field early on. Pogba took up a position on the left of the midfield three, the role, quite frankly, he should have had from the start, nailed right through the season’s entire block of United team sheets. His first touch was a glossily-executed little flick inside. He ferreted gamely, keeping his position and battling hard as Sevilla found their own midfield rhythm. But this was a United team once again struggling to move through the gears, required instead to cover and block and sit deep against opponents they might have expected to stretch a bit more. Scott McTominay, Nemanja Matic and Herrera had lined up in a deep three-man midfield block. McTominay in particular was given a heavy load, asked to vindicate his manager’s selection in difficult circumstances. And McTominay did play well here, even if once again it was hard to avoid the feeling of a team juddering and chafing against its own constraints. The deeper fascination of Mourinho at United has always been that basic question of style and personality, whether Mourinho can lose himself in something bigger, can allow himself to produce a United team of genuine elan rather than another corrosive Mourinho winning machine. It is struggle that seems to be embodied right now in Pogba; a brilliant puzzle of a player, and one United would surely be better served trying to solve rather than unsettle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/21/cnn-florida-town-hall-gun-control-six-things-we-learned","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T06:47:48Z","webTitle":"Six things we learned from the Florida town hall on gun control","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/cnn-florida-town-hall-gun-control-six-things-we-learned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/cnn-florida-town-hall-gun-control-six-things-we-learned","fields":{"headline":"Six things we learned from the Florida town hall on gun control","bodyText":"Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school students, teachers and parents booed, screamed and asked questions through tears as they interrogated lawmakers and a National Rifle Association spokeswoman about how the shooting that killed 17 people could have happened in the first place – and what those in power would do to stop another massacre. Here are six key takeaways from the two-hour CNN town hall: Marco Rubio won’t stop taking NRA money The Republican senator Marco Rubio faced the most intense scrutiny of the elected officials in attendance, with grieving students and parents directing their anger at policy inaction and the NRA’s influence toward the Florida lawmaker. One of the most intense moments of the evening came when a student named Cameron Kasky said to Rubio: “Can you tell me now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?” The senator, who received $1m from the NRA in the 2016 election, repeatedly deflected the question, citing his commitment to the second amendment, adding: “People buy into my agenda ... The influence of these groups comes not from money. The influence comes from the millions of people that agree with the agenda.” Rubio is open to ‘reconsidering’ his stance on magazines Despite his refusal to denounce NRA money, the GOP senator said he would consider certain gun control policies that his party has generally opposed. In one exchange, he said he would reconsider his position on banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. “While it may not prevent an attack, it may save lives in an attack,” he said. “I think we can reach a compromise.” He did not, however, make any firm commitments. Some Parkland students praised the senator for at least showing up, unlike the Florida governor, Rick Scott, and the president, Donald Trump, who both declined invites, according to CNN. NRA blames ‘crazy’ people and law enforcement The NRA’s spokeswoman Dana Loesch adopted a predictable strategy of casting blame on mental illness, repeatedly referring to people who are “crazy” and “nuts” carrying out these attacks. This is despite the fact that, as critics pointed out, people with mental illness are more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators and only commit a small fraction of offenses. Loesch also targeted law enforcement in her comments, arguing with the sheriff of Broward County seated besides her and claiming that police should be doing more to prevent these kinds of tragedies. The crowd repeatedly booed Loesch, who got in heated exchanges with students and parents about the second amendment. Divides on assault rifle bans The town hall kicked off with an emotional plea from Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter was killed in the shooting. He said to Rubio: “Look at me and tell me guns were the factor in the hunting of our kid.” But Rubio made clear he would not support an assault rifle ban: “If I believe that that law would have prevented this from happening I would support it.” He claimed that it would not address all assault weapons, saying: “You would literally have to ban every semi-automatic rifle that’s sold in America.” Though unintended, the line earned huge applause from the crowd, prompting the senator to say: “Fair enough ... That is a valid position to hold.” Some consensus on gun control There was some consensus on a few limited proposals. Rubio said he did not support arming teachers, echoing the position of the local Florida law enforcement officials and Democrats. Rubio also said he would support a law to create gun violence restraining orders, which would allow police and family members to request that a court block a dangerous individual from possessing weapons. The senator also said he supports raising the minimum age to purchase a rifle to 21. Ryan Deitsch, a student who survived the shooting, responded to Rubio’s modest proposals, saying: “I do appreciate your words here, but that feels like the first step of a 5k run.” Moments of hope The student activists and others expressed some amount of hope and optimism during and after the town hall. Commentators noted that this moment felt different than the typical cycle of an American mass shooting, with teenage survivors pushing for change in effective and powerful ways. Emma González, a student who recently went viral with her impassioned speech criticizing the NRA, tweeted after the hearing: “Words cannot describe how Good I feel after this Town Hall ... we got to Talk to the People who can make a Difference ... and though tears were listened to #STONEMANSTRONG.” CNN presented the evening as an “historic exchange” and observers commented on the rarity of seeing teenagers passionately challenge their lawmakers on live television."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/21/florida-cnn-town-hall-what-survivors-had-to-say","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T07:03:52Z","webTitle":"'Pathetically weak': what Florida survivors said to NRA and politicians","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/florida-cnn-town-hall-what-survivors-had-to-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/florida-cnn-town-hall-what-survivors-had-to-say","fields":{"headline":"'Pathetically weak': what Florida survivors said to NRA and politicians","bodyText":"Survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, and victim’s parents joined politicians, local sheriff Scott Israel, and Dana Loesch of the National Rifle Association in a town hall discussion hosted by CNN. Here’s what they had to say: Fred Guttenberg, father of Jamie Guttenberg, 14, who was killed To Senator Marco Rubio: “Your comments this week and those of our president have been pathetically weak ... Look at me and tell me that guns were the factor in the hunting of our kids in this school this week. Look at me and tell me you accept it, and you will work with us to do something about guns.” Marco Rubio, Republican US senator for Florida “If I believed that [an assault weapon ban] would have prevented this from happening I would support it. But I want to explain to you why it would not.” On whether he will reject NRA money: “I do support the second amendment, and I do support any law that would keep guns out of the hands of a deranged killer ... If people want to support my agenda, they are welcome to do so. But they buy into my ideas, I don’t buy into theirs.” Ted Deutch, Democratic US congressman for Parkland “Do I support banning weapons that fire off 150 rounds in seven or eight minutes, weapons that are weapons of war, that serve no purpose other than killing the maximum number of people they can? You bet I am.” Bill Nelson, Democratic US senator for Florida “There are so many other things that we can do, certainly mental health, certainly the question about putting armed deputies [in schools]. But when you get right down to it, the gun is what is going to do the killing.” Ryan Deitsch, 18, shooting survivor “After me and others have been going out of their way, going to the state capital, speaking out, we’d like to know, why do we have to be the ones to do this? Why do we have to speak out to the capital? Why do we have to march in Washington just to save innocent lives?” Ashley Kurth, Stoneman Douglas teacher “Am I supposed to get extra training now to serve and protect on top of educate these children? ... Am I supposed to have a Kevlar vest? Am I supposed to strap [a gun] to my leg or put it in my desk? How am I supposed to go on that way?” Scott Israel, Broward County sheriff “I don’t believe teachers should be armed, I believe teachers should teach. But that’s exactly what’s wrong with this country. We have people in Washington DC – representatives, senators, and legislators – telling teachers what they should do without asking teachers, ‘What do you want to do?’” Cameron Kasky, 17, shooting survivor and founder of Never Again MSD “Anyone who’s willing to show change, no matter where they’re from, anybody who’s willing to start to make a difference, is somebody we need on our side here. And this is about people who are for making a difference to save us, and people who are against us and prefer money.” Dana Loesch, national spokesperson, National Rifle Association “This individual was nuts and I nor the millions of people that I represent as a part of this organization that I am here speaking for – none of us support people who are crazy, who are a danger to themselves, who are a dangers to others, getting their hands on a firearm.” “This individual, this madman, passed a background check. How was he able to pass a background check? He was able to pass a background check because we have a system that is flawed.” Lori Alhadeff, mother of Alyssa Alhadeff, 14, who was killed No child should ever turn to their mother at six years of age and ask, ‘Mommy, am I going to die today?’ ...

The company has abandoned its March deadline for securing financing for the first stage of the Carmichael mine. In October, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, the chief executive of Adani Australia, told Reuters it aimed to settle financing for the project by March 2018. Today, as reported in Fairfax Media, Adani has confirmed it would not be meeting that deadline. A spokeswoman for Adani Australia told the Guardian the March deadline was predicated on the company receiving a subsidised loan from the Australian government through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif). Since the Queensland Labor government has said it would veto any such loan, she said the financing timeline was now pushed back. The spokeswoman would not confirm what the new funding timeline was, saying it was “commercial in confidence”. “We remain 100% committed to the Carmichael project. We are confident of securing financing,” she said. Adani’s missed funding deadline is just the latest in a string of setbacks. In December, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced she would veto any federal loan to the project. What Adani still describes on its website as the project’s “biggest deal”, a $2bn deal with Downer EDI to construct and operate the mine, was scrapped when Adani announced it could no longer afford the contract. All four big Australian banks previously ruled out funding the project, leading Adani to search for loans from foreign banks. Dozens of international banks had also ruled out funding. Amid negotiations with Chinese state-owned enterprises, which might have secured funding from huge Chinese banks, the Chinese embassy in Australia announced no Chinese bank would fund the project. Adani has also had to downgrade the predicted output of the mine, and its own consultants have contradicted Adani’s claims of the number of jobs the project would create. The federal Labor party has hardened its stance against the project, canvassing ways to kill the project if it wins government, receiving advice on whether existing environmental laws could be used, and examining whether a “climate trigger” could be introduced to those laws. Labor leader Bill Shorten has said the project is “just another project” and noted it must stack up economically and environmentally. Other senior labor leaders have gone further. The deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, has been telling members of the public who write to her office she does “not believe that the Carmichael mine project stacks up economically or environmentally”. And Mark Butler, the opposition spokesman for climate change, has doubled down on earlier comments, saying the project was not in the national interest, and it was not “what the world needs to do … to keep global warming well below two degrees”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/23/mute-review-netflix-duncan-jones-sci-fi","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T08:00:40Z","webTitle":"Mute review – Duncan Jones's sci-fi thriller is a Netflix disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/23/mute-review-netflix-duncan-jones-sci-fi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/23/mute-review-netflix-duncan-jones-sci-fi","fields":{"headline":"Mute review – Duncan Jones's sci-fi thriller is a Netflix disaster","bodyText":"If one were to relax one’s eyes and stand very far away, the career of Duncan Jones might begin to resemble that of the young Hollywood savior he’s clearly angling to be. Like George Lucas before him, Jones made a name for himself with a blazingly original sci-fi sleeper (2009’s excellent Moon) which he then parlayed into a workmanlike box-office success (2011’s high-concept Source Code). But sometime in the five-year hiatus prior to 2016’s Warcraft, a difficult period marked by his wife’s battle with cancer and his father’s death, he strayed from the path. His adaptation of the popular online fantasy game was to be Jones’ graduation into the uppermost echelon of big-league film-making, but it was savaged by critics and ate dirt at the US box office. All of which has led to Mute, a spectacularly blown shot at redemption. In the parallel universe where everything’s gone right for Jones, this long-labored-over passion project would have been his magnum opus, an idiosyncratically imagined futuro-fantasia worthy of the Blade Runner comparisons it so shamelessly courts. But while Jones has never been lacking in ambition, here that quality seems more like a willingness to “go for it”. The depth of his creative commitment hasn’t turned shallow, but it has been applied to a collection of perilously bad impulses. Foremost among them is Leo Beller, your run-of-the-mill Amish bartender at Berlin’s premier robot strip club circa 2058. Portrayed with a carefully measured mix of glowering, breathing, blinking, and standing by Alexander Skarsgård , Leo has been rendered unable to speak by one of those throat-slashing Amish motorboating accidents that are always in the news. His pat quest to locate a missing girlfriend, in conjunction with Leo’s thin characterization and a minimal range of expression from Skarsgård , leads to one surpassingly boring performance. As he trudges through the warpath already well-trod by Taken and its numerous offspring, Skarsgård simply occupies space onscreen. If acting is music, he is noise, a series of vaguely related sounds. Leo graciously cedes approximately half of the narrative attention to a pair of American surgeons, who have the decency to spruce Jones’ stultifying dialogue up with a bit of their own flavor. Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux appear to be doing everything in their estimable powers to have a bit of fun from under their ridiculous hairpieces (a robust full-face moustache and young Steve Jobs wig, respectively). The two are playfully homoerotic pals and partners-in-crime – literally, they sew gangsters up on the down-low for easy money – who have something to do with the mystery of Leo’s missing paramour, and that’s not discretion for the sake of the spoiler-averse. Their relation to the wider mechanisms of plot are not clear. Not merely tonally incoherent, the film’s denouement utterly defies comprehension; the barrage of inexplicable twists that closes out the film contains one of the more unexpected and staggeringly mishandled depictions of pedophilia in recent memory. But after horror, sci-fi is the genre in which the portal to that rarefied realm of transcendent awfulness opens widest. When it becomes apparent that Mute will not be a great achievement in the usual sense, which happens after five minutes or so, the hope becomes that it will end up one of those intimately personal messes that driven auteurs sometimes vomit out. In dribs and drabs during Theroux and Rudd’s strand of story, Jones skims the heights of lunacy that make The Fifth Element and Jupiter Ascending fascinating in their flaws. But these windows close all too quickly, and the expanses of deadening stasis between them are too wide. If Mute were a better film, it would provide a shining example of the Netflix machine functioning exactly as designed: write creators with vision a check, let them do their thing, and trust that the lack of oversight will translate to a product with integrity. Jones has spent 15 years trying to get this production off the ground, no small feat in an industry that has all but abandoned mid-budget genre pictures, and Netflix should come off looking like a guardian angel to visionaries frustrated by the studio system. The problem is that Jones couldn’t hold up his end of the bargain and deliver work that rates even as “interesting”, the last salvation of flagrantly terrible movies. (How his post-digital Berlin could simultaneously look so expensive and so cheap may be a Zen riddle.) Instead, most disappointingly of all, the volleys of overindulgent inertia mount a convincing argument against the very class of release in sadly short supply at present. Watching Jones passively bob in the deep end of his imagination, a viewer longs for the compulsory baseline competence of the big studios – anything but the blandness masquerading as future cult bait. Mute is now available to stream on Netflix"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/21/youtube-florida-teenagers-actors-videos-conspiracy-theories-promotion-results","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T21:10:43Z","webTitle":"YouTube promotes conspiracy videos attacking Florida's shooting survivors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/21/youtube-florida-teenagers-actors-videos-conspiracy-theories-promotion-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/21/youtube-florida-teenagers-actors-videos-conspiracy-theories-promotion-results","fields":{"headline":"YouTube promotes conspiracy videos attacking Florida's shooting survivors","bodyText":"YouTube is promoting conspiracy theory videos claiming that survivors of last week’s Florida school shooting are “crisis actors”, in the latest example of technology companies failing to tackle disinformation. Many of the top results for searches for David Hogg, a student survivor of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, are videos from alternative news channels suggesting he was an actor hired by gun control advocates to push an anti-gun agenda. One such clip briefly became YouTube’s No 1 trending video on Wednesday. YouTube later removed the video for violating its policy on harassment and bullying, as the platform doesn’t have a specific policy for misinformation. “I am not a crisis actor,” Hogg told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “I’m someone who had to witness this and live through this and I continue to be having to do that.” Hogg is one of many students from the school to make it clear that “thoughts and prayers” alone won’t cut it in the aftermath of such a tragedy. He and others, including the 18-year-old Emma Gonzales, who made a widely shared speech attacking the president directly, have used their own social media channels and interviews with traditional media outlets to call for gun control. Rightwing and alternative news sites including Gateway Pundit and Infowars have responded by attacking the students, with some using the fact that Hogg’s father works for the FBI to speculate that he could be part of a broader anti-Trump conspiracy. The attacks on the Florida schoolchildren have been amplified on social media, with Russian troll networks hijacking hashtags and feeding divisiveness over the gun control debate. While conspiracy theories about mass shootings are nothing new in America, some fear that the algorithms that govern our information ecosystem can be gamed in a way that exacerbates the problem. As these conspiracy theory videos and articles rack up clicks, they bubble to the top of search rankings, drowning out more reputable media outlets. In the days after the Florida shooting, it appeared that YouTube was having some success in keeping conspiracy theories out of its top results on some of the more generic search terms such as “Florida shooting” and “Parkland school”. However, results for names like David Hogg highlight the enormous challenge the platform faces. “If we think about a taxonomy of content that’s adjudicated on social media –copyrighted material, sexually explicit content, hate speech all the way to misinformation – I would say that misinformation is the most difficult for platforms to contend with,” said Sarah T Roberts, a UCLA professor who studies large-scale moderation of online platforms. YouTube’s challenge is potentially greater because of the way that it allows creators to generate a cut of advertising revenue from popular videos. “It’s pretty much a neon sign saying ‘upload here’ to anyone with a fringe conspiracy mindset,” said Roberts. “To what extent does the platform profit off that?” A YouTube spokeswoman told the Guardian that it started rolling out changes to better surface authoritative news sources in search results, particularly around breaking news events. “We’ve seen improvements, but in some circumstances these changes are not working quickly enough,” she said, adding that the company had also updated its harassment policy to include hoax videos that target the victims of tragedies. If platforms such as YouTube don’t take this challenge seriously, users will stop trusting them and start to drift away, said Joan Donovan, of the group Data &amp; Society, who recently co-authored a report about content moderation after “fake news”. “These kind of conspiracy theories are easily mapped. You can see the same people sharing #pizzagate are sharing the crisis actor conspiracy theory. There are things that can be done,” Donovan added. The problem is not a new one for Google’s video platform. After the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people and injured hundreds more, videos claiming the attack was a “hoax” and a “false flag” spread rapidly on YouTube, earning millions of views. Following criticism from survivors and victims’ relatives over the prominence of hoax claims, YouTube tweaked its search algorithms in an effort to better promote reputable sources. However, when a gunman killed 26 people at a small-town Texas church the following month, it was clear that the changes had not been effective. Search results on both Google and YouTube amplified the false news that Devin Kelley, the man accused of the massacre, was linked to anti-fascist and leftwing movements. At the time a YouTube spokesperson admitted the site had problems and said: “There is still more work to do, but we’re making progress.” YouTube users upload more than 400 hours of video content to the site each hour, and content is typically only removed for violation of its policies after being flagged by a user or caught by an artificial intelligence system at the point of upload. Once flagged, content is reviewed by human moderators. In December, Google announced it was hiring thousands of new moderators after facing widespread criticism for allowing child abuse videos and other offensive content to flourish on YouTube.

At 89, Ivory is the oldest ever winner of an Academy award; it is his first win after three previous nominations in the best director category, for the films A Room with a View, Howard’s End, and The Remains of the Day. Wearing a shirt emblazoned with the face of Call Me By Your Name star Timothée Chalamet, Ivory thanked his deceased Merchant-Ivory partners Ismail Merchant and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala as well as André Aciman. Call Me By Your Name tells the story of a life-changing romance between Elio and Oliver, which unspools over the course of one sun-soaked summer in Italy. Part gay romance, part coming-of-age tale, the film, directed by Luca Guadagnino, earned accolades across the awards circuit for both its screenplay and the performance of Chalamet – a first-time best actor nominee at this year’s Oscars. Call Me By Your Name emerged victorious over the screenplays for the films Mudbound, Logan, Molly’s Game and The Disaster Artist. Aciman’s novel, published in 2007, won the prize for gay fiction at the Lambda literary awards. Ivory, who also produced the film and had originally planned to direct it, had previously taken home honours for his screenplay at the Writer’s Guild of America, Critic’s Choice Awards, and the Baftas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/live/2018/feb/21/brit-awards-2018-follow-all-the-buildup-performances-and-winners-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T22:48:30Z","webTitle":"All the wins and performances from the Brit awards 2018 – as they happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2018/feb/21/brit-awards-2018-follow-all-the-buildup-performances-and-winners-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/live/2018/feb/21/brit-awards-2018-follow-all-the-buildup-performances-and-winners-live","fields":{"headline":"All the wins and performances from the Brit awards 2018 – as they happened","bodyText":"The pizza’s congealed, we avoided having to swig a full bottle in the drinking game, and Ed Sheeran’s going home (almost) empty-handed (save for the one award he already knew he’d won). The Brits 2018 is over. For anyone who hasn’t been following our intrepid liveblogging, here are the results in brief: British male: Stormzy British female: Dua Lipa British group: Gorillaz Breakthrough artist: Dua Lipa Global Success award: Ed Sheeran British single: Rag’n’Bone Man, Human British album: Stormzy, Gang Signs &amp; Prayer British video: Harry Styles, Sign of the Times International male: Kendrick Lamar International female: Lorde International group: Foo Fighters Critics’ choice: Jorja Smith British producer: Steve Mac There will be more Brits coverage from the Guardian’s music team tonight and tomorrow: Alexis Petridis’s rundown of the night’s proceedings will be live soon, along with a digest of what we’ve learned and a roundup of all the live performance reviews. For now, thanks very much for joining us, and effusive congratulations to everyone who commented on the female performers’ legs and asked where all the real music was. And breathe. It’s all over. Here’s the breadth of Twitter’s responses to Stormzy’s performance and calling out of Theresa May over her handling of the Grenfell Tower fire. Last year, he debuted the really rather good Shape of You remix with Ed Sheeran. This year, it’s time for the man they call The Problem, Stiff Chocolate, Wicked Skengman, or – if you’re even a little bit white – just plain Stormzy, to take to the stage himself. He does so under pouring rain to deliver Blinded By Your Grace Pt 2, backed by a gospel choir – the second of the evening! Stormzy’s though, dressed in the balaclavas of his album cover, is just that little bit gnarlier than Justin Timberlake’s. Then comes perhaps the most electric segment of the entire show, as he strips off his soaked top and delivers a freestyle that both revels in “black girl magic” and Daniel Kaluuya’s Bafta win, and savages the Daily Mail and Theresa May over Grenfell. He swings the anger into a ferocious Big For Your Boots, stalking around the stage with pent-up rage bursting out in kettle-whistles of steam, rounding off the Brits with a blast of pure energy. I love: the sound of breaking glass on Stormzy’s table as he and his cohort celebrate Gang Signs &amp; Prayer winning best British album, and the fact that his suit is long gone (he’s about to perform). Once more, he thanks God, and acknowledges how strange some people might find that in this day and age: “But if you know God, you know this is all him,” he says, continuing to thank album producer Fraser T Smith, his #Merky crew, his family – all here tonight – and admit to how much his debut album took out of him. “I’ve never worked on something like this in my life, never given my entire being, my entire emotion,” he says. “I didn’t have anything left after.” This is thoroughly, thoroughly deserved for Stormzy, whose debut became the first grime album to debut at No 1 on the album charts (and on his own independent label, #Merky, to boot) last February. The Brits’ efforts to atone for the #BritsSoWhite debacle of 2016 (they diversified their voting academy to bring in 17% BAME panellists – still a long way off decent representation) are evident this evening, though you’d hope Gang Signs &amp; Prayer would have triumphed any year, especially in a fairly weak category such as this: only J Hus’ Common Sense could even hope of touching it. Still, this makes tonight an absolute shocker for Sheeran, whose album ÷, lest we forget, was so big that the Official Charts Company had to change the singles chart rules after its 17 tracks all hit the Top 20 at once last March. Jack Whitehall is claiming it’s “carnage” at the O2. It’s unclear whether he means genuine anarchy, or, y’know, things getting a bit out of hand at the end-of-term ball. Anyway, if it’s the former, please can ITV endeavour to actually show a bit of the mess during next year’s show. Nile Rodgers calls it “a vibe”! He can’t read the teleprompter. It’s fine, nobody’s paying attention any more. The Brits hasn’t come in for accusations of sexism in the same way as the Grammys, mostly because unlike its US counterpart it still divides categories along gender lines, meaning that the disparity in recipients isn’t as pronounced. Still, fans are noticing some inconsistencies when it comes to the platforms offered to male and female performers: There was a worry that thanks to spreading herself across TV, film and music, Rita Ora would never excel at any of them, and instead be mere eye candy for time-poor gossip columnists – a snack of all trades, if you will. But happily, she guested on the only good Avicii single ever, and released Anywhere, which is like a tropical house version of a forgotten Sound of Music song – ie pair it with a jug of woo-woo and all is well in the world. She performs it after a brief blast of Your Song, dressed in a white tracksuit, perched on a pink geometric stage whose designer has just maybe, just maybe seen Solange’s live tour. Songs with choruses that don’t feature the singer doing any actual singing are a bit dangerous live, but Ora is enough of a pro by now to command the audience with a well-placed hair flick. Finally in the megamix is For You, her Fifty Shades duet with Liam Payne, which on paper is an economy-class version of Zayn and Taylor’s preceding soundtrack effort, on record is something Emeli Sandé rejected for being too Emeli Sandé, but at the Brits is surprisingly heartfelt and head-rushing. Maybe it’s the Kronenbourg I’m drinking at my desk? Her new single Proud, a return to her earlier, defiantly B-list roots, is rather conspicuous by its absence. The last award left for him to win is British album. To refresh your memory, the contenders are... Dua Lipa: Dua Lipa Ed Sheeran: ÷ J Hus: Common Sense Rag’n’Bone Man: Human Stormzy: Gang Signs &amp; Prayer This is voted for by fans, of course, meaning essentially this category was battle of the ex-One Direction members, with Liam Payne, Zayn Malik (plus Taylor Swift) and Harry Styles all in the final five. Each video had good things going for it: Payne’s Strip That Down wasn’t nearly as gross and sleazy as the song’s lyrics (though it was boring), and Malik’s I Don’t Wanna Live Forever was a literal translation of the lyrics, which is always good in a pop video; but the promo for Styles’s debut solo single was effortless and elegant – plus it gave us this timeless image of his stunt double flying through the air, wearing a horrifying mask of Styles’s beautiful face. He’s not here to collect it and he hasn’t even sent a video message, because Styles is the cool one and 1D sat through more than their fair share of tedious Brit awards during their lifespan. Tonight’s surprise guests arrives amid a European tour that is frankly incredible, where vituperative broadsides against police brutality are paired with films of him achieving karmic alignment inside a glowing vagina. There seems to be a false start with his performance – and maybe a second and third one – as he begins a rendition of Feel lying above a Lamborghini in a glass case. Ironic wolf whistles sound around the arena, but it coheres eventually. “This is another satire by Kendrick Lamar” reads the screen, as he segues into a performance of his verse from Rich the Kid’s New Freezer, with cheerleaders filing on to do the track’s viral dance craze. (If you want to do it at home, adopt the neck motion of an aggressively inquisitive, sass-talking ostrich and brace for the whiplash.) Inside the box, Rich the Kid smashes up the Lambo with a baseball bat. Well, what is it a satire of? The relentless covetousness of rap? Perhaps. Whatever it is, Kendrick just raised brows everywhere – those in the crowd, those watching at home, and the Brits as a whole from middle to high. It’s time for yet another ad break so let’s have a look at Twitter: Este Haim is out here claiming her title as the true Brits 2018 victor. A not-terribly-well-looking Elton John introduces the global success award via video message. Then Ronnie Wood arrives to give out the gong itself, obliquely referencing his notorious barney with Brandon Block at the 2000 Brit awards. For his part, Sheeran gives credit to the record labels he works with around the world, and the “girl” who coordinates that work. He did this at the Q awards last October, too, referring to his British publicist as a “girl”. Come on, dude. I mean, call a spade a spade – a sympathy spade. It’s like giving bin bags an award for “most effective rubbish-disposal vessel”, or custard a nod for “yellowest sweet gravy”. I wonder what wacky comedy purposes he uses his Brits for in Sheeran Towers. My guesses: paint stirrer, foam roller, earwax-removal chisel. Nice to see DRAM up there with Gorillaz. Here’s a reminder that he brought us the greatest album artwork of all time. Singing through the feathers, he’s perhaps spitting at being rather overlooked here – though he is still, Rag’n’Bone Man-style, eligible for next year’s awards – Sam Smith delivers Too Good for Goodbyes. This is his masterpiece thus far – wryly catty at himself, his top line has the kind of circuitous, searching melody that returns with absolute logic to its starting point, perfectly clear-eyed in his own romantic self-destruction. His slight lisp is his secret timbral weapon, and he can’t help a little swagger as he strides out; on his own, marooned from his backing singers, he still manages to completely command this vast stage. He encourages the crowd to clap on beat, something I generally think destroys the song in question, but here he turns it into a far more powerful gospel moment than Timberlake did with a massive choir earlier on. Underrated – though unlikely to be remembered amid the melee of next year’s pop. Cartoon band member Murdoc delivers a video speech, while Damon Albarn and the other human members appear on stage for the evening’s most sodden moment! “I’ve got one thing to say,” says Albarn, quite possibly slurring, “and it’s about this country.” What follows teeters on the brink of addressing Brexit and cultural colonialism, but never really goes anywhere. “This country is, believe it or not, quite a small little thing, right, but it’s full of – it’s a lovely place, and it’s part of a beautiful world – but what I wanna say is don’t let it become isolated, don’t let yourselves become cut off, considering our size we do incredible things in music. We’ve got a real spirit and a real soul, and don’t let politics get in the way of all of that shit, alright?” A remarkable moment, not only because ITV’s judicious swear-bleepers manage to miss Albarn’s last word, but because Albarn – on the cusp of his 50th birthday – manages to recreate the shambles of a standard Brits winner’s speech from his 90s heyday. Sometimes it truly takes an elder statesman to show the young ones how it’s done, yeah? Oh God, it’s not over. First, Little Simz has her moment on the mic. Then Savages’ Jehnny Beth, who doesn’t seem quite clear on why she’s up there. “Best British … band?” Albarn tries to grab the mic again but – thankfully – ITV’s censors have recovered their sense. And! Here’s Jack Whitehall again. “I really don’t want this to be an Adele moment,” he says. “I’d have let them speak all night if it was my choice.” Then a hammy stage whisper: “I think he was talking about Brexit!” SOME FACTS: since this award was minted in 1977 (disappearing until 1982), there have been 15 sets of best British group nominees that haven’t contained a single woman. No British group category has ever contained more than two acts featuring female members – until this year, when the xx, Wolf Alice and London Grammar were all up for the award. This is exciting, I thought. Progress, I thought. Obviously a cartoon band led by Damon Albarn wins it. SOME SLIGHTLY LESS COMPELLING FACTS: This is Gorillaz’s first successful British group nomination after nods in 2002, 2006 and 2011. Ariana Grande was due to anchor a tribute to the victims of the Manchester Arena terror attack, but pulled out on doctor’s orders, so Liam Gallagher took her place. The same Liam Gallagher that told this paper earlier this week, re the Brits, that “they can fuck off if they think I’m going to go there and clap some fucking idiot … Get down there with your little fucking suit on and put your arm around Stormzy and Rag’n’Bone Man, do all this bollocks? That ain’t me, mate.” Well, even Liam, whose ego has its own magnetic field, isn’t above swallowing those words for people from his home city. The lyrics, of wanting to live and not wanting to die, are painfully poignant, especially set again a spartan acoustic backing. “Now is not the time to cry, now’s the time to find out why” – a fitting note of defiance, even political fervour, and of course the title lyric is wretchedly fitting: the people who lost their lives in Manchester will live forever in the minds of those who knew them. I can’t remember hearing such a raw, unadorned Liam Gallagher performance. He stalks off stage in classic loping style, having delivered a perfect, anti-sentimental tribute. Ariana Grande was due to fly from the US to the UK for this, until doctors told her she couldn’t travel. Instead, Liam Gallagher is performing the Oasis classic Live Forever, introduced by Gary Barlow. The battle for best video, voted by fans, is really heating up online. There’s a lot of emotive pleas from Directioners for their three horses in the race, like this: Versus the steely-eyed, bean-counting military precision of Little Mix fans: Solid presenting from Ellie Goulding and Adwoa Aboah, looking profoundly awkward as they reference Time’s Up, and Goulding makes a veiled reference to Grammys president Neil Portnoy’s comments that female artists needed to “step up” that absolutely nobody will understand. Anyway, Lorde! A video message! I love how swiftly she translated from morose teen to utterly loveable New Zealand mum. Here are the things Lorde has been doing instead of coming to London for the Brit awards: reading interviews with Greta Gerwig and Florence Welch, rehearsing for tour, giving out useful acne care advice on Instagram, and trying to persuade Louis Theroux to go and see Incredibles 2 with her at the cinema. Can you blame her? The Grammys disrespected her, and her salty response – a well chosen Jenny Holzer quote pinned to her dress coupled with on-camera swigs from a contraband hip flask – made her feelings on the sham of awards ceremonies perfectly clear. Still, the recognition is welcome, especially since Melodrama sank like a stone commercially (it’s not in the Top 100 UK albums; for context, Céline Dion’s greatest hits is at No 99) for reasons that I will not understand until my dying day. It’s a masterpiece – what’s wrong with people. I would have liked to hear Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech though fear I may have died under the weight of Ponderous Thinkpieces in its wake. If you’re wondering about that reference to Jesy Little Mix’s Jamaican accent, familiarise yourself thus. It really is something. Dua’s second award of the night. Fair dos, especially given that “cor hasn’t she slogged away” is the de facto narrative around her at this point, but you can’t help but feel that her competitors – particularly Dave and J Hus – had to fight a bit harder to swim up pop’s toxic stream. Who are these children! Barron Trump? The cast of Stranger Things 3? Oh no, it’s little Gary and Susan Lipa, here for big sis Dua to show them that, as she promised in the liner notes to her album, magic is real! Foo Fighters are a weird band to be playing, because despite them having won four Brits (including one tonight), gone many times platinum and being able to headline any festival on the planet (even some really weird electronic one because everyone ultimately quite likes Dave Grohl), they haven’t written a really big tune since The Pretender, and that was more than a decade ago. What are they even going to play? The answer is The Sky is a Neighbourhood, performed in a recreation of the song’s video where the band perch atop a house – it was written after Dave Grohl watched a Neil deGrasse Tyson documentary and wanted to write a song about “when you look up at the night sky, you realise that you’re not only part of the universe, but the universe is part of us”. Stop hogging that reefer, Grohl! It’s big, chugging soulful blues-rock, but is it likely to ever break the top half of a best-of? Probs not, but they still bring a measure of rawk gravitas. This was meant to be his night after going home almost empty handed from the Grammys, but so far he’s been pipped to British single and British male solo artist. There’s still British video and album to play for, but it’d be un grand scandale if we went home without either of those. (We already know he’s won the Global Success award.) But a slightly nicer one this time. Is Ed Sheeran married? People are looking at the ring on his finger and loudly wondering things like this. We shouldn’t really swear that much on here so I’m using this message by a fairly random Twitter user to express my thoughts. You’d never have predicted this one given that he was in the country on tour when the rest of the nominees aren’t, but leaving behind awards ceremony cynicism for a sec, obviously he’s the worthy winner: a key social voice, musical innovator and – as anyone who caught his brilliant UK tour last week knows – a very funny man. (Good job he’s not wearing his white dressing gown tour outfit, though, otherwise there’d be some awkward backstage moments with Little Mix’s Leigh-Anne.) Kudos, Kung Fu Kenny. THIS SONG CAME OUT IN 2016. Far be it for me to suggest that Rag’n’Bone Man is a record industry plant, but he’s definitely a record industry plant. Still, we have the pleasure of hearing the noted orator’s acceptance speech – completely inconsequential until he swears, ITV mutes the audio and that’s one swig. Britain’s biggest pop star continues to be a confounding figure, impossible to truly hate or love – he has more pros and cons than an oversubscribed prison. On the pro side: everyman charm, nifty with a loop pedal, Thinking Out Loud being actually a really nice choice for a first dance at a wedding, and Shape of You even though I actually never need to hear it again. On the con side: being a glamour vacuum, the creepiness of casting too-attractive women in his videos who definitely aren’t his childhood sweetheart, and a sense that he would make Balinese gamelan instrumentals if it meant he opened up a lucrative Balinese gamelan market and got the Balinese gamelan Christmas No 1. So which side does this performance of Supermarket Flowers fall? Well, it’s a song about his dead nan, so not even this jaded hack can lay into him too much. It is a pretty rote ballad, but then again some of the best ballads are, and for every person that the “You were an angel in the shape of my mum” lyric nauseates, another will be reduced to helpless blubbing. And Sheeran’s detail (“John says he’d drive then put his hand on my cheek”) is the kind of thing that lifts up this from generic emotional manipulation. Not half as bold as his performance last year, but after selling as many albums as he has, he’s earned a little rest on his laurels. Dermot O’Leary: “I can’t help thinking there’s just something lacking from this year.” Emma Willis: “Female co-host?” That’s two swigs, per Brew Rules. A couple of years ago there was a sense that Dua Lipa was like the word “fetch” in Mean Girls, ie just not going to happen. After her third single Mwah barely scraped the Top 30 I was sure I could hear knives being sharpened in the Warner Bros kitchens – but then Scared to be Lonely arrived, followed by New Rules, giving jilted lovers an entire mope-to-sass axis to work through, and she went supernova. Her aesthetic – as if the creative directors of Missguided, Pretty Little Thing, BooHoo teamed up Avengers-style to make the most zeitgeist-pretty look possible – helped. She’s performing – what else? – New Rules, dressed like a sexy Moschino-coveting toreador and backed by a small army of female relationship advisers. She stalks her way through a series of neon-hued, no-fucks-given tableaux on the way to breakup nirvana, and, given the song trades in her stronger, deeper register, her performance is utterly assured. If this doesn’t win single of the year then we’re getting some placards made up. Yer da is loving Dua Lipa: I definitely heard someone say this but confess I was paying closer attention to my pizza than the screen at that moment. Just in case Jack Whitehall wasn’t posh enough, here’s Anna Friel and Damian Lewis to present the award for best international group, which always feels like a bit of an afterthought. The Foos win. “Ayyyyy! Ayyyyy!” Grohl roars. For a band so dedicated to rock’n’roll, the Foo Fighters’ stock in trade is that notoriously rebellious quality: unstinting reliability. Dave Grohl and co have won this four times now (2008, 2012, 2015) and been nominated twice more (1996, 2003). Why they’ve won for their staid real music, I have no idea, but it’s hard to make a case for any of the contenders: LCD Soundsystem will forevermore be the band that cried wolf, the less said about last year’s interminable Arcade Fire album, the better, and what on earth happened with Haim’s disastrous second album campaign? The Killers should have split up half a decade ago, but at least they can laugh at themselves. Este from Haim, fresh from delivering very ostentatious bass faces, quietly upstaged Cheryl and Liam’s sex chat: Pretty much this: First the Grammys, now this! Why do awards voters hate Sheeran so much? Ginger prejudice? Proximity to Taylor Swift? God, this is awkward isn’t it? We’re having a good time, aren’t we? It’s like the visual equivalent of one of Guardian Weekend’s 4/10 Blind Dates. HANG ON A MINUTE: who knew that Liam Payne and Cheryl Cole would actually provide the night’s most brazen moment. “Is there a safe word?” Jack Whitehall asks, trying to do a saucy riff on Payne’s appearance on the 50 Shades Freed soundtrack. “She knows that,” Payne replies, gesturing to Cole. “Don’t stop,” she replies back without missing a beat. Jack Whitehall regrets ever asking this. My skin is crawling, either in revulsion or admiration, or maybe the effects of the drinking game starting to set in. “Don’t go anywhere!” A surprising snub for Sheeran, given that the Brits looked set to shower Britain’s most business-savvy busker in bonuses after the Grammys ignored him almost completely. Sure, he has his millions, his devoted fans, the approval of his peers, but Sheeran goes about his work with Wolf of Wall Street-worthy ruthlessness, so he’ll certainly be kicking a filing cabinet over this missed sales target. Just imagine how many little blue “Best British Male!” stickers Atlantic will have to peel off the bumper edition of the already overstuffed ÷ that they were inevitably going to announce tomorrow. Regardless: the only good choice prevailed: Stormzy’s first Brit award! He’s the rare male solo artist dressed for the occasion! Loyle Carner’s great, but not really at this level yet; Liam Gallagher would make a better host than recipient (please, Brits, hear my prayer), and Rag’n’Bone Man reminds me far too much of all the earnest “blues” “men” I witnessed performing in Cornish beach bars as a teenager. Plus, nobody loves winning awards as much as Stormzy, though he seems taken aback! Maybe later he’ll even update the Mobo-referencing lyrics to Shut Up in tribute. Last year’s Critics’ Choice award winner, Rag’n’Bone Man, duets with this year’s, Jorja Smith, in an autocratic vision of music industry synergy. After three years of reliably predicting which tremulously emotional white man would be clutched to the bosoms of Asda album buyers (Tom Odell, Sam Smith, James Bay), there was a wobble in 2016 when the tremulously emotional white man Jack Garratt became as culturally relevant as a blacked-up morris dancer. The Brits don’t want that to happen again, so the phenomenally successful Rag’n’Bone Man is being used as a kind of Trojan bear to smuggle Jorja Smith into the consciousness of the ITV faithful. Rag’n’Bone Man begins with a very stark version of Skin, backed just by piano – a format which of course delivered major chills via Adele when she famously performed Someone Like You here in 2011. Smith arrives, and adds some hickory smoke to the campfire song. There’s some admirably delicate falsetto from Mr N Bone Man as a brass section swells behind him, flames lick up the set and a full band kicks in. Smith acquits herself well but certainly doesn’t upstage her Critics’ Choice forbear, who gives a typically robust performance. Makes you wonder, paired with that Justin performance: is this going to be the moodiest, woodsiest Brits ever? An insider tells the Guardian that receiving the critics’ choice award isn’t just a matter of the record company putting a new sticker on the deluxe re-release of your album, but a solemn ceremony in which the winner is anointed with the blood of the Eurythmics. Yes New Rules is a massive banger and yes Lipa has had a massive year (she’s the first British female solo artist to be nominated for five awards) but come on, really this is an award for the music industry for actually giving a young female solo artist the time to develop her music and style without panicking and sticking her in a room with Zedd, Marshmello or any of the other tepidly reliable EDM cyborgs. (We’ll forget the short-lived career wibble that was that Martin Garrix collaboration.) Still, to be fair to Lipa, she’s pure zeitgeist in a way that none of the other nominees are (let’s not forget her other big award nod this week – she’s up for Music Week’s best music and brand partnership award for her Foot Locker campaign), even if Jessie Ware or Paloma Faith almost definitely had more fiery acceptance speeches up their glittery sleeves. Still though, good effort! After reeling off a long list of names, Lipa started the night with a fairly bold statement (though I think that’s one swig, per the drinking game): I wanna thank every single female that has been on this stage before me that has given girls like me – not just in the music industry but girls in society – something to look up to, and has allowed us to dream this big. Here’s to more women on these stages, more women winning awards and more women taking over the world. Also loving Paloma noticing the camera is on her and flinging her head back in delight. Here’s what Justin’s choir looked like from down on the floor, from our roving/wine-quaffing reporter Nadia. Kylie’s Can’t Get You Out of My Head was released three years before Millie Bobby Brown was born, FYI. The public vote on the British video award, so let’s head over to YouTube to see if we can glean any clues as to the winner from the comments section: Ed Sheeran: Shape of You Views: 3,266,983,331 “I love it so much that this video is not about sexualizing a woman’s body but it’s seriously about boxing but it’s also very sweet ” – Irana van Oostrum “Can i get a like bc i don’t have a Valentine ” – Bente Hermans “What kind of RON WEASLEY is that? XDXDXDXD ” – Ricks Little Mix: Touch Views: 236,072,252 “I will never ever get tired of this song. It’s a bop🔥 ” – Shannon Braxton “Jesys voice has a beautiful vibration in it 😩❤️” – Hi There “When you’re dancing to this this and trying to do your makeup at the same time and get mascara on your face😒😕 ” – McKayla Wright Harry Styles: Sign of the Times Views: 300,982,288 “This is one of the coolest music videos I’ve ever seen. Pure art. When he runs on the water..... holy shit ” – Fucas101 “This entire video could be my fucking aesthetic!! ” – piece of crap “Y’all laughing when Harry flies. Flying somewhere with a beautiful view would be a dream come true. ” – Bleach Liam Payne: Strip That Down Views: 243,960,661 “This is way too similar to “It wasn’t me” by Shaggy ” – Maria Chiara Scatassa “Your cute I would strip that down when ever you want me to. I made a dance that matches this song ” – Holly Amos “someones trying to be David Beckham me thinks!! How laughable … songs pretty bad too ” – Tracieew Zayn and Taylor Swift: I Don’t Wanna Live Forever Views: 452,451,798 “Want my children kidz to hit the gym for those pain joints just remember the execerise mom taught and my sons and daughters I need u ” – Navilin Samuel “I think the music video is a little disappointing. ” – Eunice EH “Zayn has such glamorous eye lashes 🤷🏻‍♀️ ” – Kaatie 01 So there you have it. Based on this 100% scientific survey my money is on Harry Styles. The last time Timberlake played the Brits was in 2013, he came promoting a critically derided new album with a handful of kickass singles, so this should feel like Groundhog Day. He comes primed for big-stage performance after his Super Bowl show a couple of weeks back, a pop mashup that was almost avant-garde in its insane complexity (or maybe just a bit of a mess) – he didn’t actually seem to do much singing, choosing instead to make occasional personal trainer “hup!” noises and bounding around like a funky televangelist. So what do we have here? He begins here with Midnight Summer Jam, which takes Bruno Mars’s “shameless disco pastiche” baton and runs it into his own comfort zone – this is classic Timberlake: light, unthreateningly sexy and nimble of foot. He pulls the tempo down, triggers some live vocal samples (hey, people like it when Sheeran uses his loop pedal, right?) before bringing on country star Chris Stapleton for their duet Say Something. This is the cornerstone of the plaid-wearing “woods” bits of his album Man of the Woods – and while the wheel remains very much round and turn-y, it’s sturdy and satisfyingly harmonised. As noted last year, during the 1975’s performance, soulful white performers will bring out a gospel choir at the Brits on a hair trigger and so it proves here, but it works. If this is going to be soulful, dignified, emotive Brits to match the Time’s Up protests, then it’s a good basis to build off. Jack Whitehall has all the gravitas of a student union president telling the new intake of freshers that “we work hard and play hard at Warwick”. Enjoyed his ribbing of Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith, but enjoyed more the fact that his weak Little Mix diss went down like a lead balloon. Just thought you’d like to know that Z-list celebrities are already turning up at the afterparty. Chris Stapleton: a name that means nothing to British viewers. Timbo might as well have got someone who works at Carphone Warehouse up there for all the applause poor Chris got. Anyway, the viewers (music critics) are loving it! Jack “did you know I’m posh” Whitehall doing a skit with Big Shaq was as inevitable as Annie Lennox getting a nod for British female in the 1990s. Is his big coat also a surreptitious Talking Heads tribute? Probably not. Also “uckers” being blanked out by ITV means one swig for anyone following the drinking game. Anyway, here’s Justin Timberlake onstage! Earlier today, reliably acerbic commentator Peter Robinson was rummaging through the Popjustice archives and turned up a programme from a Brits ceremony of yore. First up is the then BPI chairman wishing that more young people were in work so that the industry’s “natural customer was flush with cash to buy our records”. Given today’s unemployment stats, I’m looking forward to the economic analysis from the show floor. Nadia has bumped into Jess Glynne, above, about her decision to wear a white rose. She says: I’m wearing a rose to show solidarity with the Time’s Up movement. Women in music should use their platform to help enact change because you’re a role model to so many people. We’ve all experienced sexism. In the past I’ve been shut down, not had my opinions listened to. So I would say to all young women: stand for something, and believe in yourself. The night’s biggest winner is evidently the person behind Mastercard’s Twitter for these seamless brand integrations. Our reporter Nadia Khomani is sat on actual table in the actual Brit awards while we look like the very picture of pasty journalists under our office strip lighting. Here’s what’s being advised booze-wise. Remember, don’t drink too much, or you might end up having a rather slipshod argument with Ronnie Wood in front of millions of people. Rich the Kid has posted this backstage, with Ed Sheeran. Given the rapper guests on a currently hot track with another certain rapper whose name rhymes with Schmendrick Shlamar, the rumour mill is going into overdrive about potential surprise performances ... The performers have got their own emojis for this evening; in lieu of an official avatar, Anne Marie has gone for the next best thing, and come dressed as the dancing lady emoji. Confirmation from BPI boss Geoff Taylor: Ariana Grande was meant to fly over to participate in a tribute to victims of the Manchester Arena bombing, but was ordered not to travel by her doctor. It’s speculated that Liam Gallagher will take her place … More schlebs! First up the xx, who have finally been taught to smile for the camera with very neatly varying levels of success. Jesy from Little Mix, after showing the make-up lady a Kylie Jenner Insta and saying “that”. Sam Smith, who is a bit matchy-matchy with Justin Timberlake colour-wise, and who has really let his stubble go to seed. Jess Glynne, fresh from appearing in a club scene in a 1993 film starring Janeane Garofalo and Matt Dillon as computer hackers. So far, everyone on the red carpet seems to have incorporated a white rose – either a flower or a pin – somewhere on their outfit, in keeping with the Brits’ suggestion to show solidarity with the Time’s Up movement. Here’s the pin: And here’s Ed Sheeran wearing a big white flower. Do look out for the moment later where he changes out of his nice suit to perform in his skivvies. Some more red carpet arrivals. If you look closely enough you can see Paloma Faith and one of Clean Bandit reflected in Stormzy’s suit. Ed Sheeran, looking rather matte in comparison. “I’ll have your cocoa ready for you after the show ends, pet.” Haim, going for an “Ophelia cosplay” tip. Justin Timberlake, searching deep into our collective souls for someone who liked Man of the Woods. We’re going to get through these next few hours together via the solidarity of the liveblog and possibly the intake of alcohol. Should you wish to make things interesting, here are the rules to the Guardian’s Brit awards drinking game: One swig: Incredibly vague “political” statements or solemn acknowledgement of “the issues facing our industry” Rag’n’Bone Man being lost for words Agonising show floor “banter” Artists attempting to leave the stage in the wrong direction Shots of Liam Gallagher to make things more interesting Jack Whitehall reminding everyone that he’s posh Two swigs: Mentions of Time’s Up, #MeToo, industry sexism or racism Dancing house (or similar) falling off/through the stage ITV’s wildly overcautious sound blackout whenever there’s the faintest hint of a swear Sour mention of James Corden for nobbing off to America Pop culture “parody” The whole bottle: Any artist climbing on a table, pointing into the assembled record executives and naming names If you want to suggest more in the comments, I’ll update the game accordingly. Celebs have already arrived, and if Dua Lipa, Rita Ora and Perrie Edwards are anything to go by, the look is very much “upstaging the bride”. Fatted on pizza and a responsible amount of beer, we are here to bring you all the action from tonight’s Brit awards. Maybe action is too strong a word – after the political atmosphere at the recent Golden Globes, Grammys and Baftas ceremonies, the Brits, despite its white-rose pin initiative, looks less like a protest and more like Good Old Fashioned British Entertainment. Expect: Bumbling “Ooh it’s a bit awkward that I’m posh isn’t it” “humour” c/o newly minted host Jack Whitehall. A lap of honour for British entertainment’s greatest contributor to the GDP, Ed Sheeran. Custom emoji for each performer, because never mind the entertainment industry’s ongoing “issues”, here’s Rita Ora with a droopy digital pout!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/feb/21/lloyds-bank-useful-know-what-corbyn-labour-leader-really-thinks","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T19:16:16Z","webTitle":"It would be useful to know what Corbyn really thinks of Lloyds | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/feb/21/lloyds-bank-useful-know-what-corbyn-labour-leader-really-thinks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/feb/21/lloyds-bank-useful-know-what-corbyn-labour-leader-really-thinks","fields":{"headline":"It would be useful to know what Corbyn really thinks of Lloyds","bodyText":"Lloyds Banking Group’s profits are back at pre-crisis level, there’s a new, digital-heavy three-year plan and enough surplus cash to spend £1bn buying back shares. Very good, but the chief executive, António Horta-Osório, has a more interesting boast. Lloyds, he said, is “completely aligned” with Jeremy Corbyn’s vision that banks should serve the “real economy”. You can see what Horta-Osório means, of course. Since the crisis, Lloyds has jettisoned almost all its overseas operations and presents itself these days as a patriotic servant of “the people, businesses and communities in the UK”. It parades its flattering statistics at every opportunity: £47bn lent to first-time buyers in the last four years, support for 440,000 startups and the No 1 spot among UK corporate taxpayers. Horta-Osório, lest we forget, has become extremely rich in the process: last year’s £6.4m pay packet is absurd and won’t be cheered by politicians of any stripe. Meanwhile, the group’s behaviour in investigating the fraud at HBOS Reading may have been seriously poor – the regulator’s view is keenly awaited. But, those qualifications aside, what does the Labour leader make of Lloyds? Is it his kind of bank, or one that he’d prefer to break up? It would be useful to know because Corbyn, in his speech to the EEF, the manufacturers’ trade body, on Tuesday painted the financial landscape with such a broad brush that it was impossible to guess what policies are being contemplated. “Banks should be helping the real economy, not suffocating it,” he said. And later: “We need a fundamental rethink of whom finance should serve and how it should be regulated.” What does that mean in practice? Was Corbyn merely bemoaning (fairly) some of the socially useless activities of investment banks? Or was he saying that ring-fencing and fatter capital ratios – the post-crisis reforms of which Lloyds is the poster child – are inadequate? Horta-Osório has laid down a good challenge. The UK’s biggest bank claims it is putting Corbyn’s view of banking into action. Does the Labour leader agree? A clear answer would be more revealing than a speech that made big claims about the sins of modern finance but didn’t name the culprits. Does he view Lloyds as part of the problem or the solution? AA on the road to nowhere? The AA, after a 28% fall in its share price, is a company worth £500m towing a £2.7bn caravan of debt. This lop-sided arrangement is the legacy of too many years under private equity ownership (CVC and Permira, take a bow) and the fund managers who foolishly agreed to provide an exit via flotation in 2014. The share price then was 250p v 84p today, offering a vivid illustration of why the AA should never have been allowed to list with this capital structure. Whistling cheerfully, the chief executive, Simon Breakwell, reckons the heavy debt load won’t impede his plans to reinvigorate the group. The covenants are supposedly light, the average cost of debt is 4.5% and the risk of default is described as “very low” because, even after a hefty profits warning, top-line trading profits are forecast to be £340m-ish this year. Well, maybe, but it still feels early to be predicting a return to profit growth next year. In attempting to get bigger in car insurance and to sell policies to non-members for the first time, the AA is pitching itself further into a highly competitive market. The other half of the plan is called “connected car” and involves selling technology devices that detect faults with an engine. Maybe breakdown prevention, as opposed to assistance, really is the future. But since the gadgets have been fitted to only 5,000 cars so far it’s impossible to tell whether this is the advertised gamechanger. Suffering shareholders do know, however, that the AA has been pressing the growth accelerator for years and getting little response. A total of 3.39 million members is a decent base, but the figure is 100,000 lower than three years ago. The dividend is being cut from 9p a share to 2p until further notice, demonstrating that bond holders are in the driving seat. The token payment seems to be a peace offering to income funds, including the one run by poor old Neil Woodford, who was there at the AA’s float and whose shocking run goes on. No fancy technology is required to discern the problem in this case: don’t buy shares in simple companies that have been overly complicated by financial engineers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/22/disadvantaged-children-education-poverty-social-mobility","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T08:00:11Z","webTitle":"Disadvantaged children need a break – not a system stacked against them | Frances Ryan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/disadvantaged-children-education-poverty-social-mobility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/disadvantaged-children-education-poverty-social-mobility","fields":{"headline":"Disadvantaged children need a break – not a system stacked against them","bodyText":"“It’s like giving some people a head start in a race and it’s your job to catch up,” says 13-year-old Kian in Generation Gifted. This month’s BBC’s series tracking social mobility through the lives of six teenagers presented an honest, at times painful insight into the barriers facing low-income pupils. Several had disabled siblings or parents and had to get by on benefits. Some were in temporary accommodation waiting for social housing, and others in cramped bedrooms without enough room to study. In one particularly moving scene, Anne-Marie – who dreams of going to university to become a criminologist – paused as she Googled the cost of tuition fees. Her mum had thought a degree would cost around £500. As Guardian columnist Dawn Foster wrote this week, the programme’s focus on social mobility for gifted pupils in some ways speaks to a regressive idea – that our energy should be put towards “saving” a chosen few bright children rather than widening opportunities for the poorest across the board. But as even that limited version of social mobility flounders, any grander aim – that poverty must not inhibit any child’s life chances – is surely being run into the ground. This month has seen two government policies to this effect – each of them an insight into what is currently being done to working-class young people’s futures. On Monday Theresa May announced plans to overhaul post-18 education funding – while admitting it would likely result in no extra money from the Treasury. The prime minister made nods to addressing disadvantage – that poorer students were “bearing the highest levels of debt” and Russell Group universities are disproportionately made up of private school alumni – yet her idea of lowering fees for some degrees is not only unworkable (discouraging students from taking up expensive subjects such as engineering) but blindly unfair. It’s hard to see how this two-tier system would not result in working-class pupils – put off by higher fees in some subjects – choosing an education based on what they can afford. While wealthier pupils would feel free to pick a degree based on interest or job prospects, poorer students could make do with what has been left in the “bargain bin” by the middle classes. Only a few days earlier, with decidedly less fanfare, children’s minister Nadhim Zahawi had announced another policy – the new eligibility rules for free school meals under universal credit. Every child whose parent claims universal credit was due to qualify from April but the government has lowered the threshold so that a family will need to earn less than £7,400 to receive help. The Children’s Society calculates this will mean one million children missing out. This is at a time when a council in Scotland has just extended free school meals outside of term time to avoid “holiday hunger” – children so desperate for a regular meal that school is the only place to get one. These policies may seem disconnected – indeed, ministers regularly speak as if these areas of government are entirely separate – but they are unmistakably linked. Hungry children can’t concentrate in class; their growing brains can’t develop. The same families who can’t afford a hot meal for tea are the ones expected to find thousands for university living costs. While ministers call for more grammar and faith schools, funding cuts to the education system amount to an assault on the life chances of the working class. As maintenance grants for low-income students were axed, sixth forms had their resources cut (the Sixth Form Colleges’ Association calculates that £100m in funding has been lost since 2010), school budgets – cut by £2.8bn in real terms – have reached “breaking point”, with the poorest areas and pupils with special needs hit the hardest. Meanwhile, the building blocks for success outside of education – from a secure, decent home to regular meals – are increasingly out of reach as cuts to social security and subsequent mounting child poverty pull support from families already struggling on a low income. Education at its best is a solution for disadvantage: the route to skills and learning, well-paid jobs and opportunities. But at its worst the education system merely replicates and perpetuates the class inequality that already exists – pushing advantage to the already wealthy and locking disadvantaged pupils into poverty. Stagnated life chances have long plagued Britain but current policies are pushing progress backwards. For low-income young people, the odds are not simply stacked against them at birth – they are made worse by the very government that is supposed to help reduce that disadvantage. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/28/colten-boushie-canada-all-white-jury-acquitted","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T15:26:29Z","webTitle":"I am Colten Boushie.

Canada is the all-white jury that acquitted his killer","bodyText":"On 9 August 2016, when he was 22, Colten Boushie, a Cree man from the Red Pheasant First Nation was shot in the head by Gerald Stanley, a white farmer. Earlier this month, beneath a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II in Battleford, Saskatchewan, in Canada’s prairies, an all-white jury in a court presided over by a white judge found Stanley not guilty of second-degree murder and also not guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. According to the Stanley family, Boushie and his friends were trying to rob their farm. After an altercation, Stanley fired three shots. The third hit Boushie in the back of the head and killed him. Stanley claimed that the point-blank shot to Boushie’s head was a “freak accident”, possibly the result of an unlikely mechanical failure known as hang fire, according to his defense. That evening, a dozen law enforcement officers arrived at the home of Boushie’s mother, Debbie Baptiste. They told Baptiste that her son was “deceased”, accused her of drinking, and commenced an unwarranted search of her trailer. “My son was the victim,” Baptiste later told the Globe and Mail. “But I thought that we did something wrong.” To reach its verdict, the jury revisited the events of that August day. But to understand what that verdict means, we must go back much further. The land where Boushie was slain is governed by Treaty Six which was negotiated between the Crown and the Cree and Assiniboine peoples from 1876 to 1898. The treaty was met with apprehension by many Indigenous leaders, including the Cree chief Wuttunee, who sent his younger brother, Red Pheasant – for whom the Red Pheasant First Nation is named – to sign in his stead. “We want none of the Queen’s presents,” said Chief Big Bear, a Cree dissident at the time. “It was not given to us to have the rope about our necks.” As settlers massacred the last buffalo, famine and disease spread among the defiant first peoples of the northern plains. Outspoken leaders like Big Bear had to sign so their people would not starve. When rations proved inadequate, the Indigenous turned to petty theft and prostitution to get by. By the spring of 1885, many proud warriors had had enough. They turned on their overseers, and in the aftermath of the insurrection, the Crown hanged eight Cree men at Battleford, Saskatchewan. “The executions of the Indians ought to convince the Red Man that the White Man governs,” remarked the then prime minister, John MacDonald. The hanging remains the largest mass execution in Canadian history. In 2016, 26% of Red Pheasant residents were unemployed versus just 6% for their broader census division, according to Statistics Canada. Median household income on the reserve was $25,000, compared with more than $75,000 in surrounding communities. More than half of Red Pheasant’s adult residents did not graduate high school. Maclean’s magazine named North Battleford, just across the North Saskatchewan river, the most dangerous place in Canada. This is the landscape that Boushie, his girlfriend Kiora Wuttunee and their friends Eric Meechance, Belinda Jackson and Cassidy Whitstone set out from for a day of swimming and drinking on 9 August 2016. On the way home, the group’s Ford Escape punctured a tire. At this point in their road trip, according to toxicology reports, Boushie had a blood alcohol content three times the legal driving limit and was so drunk that he was probably passed out in the backseat. I can imagine the five friends now, riding on three wheels and a rim like characters cut straight from a Sherman Alexie novel, pulling on to the Stanley homestead and into danger. When I was 22, the age that Boushie was killed, I stumbled across Cree leader Harold Cardinal’s book The Unjust Society. Penned in 1969 as a rebuke to the then Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau’s campaign promise to deliver a “Just Society” for all Canadians, the book shook me. Its words could have been written today. “The history of Canada’s Indians is a shameful chronicle of the white man’s disinterest, his deliberate trampling of Indian rights and his repeated betrayal of our trust,” wrote Cardinal. “[T]he native people of Canada look back on generations of accumulated frustration under conditions which can only be described as colonial, brutal and tyrannical, and look to the future with the gravest of doubts.” Erasure and denial haunt the first peoples of Canada. Loved ones like Boushie, whose family nicknamed him “Coco”, who tended the ceremonial fire at community gatherings, are fit with a mask of criminality, their talents and ambitions displaced by a ghoulish caricature. Their lives are deemed dispensable. Their justice – our justice – is denied. I know and love many Colten Boushies – fathers, uncles, cousins, nephews and friends who never got a fair shake. I’ve even been wrongfully accused of stealing a car in the backwaters of western Canada simply because of my race. I am Colten Boushie. My people are Colten Boushie. And the uncomfortable truth is that Canada is the all-white jury that acquitted Stanley. Canada starved Indigenous people until they signed treaties because there was no other option. Canada hanged eight of Boushie’s Cree forefathers in 1885. And Canada today is a wicked apartheid landscape that set a car of Red Pheasant daytrippers careening into the Stanley farm and the line of fire. “The Indian has reached the end of an era,” wrote Cardinal of this unjust society half a century ago. “[W]e will not be silenced again, left behind to be absorbed conveniently into the wretched fringes of a society that institutionalizes wretchedness.” While the fire that Coco kept spreads across this continent, let us pray that this wretched era is done at last.

It’s been a thrill. If you’ve missed any of it, here’s your summary of another action-packed day. Bye! What’s happened on Day 13 The US has won a thrilling women’s ice hockey final, beating Canada in a sudden death shootout after the teams finished overtime level on 2-2. Sweden’s Andre Myhrer won the men’s slalom gold after Austrian favourite Marcel Hirscher crashed out. Britain’s Dave Ryding ended ninth. Switzerland’s Michelle Gizin waltzed off with the women’s alpine combined, leaving silver to America’s Mikaela Shiffrin. Lindsey Vonn, in what could be her final Games, did not finish. David Wise of the US clinched gold in the men’s ski halfpipe, with countryman Alex Ferreira in silver, and a breathtaking bronze for 16-year-old Nico Porteous of New Zealand. New Zealander Zoi Sadowski-Synnott, also 16, also won bronze, this time in the women’s snowboard big air. That was won by Austria’s Anna Gasser, with Jamie Anderson of the US in silver. China’s Wu Dajing broke the world record twice on his way to 500m speed skating gold, while there were shocks in both the women’s 1,000m – won by Holland’s Suzanne Schulting – and the men’s 5,000m relay, in which Korea crashed out and Hungary took a surprise gold. Germany won gold in the Nordic Combined Team Gundersen large hill, continuing their dominance of the discipline. Darya Domracheva anchored Belarus to gold in the women’s 4x6km biathlon relay, with the favourites, Germany, nearly a minute back in eighth at the end of a race held in swirling wind and, for much of the time, heavy snow. Sweden will play the USA in the men’s curling final, after the former eased past Switzerland and the latter edged past Canada in the semi-finals. Earlier the Swiss eliminated Great Britain in a play-off: here’s Sean Ingle’s report on how the Swiss thumped their way back from 4-5 down to a 9-5 win with just one deft stone. And away from the action, the Russian curler Alexander Krushelnitsky was stripped of his mixed doubles bronze medal after testing positive for meldonium. And finally, here’s our pick of the day’s best pics: USA will play Sweden in the men’s curling final! They complete a shock victory over Canada – their second of the week – by controlling the final end to seal a 5-3 success. Canada will play Switzerland for bronze. Down to the last end in the second men’s curling semi-final. Canada took a point from the ninth, but USA lead 4-3 and have the hammer in the last. Here’s the latest medal table, with Sweden overtaking France and taking sixth position since it was posted earlier: In the other semi-final, for the first time, daylight: USA steal two in the eighth end and lead 4-2! Sweden qualify for the men’s curling gold medal match! At the end of the eighth end, with the Swedes holding a 9-3 lead, Switzerland accept the inevitable. They will have a chance of bronze, but still don’t know who they’ll be facing. Another end, and another step closer to the final for Sweden, who now lead 9-2. But who will they be playing? Midway through end eight, it’s still Canada 2-2 USA. Sweden add another two points from end six, and lead Switzerland 8-2. So Thursday’s action is over, everywhere except for the Gangneung curling centre, where the men’s semi-finals are both on end six. It’s currently Canada 2-2 USA, and Sweden 6-2 Switzerland. Here’s an Elise Christie video update: There’s another sporting power couple in the biathlon: Domracheva’s husband is the Norwegian Ole Einar Bjorndalen, 13 years her senior and a veteran of six Olympics – with eight gold medals of his own. He couldn’t get in Norway’s team for these Games, but is in the stadium to celebrate Belarus’s success. Their daughter, Xenia, was born in October 2016; 16 months later her mum has won two Olympic medals. Nobody can get anywhere near Domracheva! She picks up a Belarus flag in the final straight, holds it aloft, and it flies off its pole to leave her waving a big, blank stick. That’s as close as she gets to disappointment, though. Sweden seal silver, and France take bronze! Domracheva reaches the top of the course’s one big climb still in the lead, but behind her Sweden’s Hanna Oeberg has moved into second, just ahead of France’s Anais Bescond. Not really – she misses three of her first five attempts, but collects herself and is still first away. It’s so close, though, with France six seconds behind and Sweden four seconds behind that. Surely one of those will win this – can anyone catch Domracheva? Into the range for the final time! Can Domracheva nail this one and race away to gold? In the men’s curling semi-finals, Sweden have stormed into a 6-1 lead over Switzerland after getting a four in the fourth end. The other match is still too close to call, Canada leading 2-1. Point of information here, from Erwin Hofman: And Domracheva nails her first visit to the range, and Belarus take the lead! This is exciting stuff – rush to your nearest on-demand Olympic footage outlet for the final stages. Back, then, to the biathlon. The final leg has started, and there are still two shoots which could shake everything up again, but as it stands Poland lead, ahead of France and Belarus, who have Darya Domracheva, three times a gold medalist in 2014 but with only a bronze from these games, on the last leg. The result has been confirmed, Hungary winning in an Olympic record time. The judges still have to ratify this skating result, and they have quite a lot of footage to check. Finally we get to see Elise Christie celebrating at the Gangneung Ice Arena! She’s bouncing around on the sidelines as her boyfriend, Shaolin Sandor Liu, wins gold for Hungary. Hungary’s first ever olympic speed skating gold! China take silver, and Canada bronze! With 10 laps to go, China lead ahead of Canada and Hungary, with Korea hoping that one of them falls over or gets penalised. Drama in the speed skating, as Korea’s Lim Hyojun goes down! They’re not out of the race, but they are a long way behind! The snow has stopped falling on the biathletes, but the wind continues to howl across the shooting range. Italy’s Nicole Gontier comes into it first, hits her first three targets and then loses her cool, misses the remainder and ends up with a penalty loop to do. Belarus are the new leaders! The A final is about to begin, with South Korea, Hungary, China and Canada involved. USA have won the men’s 5,000m relay final, with Kazakhstan in second, the two of them way clear of the rest in the crucial final stages. In the biathlon, Germany’s third leg isn’t going great either – after the first visit to the range, Franziska Hildebrand is off for a penalty loop and they are now nearly two minutes off the lead. Italy are in that position, by a wafer. I’ve been criminally ignoring the men’s curling semi-finals, which still have a way to go. It’s currently Canada 1-1 USA after three ends, and Sweden 2-1 Switzerland at a similar stage. Today’s final speed skating event is the men’s 5,000m relay. The B final is about to start, involving Japan, the USA and Kazakhstan. The third of four legs of biathlon relay has just begun, with Finland currently in the lead, 14.2sec ahead of Italy, with Slovakia and the USA close behind. Germany are more than one and a half minutes off the pace. Some fabulous photographs from day 13 at the Games: Incredible scenes! Wierer comes back to the range, where because of the wind everyone is taking their time, reels off five perfect shots and emerges in the lead again! Slovakia take the lead in the biathlon, but then Anasasiya Kuzmina misses with her first three shots on the range, she has a penalty loop to do, and they too will drop down. Wierer ends up with two penalty loops to complete, and Italy are suddenly in 12th, and over a minute behind. Biathlon latest: Italy are in the lead for now, but Dorothea Wierer’s shooting has let her down and in these conditions, anything could still happen. Schulting is in bits, utterly astonished at this unexpected glory. Meanwhile Arianna Fontana has added another medal to her collection – she had already won silver in the 3,000m relay, to go with a haul of a silver and two bronzes from Sochi, and a bronze each from 2010 and 2006. No woman has ever won more short track speed skating medals. To make matters worse, Shim Sukhee is penalised by the judges and officially comes last. Schulting leads from the front and can’t be beaten. Shim Sukhee and Choi Monjeong move wide to make their move in the final stages but collide and slide out, leaving Canada’s Kim Boutin and Italy’s Arianna Fontana to take silver and bronze! The Koreans have taken each other out on the final lap! Meanwhile the women’s 1,000m B final has been cancelled, because with two athletes penalised and one advanced only Kim Alang of Korea was going to skate in it. So it’s on with the A final, in which Canada’s Kim Boutin takes the inside track, with Arianna Fontana of Italy, Suzane Schulting of Holland, Korea’s Shim Sukhee and Choi Minjeong, also from Korea, to her right, in order. The result has been confirmed: Wu Dajing takes gold – China’s first of these Games – Hwang Daeheon and Lim Hyojun sweep up the remaining medals for Korea, and Canada’s Samuel Girard comes fourth. China’s Wu Dajing hits the first bend in front, and stays there! The 39.8 second world record – a record that hadn’t been beaten for six years until today – that he set in qualifying is smashed in the process, as he clocks 39.584! Back to the skating, where the men’s 500m final has started … with a false start. The tension rises. The biathlon is on, in suitably wintry conditions – strong winds, and heavy snowfall. The men’s 500m B final is over, and Shaolin Sandor Liu wins it by a 0.043sec ahead of China’s Ren Ziwei, meaning that he retains an outside chance of a medal, should a couple of finalists be penalised or otherwise fail to finish. Aside from the skating, the only medals still to be decided today are at the Alpansia Biathlon Centre, where the women’s 4x6km relay is about to start. Germany are again heavy favourites here, with France expected to offer some competition. The speed skating finals are about to begin, starting with the men’s 500m B final, due to start in about one minute. Johannes Rydzek crosses the line, fluttering flag in hand, and is swamped by celebrating team-mates. After a lengthy wait Norway comes home second, and Austria take bronze! After 43 minutes of racing, Germany’s lead in the Nordic Combined is now 1min 20sec, and another gold is in the can. Germany have won every Nordic Combined gold so far, as well as 50% of the silvers and 50% of the bronzes. Roars from the crowd, as China’s Qu Chunyu is penalised by the judges, and Choi is advanced into the A final! Suzanne Schulting comes through to win that semi-final, with Shim Sukhee in second. But Choi Minjeong, gold-medalist in the 1,500m and in the 3,000m relay, is – pending official ratification – heading only to the B final! The women’s 1,000m speed skating semi-finals are on. The first ended with Canada’s Kim Boutin and Italy’s Arianna Fontana qualifying for the A final. The second is currently in progress, with Korea’s Shim Sukhee at the back with two laps to go – but unlikely to stay there. The second leg of the Nordic Combined relay is now finishing. Germany’s Eric Frenzel, already a gold medalist in the individual Gundersen normal hill – and with a bronze in the large hill to boot – holds a lead of precisely one minute and 0.3 seconds ahead of Austria, who themselves are six seconds ahead of Norway, with Japan now 59 seconds further back. Back to the speed skating, where the men’s 500m semi-finals have just finished. In the first, China’s newly-minted world record-holder Wu Dajing won again, with Canada’s Samuel Girard also qualifying for the A final. In the second, China’s Ren Ziwei led for much of the race only to finish third, behind two Koreans – Hwang Daeheon and Lim Hyojun. Here’s a video report (in Dutch) on a remarkable event at Holland’s Heineken House in Peongchang in which two people were injured by a flying outsized massive fake Olympic medal. According to nltimes.nl, Holland’s men’s skating pursuit team were taking part in a ceremony during which “medal winners hand the plate holding their medal to the crowd. The plate is then passed from hand to hand over the crowd to a wall where all the medals won by Dutch athletes are hung”. But instead of passing it to the crowd they threw it, injuring two women, one of whom required treatment in hospital. Today the Dutch team have released a statement, which read: At our ceremony last night in the Holland Heineken House two visitors were injured. We obviously find that very regrettable. After this incident we contacted the two ladies who were hit in the head by the big medal that we gave to the audience from the podium. Meanwhile we have understood that one of them had to go to the hospital and was treated there. Fortunately both ladies are doing well but are very shaken. Let it be clear that we obviously never intended to cause this. We let them know that and in this way we also want to let the public know. Hopefully everyone can enjoy the Olympics here in Peyonchang for another four days. Riessle now leads by 44.8 seconds, with the three athletes behind him having apparently given up on the chase in favour of a tactical three-way battle for the two remaining medals, though of course there is a long way (12.5km, to be precise) still to go. Fabian Riessle, the second German in the Nordic Combined relay, is stretching their lead, which now stands at 32.6 seconds. Behind him Austria, Norway and Japan are within a second of each other. Here’s Reuters on New Zealand’s success today: 26 years after their first and only Winter Olympic medal they won two in a single morning, both bronzes taken by 16-year-olds: After waiting 26 years for a second Winter Olympics medal, New Zealand secured two bronzes in snowboarding and freestyle skiing within a few hours on Thursday. Zoi Sadowski-Synnott and Nico Porteous, both 16, made the Winter Games podium, emulating the feat of compatriot Annelise Coberger who won silver in Alpine skiing women’s slalom in 1992. Sadowski-Synnott produced an outstanding performance in the inaugural big air snowboarding event, recording the highest individual score of the competition. An hour later, Porteous stood at the top of the halfpipe having watched team mate Byron Wells crash out and, overcome by nerves, he vomited. But he was fired up by Sadowski-Synott’s performance. “It was so sick watching her getting a bronze medal right before I was going to drop. It was a huge inspiration for me,” he told Reuters. “It is super special and I am so proud to be a New Zealander right now. I think it is safe to say we broke the curse by getting two medals in one day.” The first leg of the Nordic Combined relay is just finishing, with Germany 12.1 seconds ahead of Norway and Austria, who are neck and neck in second place. Back to the speed skating, where the women’s 1,000m quarter-finals are ongoing. In the third and latest, Korea’s Choi Minjeong just absolutely destroyed her rivals, hanging safely at the back before overtaking the lot of them around the outside on the penultimate lap and winning with ease ahead of China’s Qu Chunyu. Here’s Sean Ingle on the extraordinary men’s slalom, and the ninth-placed finish of Dave ‘The Rocket’ Ryding: Meanwhile at the Alpensia cross-country centre, the Nordic Combined team Gundersen relay has just got under way. There’ll be four legs, of 5km each. And there is good news for Azhgaliyev: Hungary’s Shoang Liu has been penalised, and the Kazakhstani has been advanced into the semi-finals, which start in precisely 22 minutes. When it finally actually happens, Korea’s Lim Hyojun skates to an extremely popular victory, with Daan Breeuwsma of Holland behind him, though the judges are again checking the replays, with Kazakhstan’s Abzal Azhgaliyev feeling hard done by after apparently being impeded in the closing stages. That result has been ratified, and the fireworks continue in the final quarter-final, which began with a false start, followed by a two-man pile-up and consequent stoppage before the first bend, forcing another restart. The third quarter-final sees Seo Yira, the South Korean world champion, crash out about halfway through. China’s Han Tianyu also went, leaving Canada’s Sam Girard and Japan’s Ryosuke Sakazume to skate calmly into the two qualifying places – though the judges are still examining the replays. We have live sport! The men’s speed skating 500m quarter-finals are in progress, and they have started explosively: in the first of them Ren Ziwei of China set a new Olympic Record, and in the second Wu Dajing, also of China, broke a six-year-old world record. This AP story about North Korea’s Olympics seems a little mean of spirit: Unprepared and outclassed, North Korea’s 22 athletes wrapped up their competition at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics on Thursday without a finish higher than 13th. North Korea wasn’t expected to come to Pyeongchang until a last-minute announcement by Kim Jong Un on New Year’s Day that he wanted to send a team, which set off a flurry of North-South diplomatic machinations allowing their delegation to cross the border. With few athletes prepared and ready, the North sent more than 140 musicians, a demonstration taekwondo team, a 229-woman strong cheering squad and 21 journalists, though the sporting aspect of the Olympics has gotten virtually zero coverage in the North. Their athletes’ lack of experience and preparation showed. The sentimental highlight of the North’s participation in the games was the joint Korea ice hockey team, which featured players from North and South for the first time. Although it was ranked below the Olympic qualifying level, South Korea won an ice hockey berth in the games because it is the host nation. South Korean President Moon Jae-in championed the effort to allow 12 North Korean players to join the team. The concept won emotional support from many South Koreans, but it was also controversial because it took slots away from more talented South Koreans who had trained hard for the Olympics. The team ended up losing every game they played giving up 28 goals and scoring only twice in their five matches. They lost their final match on Tuesday to Sweden, 6-1. Not counting the mostly South Korean hockey squad, the North’s best performance came from figure skaters Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik, who finished 13th in pairs. They were the only North Koreans to have actually qualified for the Olympics in pre-games competition, though the North missed a registration deadline and the two had lost their slot until politics intervened on their behalf. We’re in a bit of a lull, as we wait for the speed skating to get under way in about 20 minutes, with the Nordic Combined cross-country starting 20 minutes after that. You could spend some of that time looking at this photograph: Here’s our news story on Alexander Krushelnitsky’s meldonium-related medal-stripping: The men’s slalom is certainly going to be one of the stories of the day. Marcel Hirscher and Henrik Kristoffersen had finished first and second in four of the eight World Cup slaloms this season; today they both crashed out, allowing a 35-year-old who thought his chance had gone, and a 6ft 7in Swiss who had always been told, in his own words, “that a two-metre man couldn’t go fast in slalom”, to claim the top two places. This from Associated Press: The shock wasn’t only about who won the Olympic gold medal in the men’s slalom, it was also about who failed to even finish the race. Andre Myhrer, a 35-year-old Swede who took bronze in the event eight years ago in Vancouver, was the unlikely champion on Thursday. But it was Marcel Hirscher and Henrik Kristoffersen the best slalom skiers on the World Cup circuit that couldn’t complete two runs to give themselves a chance at the title. “To be able to do this after the season they have had is, of course, amazing for me,” Myhrer said. Hirscher skied off course in the opening run, while Kristoffersen set the fastest time. But the Norwegian couldn’t make it all the way down the piste on the second run, leaving Myhrer at the top of the podium. Both Hirscher and Kristoffersen won Olympic medals in this event four years ago in Sochi. They also combined for 1-2 finishes in four of the eight World Cup slaloms this season. Myhrer watched in the finish area as Kristoffersen, holding a 0.21-second advantage out of the starting gate, skied out early in the second run. That allowed Ramon Zenhaeusern of Switzerland to take an unexpected silver medal, 0.34 seconds behind Myhrer. The tallest man in the race at 6-foot-7 (2 meters) threw his ski poles in the air after seeing he had taken the lead several racers before Myhrer completed his second run. Bronze medalist Michael Matt of Austria was 0.67 behind Myhrer’s two-run time of 1 minute, 38.99 seconds. Matt, whose brother Mario won slalom gold four years ago at the age of 34, said he had given up hope of a medal before Kristoffersen started. “I got my backpack and said, ‘That’s it,’ because Henrik is really fast and skis very safe as well,” said Matt, who had been 12th-fastest in the first run. “I thought it was over.” Kristoffersen is so safe he had top-three finishes in all eight World Cup slaloms this season. He won one race, while Hirscher won six times and also completed the rest safely. “It’s better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all,” Kristoffersen said. Hirscher fell short in his quest for a third gold medal at the Pyeongchang Olympics. The Austrian great also won the combined event and the giant slalom, when Kristoffersen took silver. “I had already really a bad feeling about the whole situation,” Hirscher said, adding he has had some “really bad training days here.” Myhrer became the second 35-year-old Alpine skier to take gold at the Pyeongchang Games. Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, barely two weeks older than Myhrer, won the downhill and set a record as the sport’s oldest male Olympic champion. Michael Matt, the Austrian who won bronze in the slalom earlier today, has unusual family history in the Olympics: His elder brother Andreas won silver in ski cross in 2010, and his even older brother Mario won gold in the slalom in Sochi four years ago. News just in of Alexander Krushelnitsky, the Russian curler, who has been stripped of the mixed doubles bronze he won with his wife, Anastasia Bryzgalova. This from the Press Association: Russian Alexander Krushelnitsky has been stripped of the mixed doubles curling bronze medal he won at the Winter Olympics after being found guilty of doping, the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s anti-doping division has announced. Krushelnitsky finished third in the event representing the Olympic Athletes of Russia with his wife, Anastasia Bryzgalova, but now the medal will likely be reallocated by the International Olympic Committee and World Curling. A statement from CAS’ ADD read: “The athlete has admitted the anti-doping rule violation; he is disqualified from the mixed doubles curling event at the Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018 and the results obtained by the team OAR at the same event are disqualified.” Krushelnitsky earlier this week denied taking meldonium, which increases blood flow, and the OAR delegation announced a criminal investigation would take place to determine how the positive test happened. The CAS ADD statement added: “The athlete has accepted a provisional suspension beyond the period of the Games and reserved his rights to seek the elimination or reduction of any period of ineligibility based on ‘no fault or negligence’ following the conclusion of the Games.” For meldonium to be performance-enhancing it must be used on a regular basis and over a prolonged period of time, the OAR statement added. And the OAR said Krushelnitsky provided a clear drug sample on January 22. Meldonium was found to be used by more than 100 Russian athletes in 2016. Former world tennis number one Maria Sharapova served a 15-month ban for using the substance after it was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list. Hello world! The Nordic Combined Team Gundersen ski jumping round has just finished, with Austria in the lead and Germany second. Of the 10 teams eight are from Europe, leaving Japan (currently third) and USA (ninth) to represent the rest of the world. What it all means is that in the cross-country relay the top four teams, rounded out by Norway, start within 27 seconds of each other, with France in fifth starting more than a minute behind the leaders. It would be a surprise, then, if gold was won by any team other than Austria, Germany, Japan or Norway. The racing gets under way at 7.20pm local time, 10.20am GMT. What’s happened The US has won a thrilling ice hockey final, beating Canada in a sudden death shootout after the teams finished overtime level on 2-2. David Wise of the US clinched gold in the men’s ski halfpipe, with countryman Alex Ferreira in silver, and a breathtaking bronze for 16-year-old Nico Porteous of New Zealand. New Zealander Zoi Sadowski-Synnott, also 16, also won bronze, this time in the women’s snowboard big air. That was won by Austria’s Anna Gasser, with Jamie Anderson of the US in silver. Switzerland’s Michelle Gizin waltzed off with the women’s alpine combined, leaving silver to America’s Mikaela Shiffrin. Lindsey Vonn, in what could be her final Games, did not finish. Sweden’s Andre Myhrer won the men’s slalom gold after Austrian favourite Marcel Hirscher crashed out. Britain’s Dave Ryding ended ninth. There were no smiles for Great Britain in the men’s curling, where hopes of making the semi-finals evaporated after a walloping in the ninth end from Switzerland. Read Sean Ingle’s report on how the Swiss thumped their way back from 4-5 down to a 9-5 win with just one deft stone. What’s coming up All times are local – Pyeongchang is GMT +9, EST +14, AEDT -2, but our fancy schedule will tell you the times wherever you are, should those timezones not apply or you run out of fingers to calculate on. From 7pm, the men’s short-track speed skating 500m begins with quarter-finals, building up to medal races at about 8.15pm. In between comes the women’s 1,000m short-track – gold should be dished out there by about 8.30pm. The men’s 5,000m relay rounds off the track action. You might want to switch an eye at 7.20pm to the catchily titled men’s Nordic combined Team Gundersen LH/4x5km cross-country. At 8.05 it’s the men’s curling semi-finals: Sweden take on Switzerland, while the other is another USA v Canada crunch match. At 8.15pm it’s medal time for the women’s 4x6km biathlon relay. Stick with the live blog for every throw, slip and whatever it is they do in the men’s Nordic combined Team Gundersen LH/4x5km cross-country. My colleague Simon Burnton will see you through the rest of the day. The United States women’s hockey team ended Canada’s gold medal streak in dramatic fashion on Thursday afternoon, defeating their arch-rivals in a shootout to capture their first Olympic title since 1998. USA’s Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson scored the go-ahead goal in the shootout after the teams played to a 2-2 stalemate after regulation and overtime, setting the stage for American goaltender Maddie Rooney’s save of Meghan Agosta to clinch the gold before a rollicking crowd at the Gangneung Hockey Centre. “It is everything for our country,” American coach Robb Stauber said afterward. “I can’t tell you how happy I am for our players. We love them, it is unreal. I am just so thankful for the outcome. It was a thrilling final, it was unreal. I am just so happy for our players.” Canada had won four straight Olympic golds, three times beating the United States in the final. Their lone failure to win the title came when women’s hockey debuted at the 1998 Nagano Games, when they fell to the Americans in the gold medal match. Read our full report here: For Canadians dejected by that so-close ice hockey loss, a reminder of the medal table: It was supposed to be a men’s slalom battle for the ages between Austria’s Marcel Hirscher and the Norwegian Henrik Kristofferson – with a British skier in the mix for bronze. Instead, when Hirscher lost control on his first run, and Kristofferson got tangled with a gate on his second, Sweden’s Andre Myhrer claimed a surprise gold. Meanwhile Dave “The Rocket” Ryding, who learned to ski on a dry slope in Pendle, Lancashire, was left to rue a spluttering first run as he finished ninth. It was Britain’s best alpine skiing result for 30 years and thus a highly creditable result for the Ryding, whose overall time of 1:40.16 was just 1.17 sec behind Myhrer. However, he undoubtedly left himself with too much to do after a cautious first run saw him 1.37 sec back at halfway. He admitted: I had a couple of mistakes there that were a bit costly but the Olympics always give you a bit of the yips. Admittedly, yes, this is impressive (especially coming on a day when two 16-year-olds also won bronze medals): AP is quickest with its take on that thrilling ice hockey finish: Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson scored in the first extra round of the first shootout tiebreaker in Olympic women’s hockey history to give the United States the gold medal with a 3-2 victory over Canada. Maddie Rooney stopped Meghan Agosta on her second try of Thursday’s shootout to clinch it. Rooney stopped 29 shots in regulation and the 20-minute overtime. Shannon Szabados made 39 saves for Canada, which had won four straight Olympic gold medals. Marie-Philip Poulin and Haley Irwin scored in regulation for Canada. The Americans won the inaugural women’s gold medal in 1998, but had not beaten Canada in the Olympics since. Hilary Knight and Monique Lamoureux-Morando, Jocelyne’s twin sister, scored the American goals in regulation. It was 2-2 after three periods and 2-2 through five shooters in the tie-breaker. It was the second straight overtime in the gold medal game for these two teams, but the first shootout in Olympic women’s hockey history. The men have done it, most recently when Sweden beat Canada in 1994. Fellow US Olympians are quick to congratulate their gold-winning ice hockey teammates after that rather stressful sudden death shootout. The Shib Sibs are definitely pleased: And it remains 2-2 after two more saves. We’re into sudden death in the women’s ice hockey final. And it’s the US that wins it! And now it’s 2-2 after four shots each in the shootout. Sheesh. And it’s still 1-1 after the next two are both saved. Did I mention this is quite TENSE? And then it’s reversed: Canada gets one, US has one stopped. It’s 1-1. 1-0 to the US in the shootout. Canada’s first shot was stopped. Women’s ice hockey final goes to a shootout. After overtime, it’s Canada 2 – 2 USA. Is this a great way to decide a gold medal? It’s the first time ever the women’s winner will be decided this way. What do you reckon? It’s live over here if you want to follow it intensely. We’re edging perilously/excitingly (delete according to your view) close to a shootout to decide the gold medal winner in the women’s ice hockey. Our blow-by-blow live coverage is over this way, though I’ll keep on with the highlights here because frankly it’s quite TENSE: Our second 16-year-old New Zealander bronze medal winner of the day has been chatting about his success. Bryan Armen Graham sends these highlights from Nico Porteous, who finished third in the men’s ski halfpipe: On being a bronze medallist at 16 years old: I’ve only had about 30 minutes to think about it. I’m pretty confused about what’s going on. I just can’t believe it. I was just so proud of my skiing today, and that’s why in the third run I just didn’t have anything left in the bag. I’d done what I’d worked on for the past four years, and I just landed my best run I could ever do. On his bronze-medal winning second run: I was vomiting at the top of the course with nerves and I had a lot of help from my sport psychologist, he’s an absolute legend. I honestly don’t know why it went so well. I honestly have no clue. I’ve been a mixed bag of emotions lately, I haven’t been really getting much sleep. On the night of quals I didn’t get to sleep until 4am. I’ve been all over the show. Maybe it was meant to be, I guess. On competing alongside his brother Miguel Porteous: It was really special to compete with him. It’s a bummer that he didn’t make finals, that’s a really big thing for me. It took me at least 24 hours to get over that. That performance was really for him, he’s a legend and a much better skier than me, so it would have been so sick to see him here and he definitely would have done really well. On how he will celebrate: Maybe just have a quiet one with family. On his future: I can always get a lot better and I’m going to be pushing the sport as hard as I can in the next four years. I don’t know what the next level is going to be, I’m just really excited to see what’s going to happen and what everyone else is going to be doing. Meanwhile, we’re in sudden death overtime in the women’s ice hockey final. With Vonn flunking that slalom run, it’s all settled in the women’s Alpine combined. 1 Michelle Gisin (Switzerland) 2 Mikaela Shiffrin (US) 3 Wendy Holdener (Switzerland) It’s the first gold for Switzerland in the combined event. It’s Lindsey Vonn time. She’s the final runner in the slalom run of the women’s Alpine combined and it all rests on this. SHE STOPS. It’s all over for Vonn. Next up in the women’s Alpine combined is Norwegian Ragnhild Mowinckel. She sat second after the downhill run. What can she wring out of this slalom? It’s snowing pretty heavily, though I guess she won’t find that too troublesome. But she finishes fourth – no medal for Mowinckel and a definite medal for Shiffrin. But will it be silver or bronze? Switzerland’s Michelle Gisin knocks Shiffrin out of top spot in the women’s Alpine combined! An epic slalom run – with just two competitors left to race – means Gisin is guaranteed a podium space. An update from my colleague DJ Gallo on the women’s ice hockey final: End of regulation: Canada 2-2 USA Same as 2014, Canada and the US will head to overtime tied at 2-2. In 15 minutes, we’ll get 4-on-4 sudden death overtime for the gold medal. And here comes Mikaela Shiffrin in the women’s Alpine combined. The American stood sixth after the downhill run but slalom is her favoured run. And so it proves. She ends 0.47 quicker than Wendy Holdener, after a run in which she looked rather slower in the early stages. Will that super swift finish get her into a medal spot? They’ve drawn level with Canada in the third period: we’re tracking it minute-by-minute in our devoted live blog here: The slalom run of the women’s Alpine combined is on! Lindsey Vonn (US) and Ragnhild Mowinckel (Norway) held the top spots after the downhill run; slalom specialist Mikaela Shiffrin was lurking in sixth and will be one to watch. Mowinckel and Vonn already have a silver and bronze respectively from yesterday’s downhill final in their pockets (not literally; that would not be aerodynamic), while Shiffrin is going home with a gold regardless after victory in last week’s giant slalom. My colleague Eleanor Ainge Roy reports from New Zealand: Sixteen-year-old Zoi Sadowski-Synnott has just achieved her dream - a bronze medal in the women’s snowboard big air as well as personal congratulations from the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. Hailing from the small alpine resort of Wanaka in the Southern Alps, the teenager specialises in in slopestyle and big air, and won a silver medal last year in the slopestyle at the 2017 snowboard world championships. She also won gold in the world Cup snowboard in the Czech Republic last year. Sadowski-Synnott was born in Australia, but moved to New Zealand age six. Her coach, Mitch Brown is a double Olympian, and told the New Zealand Herald: I think she could really dominate the women’s snowboarding world to be honest. People are blown away about this lady from Wanaka who has just popped up and become a force to be reckoned with on the world tour … She is an amazing athlete to work with, because of her willpower and belief. Wanaka, in the lower south island, is ringed by five ski fields, and the local high school, Mt Aspiring, has intensive winter sports programmes for young athletes, allowing them time off school to practise as part of their outdoor education programme. Sadowski-Synnott last year admitted it was hard to concentrate on her schoolwork: I have no other career goals now, just snowboarding. It was in 2012, about three years after I started snowboarding, that I found I loved it so much I wanted to skip school. I knew I wanted to go the Olympics and X-Games. Back then, it was just a dream for a little kid. Over in the men’s slalom, after that second-round run, we have our top three: 1 Andre Myhrer (Sweden) 2 Ramon Zenhaeusern (Switzerland) 3 Michael Matt (Austria) Hot favourite Marcel Hirscher of Austria crashed out early on his first run and halfway leader Norway’s Henrik Kristoffersen also failed to finish his second run. Britain’s Dave Ryding finished ninth. Hello and welcome to our third live blog of day 13, because you can never have too many when there’s this much icy action going on. Earlier we brought you blow-by-blow coverage of the men’s ski halfpipe: David Wise of the US clinched gold in that one, with countryman Alex Ferreira in silver, and a breathtaking bronze for 16-year-old Nico Porteous of New Zealand. Porteous was – remarkably, given his country had won only one Winter Olympics medal before today, way back in 1992 – not the first New Zealander to reach the podium today. That honour went to Zoi Sadowski-Synnott, also 16 and now also a bronze winner, this time in the women’s snowboard big air. That battle was won by Austria’s Anna Gasser, with Jamie Anderson of the US in silver. Over here is every swipe of the ongoing women’s ice hockey final between the US and Canada: Canada are leading 2-1 at the end of the second period. The men’s slalom is running right now and we’ll have that action right here any minute now. There were no smiles for Great Britain in the men’s curling, where hopes of making the semi-finals evaporated after a walloping in the ninth end from Switzerland. Read Sean Ingle’s report on how the Swiss thumped their way back from 4-5 down to a 9-5 win with just one deft stone. Coming up Here are your medal must-watches for the rest of the day. All times are local – Pyeongchang is GMT +9, EST +14, AEDT -2, but our fancy schedule will tell you the times wherever you are, should those timezones not apply or you run out of fingers to calculate on. At 3pm, it’s the slalom run of the women’s Alpine combined, with Lindsey Vonn (US) and Ragnhild Mowinckel (Norway) leading after the downhill. But don’t count out America’s Mikaela Shiffrin, currently sitting in sixth spot. From 7pm, the men’s short-track speed skating 500m begins with quarter-finals, building up to medal races at about 8.15pm. In between comes the women’s 1,000m short-track – gold should be dished out there by about 8.30pm. The men’s 5,000m relay rounds off the track action. You might want to switch an eye at 7.20pm to the catchily titled men’s Nordic combined Team Gundersen LH/4x5km cross-country, which will no way fit on a medal. At 8.05 it’s those men’s curling semi-finals: Sweden take on Switzerland, while the other is another USA v Canada crunch match. At 8.15pm it’s medal time for the women’s 4x6km biathlon relay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/21/wednesday-briefing-leaver-tories-hand-ransom-note-to-may","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T06:39:17Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Leaver Tories hand ‘ransom note’ to May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/21/wednesday-briefing-leaver-tories-hand-ransom-note-to-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/21/wednesday-briefing-leaver-tories-hand-ransom-note-to-may","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: Leaver Tories hand ‘ransom note’ to May","bodyText":"Top story: PM on notice ahead of ‘war cabinet’ talks Hello, I’m Warren Murray and here’s your news on toast. It is shaping up to be a rocky couple of days after the prime minister was handed a letter from more than 60 backbench Conservative MPs containing a list of hard Brexit demands ahead of a crunch meeting on Thursday. The letter from the so-called European Research Group has enraged other Tory MPs including Nicky Morgan, an advocate for a soft Brexit who chairs the Treasury select committee. She called it a “ransom note”. May and her Brexit “war cabinet” will meet tomorrow to hammer out what Britain will seek in talks with the European commission. She knows she cannot ignore the “hard” group – its 62 signatories are enough to force a leadership contest. Meanwhile, May’s government could be on the brink of a deal to end months of deadlock with the Scottish and Welsh governments over an alleged “power grab” following Brexit.

Christensen has filled the role with distinction for the most part this season but his wayward pass in the 75th minute was a calamitous mistake that could have serious ramifications for his team’s hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. Chelsea had been leading, courtesy of Willian’s goal, and showing all their better qualities. Yet no side can defend this generously and expect to get away with it. Not, at least, when the opposition has Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi among its front line. Messi’s goal was his first against Chelsea in nine attempts and in that moment the advantage swung towards Barça ahead of the return leg. Chelsea had looked vulnerable as soon as Christensen committed the defender’s sin of playing the ball across the front of his own penalty area. If the pass was intended for Cesc Fàbregas, it was not entirely clear. The ball went from one side of the pitch to the other and, in his desperation to cut it out, César Azpilicueta put his team in even more danger by lunging in and failing to make contact. Iniesta was free. Messi, as always, was backing him up. And it is tempting to think Chelsea might live to regret that combination of errors in the second leg at the Camp Nou on 14 March. Nonetheless, Conte refused to blame Christensen, who was chosen ahead of the experienced Gary Cahill. “No, absolutely no, no, no,” he insisted. “Christensen’s performance was great, incredible. He is only 21 years old, it’s great that he’s able to play this game with his maturity and personality. He was one of the best players tonight. A top, top game and I’m very pleased for his performance.” Even so, it was still a frustrating night for Conte and his players bearing in mind the 13-minute spell when they had the lead and seemed to have the measure of their opponents. Eden Hazard had frequently unsettled the visiting defence. Thibaut Courtois was scarcely troubled in Chelsea’s goal and the home side could also reflect on two moments in the first half when Willian tried his luck from 20 yards out and – agonisingly, almost implausibly – both shots came back off the woodwork. The first was just before the half-hour mark when the ball thudded off Marc-André ter Stegen’s left-hand post. Ten minutes later, Willian tried again from the same distance, 20 yards out, and this time his shot ricocheted off the other upright. Stamford Bridge howled with anguish but these were encouraging moments for Chelsea and when Willian tried for a third time, in the 62nd minute, he had seen a small gap inside the right-hand post and picked it out beautifully. More than anything, the frustration for Chelsea was exacerbated by the sense that the team currently seven points clear at the top of La Liga might be running out of ideas. Barça had played every kind of pass bar the killer variety. They did not manage a shot on target in the first half and it was unusual, in particular, to see Luis Suárez looking as subdued as he did in the opening 45 minutes. These are the occasions – the big nights, under the floodlights, with the Champions League anthem blaring – when Suárez usually loves to compete with Messi for the leading role. Not here, though. Instead, the narrative came back – as it often does – to the little guy wearing Barca’s No 10 shirt. Messi did not invent the art of dribbling but he has certainly taken it to its highest level. One early slalom left Antonio Rüdiger in such a fix it was difficult not to feel a pang of sympathy for the defender. Messi then proceeded to remind everyone that too much time had been wasted in the build-up to this match analysing his lack of goals in these fixtures. His movement, his distribution, the deftness of touch – as much as Chelsea’s fans must have wished the ball could avoid him, they will surely realise these are moments to treasure. And Messi, true to form, had not yet finished with Rüdiger. Equally, Messi’s influence had waned after the interval and Chelsea were looking relatively comfortable as the game reached the final quarter of an hour. They had defended stoutly, with N’Golo Kanté having one of his better performances in front of the back four. Chelsea did not start with an orthodox centre-forward but the speed and movement of Hazard, Willian and Pedro always made them dangerous on the counterattack. Willian’s goal was a peach and, frankly, it felt ludicrous that Conte is widely assumed to be on his way out in the summer. Stamford Bridge, once again, felt like a happy place. Yet this was a big night for Christensen, only 21, and there were some tell-tale signs, perhaps, in the first half when he misdirected what should have been a routine pass and sent the ball out for a corner. His next mistake was far more serious and, though Messi will inevitably dominate the headlines, the goal would never have been possible had it not been for Iniesta’s brilliant anticipation. Messi was waiting, unmarked, and was never going to let Chelsea off the hook."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/20/paul-pogba-manchester-united-sevilla-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T20:35:28Z","webTitle":"Paul Pogba primed and ready for Manchester United’s Sevilla test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/20/paul-pogba-manchester-united-sevilla-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/20/paul-pogba-manchester-united-sevilla-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Paul Pogba primed and ready for Manchester United’s Sevilla test","bodyText":"The cameras were out late at Carrington on Tuesday morning and so was Paul Pogba, which was one way of announcing that the Frenchman should be fit to play in Seville. But José Mourinho said it was “unfair” to load him with the responsibility for carrying Manchester United to the phase of the competition where teams start to believe they can actually win it and stopped short of saying he would start. Instead, he had set up a response before he and his players flew to Spain, one that he did not clarify upon arrival in Andalucia. Normally the media is allowed in to film the first 15 minutes of training before Champions League ties – meaningless minutes in which the only thing anyone sees is players jogging round the pitch, stretching or knocking the ball back and forth with little real purpose – but this time access was granted towards the end of the session. And that, Mourinho said, provided an objective view of the condition of his players, including Pogba who he had been frustrated not to be able to field against Huddersfield. What Mourinho did not provide was a definitive answer when he was asked if the midfielder would start. “Normally when we open [training sessions], we do it in the warm-up and the simple drills,” Mourinho said. “[But] this time we did it for a long time so that we could see the players in a competitive situation – and when a player is in that situation it is because they are normally ready and without any problems. You could see that in training.” The answer was a rambling one, far from clear and without a definitive “yes, he is fit” or “no, he is not fit”, and there was no opportunity for Mourinho to clarify what he meant. He may not have wanted there to be one, either, while how far the morning session had been staged may have been a legitimate question too. There would be no holding back despite facing Chelsea on Sunday, Mourinho said, and no obligation to play Pogba. When Mourinho was asked if this was the kind of stage that his most expensive signing should dominate, he sought to release the pressure on the man who cost £89.1m. “I don’t think it is fair to speak about the responsibilities of a player,” Mourinho said. “I don’t like the fact that the player who cost X millions doesn’t have the same responsibility as the player who cost three times X. I think it is for everyone. I understand that, from your point of you, but I don’t like that approach. When I decide the team to play I don’t look at the age, the salary, [or] the transfer fee, because I think that is not fair.” On an evening when there was a hint of nostalgia as Mourinho returned to Spain to face a coach who is embarking on only his second Champions League night and who admitted to feeling “enormously emotional” at being able to compete against a man he has read about in books, much of the focus was on what this competition means and how it can be won. This will be Mourinho’s 140th Champions League match and he has won more titles than Vincenzo Montella has managed games. When it was pointed out to him that he had won many titles in Spain, Mourinho smiled, held up three fingers and said: “no, not many”, and he insisted that there would be no repeat of the 6-2 scoreline he twice achieved here with Real Madrid, but he has an admirer in the Sevilla coach. “He is a pioneer in training methodology, he was different,” Montella said. “I have read his books and what has been written about him, I’ve read a lot about tactical periodisation.” Montella said United were favourites, and had warm words for Mourinho, Pogba and also Alexis Sánchez – a “fantastic” player who he said could be stopped only by “tying him down with rope”. If this is a stage for Pogba it is also one that Sánchez wished to return to, but for it to have been worthwhile United must reach the quarter-finals – where, Mourinho said, even the less favoured teams, “which includes us”, believe that anything can happen and they can win the competition. “Alexis could have come in the summer, to us or another club, but one of the reasons he came now was the attraction of playing the Champions League,” Mourinho said. “It’s one thing to go to Manchester United in the Champions League, another Manchester United not in the Champions League. Last season was hard to motivate the players for a competition that we didn’t want to play. We won it and that’s why we are now playing the Champions League, that’s why he wanted to come in January to play this competition. But we have to be good, or else he will only play two games.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/20/chelsea-barcelona-champions-league-player-rartings","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T23:32:54Z","webTitle":"Chelsea 1-1 Barcelona: player ratings from Stamford Bridge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/20/chelsea-barcelona-champions-league-player-rartings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/20/chelsea-barcelona-champions-league-player-rartings","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea 1-1 Barcelona: player ratings from Stamford Bridge","bodyText":"Chelsea Thibaut Courtois Occasionally panicked with his distribution, but strong at crosses and helpless for Messi’s equaliser 6 César Azpilicueta Organised, read Barça’s intent and summoned the form of recent seasons rather than this one, but could not reach Christensen’s pass 7 Andreas Christensen It was cruel that Chelsea’s most consistent defender this season should err with a pass to present Barça with their equaliser 6 Antonio Rüdiger Endured some awkward moments, dizzied by Messi at times, but persevered and his charges up-field were a thrill 7 Victor Moses Energetic down the flank and ever eager to support the attack, but stretched defensively 6 N’Golo Kanté Chelsea needed Kanté to excel, and it was his aggression and interceptions which whipped up the hosts 8 Cesc Fàbregas Conte was frustrated at the pace and accuracy of some of his passing, but he was industrious and prompted when he could 6 Marcos Alonso Severely tested defensively, and wary of venturing too far forward.

On Wednesday the treasurer and former immigration minister launched a lengthy rebuttal of the former prime minister’s attempts to link migration to cost-of-living pressures, warning it would “cut off your nose to spite your face”. Abbott has campaigned to cut migration since 2017 but received a boost when the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, suggested in February that Australia must reduce its intake of migrants “where we believe it’s in our national interest”. On Tuesday Abbott advocated a target of 110,000 migrants a year, down from 190,000. Morrison said the permanent migration intake was “exactly the same as it was” when Abbott was prime minister” and had remained the same since 2011. “I don’t recall any discussion that that should be lowered and I do recall housing affordability being a significant issue at that time,” he said at a doorstop in Melbourne. “Where the increase in population growth has come from is the more temporary migration,” he added, citing a rebound in international students and people on extended holidays in Australia. “If you cut the level of permanent immigration to Australia by 80,000, that would cost the budget, that would hit the bottom line, the deficit, by $4bn to $5bn over the next four years. “If you did what Tony Abbott suggests, then you would only reduce the proportion that was skilled migration and you’d have a bigger proportion which was family migration – which ultimately gets more dependent on welfare.” “People who come as skilled migrants pay taxes,” he said. “They make a net contribution to the economy.” Morrison said the skilled migration program was demand-driven, aiming to fill skill shortages in critical sectors of the economy. He said he had no problem with having the debate but “the debate needs to be informed by the facts”. Abbott’s speech to the Sydney Institute on Tuesday claimed that cutting migration would improve “stagnant wages, unaffordable housing and clogged infrastructure”. “It’s a basic law of economics that increasing the supply of labour depresses wages, and that increasing demand for housing boosts price,” he said. The population argument was kicked off when the new Liberal senator Jim Molan said in his first speech that migration was “in excess of the capacities of our cities to absorb”. Asked what Abbott and Molan were doing, Morrison replied: “I don’t know what Tony Abbott’s doing but Jim’s a good friend of mine and Jim’s comments I think were quite different to the former prime minister’s.” At a doorstop in Rockhampton, Bill Shorten said Labor wanted to “tighten up” visa requirements so employers hire Australians. “As for the rest of the debate, Morrison’s torpedoed Abbott, Abbott’s trying to ambush Turnbull – it’s just another day at the office for the [Liberal-National parties].” Abbott’s comments on immigration have also been criticised by an Australian National University demographer, Liz Allen, who told the Australian Financial Review that the optimal rate of immigration for the Australian economy was 160,000 to 210,000 people a year. “Tony Abbott is suggesting a suboptimal level of immigration, whereby we might actually see more adverse consequences of immigration intake than benefits,” she reportedly said. “The contributions migrants make has a positive net effect, that is migrants aren’t costing Australia more than they are contributing in terms of economics and culture. “Population is merely highlighting policy failures over decades. Infrastructure funding has not kept pace with population needs, regardless of whether we have strength in growth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/20/marjory-stoneman-douglas-students-florida-capital-gun-control","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"Students take fight for gun control to Florida legislators' doorstep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/20/marjory-stoneman-douglas-students-florida-capital-gun-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/20/marjory-stoneman-douglas-students-florida-capital-gun-control","fields":{"headline":"Students take fight for gun control to Florida legislators' doorstep","bodyText":"Some huddled in small groups, comforting each other through their tears and clutching pillows they had brought for the long journey ahead. Others were angry and defiant, shouting their demands for gun reform as they boarded the buses. But as a vanguard of about 100 students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school prepared to take their fast-growing #NeverAgain campaign from their shattered campus straight to the doorstep of Florida’s legislators in Tallahassee, their message was simple: end school shootings. Many who arrived in Tallahassee late on Tuesday night had come straight from the funerals of their friends to begin the eight-hour, 450-mile trek. Barely an hour before, they had said their final goodbyes to classmates Carmen Schentrup, 16, and three 14-year-olds, Cara Loughran, Gina Montalto and Peter Wang, who were among the 14 children and three adult teachers murdered in last week’s shooting. “This is how we’re coping, this is how we’re grieving, this is what is holding us together,” Sofie Whitney, a Stoneman Douglas senior, told the Guardian before boarding her bus. The teenagers will meet with lawmakers Wednesday morning to discuss gun control measures, then join a coalition of activist groups for a lunchtime anti-gun rally on the steps of the state capitol. Whitney said the students’ attempts to channel their unfathomable grief into a focused campaign had been an exhaustive emotional whirlwind. “The only way to get through is by making the change. There’s a hundred kids from a school that got shot up less than a week ago coming specifically to them, so if those legislators aren’t receptive that’s pretty embarrassing for them.” Whitney, one of the three founders of the #NeverAgain movement that on Sunday announced a nationwide March for Our Lives on 24 March, said the students were simply seeking “common sense” solutions to gun control. “We don’t need a full bill to be written overnight but we need some action, we need them to begin helping us make the change,” she said. Among the students’ demands are tighter background checks for gun ownership and regulations that would prevent assault weapons falling into the hands of the mentally ill. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Kimberly and James Snead, a Florida couple who took in shooter Nikolas Cruz after his mother died, revealed the disturbed 19-year-old who had acquired his rifle legally, was “days away from getting counselling”. As the fleet of buses was setting off from Parkland, thousands of students from neighbouring schools were walking out of lessons and staging impromptu rallies in solidarity. Hundreds from West Boca Raton high school left classes with their backpacks to walk the 12 miles to Stoneman Douglas. Meanwhile, the #NeverAgain campaign received the backing of several celebrities including the actor George Clooney and his wife Amal, who pledged $500,000 to support next month’s march. Also, Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg both announced they would match the Clooneys’ donation. The Stoneman Douglas students heading for Tallahassee said they could feel the groundswell of support behind them. “It feel empowering, knowing that our movement is so strong and that celebrities are backing us up,” said 11th grader Lorenzo Prado, who lost one of his best friends and the school’s swim team captain, Nicholas Dworet, 17, in the shooting. “It’s not just people who were affected. Hollywood, New York’s talking about it. It shows how big our movement is and how impactful it can be. “It hurts to lose Nick. I knew him since 7th grade, we talked every day at swim practice. Tomorrow it’s his celebration of life, I spoke to his parents and said I wished I could be there, but I feel this would be better. I don’t want Nick’s life to be in vain and I’m using his life as a catalyst for a change in America, for our gun laws, and to make sure nothing like this happens again.” The students have a packed schedule on Wednesday, with trip organiser Jaclyn Corin meeting with the Florida governor, Rick Scott, and others taking part in a series of roundtable meetings with state senators and representatives through the morning. “We’re splitting into groups to divide and conquer and talk to as many as we can,” said Kaylyn Pipitone, 20, who graduated from Stoneman Douglas two years ago but joined the trip to support her friends. “We’re going to be seen and we’re going to be heard.” For the survivors and their families in the Parkland community, the slow process of healing was continuing. More funerals, vigils and memorial services were taking place, including a visit to a local church on Tuesday night of Crystal Miller, a survivor of the 1999 Columbine high school shooting and an advocate for gun reform. On Wednesday night, hundreds of Parkland students and their families, representatives of law enforcement, and politicians including Florida’s two senators, Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, will take part in a televised debate on gun control hosted by CNN at the BB&amp;T arena in Sunrise. Stoneman Douglas students have blasted Rubio in particular for accepting money from the National Rifle Association and for refusing to support gun reform measures in Washington."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/22/turnbulls-us-visit-should-prompt-us-to-rethink-australias-place-in-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T17:00:13Z","webTitle":"Turnbull's US visit should prompt us to rethink Australia's place in the world | Peter Romaniuk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/turnbulls-us-visit-should-prompt-us-to-rethink-australias-place-in-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/turnbulls-us-visit-should-prompt-us-to-rethink-australias-place-in-the-world","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull's US visit should prompt us to rethink Australia's place in the world","bodyText":"In the lead up to US president Donald Trump hosting prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, much is being said about points of contention in the current bilateral relationship, and about awkward moments in past interactions between the two leaders. But there should be no doubt that bigger issues are at stake. The visit ought to prompt serious reflection on Australia’s relationship with the US and our place in the world. The PM and others should ask themselves three questions. First, are things in the US as bad as they seem? Dysfunction in Washington is the stuff of legend. The centrifugal forces that afflict the US predate Trump. Maybe, for all the tweets, this is just politics as usual. No. The current crisis is broader and deeper than those of the recent past, and nascent trends have accelerated in a dangerous and unpredictable fashion. Trump’s unfitness for office is advertised daily and is exceeded by the pliancy of those around him. Beyond personality alone, on a host of issues the administration is pursuing bad policy. Most consequentially for Australia, in foreign affairs, the administration is abdicating US leadership, hollowing out the state department and diminishing US credibility. The state of the US economy provides no reassurance. Deregulation and tax cuts have been warmly received by corporate America. But the administration’s approach relies on trickle-down economics, over-hyped projections for growth and economic nationalist rhetoric that is utterly ahistorical. It’s unlikely that politics and economics can remain out of sync for long. Recent corrections may be the first sign that Wall Street optimism is being mugged by reality. More grave still is the harm being done to institutions. Levels of tolerance for self-dealing are at an all-time high just as mechanisms of accountability are in abeyance. Checks and balances survive in the form of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and in the persistence of an independent press. The disparagement of both by the US president and his loyalists attests to the novelty of our times. Second, will this situation improve any time soon? The current moment is bleak; the future looks worse. The Mueller investigation will be determinative – supposing that Trump does not intervene to end it. Such a move is but one route to constitutional crisis. If Mueller’s findings are gentle on Trump, he and his apologists will be emboldened. If Mueller finds Trump and his associates complicit in enabling Russian interference, or of related offences, they will push back hard. The consequences of either outcome are damaging. It’s difficult to say how these developments will play out. More than 40 Republican lawmakers are not sticking around to find out, declining to compete in the 2018 midterm elections. A Democratic “blue wave” may help restore some semblance of normality. But for a long time hence, Americans will be preoccupied cleaning up the mess that the administration is making – or messing things up even more. Third, if things are bad, and are not going to get better, what does this mean for us? Australians should realise the urgency of reconsidering some of the taken-for-granted assumptions that inform our foreign and domestic policy alike. Australia’s security and prosperity are grounded in the postwar, US-led world order. The US’ inability or unwillingness to maintain leadership will give rise to uncertainty. Negotiating those choppy waters will require sound strategy and skilled diplomacy. Challengers to US influence are at the ready. Democracy is on the back foot worldwide. Our other oldest, closest friend – the UK – has also engaged in self-destructive behaviour, in the form of Brexit. Australia’s foreign policy makers face a generational challenge. The travails of US democracy also provide lessons for us domestically. US elites have been at best negligent in allowing civic life to decay. Institutions that ought to bolster the health of a democracy – education, the media and electoral systems – have become battlegrounds. The ideal of an informed citizenry prepared to play its part in good government has been overwhelmed by moneyed partisanship and a social media environment too permissive of agents of influence at home and abroad. Australians should avoid this fate. Leaders should care about political and social cohesion. Investments in civic education should ensure that young Australians can discern political fact from fiction, and are apprised of the case for liberal democracy as the best (least worst) form of government. Turnbull’s visit is an a critical opportunity for the PM and for all Australians to absorb that the US is at a fulcrum point. We should start thinking about how to secure Australia’s interests in the uncertain future that awaits. • Peter Romaniuk is associate professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Graduate Center, the City University of New York"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/22/calling-citizen-scientists-more-data-needed-to-protect-echidnas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T17:00:12Z","webTitle":"Calling citizen scientists: more data needed to protect echidnas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/22/calling-citizen-scientists-more-data-needed-to-protect-echidnas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/22/calling-citizen-scientists-more-data-needed-to-protect-echidnas","fields":{"headline":"Calling citizen scientists: more data needed to protect echidnas","bodyText":"They may be one of the world’s oldest surviving mammals – around for at least 25m years – but scientists don’t know much about echidnas. Now researchers believe the remaining Australian population may be threatened and they need citizen scientists’ help to save them. The short-beaked echidna is found only in Australia and Papua New Guinea. In 2015 the Kangaroo Island echidna, a once significant subspecies, was listed as endangered. While the remaining population is listed as “least concern”, researchers question the listing. As Tahlia Perry, a PhD researcher at the University of Adelaide’s Grutzner Lab, which is studying the molecular biology of echidnas, says: “When you don’t have exact numbers, it’s really hard to give something a listing.” In September 2017, the lab, in association with the CSIRO’s Atlas of Living Australia, launched the free echidna CSI app to encourage Australians to photograph wild echidnas and collect their scat, or droppings. “What we are hoping to find out is [whether there are] other pockets of populations around the rest of the country that are in the same sort of threat level [as the Kangaroo Island species] because they face the exact same threats,” says Perry. The main threats to echidnas are land clearing and habitat loss. This was demonstrated on Kangaroo Island when the population shrank as development increased. Echidnas can travel great distances – often several kilometres in a day – they have very large home ranges and so land clearing and rapid developments can cause problems in their ability to travel by removing viable habitat, says Perry. Other major threats include traffic, feral cats and potentially the rapidly changing climate. What is known about the echidna is fascinating. Like their mammalian cousins the platypus, echidnas lay eggs but keep their young – puggles – in the mother’s pouch. Once they are the size of a cricket ball and their spines begin to develop, they are kicked out of the pouch and left in burrows. And while some echidna populations nurture their young, mostly the puggles are left to figure things out for themselves. Echidnas are quite smart, though, having the biggest frontal cortex in relation to their body size of all mammals, including humans. They can climb, burrow and run rapidly. They are mostly solitary animals, but the rare times they are seen collectively is when they form “an echidna train”. This is when the female is in season and up to 20 males follow her across great distances, all competing for her attention. They are robust and are found in wildly different environments, from the desert to the snow, likely to having much lower body temperature than all other mammals - around 30C - which can fluctuate by up to 10C in a single day. Perry has long been fascinated by the spiky creatures. Asked for a little-known fact, she points out the back feet of the echidnas point backwards to help them dig their burrows. This bewildered the British taxidermists of old who, thinking there must be a mistake, rotated the feet forward. Now hundreds of years later, those feet are being switched back. With the help of the research project, Perry hopes to discover more about the echidna’s DNA, eating habits and hormones to study breeding patterns. “You can also measure things like stress hormones to figure out what populations are particularly stressed,” she says. “For instance, [the] ones that are around more suburban areas, it would be interesting to find out if that is affecting them in a negative way or if they don’t care at all.” Anecdotally some echidnas seem terrified of humans – burrowing quickly – while others are more inquisitive. Their ability to escape stressful situations so quickly is why little is known about echidnas, says Perry. “They can literally dig themselves into the ground within a matter of seconds – they completely disappear in front of your eyes … They are masters of disguise and hiding and are insanely fast when they want to be as well. So they are just not great for a research animal.” As part of Guardian Australia’s series on endangered species, we’re encouraging readers to take part in the echidna CSI project. Download the free app, then photograph your local echidna or collect a sample of their scat and help to save the echidna."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/20/utoya-july-22-review-norway-mass-killing-gut-wrenching-ordeal-berlin-film","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T21:18:09Z","webTitle":"Utøya July 22 review - recreation of Norway mass killing is a gut-wrenching ordeal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/20/utoya-july-22-review-norway-mass-killing-gut-wrenching-ordeal-berlin-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/20/utoya-july-22-review-norway-mass-killing-gut-wrenching-ordeal-berlin-film","fields":{"headline":"Utøya July 22 review - recreation of Norway mass killing is a gut-wrenching ordeal","bodyText":"Erik Poppe’s Utøya July 22 is a visceral, brutal, yet heartfelt and earnest movie, which imbibes the innocent bewilderment and horror of its young characters. On one unbroken camera take, it seeks to recreate the horrific mass murder of 69 defenceless teenagers in Norway in 2011 at a socialist youth summer camp at Utøya island outside Oslo. The heavily armed killer was a rightwing race-hate terrorist who had detonated a bomb in Oslo itself earlier in the day. This slaughter was arguably the biggest trauma to have hit Norway since the second world war; the Utøya massacre (happening as it did in a closely regulated progressive European country) is also often adduced by America’s NRA as evidence that gun control laws are beside the point. It was, however, a single incident: quite distinct from what is now the single rolling, continuous mass phenomenon of school shootings now in progress in the US. Poppe’s camera situates itself among the nervous teens at the camp just by a forest and a lake – nervous, because they have just heard about the Oslo bombing and are earnestly discussing it. They are not, in fact, like those eerily unaware future victims of Paul Greengrass’s 9/11 drama United 93 or Gus Van Sant’s school shooting nightmare Elephant whose ordinary lives we see blankly unfolding at first as the calamity draws invisibly closer. Kaja (Andrea Berntzen) is a smart young 19-year-old, disturbed at the Oslo bomb, and annoyed at the tactless, insensitively carefree behaviour of her sister Emilie (Elli Rhiannon Müller Osbourne), with whom she has a painful row. Petter (Brede Fristad) is an annoying guy who likes needling Kaja on political issues. He clearly has a crush on her, as does the dopey Magnus (Aleksander Holmen). Meanwhile, a young person of colour, Issa (Sorosh Sadat), is praying that the terror attack they have all heard about is not the work of an Islamist jihadist, which would increase the racism he faces from day to day. So these are the regular travails faced by ordinary teens – though coloured by anxiety. And then they hear gunshots in the forest; their terrified friends come running blindly out of the woodland and the sickening nightmare begins. Perhaps nothing in the film quite matches the coup de cinéma at the very beginning. Looking directly into the camera, and with a weirdly blank expression on her face, Kaja says: “You’ll never understand.” Has she, at that moment, intuited the affectless, dead-eyed unconcern of The killer himself? In the next moment, the explanation is revealed; but this is the nearest the film gets to a Haneke-esque callousness. The camera stays with Kaja throughout; she sometimes cowers and hides with friends, she sometimes goes off on her own, searching for Emilie. The dull gunfire echoes in the distance, along with the screaming – and occasionally we glimpse the terrorist’s chilling silhouette on the horizon. Staying with Kaja has its advantages and disadvantages. This way, Poppe allows us to feel the horror-struck isolation and tension, he invites us to make an emotional investment in Kaja and feel her dilemma: is trying to hide a good idea or not? Does staying in one place make it likelier that the killer will eventually find you? But it also occasionally makes for a slightly static film. Sebastian Schipper’s one-take thriller Victoria (2015), by contrast, followed the active participants and made it a thrill-ride and put you at the centre of the action. It would be theoretically possible to play this film from the killer’s viewpoint, a crazed version of Call of Duty, though such an approach would be crass in this case, and Poppe is right to avoid it - though the imperative to proceed with moral seriousness as befits an event which is still a live issue perhaps inhibits Poppe a little. Occasionally this feels oddly like an old-fashioned war film, as Magnus and Kaja start talking about what they’ll do if they get home alive. At other times, it can’t help looking queasily like a YA post-apocalyptic dystopia, with Kaja a real-life Katniss Everdeen. There are also ironic echoes of Kinji Fukasaku’s Battle Royale. And after 72 minutes – the length of the ordeal in real life – the gut wrenching action of the film is at an end. It feels simultaneously much shorter and much longer than 72 minutes. It is an absorbing and moving tribute to the courage of the young victims of Utøya."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/21/columbus-crew-move-austin-texas-mls","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T09:00:18Z","webTitle":"The Crew want to move to Austin – but does Austin want the Crew?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/21/columbus-crew-move-austin-texas-mls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/21/columbus-crew-move-austin-texas-mls","fields":{"headline":"The Crew want to move to Austin – but does Austin want the Crew?","bodyText":"It could have been the day when the Columbus Crew’s planned move to the Texan capital evolved from possible to probable. Instead, 20 local activists gathered at the lectern during last Thursday’s Austin city council meeting and demanded that one of the team’s preferred stadium sites be ruled out. They brandished placards pleading: Save Guerrero Park. Such vocal dissent is complicating the already messy attempt to relocate one of Major League Soccer’s original clubs from Ohio to Texas. A couple of weeks ago, protests scuppered Crew ownership’s hopes of building an MLS stadium at Butler Shores, an enviable location that’s easy staggering distance from downtown’s ever-expanding throng of bars - not to mention restaurants, hotels, offices and glassy high-rise apartment blocks. Attention switched three miles east to another public parkland site along the banks of the Colorado river. Here, next to woodland on Pleasant Valley Road, are softball fields, administrative offices, parking lots and a fire department training tower. And views of water and the downtown skyline that would be telegenic and seductive for fans if those modest facilities are razed and replaced with a 20,000-seat venue. But a presentation of options to the council scheduled for last week was postponed after the Parks and Recreation Department asked for more time to conduct analyses, ensuring the process will drag on for months. The protestors took the opportunity to say their piece. A Precourt Sports Ventures (PSV) representative was not available for comment. It is easy to imagine, though, that the CEO of the Crew’s ownership group would feel at home in Austin. After all, Anthony Precourt is based in San Francisco, another prosperous, fast-growing, youthful and liberal-leaning technology hub. However dubious the sporting ethics of the Crew’s mooted relocation, there is a box-checking logic to bringing a professional side to the city, even if the Formula One circuit and the high-profile outfits of the University of Texas – notably the Longhorns football team, with their 100,000-capacity stadium – ensure there is no shortage of action. “Austin is quickly becoming a very international destination city, it’s growing very fast, all of these people are coming typically from the coasts, New York, LA,” said Josh Babetski of the MLS in Austin supporters group as he sat in the bleachers behind one of Guerrero Park’s fields. “Austin is lacking those key art and entertainment venues for a populace that’s growing this big and ... wants to have these kind of services and opportunities. When you look at us not having a major league anything and soccer being really the only realistic candidate for that, it really feels like a no-brainer to support bringing that into the city.” Austin appears to possess the same kind of demographic, cultural and economic ingredients that have made Portland and Seattle into MLS hotbeds – save, that is, for a storied soccer tradition. It is one of the most rapidly expanding metropolitan areas in the country, now numbering more than two million people, having doubled in two decades. The region is more populous than San Jose, Nashville – just awarded an MLS franchise – and Columbus. But Austin’s culture and politics breed anxieties about the environmental impact of big projects, a commitment to preserving green spaces and mistrust of pervasive corporate influence. A short walk from the park, workers in fluorescent vests swarmed over a lakeside site where the Silicon Valley giant, Oracle, is building an office campus surrounded by new apartment complexes targeted at young professionals – signs of the gentrification wave surging from the now-pricey centre of town to the cheaper south and east. “They’re traditionally very affordable lower income neighbourhoods. Building a stadium there would speed up the gentrification and displacement of people that are there now,” said Bill Bunch of the Save Our Springs Alliance environmental advocacy group, which wants to protect public parkland from exploitation by for-profit companies. Babetski, though, believes a stadium could spur growth that might benefit underprivileged areas. “I think it’s better to have a conversation about managing it better than it is to just try and dig your heels in and just stop it, because what is the alternative? Nothing’s ever going to move in here and rents are never going to go up? Those are just unrealistic plans. “Build a better plan. Say, OK, great, we’re going to carve off this little bit of space and gentrify, but use some of the economic benefits of that to help other parts of the surrounding areas,” he said. There are alternatives to Guerrero Park, but it would seem foolhardy to uproot the Crew avowedly because they struggle economically in Columbus without a downtown stadium, only to inject them 1,200 miles away into a characterless and distant suburb of a city that scorns blandness and has serious traffic problems. Amid reports that the team could play in a temporary venue in 2019 and 2020 before a permanent stadium opens in 2021, PSV will be desperate to avoid the travails of David Beckham’s Miami ownership group, whose expansion franchise was announced last month. They spent four years seeking a home, initially focusing on a prime waterside setting before picking an inland site in the largely African American district of Overtown that is inspiring opposition from residents who fear congestion and being forced out by redevelopment. Guerrero Park is east of Interstate 35, the freeway that historically has symbolised a dividing line between west, white, Austin, and the mainly black and Hispanic neighbourhoods on the other side. A racist strategy was formulated by city planners in the 1920s who plotted to shift African American people out of the centre. “There is one side of the tracks and the other. It’s a history, and it’s a constructed history of systemic racism all over the country. And here we have our own version in just the fact that we have an east Austin,” said Daniel Llanes, an artist and activist, after the council meeting. Llanes noted that the Butler proposal was quickly abandoned but the Guerrero Park idea is being taken seriously. “I’m not against the soccer stadium and all of the economic benefits that it would bring. What I don’t want is to locate it in Guerrero Park and I especially don’t want it if they’re protecting west Austin and they’re not protecting east Austin,” he said. “The stadium would be a blight to a park that everybody around it worked so hard to create,” he added. “I’m a Chicano so my heritage is Native American, it’s earth, you know? So I go: why is it that white people cannot leave a space alone? They cannot leave a big open space with wildlife and trees and water and nature. They can’t just leave it alone, they want to pave it over.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/20/how-rightwing-media-is-already-attacking-florida-teens-speaking-out","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T20:58:31Z","webTitle":"How rightwing media is already attacking Florida teens speaking out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/20/how-rightwing-media-is-already-attacking-florida-teens-speaking-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/20/how-rightwing-media-is-already-attacking-florida-teens-speaking-out","fields":{"headline":"How rightwing media is already attacking Florida teens speaking out","bodyText":"After Parkland’s mass shooting, the wind seems to have changed. Students are speaking out, demanding that politicians act. And they’re getting some traction. Many found their voice on Twitter and directly attacked Donald Trump’s strange and distracted online response to the massacre. David Hogg, a student journalist who interviewed his classmates as the massacre was happening, has been one of the leaders of a chorus of students calling for tough action on gun control. Emma González made a widely shared, impassioned speech which attacked the president directly, calling out the funding he has received from the National Rifle Association. Today, many of them are making their way in buses to the Florida State House to demand change. The survivors are not elementary school students, or public employees, either shielded from media intrusion or disbarred from speaking out. They are confident young adults, many of them media savvy, and more than capable of matching the president when it comes to online snark. Several made it clear that “thoughts and prayers” in the wake of slaughter isn’t welcome. So what is a rightwing media apparatus dedicated to the maintenance of unrestricted access to powerful assault weapons to do? By and large, the answer has been to attack the students, along with anyone who offers them a platform or any other form of support. The nature of such attack has varied with the self-perceived seriousness of the outlet, but almost the entirety of the right has joined in. Unremitting support for the current interpretation of the second amendment and the advocacy of the NRA is one of the single issues that unites them. The sleaziest and most direct attacks on individual students have come from the right’s more conspiratorial fringe. On Jim Hoft’s pro-Trump, conspiracy-minded website, Gateway Pundit, Lucian Wintrich performed a hatchet job on David Hogg, suggesting that he was “heavily coached on lines and is merely reciting a script”. Wintrich once told the Guardian that he learned about the perfidy of the left while attending Bard College. In his new piece, he claimed that because Hogg’s father works for the FBI, he may well be part of a broader anti-Trump conspiracy. Gateway Pundit has been retweeted by Donald Trump senior and junior in the past, and they say that last year they managed to get White House Press Corps accreditation. Conspiracy kingpin Alex Jones, who once told Piers Morgan that “1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms,” published a similar attack on his Infowars website. His minions trawled through Hogg’s past, unrelated media appearances, saying that they “raised questions”. The piece then quoted one of their bevy of retired military “experts” who had appeared on Infowars, who repeated the FBI conspiracy theory, claiming that the bureau “has been hiring Social Justice Warriors for years”. It’s not that Jones doesn’t want to hear from students at all. The site, and Jones show, has highlighted commentary from a witness who claimed that there was a second shooter, and gave a lot of airtime to another who bolstered Jones’s now-reflexive “false flag” take on any given massacre. They just don’t want to hear from any who think that others should be spared the trauma they have endured through some measure of gun control. Another approach was to find individual survivors of this massacre who did not happen to support the call from a large number of their classmates for gun control. The Daily Wire managed to find a pro-gun Marjory Stoneman student who accused the media of “politicizing” the massacre to talk about gun control. Glenn Beck’s outfit, The Blaze did their best to extract criticism of the FBI, not Trump, from one student’s CNN interview. Others reached back into history to feature the wisdom of survivors of massacres in the more distant past. The Washington Times spoke to Columbine survivor and Colorado Republican Patrick Neville, who wants to remove restrictions on concealed carry in K-12 schools. His thoughts were reliably disseminated by Breitbart and other outlets. The Federalist, a would-be purveyor of considered debates, considers itself a cut above such vulgar attacks – instead, under the guise of big tent commentary, they featured writers who have merely tried to undermine the students’ credibility by claiming they have no special status in the debate. On Monday, Chandler Lasch complained on the site that “Media tends to treat survivors like Hogg as if they are policy experts … Yet enduring tragedy does not make anyone a source of wisdom on legislation.” Just because your school has been shot up by a disturbed young man with a semi-automatic weapon, the logic seems to run, you don’t deserve a more extensive hearing than a Hillsdale College student, hundreds of miles away. Talk radio heavyweight Rush Limbaugh also likes to affect a certain gravitas. He was invited to discuss the massacre, and the students’ activism, on Fox News Sunday. Speaking to Chris Wallace, he defended the status quo, and recommended that more guns be introduced to schools to defend them from mass shooters. He lubricated the message with a few crocodile tears about the students’ pain. Conservative movement stalwart the National Review is similarly fastidious – but they’ll reliably put their shoulders to the wheel to prevent measures that might lessen the incidence of large scale, random slaughter. Ben Shapiro spat out a would-be demolition of the students, and the left, arguing that their activism should be dismissed because in adolescence, “the emotional centers of the brain are overdeveloped in comparison with the rational centers of the brain”. Dan McLaughlin, who has long blogged and tweeted under the moniker of The Baseball Crank, added that “if you have ever been, or known, a teenager, you know that even comparatively well-informed teens are almost always just advancing arguments they’ve heard from adults”. Even, it seems, teens who have recently been shot at by a mass murderer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/20/serena-williams-childbirth-health-daughter-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T20:15:36Z","webTitle":"Serena Williams: I almost died after giving birth to my daughter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/20/serena-williams-childbirth-health-daughter-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/20/serena-williams-childbirth-health-daughter-tennis","fields":{"headline":"Serena Williams: I almost died after giving birth to my daughter","bodyText":"Serena Williams has written about the complications surrounding the birth of her daughter in an article for CNN. The former world No1 had already revealed in an interview with Vogue that she was bedridden for six weeks after the birth of Alexis Olympia last year following an emergency caesarean section. Writing on Tuesday, she gave more details of the difficulties she experienced. “I almost died after giving birth to my daughter, Olympia,” she wrote. Williams said the pregnancy had gone smoothly before she encountered problems: “First my C-section wound popped open due to the intense coughing I endured as a result of the embolism. I returned to surgery, where the doctors found a large hematoma, a swelling of clotted blood, in my abdomen. And then I returned to the operating room for a procedure that prevents clots from traveling to my lungs.” Williams said that she was lucky to have received excellent medical care but others are not so lucky: “According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, black women in the United States are over three times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes. But this is not just a challenge in the United States. Around the world, thousands of women struggle to give birth in the poorest countries. When they have complications like mine, there are often no drugs, health facilities or doctors to save them. If they don’t want to give birth at home, they have to travel great distances at the height of pregnancy.” Williams goes on to urge people to donate to charities that help mothers and newborns around the world. The 23-time grand slam singles champion made her return to competitive tennis this month after time away during her pregnancy and to recover from the birth of Alexis Olympia. Her last grand slam victory came at the 2017 Australian Open while she was pregnant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/20/owen-farrell-leg-injury-will-not-stop-him-facing-scots","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-20T22:00:03Z","webTitle":"Owen Farrell’s leg problem is unlikely to stop him facing Scotland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/20/owen-farrell-leg-injury-will-not-stop-him-facing-scots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/20/owen-farrell-leg-injury-will-not-stop-him-facing-scots","fields":{"headline":"Owen Farrell’s leg problem is unlikely to stop him facing Scotland","bodyText":"England are confident Owen Farrell will be fit to face Scotland on Saturday despite the leg problem which has restricted his ability to train fully over the past 10 days. Farrell has not participated in the squad’s more physical sessions since the hard-fought win over Wales but is expected to prove his fitness on Thursday before the team fly north. The England management are insisting all will be fine even though the Lions midfielder once again played a reduced part in Tuesday’s training watched by the visiting football coaches Stuart Pearce, Hope Powell and Mark Warburton. “Owen is good,” said Neal Hatley, England’s scrum coach. “He’s been doing an extra bit of reconditioning but he’s good to go. “He’ll train with us on Thursday and has been involved with the group outdoors this week. It’s about doing what we need to do to get the individual specifically right for the weekend. If that means we tailor what we do in the training then we do it to make sure we hit the ground running. We have a clean bill of health so everyone is available for selection.” The West Ham manager David Moyes had been due to watch Tuesday’s session but the Scot ultimately could not attend. Eddie Jones will instead visit West Ham at a later date to continue his search for potentially valuable training tips from other sports. England’s matchday squad is set to include Nathan Hughes and Joe Marler for the first time in the tournament, both of whom will be expected to challenge Scotland physically. “In that last 25 minutes against France, Scotland were anything but flaky or fragile,” said Hatley. “Physicality will be important for us. We’ll look to make sure we do well in the collisions and go from there.” England have also named two extra forwards, Wasps’ James Haskell and Bath’s Charlie Ewels, in a 25-man travelling squad, with the starting XV to be confirmed on Thursday. They will not, however, request that Welsh referee Nigel Owens keeps a specific eye out for Scottish prop Simon Berghan scrummaging on his knees. “If he’s got a tendency to drop you’ve got to force him on to his knees to make it clear for the ref,” said Hatley. “If he picks it up he picks it up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/24/childrens-and-teens-roundup-best-new-picture-books-and-novels","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"Children’s and teens roundup: the best new picture books and novels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/24/childrens-and-teens-roundup-best-new-picture-books-and-novels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/24/childrens-and-teens-roundup-best-new-picture-books-and-novels","fields":{"headline":"Children’s and teens roundup: the best new picture books and novels","bodyText":"This month, Nosy Crow celebrates the centenary of voting rights for (some) women with an anthology of work by contemporary female authors, ideal for readers of eight plus. Crammed with assured writing from Katherine Woodfine, Catherine Johnson, Sally Nicholls and others, Make More Noise examines girls’ access to money, education, respect and power. It’s a thought-provoking collection of short stories. Capable girls also battle patriarchal values in Robin Stevens’s A Spoonful of Murder (Puffin), the latest in the bestselling series starring 1930s schoolgirl detectives Hazel Wong and Daisy Wells. This instalment, set in Hong Kong, features ultra-English Daisy feeling “foreign” for the first time, an unexpected development in the Wong family – and a murder close to home for Hazel. Stevens’s combination of meticulous research, character development and a knotty plot is guaranteed to please. MG Leonard’s entomological trilogy comes to a spectacular conclusion in Battle of the Beetles (Chicken House), featuring chitinous villain Lucretia Cutter on her most ambitious quest yet for world domination. As anti-beetle feeling surges, Darkus, Bertolt, Virginia and their six-legged pals must find Lucretia’s secret Amazon biome before she releases a wave of giant Frankenbeetles that will change the world for ever. From Usborne, meanwhile, for readers of seven years and up, comes Politics for Beginners by Louie Stowell, Alex Frith and Rosie Hore, which clearly explains the basic principles of decision-making and political representation. As well as history, it explores differing ideologies and poses the big questions without ever patronising or overwhelming the reader. Kellan Stover’s infographic-style illustrations keep the packed pages vivid and accessible. For five plus, Fantastically Great Women Who Made History (Bloomsbury) doesn’t disappoint as a follow-up to Fantastically Great Women Who Changed the World, one of the first and best titles in the current boom celebrating female achievement. Here Kate Pankhurst chronicles the careers of heroines both close to home (Ada Lovelace, Boudicca) and further afield (Qiu Jin, Pocahontas), conveying a strong sense of each woman’s journey. Speech bubbles featuring notable sayings – “Do NOT tell me women are not the stuff of heroes” – add to the excitement. Horrible Science illustrator Tony De Saulles turns his hand to series fiction in the zingy yellow-jacketed Bee Boy: Clash of the Killer Queens (Oxford), an illustrated tale of lonely boy Melvin Meadly, his tower-block beehive and what happens when he enters the bees’ tiny world (and acclaimed as “Marrzzter”). Conservation, friendship and the joys of mastering unusual skills are interwoven with verbal and visual humour. There’s another unlikely hero in Sam Wu Is NOT Afraid of Ghosts! (Egmont), a husband-and-wife collaboration by Katie and Kevin Tsang, with lively pictures from Nathan Reed. Sam Wu has yet to live down an embarrassing incident on a school trip to the space museum. Can he re-establish his cred with the acquisition of a terrifying new pet? Amusingly hyperbolic and likable, Sam is an engaging protagonist - though it’s his little sister, Lucy, who kicks serious butt. Picture books this month are similarly rich in absurd humour. Best avoided by small readers upset by death (even the comic demise of cartoon bangers), Michelle Robinson and Tor Freeman’s Ten Fat Sausages (Andersen) gives an irresistible twist to the well-known counting rhyme. Its hapless chipolatas hope to escape the fatal “pop” – but, alas, meet other grisly fates in the attempt. Bright condiments, stricken-looking frankfurters and wicked comedy will appeal to the ruthless reader. For the more tender hearted, Supertato creators Sue Hendra and Paul Linnet return with Simon Sock (Hodder), illustrated with energetic charm by Nick East. This entertaining tale of an odd sock’s search for a stripy mate to go on adventures with features a series of increasingly surreal pairings – and a fruity twist at the end. Meanwhile, Superbat author-illustrator Matt Carr turns his attention to arachnids in Spyder (Scholastic), an espionage caper in retro graphic style, all saturated blue and orangey-red. Follow the eight-legged agent on her mission: to save a birthday cake from Bluebottle’s unhygienic appetites. Spider facts, unusual perspectives and humour make for a diverting original story. For young adult readers, Sara Barnard sifts the thorny issue of teacher-student relationships in Goodbye, Perfect (Macmillan), told from the perspective of Eden, the resolutely unacademic best friend of high achiever Bonnie. Eden knows Bonnie has a secret boyfriend – but not that he is her music teacher. When Bonnie and “Jack” run away together, Eden faces a painful choice: betray her friend’s confidence, or allow her to slip for ever beyond reach. This gripping novel examines anxiety, identity, pressure and power with Barnard’s characteristic lightness of touch. Spare, laser-focused verse from award-winning US author Jason Reynolds is interspersed with Chris Priestley’s tenebrous illustrations in the intensely powerful Long Way Down (Faber). Will’s brother Shawn has been shot on the street: now Will must avenge him. But as the lift carrying Will – and his brother’s gun – moves down towards the lobby, the ghosts of his past join him at every floor, telling their own stories, and calling certainty into question. The harsh beauty of Reynolds’ writing (“Shawn was zipped into a bag/ and rolled away, his blood added/ to the pavement galaxy of/ bubblegum stars ...”) communicates both the inescapable, widening reach of a gang blood feud and the love and terror underlying it. Finally, Landscape With Invisible Hand (Walker), a savage science-fiction satire from MT Anderson, posits an alien invasion that leaves the human underclass dependent on the ruling vuvv for access to food and jobs. Enamoured of 1950s movie values, the vuvv can be charmed by artificial displays of chaste, “gee whizz” romance – but can artist Adam earn enough from such displays to afford medical care, even as he and his girlfriend start to hate each other? Mordant and meditative, Anderson’s writing intertwines social satire with ideas of despair, hope and the nature of art."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/21/lloyds-bumper-profits-deliver-1bn-bonanza-for-shareholders","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T14:52:06Z","webTitle":"Lloyds to hand £3bn to shareholders as profits jump 24% to £5.3bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/21/lloyds-bumper-profits-deliver-1bn-bonanza-for-shareholders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/21/lloyds-bumper-profits-deliver-1bn-bonanza-for-shareholders","fields":{"headline":"Lloyds to hand £3bn to shareholders as profits jump 24% to £5.3bn","bodyText":"Lloyds Banking Group is to hand more than £3bn in dividends and surplus capital to shareholders and has awarded its chief executive a bumper £6.4m payout just nine months after returning to full private ownership following its taxpayer bailout in 2008. The group, the largest bank in Britain with 27 million customers, posted a 24% jump in pretax profits to £5.3bn. In a bonanza for shareholders, Lloyds hiked its dividend by 20% and announced a buyback programme worth an extra £1bn. The chief executive António Horta-Osório’s pay, including bonuses, increased 11% to £6.4m in 2017 from £5.8 in 2016. Unions said it contrasted with an average pay increase for staff of just 2% in 2017. In a scathing attack on Britain’s banks on Tuesday the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, promised “a fundamental rethink of whom finance should serve and how it should be regulated … We will take decisive action to make finance the servant of industry, not the masters of us all.” But in a surprise response, Horta-Osório said: “I have read what Jeremy Corbyn said. He is very focused on ensuring the banks are helping the real economy, and that is what Lloyds is also about.” He promised a new three-year £3bn investment in the bank and billions more in loans for startups and small businesses. In an upbeat assessment of the British economy, Horta-Osório said that while the UK faces political and economic uncertainty “we see an economy that is resilient, employment growth to continue … and where exports are growing consistently ahead of imports for the first time in six years. We expect GDP growth in 2018 to be around the same levels as 2017.” But he warned mortgage customers of pricing pressure that could see loan interest rates march upwards as the Bank of England’s term funding scheme ends this month. Under the TFS banks have borrowed £106bn from the Bank of England at rock-bottom interest rates, but that money must now be repaid. Analysts are pencilling in the next rise in the Bank of England base rate for May, but Horta-Osório predicted that rates would rise only gently over the next few years, reaching just 1.25% by 2020. Lloyds continues to be dogged by payouts for payment protection insurance mis-selling. It took a £1.65bn charge for PPI last year, up from £1bn in 2016. The lender had to pay £600m in the fourth quarter after weekly complaints rose from 9,000 to 11,000. Lloyds’ bill for the PPI mis-selling scandal now stands at £18.7bn. Undeterred by past mis-selling scandals, the bank sees pensions and insurance as its major growth area for future years. It has set itself the target of obtaining a million new pension customers by 2020. The branch network will continue to slim down – Lloyds announced 49 closures in November – but Horta-Osório declined to give a figure on further cuts despite being repeatedly pressed. He pledged the bank would maintain its share of all bank branches in the UK at about 21% of the total. The surge in profits and payouts saw Lloyds shares climb nearly 3% higher despite higher PPI provisions than expected. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank of England’s decision in November to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade was welcome news for Lloyds. “There’s a lot to like in Lloyds’ numbers, with profits rising, costs under control and prodigious amounts of cash being thrown off to shareholders. “The Bank of England can take its fair share of credit for Lloyds’ profits, as rising interest rates have delivered a boost to the top line. For the banking industry the prospect of rising rates after a decade of loose monetary policy is a bit like finally coming across an oasis in the middle of the desert.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/21/australia-wrap-up-t20-tri-series-with-dls-win-over-new-zealand","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T09:57:44Z","webTitle":"Australia wrap up T20 tri-series with DLS win over New Zealand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/21/australia-wrap-up-t20-tri-series-with-dls-win-over-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/21/australia-wrap-up-t20-tri-series-with-dls-win-over-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"Australia wrap up T20 tri-series with DLS win over New Zealand","bodyText":"Australia put in another accomplished Twenty20 performance to win the Trans-Tasman tri-series with a whimper not of their choosing. Victory by 19 runs via Duckworth Lewis Stern made it five wins in a row for this band of Big Bash League-bred specialists – and stand-in skipper David Warner. They have been too much for England and here at Eden Park, for the third time, New Zealand. Both Warner and head coach Darren Lehmann will miss the bulk of the post-match celebrations: an early morning call awaits for a flight to Sydney and then onto Johannesburg where they will join up with the Test squad. Their time in transit will be well-spent reflecting on a remarkable about-turn in Australia’s T20 fortunes: one summed up by the fact they started this mini-tournament on 3 February as seventh in the world and now sit second in the ICC rankings. Such a dramatic swing can be explained by the “unusual” concentration of international T20s in this, only the second international tri-series. The five fixtures in the last three weeks matches the number played by Australia during the whole of 2017. Returning to the scene of last Friday’s slugfest, when Australia chased down a world record 244 with seven balls to spare, there were fewer runs and spectators on a Wednesday night. Part of the blame can be attributed to Ashton Agar. In a T20 world where leg spinners are sending franchise owners wild, Agar’s spell of three for 27 was one for the orthodox guys. Backed to the hilt by Warner, he was brought on in the fourth over – the first time Australia has gone for spin in the power play overs this series. But the brunt of his work was done in his next three overs: gutting the Blackcaps middle order with the wickets of Kane Williamson, Mark Chapman and Colin de Grandhomme. “We spoke about it in the team meeting and the other day we saw that if you are going at 10s or 12s you might as well try something,” said Warner, when asked of Agar’s deployment in the first six overs. “I know my own tactics were that if a bowler starts well you give him another over. But I thought tonight just change it up a bit. I had a word with Finchy and said ‘What about just throwing Ash the ball?’ Tonight he came out and bowled well.” Warner also reserved special praise for Glenn Maxwell. A stop-start summer – in that order – has seen Maxwell walk away with the T20 man of the series gong, with 233 runs at a remarkable 116.5. “I’m very happy for him and very pleased. You could see it hurt him to get dropped form that one-day team and obviously vying for Test selection at the start of the summer. He’s the type of player to go back, get on with it and train to make sure he’s getting the numbers on the board. He’s put the numbers on the board time and time again this year and we’re really happy with where he is and his mental state with the game as well.” With Billy Stanlake and Kane Richardson restricting the damage done by openers Martin Guptill (21) and Colin Munro (29), Ross Taylor’s senior hand of 43 from 38 deliveries, featuring three boundaries and just one six, did at least ensure a target of 151 to provide enough back-and-forth for the 20,072 that came through the gates. David Warner and D’Arcy Short were not in the mood for nuance, taking Australia to 55-0 after six overs, which is where the score remained until the first batch of rain had cleared. When play resumed, Short brought up his second international T20 fifty before holing out to long on long on the ball after, off Munro, for 72 for one. It was a start, though, that meant even though Short was the first of three wickets to fall in the space of 15 balls for just 12 runs, a 20 not out and 18 not out from Maxwell and Aaron Finch respectively ensured that the required scoring rate was always under control. The second delay, coming with 30 needed off 32, confirmed an Australian win. That joy was soured by yet another shoulder injury sustained by Chris Lynn. The crumb of comfort is that it was his right shoulder that was dislocated when attempting to save a single at the start of the ninth over, having had three previous issues with the left one since 2015. He was meant to travel to the Pakistan Super League on Thursday to play for the Lahore Qalandars. Instead, he will now miss the tournament, returning to Queensland instead for further scans on his shoulder. The road to be fit for his $1.86m IPL gig with Kolkata Knight Riders starts here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/21/peter-dutton-joins-frontbench-rebuff-of-abbotts-immigration-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T08:07:35Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton joins frontbench rebuff of Abbott's immigration speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/peter-dutton-joins-frontbench-rebuff-of-abbotts-immigration-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/peter-dutton-joins-frontbench-rebuff-of-abbotts-immigration-speech","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton joins frontbench rebuff of Abbott's immigration speech","bodyText":"Peter Dutton has joined Scott Morrison in rebuffing a push by Tony Abbott to cut migration, arguing the government “has got the settings right”. But Abbott has immediately returned fire, accusing Morrison of being “captured” by the treasury and being tin-eared politically, living in a “Canberra bubble” and swallowing the advice of “so-called experts”. Morrison early on Wednesday comprehensively rebuffed a new public foray by Abbott contending that migration should be cut by 80,000 places, and he was joined later in the day by Dutton, the home affairs minister, who was more diplomatic than the treasurer during an outing at the National Press Club, but also argued in favour of the status quo. Abbott ignored the Dutton rebuff and used a radio interview to return fire on Morrison, declaring the treasurer was “wrong” and had been “captured” by his department. “Let me repeat that, that is Scott’s problem, he has been captured by his department,” Abbott told 2GB. “Treasury is always in favour of more migration, but the point that I make ... is we cannot let the treasury’s accounting rules determine what is in our long-term and medium-term best national interest. “I want us to win the next election and, sure, people like Scott can say, ‘oh, everything we are doing now is right’. If you believe the polls, and it is the prime minister who, let’s face it, sets such great store by the polls, if you believe the polls, obviously we aren’t doing everything right.” Abbott said he had “some experience” winning elections and taking seats off the Labor party, and was therefore qualified to express a view. “If we want to have a fighting chance of winning the next election, some things have got to change and this is something which we could well change, which I think would be principled, pragmatic and maybe even popular,” Abbott said. Abbott used a speech at the Sydney Institute on Tuesday to call on the Turnbull government to cut immigration levels from 190,000 people a year to 110,000. Morrison said that proposal would cost the budget $4-5bn over four years. The treasurer noted the permanent migration intake was “exactly the same as it was” when Abbott was prime minister and had remained the same since 2011. Dutton has previously signalled interest in cutting the intake, but on Wednesday at the National Press Club he said his comments in mid-February “wasn’t a departure from what I’ve said previously”. He said as the minister responsible for immigration, “I want to bring people in as young as possible, as highly skilled as possible, so they’re paying taxes for longer, they’re contributing to Australian society and that they’re helping build our nation”. “The number will ebb and flow, but that’s the basis on which we’ve made decisions about our migration program,” he said. “There’s an economic benefit to bringing people in who are skilled, who will work and pay taxes and contribute to society. It’s not just a social dividend. There’s a significant economic dividend.” In a broad-ranging speech, Dutton flagged reworking the foreign fighters legislation to allow returning combatants to be prosecuted successfully – although he ruled out withdrawing from international treaties as a mechanism to toughen the domestic legal framework. Dutton flagged the desirability of school children making a loyalty pledge to Australia. “In my view, there is a place for the pledge in a broader, rejuvenated civics effort with school-age children, regardless of their background.” The minister also defended the length of time it was taking to investigate the head of the border force, Roman Quaedvlieg, who has been on leave with pay for nine months while allegations that he arranged employment for a girlfriend are investigated. Dutton said the current processes were about ensuring natural justice prevailed and he didn’t intend to interfere in a legal process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/feb/21/newsweek-plunged-into-chaos-by-its-own-reporters-expose","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T19:25:57Z","webTitle":"Newsweek plunged into chaos by its own reporters' exposé","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/21/newsweek-plunged-into-chaos-by-its-own-reporters-expose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/feb/21/newsweek-plunged-into-chaos-by-its-own-reporters-expose","fields":{"headline":"Newsweek plunged into chaos by its own reporters' exposé","bodyText":"Newsweek, once one of the most powerful publications in US media, has a scoop on its hands – one that has plunged the troubled title further into chaos. On Tuesday the magazine published an exposé of its owner’s ties to a small evangelical Christian school, Olivet University, founded by the controversial Korean pastor David Jang. Staff were fired and several editors threatened to resign as management tried to interfere in the publication of the story. The story – entitled “Why is the Manhattan DA looking at Newsweek’s ties to a Christian university?” – details links between Newsweek Media Group and Olivet University’s efforts to develop a campus in upstate New York. The Manhattan district attorney’s office raided the downtown newsroom of Newsweek in January, taking 18 computer servers. Its investigations have been reported to be into ties between Olivet and Newsweek Media Group, formerly known as IBT Media. Jonathan Davis, co-founder of Newsweek Media Group, is the husband of Tracy Davis, president of Olivet University. After the raid Olivet denied “shared ownership interests” with Newsweek but acknowledged “payment for a licensing and R&amp;D arrangement”. According to the Newsweek report, tax records show Newsweek Media Group paid Olivet millions of dollars for licensing and research and development agreements. Olivet also offered New York county officials free advertising in Newsweek, according to the report, as it sought permits and tax breaks for its new campus. In 2017 Newsweek ran 10 full-page ads – valued at about $149,000 (£106,000) – promoting local services, all free of charge. “At the same time as Newsweek Media Group was giving away $150k in free advertising as part of negotiations to secure property for Olivet University, I watched reporters in tears as they laid off two-thirds of the people in the newsroom,” Newsweek’s associate politics editor, Jason Le Miere, tweeted on Tuesday night. The story was accompanied by an extraordinary editors’ note describing turmoil at the magazine and “egregious breaches of confidentiality and journalism ethics”. “As we were reporting this story, Newsweek Media Group fired Newsweek editor Bob Roe, executive editor Ken Li and senior politics reporter Celeste Katz for doing their jobs,” it read. “As we continued working on the story, we were asked to take part in a review process which, we ultimately learned, involved egregious breaches of confidentiality and journalism ethics.” The editors claimed “subjects of the story were shown parts of the draft, if not the entire piece, prior to publication by a company executive who should not have been involved in the process”. The Daily Beast, which used to be owned by the same company as Newsweek, reported that the story had been in the works for weeks and had encountered “significant headwinds” from management. The editors and reporters involved in the Olivet piece said they resisted efforts of management to influence the story and “felt they would be forced to resign”. However, a senior Newsweek Media Group executive then promised that the company’s owners would ensure editorial independence in the future. Eventually the story was published, but not without another note at the bottom reading: “Celeste Katz contributed reporting to this article before she was fired.” Newsweek Media Group, which bought the 85-year-old publication in 2013, did not immediately return a request for comment. The editors’ note in full As we were reporting this story, Newsweek Media Group fired Newsweek editor Bob Roe, executive editor Ken Li and senior politics reporter Celeste Katz for doing their jobs. Reporters Josh Keefe and Josh Saul were targeted for firing before an editor persuaded the company to reverse its decision. As we continued working on the story, we were asked to take part in a review process, which, we ultimately learned, involved egregious breaches of confidentiality and journalism ethics. We believe that subjects of the story were shown parts of the draft, if not the entire piece, prior to publication by a company executive who should not have been involved in the process. At an on-the-record interview with the subjects of this story, a company official asked editors to identify confidential sources. On-the-record sources were contacted and questioned about their discussions with Newsweek Media Group reporters.

AC/DC’s Highway to Hell booms so loudly that the chairs in the theatre seems to move in time to the music. Onstage, a female Boba Fett performs a strip routine with actual flames. A female Luke Skywalker enters, bends over seductively and twerks along to a Nicki Minaj song as she scrubs her Landspeeder. The crowd – a mix of couples, tie-loosened workmates, tipsy sci-fi hobbyists and burlesque aficionados – have gathered for a single, united goal: to watch their favourite Star Wars characters drop trou, don nipple tassels and swing lightsabers to a selection of pop hits and film-score highlights. The Star Wars burlesque parody show The Empire Strips Back has been packing out Australian theatres since 2011, when it opened in Sydney and swiftly became a word-of-mouth phenomenon. Its creator, Russall S Beattie, conceived the show as a fun break between more serious, artistic burlesque seasons, hoping for a three-night run and modest ticket returns in Newtown. The show went on to consume Beattie’s burlesque business, cropping up in capital cities across Australia and playing for an estimated 50,000 people. Now, after a lot of what Beattie describes as “red tape”, The Empire Strips Back is poised to take on the United States. The show has given thousands of Australians their first experience of burlesque. My own date to a 2014 performance at Newtown’s Enmore Theatre leaned over and asked me what exactly happened at a burlesque show. After a dominatrix Darth Vader performed a suggestive routine set to the Imperial March, I think she had her answer. Burlesque has always been an art form that’s in on the joke (it originates from the Italian “burla” – ridicule or mockery), which makes it an ideal vehicle for parody. It grew out of the Victorian “extravaganza” style, which took serious opera and literature and applied broad comic satire (usually with music) that played to the masses. These days, burlesque continues to skewer social power and sexual politics by demystifying the body and our hang-ups about it via its two most enduring elements: striptease and comedy. Given this, the Empire Strips Back makes it seem perfectly natural to consider a scene where Jawas de-metal a sensual C-3P0, revealing her true female form. Australia has rediscovered its soft spot for burlesque, especially when combined with its close cousins, cabaret and circus arts. Burlesque experienced a renaissance in the early 2010s alongside a renewed interest in vintage, rockabilly and pinup fashion, creating a space for alt-performers – mostly women – to work outside traditional performance spaces. Now you’ll find sex-tinged, revealing variety nights at the Sydney Opera House every summer (take this year’s Limbo Unhinged, for example), and they remain spotted through our major arts festivals (Briefs, a circus-cabaret-boylesque night, was a highlight of this year’s Sydney festival) as well as fringe events and shows at alternative venues including Sydney’s Red Rattler and Melbourne’s Butterfly Club. In this landscape, The Empire Strips Back fits right in. Australian audiences kept Star Wars in cinemas for five years after its October 1977 release, and there is still a thirst for the films as well as merchandise, cosplay and conventions. When Beattie realised The Empire Strips Back had staying power, he “destroyed the show and built it from scratch”, building up his behind-the-scenes team with craftspeople who worked on some of the later Star Wars films (the costumes and props can cost up to $30,000 a piece). “The best way to sell a gag is to set it up correctly,” Beattie explains. “And the best way to set up our gags is having the characters closest to [what] people know them from the movies.” The Stormtrooper chorus line remain from his original show and have been joined by a full-size Jabba the Hutt and a rideable Tauntaun. The Empire Strips Back has been able to flourish owing to Australia’s generous parody laws, and the production will land in the US in June – thanks to its legal similarities around fair use of copyrighted creations. “We can’t go to New Zealand,” Beattie says, and the UK only became a touring possibility for the show three years ago, when the country first defined copyright parody protections in legislation. Overseas, Beattie expects to rely on Star Wars fans for success and promotion. Everyone knows Star Wars, even if they haven’t seen the films. It’s a strategy the Disney corporation itself relies on to drive engagement, and Beattie’s team, complete with a female Luke Skywalker expressing her journey through cheeky choreography, seem poised for continued success. “[Star Wars fans] don’t see this show as a separate thing any more,” Beattie says. “They see it as an extension of the universe.” • The Empire Strips Back is showing at Perth’s Regal Theatre on 2 March and 3 March, and Melbourne’s Palais Theatre on 9 March"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/20/florida-shooting-conspiracy-theory-actors-benjamin-kelly-shawn-harrison","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T01:25:13Z","webTitle":"Aide to Florida lawmaker fired after suggesting shooting survivors are actors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/20/florida-shooting-conspiracy-theory-actors-benjamin-kelly-shawn-harrison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/20/florida-shooting-conspiracy-theory-actors-benjamin-kelly-shawn-harrison","fields":{"headline":"Florida Republican's aide fired for false suggestion shooting survivors are actors","bodyText":"An aide to a Florida lawmaker was fired after falsely suggesting that student survivors of the mass shooting in Parkland were “actors”, repeating a conspiracy theory that has been used to harass victims. Benjamin Kelly, an aide to Republican state representative Shawn Harrison, was terminated after a reporter published his email attacking the students who have become vocal advocates for stricter gun laws after surviving the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school massacre that killed 17 people last week. Kelly emailed a Tampa Bay Times reporter on Tuesday, saying two of the outspoken high schoolers “are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen”. When asked for evidence, Kelly sent a link to a YouTube conspiracy video targeting one of the students, the newspaper reported. Late Tuesday, Harrison announced that Kelly had been fired and said he was “appalled at and strongly denounce his comments”, adding that he was “sorry for any pain this has caused the grieving families of this tragedy”. In recent years, mass shooting survivors and victims’ families have been subjected to online harassment and attacks from conspiracy theorists who go viral on social media by falsely claiming the tragedies were hoaxes and that witnesses and grieving relatives were paid “crisis actors”. Often they have claimed the government staged the shootings to advance gun control policies. High school students who survived the Parkland tragedy – where a former student used an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle to kill students and staff – have rapidly mobilized to fight for policy reforms. Rightwing media, however, have quickly responded with attacks on the young activists mourning their deceased classmates, and conspiracy theories proven to be false appear to have even influenced a legislative staffer. Conspiracy videos targeting one of the students, David Hogg, rapidly spread on YouTube, which appeared to be prominently promoting the footage in search results on Tuesday. Senator Marco Rubio, who has faced backlash this week for accepting money from the National Rifle Association, said that calling the students actors was “the work of a disgusting group of idiots with no sense of decency”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/22/cost-of-living-pushing-australian-workers-into-homelessness","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T17:00:12Z","webTitle":"Cost of living pushing Australian workers into homelessness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/22/cost-of-living-pushing-australian-workers-into-homelessness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/22/cost-of-living-pushing-australian-workers-into-homelessness","fields":{"headline":"Cost of living pushing Australian workers into homelessness","bodyText":"The number of employed Australians seeking help for homelessness has jumped by almost 30% in three years, sparking concerns that stagnant wage growth and high housing costs are pushing workers to the brink. The Victorian-based Council to Homeless Persons has released an analysis showing 20,302 employed Australians sought homelessness support in 2016-17, well up from 15,931 in 2013-14. The council has blamed the rise on a combination of sluggish wage growth and extreme housing costs. On Wednesday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the latest wage data, which showed wages grew by just 2.1% last year. Housing costs grew by 3.4% in the same period. That’s only adding to the profound pressure on people like Mim, who works in out-of-home care in Victoria. Mim, who only has one name, fled a violent relationship many years ago, taking her three children with her. She immediately found herself homeless. The four of them squashed into the family’s four-wheel-drive ute – the two youngest in the back, and Mim and her eldest boy in the front. There were times when Mim couldn’t see a way out. “When I was stuck in it, I was just stuck. I just felt like the worst parent on the planet,” Mim told Guardian Australia. “I felt like a huge failure, actually. I think that fed into the stress as well. “When you feel like the worst parent on the planet … it feeds into not feeling like anyone is going to want you either – anyone’s going to want you for work, or anyone’s going to want you for housing, the lot of it.” The family, through sheer determination, found a way to survive, eventually securing emergency accommodation and later government housing. Now in her 40s, Mim is again nearing breaking point. She lives in Taggerty, about two hours away from her workplace in Burwood, on Melbourne’s outskirts. A recent injury has left her unable to work and her worker’s compensation payments have been withheld due to problems outside her control. The money she does have goes to rent and petrol. She’s currently living in what she jokingly described as a “bush shack”, which she’s using as a stopgap solution until she finds a private rental. Nothing she’s seen so far is within her reach. “I’ve got three kids and I wonder – they’ve all had such big experiences – I wonder if any of them will have kids,” Mim said. “But if they ever do, I want to be a grandma that’s able to buy grouse things for their grandkids, or help out with school fees. All the things my kids never had – I’d love to be able to do all of that.” The ABS data showed wages grew by 0.6% in the December quarter and 2.1% throughout last year. Public sector wages grew the most, increasing by 2.4% through the year. Private sector wages rose by 1.9%. The Council to Homeless Persons policy and communications manager, Kate Colvin, said the disparity between wage growth and high housing costs was putting a lot of strain on workers, particularly those who were working infrequently or in insecure employment. “If that disparity continues, we’ll only see more and more people homeless while they’re working,” she said. “Then the challenge is that people become homeless [and] it’s just even harder to engage in paid work, because if you’re moving around between friends’ places, couch surfing, it’s hard to have the stability to work.” Unions have said Wednesday’s ABS figures put wage growth at a near-record low. The Australian Council of Trade Unions assistant secretary, Scott Connolly, said the figures were at odds with 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth in Australia. The ACTU said workers needed more power to negotiate fair pay rises. “Right now big corporations have too much power and working people have too little,” Connolly said. “We need to change the rules so that there is a fair power balance between working people and big business.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2018/feb/22/david-squires-on-footballs-place-in-australias-bounty-of-wonders","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T17:00:10Z","webTitle":"David Squires on ... football's place in Australia's bounty of wonders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/feb/22/david-squires-on-footballs-place-in-australias-bounty-of-wonders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/feb/22/david-squires-on-footballs-place-in-australias-bounty-of-wonders","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on ... football's place in Australia's bounty of wonders","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/feb/21/tory-mps-urge-theresa-may-to-ignore-demands-of-brexiter-unicorn-chasers-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T17:49:26Z","webTitle":"UK needs to provide 'more clarity' about Brexit plans, Dutch PM tells May – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/feb/21/tory-mps-urge-theresa-may-to-ignore-demands-of-brexiter-unicorn-chasers-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/feb/21/tory-mps-urge-theresa-may-to-ignore-demands-of-brexiter-unicorn-chasers-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"UK needs to provide 'more clarity' about Brexit plans, Dutch PM tells May – as it happened","bodyText":"Theresa May has been urged by the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte to provide “more clarity” about her plans for Brexit. (See 5pm.) Rutte made his comments before the government published a 10-page document setting out its proposals for the Brexit transition period. A leaked version was published this morning, and the official text confirms that the government has not yet committed itself to an end date for the transition. But Downing Street says the transition will not be open-ended. Jeremy Corbyn has sought to exploit divisions in the Conservative party over Brexit by pressing Theresa May at prime minister’s questions for more details on the deal she hopes to strike with the EU. The UK’s aid budget will not be cut as a result of the sexual exploitation scandal affecting the sector, the prime minister has confirmed in a push back against the right wing of her party. Labour has stepped up its war of words with rightwing newspapers over claims that Jeremy Corbyn met a Czechoslovakian spy in the 1980s, calling the allegations “completely surreal” and “utterly ridiculous”. Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary, has launched a nine-month review into how the NHS addresses concerns about medical treatments, including vaginal mesh devices. The number of Poles, Latvians and other eastern European nationals working in Britain fell by 5% last year, providing fresh evidence that a “Brexodus” is under way. Immigration can be a euphemism for race, and Labour should not be afraid to fundamentally change the conversation about the benefits of migration, the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has said. As Jessica Elgot reports, in a speech where Abbott pledged Labour would end family break-up through the immigration system, the MP said the party’s immigration policy in government would be value-led and humane. Abbott said the success of Labour in the 2017 general election, against the grain of its sister centre-left parties in Europe, showed it was possible to win votes without scapegoating migrants. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said the Democratic Unionists are not contemplating introducing an Irish language act in Northern Ireland. She said a leaked document on negotiations with Sinn Fein before the collapse of powersharing talks last week was only one of a number circulated. Speaking after a meeting with Theresa May, she said: We were not contemplating bringing in an Irish language act and I could not be clearer in relation to that. If you look at the so-called draft agreement that is only one of a number of documents that were circulated and put out and about, and I think the important thing is that we now reflect on where we got to in relation to all of those issues, we have a budget put in place, I think that is important for the people of Northern Ireland and that we move forward. A poll has been released showing Labour 26 points ahead of the Conservatives in London and on course to ensure that the Tories lose control of at least three of their councils in the capital, Wandsworth, Westminster and Barnet, the Evening Standard has reported. Labour MP Kate Hoey has been accused of putting Brexit before peace in Northern Ireland in a sustained verbal attack at a House of Commons committee. Britain’s departure from the EU will hit the economy in Ireland more than that of any other country in Europe, with a hard Brexit costing it about €18bn (£16bn), a study has found. That’s all from me for today. Thanks the comments. If there are any differences between the implementation period plans published by DExEU, and the draft leaked to Bloomberg earlier, I have not been able to spot them. Skimming through both versions of the 10-page document, they both seem the same. The key paper, Draft Text for Discussion: Implementation Period (pdf), is now up on the Brexit department’s website. This is the document a draft of which was leaked to Bloomberg earlier. (See 11.10am.) The written ministerial statement from David Davis, the Brexit secretary, about the transtition period has just been published. It runs to one sentence and it says: I am today publishing the UK’s response to the European Commission’s draft legal text on arrangements for the implementation period, copies of which will be deposited in the libraries of both Houses. That means the documents should be available from the department very soon. After his meeting with Theresa May, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, posted a message on Twitter saying the UK needed to provide “more clarity” about its Brexit plans. Earlier today the BBC said we would get the written ministerial statement about the transition period at 9.30am. As the Labour whips point out, it still has not arrived. Remain campaigners have launched a campaign bus claiming the cost of quitting the European Union will be £2bn - or £2,000m - a week. It has been funded by the Is it worth it? campaign, which explains on its website that it has arrived at the £2bn per week figure by extrapolating from the claim in the government’s leaked Brexit impact analysis that GDP would be 5% lower over the next 15 years if the UK ends up outside the single market but having a free trade agreement with the EU. The same analysis - which the government does not accept, because it does not model what ministers say is their desired outcome - says trading with the EU on WTO terms would be even worse for the economy. The bus will be touring the country for the rest of the month. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman and one of the campaign supporters, said: What this bus is about is reminding people of the lies that particularly Boris Johnson put across during the referendum campaign about how 350 million a week was going to be available to the NHS. Clearly it isn’t. The point that is being made on the side of this red bus is that as a result of us leaving the European Union and the impact it will have on growth and the economy, the figures suggest the loss to the UK economy could be as high as 2,000 million a week. On the Daily Politics earlier Steve Baker, the Brexit minister, said that the withdrawal agreement definitely would include a fixed date for the end of the transition. He said: You can see that they [the EU] want us to exit at the end of the budget period, the Prime Minister is suggesting two years. But what will be the case is, when we’ve agreed, there will be a fixed date. A Labour MP has been left “badly shaken up” and bruised after he was mugged on his way home from Parliament on Tuesday night, the Press Association reports. Adrian Bailey, member for West Bromwich West, was near his home in Southwark, south London, when he was attacked by “up to six” hooded assailants at around 10pm. One of the group jumped on his back before being fought off but another attacked Bailey from behind, a statement from the MP said. A third person blocked his exit with a bike, before Bailey shouted for help to someone he thought was a passer-by. They turned out to be a fourth attacker and the MP suffered “a number of blows” and was hit over the head with a “large milk container” during the struggle. Bailey handed over his phone and wallet before the attackers made off and he made his way home to call the police. Despite some “bumps and bruises”, he did not require hospital treatment. In a statement the 72-year-old MP, who is a former chairman of the Commons business committee and who was back at work today, said: I appreciate that many other people have gone through what I went though last night and it really brought home to me the value of having bobbies on the beat to deter such attacks. Every member of the public deserves the right to walk about in a safe and non-threatening environment. The Metropolitan Police response has been excellent and they are working hard with me to identify the perpetrators of this attack. ICM have written up the poll findings which were covered at 2.35pm on their blog here. And here are the tables (pdf). Lawyers acting for a group of Scottish parliamentarians has urged Scotland’s most senior judge to reject attempts by the UK government to block a legal case that would determine whether article 50 can be revoked. The parliamentarians, which includes MEPs, MPs and MSPs from the Scottish Greens, Labour, the Lib Dems and Scottish National party, are appealing against a decision by Lord Doherty earlier this month to reject their case that the European court of justice needed to rule on whether the UK can unilaterally withdraw its article 50 application. Doherty said it was a “hypothetical and academic” case since the UK government had made it clear it had no intention of supporting a vote to abandon Brexit. Doherty said there was no evidence Westminster planned a vote on it either, and therefore no need for a court ruling. Aidan O’Neill QC, acting for the politicians, told Lord Carloway, the President of the Court of Session, and two other appeal judges, Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond John, that Doherty’s stance was “utterly wrong” since it undermined the clear constitutional case that parliament was supreme. He added: This is a minority government and they’re answerable to parliament. Parliament isn’t answerable to them.” O’Neill said it was essential that MPs knew whether they had the right to vote against Brexit later this year: that question could only be settled by the European court. It was a very live issue, and of “profound importance. As things stand, the EU’s treaties were silent on whether a member state could unilaterally revoke an article 50 application. The European Commission and David Davis, the BrexitsSecretary, have both said cancelling an article 50 application had to be agreed by all 27 member states – a position rejected by European legal experts. O’Neill also attacked Doherty’s decision to award full costs for the previous hearing against the seven politicians involved. He said that had a clear “chilling effect” on the case since one of the seven, the SNP MP Joanna Cherry, had dropped out temporarily because of the risks more costs would be awarded against them. Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, is giving evidence to the European scrutiny committee. As my colleague Alan Travis reports, she told them EU nationals coming to the UK after March 2019 would not have the same long-term rights as those already here. (Theresa May has said as much before, but the EU wants EU nationals arriving during the transition to get exactly the same rights as those who arrived before Brexit day.) We’ve got some fresh Guardian/ICM polling. Yesterday I posted figures from the weekend polling showing that a majority of people who give to humanitarian charities are now less likely to do so following the Oxfam Haiti scandal, but we saved the main figures until today. Which party is best on key issues First, we asked people which of the two main parties, the Conservatives or Labour, they trusted most on nine key issues. Labour are ahead of the Conservatives on five of the nine issues we asked about. The Labour lead is particularly strong on health (23 points) and public services generally (21 points), but they are also ahead on education, pensioners and making Britain fairer. The Tories are ahead of Labour on four of the nine issues we asked about. Their biggest leads are on security and controlling immigration (15 points respectively), but they are also ahead on negotiating Brexit and managing the economy. Here is a chart with the figures. Leaders versus their parties on the key issues Polling can be used to explore whether leaders are more popular than their parties. This weekend we framed the question about who was best on which issue in terms of parties (Conservatives v Labour). Last month we asked the same questions, but we framed it in terms of leaders (Theresa May v Jeremy Corbyn). By comparing the results, you can gain some insight into whether a leader is seen as more popular than his/her party generally, or less popular. Here are the figures showing whether May and Corbyn are outperforming or underperforming their party on the nine issues we asked about. (The Conservatives, and May, both score 38% on protecting people, which means May is level with her party, 0%, but Labour scores 23%, and Corbyn scores 21%, which gives him a net score of -2.) An alternative way of looking at this is to compare the red v blue results when the question is framed as a May/Corbyn one, with the results when it is framed as a Conservative/Labour choice. Roughly the results are the same - blue ahead on four issues, red ahead on five. But the blue leads are the same or lower when it is framed in party terms not leader terms, and the red leads are all bigger - sometimes considerably. (For example, Corbyn leads May by 13 points on improving public services, but Labour leads the Tories by 21 points on this measure.) Corbyn personal standing is lower than his party’s on all key issues, the poll suggests. By comparison, May’s personal standing is broadly in line with her party’s on these issues. Voting intention Finally, here are the voting intention figures. Labour has a one-point lead over the Conservatives, the poll suggests. Two weeks ago Labour was one point behind. Here is ICM’s Alex Turk on these figures. This week’s voting intention has Labour up three percentage points to 43%, with the Conservative bumping up by 1 point to 42%. This means that the narrow one point lead for the Conservatives in our last poll has shifted to a narrow one point lead for Labour in our poll out today. We shouldn’t make too much of these small shifts. Indeed, since the last general election in June 2017, no ICM/Guardian poll has shown a lead of more than 2 percentage points for either Labour or the Tories. This makes it a run of 13 polls where we’d consider the result ‘too close to call’, meaning the lead for either main party is within the margin of error. This is totally unprecedented in the regular polling ICM have carried out for The Guardian over almost 35 years – never before have we had so many consecutive polls where the two main parties have been so close to each other. However, we can quite confidently say that Ukip would be highly unlikely to win a general election if it were to be held tomorrow, as they slip down one percentage point to 3%. Whilst Ukip have been on 3% in ICM/Guardian polls before, they have never been lower – this is their joint lowest result since we started regularly asking voting intention about Ukip back in 2012. I will post a link to the tables as soon as they go up on the ICM website. ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,017 adults aged 18+ on 16 to 19 February 2018. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. UPDATE: ICM have written up the poll findings here. And here are the tables (pdf). Earlier I described Susan Elan Jones as a Plaid Cyrmu MP. (See 12.46pm.) She is, of course, a Labour MP, for Clywd South. I apologise for the error. This is how George Osborne’s Evening Standard is reporting the news (see 11.37am) that the government does not want to commit now to the Brexit transition having an end date. Here is my colleague Daniel Boffey’s story. On the World at One Steve Baker, the Brexit minister, has just been asked about the story. Here are the main points he made. Baker claimed the row about the government not proposing a transition end date was a “red herring”. He told the programme: This is a red herring. The prime minister has always been clear that the implementation period should last about two years ... In a negotiation there is a degree of shift too and fro. I just would make the point, if there is any movement, it will be from an earlier date, from the EU’s point of view. They want December 2020 [as the date for the end of the transition] ... Returning to an idea that has been used to disrupt Eurosceptics on and off as long as we have been having this conversation, this idea that it will be an open-ended transition period is a complete red herring. The European Union wants us out of this implementation period. They want us out earlier than the prime minister has currently been saying, for two years. He said Tory backbenchers would back the government’s plans. What was leaked was the government’s draft legal text for a transition, he said. He said it reflected what the prime minister had always said. He went on: I would expect that [Conservative backbenchers] will be content with it. Baker is particularly influential on this topic because, before becoming a minister, he was chair of the European Research Group, the Tory group pushing for a harder Brexit. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs. There are mixed views as to how well Jeremy Corbyn did, but there is general agreement that his decision to raise Brexit was itself significant. From the Daily Mirror’s Jason Beattie From the Sun’s Harry Cole From Sky’s Lewis Goodall From the Guardian’s Jessica Elgot From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From Politico Europe’s Charlie Cooper From the Spectator’s James Forsyth From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman From the Evening Standard’s Pippa Crerar On the Daily Politics Steve Baker, the Brexit minister, has just said he would be “amazed” if Labour ends up voting to support the Brexit withdrawal agreement when it gets finalised towards the end of the year. Andrew Gwynne, the shadow housing secretary, refused to say how he thought his party would vote. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, used his two questions at PMQs to ask about Syria. He said: At least 194 people have been killed in the last 48 hours in eastern Ghouta. Can the prime minster tell the House what discussions she has had with UN colleagues? Theresa May said the government was “appalled by the escalation of air strikes in eastern Ghouta.” She urged the Syrian government to stop the violence and to allow humanitarian access. Blackford then said May should take the issue to the UN. He said: The bombing is relentless, doctors are treating pregnant women and babies that have lost limbs, it is estimated over 100 children have been killed since Sunday ... Will the prime minister show leadership and join me in calling for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to address the horrific genocide unfolding in Syria? May said the government would be talking to the UN. She also urged Russia to do more to stop the violence. She told MPs: The UN has called on governments around the world to call out the action that has been taken ... We will be talking to our colleagues within the UN to ensure the best possible approach can be taken in relation to these issues ... We call on all their backers, including Russia, to ensure this violence stops. I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Labour’s Susan Elan Jones asks if May agrees that losing access to the single market will be disastrous for farmers. May says she wants a good trading relationship with the EU after Brexit. UPDATE: Earlier this post wrongly described Jones as a Plaid Cymru MP. She is, of course, a Labour MP. I’m sorry for the mistake. Ross Thomson, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees that electrocuting dogs is wrong. Will the government ban the use of shock collars? May says the government encourages positive training for dogs. She says Thomson is meeting Michael Gove to discuss this further. Richard Graham, a Conservative, asks about driving instructor having a sexual relationship with a much younger pupil. Will driving instructors be added to the list of professions where such relationships are banned. May says attitudes have changed on this. The education department will look at this, she says. Labour’s Stephen McCabe asks how May would feel if someone stole her car and she had to pay £200 to get it back. Will May put a stop to this? May says the Home Office will look into this. Bob Blackman, a Conservatives, asks May to complain the Polish government about their plan for a law banning reference to Poland being involved in the Holocaust. May says the government has already taken up this issue. The SNP’s Alison Thewliss says a constituent of hers was refused leave to remain in the UK because of an error with his tax return. This was deemed a threat to national security. May says she cannot comment on this case. The Home Office makes its decisions in the national interest, she says. Nigel Evans, a Conservative, asks May if she will tell the aid sector it does need to get its act in order. May says the government retains its commitment to aid, and the aid budget. But it wants to work with organisations which meet proper standards. What happened at Oxfam was appalling, she says. She says an accreditation scheme for aid workers may be established. The SNP’s David Linden asks for an assurance that no more job centres in Glasgow are earmarked for closure. May says the government will ensure there is no decrease in the job centre service available in Scotland. May says the government is committed to devolving more powers to the Scottish parliament in line with the Smith agreement. Responsibility for British Transport Police will be devolved. But the UK government wants to do it in a way that is safe, she says. Labour’s Steve Reed says there is one fire every month involving the cladding of the type used at Grenfell Tower. Why won’t the government take it down? May says enforcement rules were changed under Labour. After the Grenfell Tower fire, the government ordered inspections. Action was taken by fire authorities in areas where this was thought necessary. She says the housing secretary has taken action on the basis of the findings of a review. Sir Mike Penning, a Conservative, asks if May has any good news for the victims of the drug Primodos. May says the victims have powerful stories. She is clear that there is a problem with regulation. We do need to do better, she says. She says the health secretary will make a statement this afternoon announcing a review. Labour’s Tulip Siddiq says if the supply of medical isotopes to the UK is delayed after Brexit, cancer treatment could suffer. May says Siddiq is wrong. She says the availability of medical isotopes will not be affected by the UK’s departure from Euratom. PMQs - Snap verdict: Corbyn receives a lot of criticism for normally avoiding Brexit at PMQs, but today’s exchanges illustrated vividly why he is so reluctant to attack May on this topic. He devoted all six of his questions to the subject but made no real headway at all. Worse, he even achieved the rare feat of allowing May to sound half-authoritative on an issue on which her party is deeply split. There wasn’t anything particularly wrong with Corbyn’s questions. They were nicely phrased (one of them sounded a bit like a lift from my blog intro yesterday) and they made good points. But Brexit is an issue where the detail is crucial, and today Corbyn’s unwillingness to ask forensic follow-up questions was a serious weakness. (Can you imagine what the late Robin Cook would have been like tearing apart the government’s Brexit stategy from the despatch box? After 15 minutes, it would be in tatters.) More tellingly, Corbyn just did not sound very engaged by any of this. When Corbyn talks about housing, or the NHS, or social justice, his passion is evident. But today he came across as someone merely going through the motions, not just uninterested (a bit bored by it all), but disinterested (neutral on the key soft/hard divide) too. Corbyn asks how May hopes to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. May says the government explained that in a paper published last year. Corbyn says Boris Johnson recently gave a speech on Brexit mentioning things like stag parties, carrots and a plague of boils. But he did not mention Ireland. We don’t know from the government’s road to Brexit speeches where it is going. This government is not on the road to Brexit; it is on the road to nowhere. May says Corbyn is meant to ask a question. She says Corbyn should think about the security partnership the UK needs with the EU. She set out her views in a speech last week. She is unconditionally committed to the security of Europe. Normally Corbyn asks May to sign a blank cheque. She knows he likes Czechs but [and whatever came next was obscured by the cheers/groans.] Corbyn says in December the foreign secretary was briefing that the working time directive would be scrapped. The only party that wants to scrap regulations is the Conservative party. May used to say she wanted tariff-free access to the EU. Now it is just going for access that is “as tariff-free as possible”. May says she has not changed her stance. She wants to not just protect workers’ rights, but enhance them, she says. She says the Conservatives commissioned the Taylor report, took action on zero-hours contracts and ensured workers’ voices are heard on board. Corbyn says if May has read today’s Telegraph, she will see that 62 Tories want to deregulate. What is the government’s desired outcome? May says she is happy to answer: a bespoke economic partnership. Jeremy Corbyn says David Davis said yesterday Brexit would not turn Britain into a Mad Max-style dystopia. Couldn’t he set the bar a bit higher? May says the only fiction around is from Labour, which cannot decide what its policy is. Corbyn says a former Tory minster said the government’s Brexit policy could be a gang plank into thin air. Davis said he did not want to deregulate. So why did his own department say their could be opportunities from deregulating on issues like the environment. May rattles through a list of what she wants from Brexit. She does not address the question. She wants to put the people first, she says. Eddie Hughes, a Conservative, asks about policing. May says more money is going to policing. John Bercow interrupts. There is too much noise, he says. He says MPs should think about what the public thinks. The Commons has recently published a report on harassment, he says. May continues. She says the Labour West Midlands police and crime commissioner must defend his record, but money can be spent better. The Labour MP Ruth Cadbury asks about air pollution. The high court has today ruled that the government’s air pollution programme is unlawful, she says. Theresa May says the government has been taking action to improve air quality. But she disputes Cadbury’s account of what the court decided. The court dismissed the complaint from five cities, she says. It agreed the government’s modelling was sound. But it did ask the government to go further in some areas. Overall, on two out of three counts, it found in the government’s favour, she says. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Matthew O’Toole, who was in the Downing Street communications team during the EU referendum, argues that there is an inherent contradiction in what the government is saying about how long the transition will last. On the Daily Politics Steve Baker, the Brexit minister, has just said that the transition period will be time-limited. But he did not say for how long. And here is ITV’s Robert Peston on the Bloomberg leak. Here is the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on the Bloomberg leak. (See 11.10am and 11.37am.) This is a reference to this concession. Here is the key extract from the Bloomberg leak. (See 11.10am.) The square brackets means the government does not accept the EU proposal to set 31 December 2020 as the definite end of the transition. The explanatory note explains why the government does not want to commit to a date now. The Ukip MEP Patrick O’Flynn has described this as “outrageous”. The Brexit department is publishing a ministerial statement about its stance on the transition period today. We were expecting it at 9.30am, but it hasn’t arrived yet. Never mind; Bloomberg seem to know what’s coming, because they have got a leak of a draft legal document setting out the government’s position. As Nikos Chrysoloras and Tim Ross report, it shows that government does not agree to the EU’s proposal for the transition to definitely end on 31 December 2020. Here is an extract from their story. UK prime minister Theresa May is asking the European Union to rethink its plan to end the Brexit transition period that businesses want on the final day of 2020, suggesting such a bridging phase should last as long as it’s needed. The British suggestion of a longer bridging phase risks inflaming May’s already tense relations with eurosceptics in her own Tory party. They want her to take the U.K. out of the bloc as soon as possible and keep any transitional arrangements to a minimum. May says she wants such an implementation period to last around two years, while the European Union has stipulated an end date of December 31, 2020. And here is the text of the document (pdf). In a speech this morning Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said Labour would end “family break-up through the immigration system”. As Alan Travis reports, she said: We will allow the carers or parents of admitted child refugees to come here. We will also end the practice of deporting the children, currently without entitlement to be here, once they turn 18, even when their parents are entitled to be here. Here is Alan’s story. As my colleague Jessica Elgot reports, after the speech Abbott also said Labour was in favour of EU nationals coming to the UK during the transition having exactly the same long-term rights as EU nationals here before. Ministers signalled they intend to press ahead with Tina Stowell’s controverisal appointment as chair of the Charity Commission, with the culture secretary insisting she would be brilliant in the job despite her rejection by a select committee of MPs overnight. Matt Hancock released a statement of support, demonstrating that government believes the former Tory cabinet minister is the right person to take on the job regulating a sector reeling from the fall out of the Oxfam sexual abuse scandal. He said: I’m sure Tina Stowell will be a brilliant chair of the Charity Commission. This is a crucial time for the Commission and the sector. She was appointed after a fair, open and transparent competition. She was not only the best candidate for the job, but is the right candidate and has my full backing. His intervention comes after a pre-appoinment hearing, which saw the cross party committee of MPs conclude that she had “a complete lack of experience” of the charitable sector and lacked “any real insight, knowledge or vision” for the job. The committee set out its conclusions in a letter to Hancock (pdf). Stowell accepted she had “limited experience” of the voluntary sector in the pre-appointment hearing, having previously been leader of the House of Lords between 2014 and 2016 and a senior official at the BBC Trust for nine years in the previous decade. But Hancock dismissed allegations that the former Tory minister would not operate fairly. He said: Tina has been absolutely clear about her impartiality in this role. I know that she will work tirelessly to protect and promote the great work that charities do and ensure they uphold the highest standards of integrity. Formally, the DCMS will now wait for a final report from the select committee. The committee, however, does not have a power of veto, and ministers may proceed with appointing Stowell despite its objections. Since the system of pre-appointment was introduced there have been 96 such hearings, and only five individuals have been negatively assessed. The appointment went ahead in three of those cases. At the hearing on Tuesday, Paul Farrelly, a Labour MP, had asked: “What were the skills, qualifications and experience that were considered by Number 10 to such an extent that perceived political neutrality was not a core consideration?” In reply, Stowell said she had “an experience of nine years at the BBC, dealing with an internal form of regulation” while her time leading the Lords required her to “manage very complex stakeholder relationships.” UPDATE: Labour said it was concerned by Hancock’s remarks and Steve Reed, the shadow minister for civil society, wrote to the Commissioner for Public Appointments to ask if they had been consulted about the proposed appointment of Stowell before her name was announced and whether the commissioner would mount a full inquiry. “It is vital that this appointment is carefully scrutinised so that the public havefull confidence in the Charity Commission,” Reed wrote. Breaking! Britain’s jobless rate has risen for the first time in almost two years. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% in the three months to December, up from 4.3% (a four-decade low). The number of people out of work rose by 46,000 to 1.47 million. But... the number of people in work also rose, by 88,000 during the quarter, to 32.147 million. More here on the business live blog. Owen Smith, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, was also on ITV’s Good Morning Britain this morning. He used his interview to restate his view that the UK should remain in the single market and the customs union after Brexit. This puts him at odds with the party’s official position and with Jeremy Corbyn, who has talked about the UK staying in “a customs union” but who has ruled out staying in the single market. But when this was put to Smith, he rejected claims there was a split, saying “Jeremy’s position is evolving and deepening.” The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, who was one of the MPs who signed the ERG letter (see 9.15am), told ITV’s Good Morning Britain this morning that it would be unacceptable for the UK to be subject to EU rules during the transition without having any say over how they were drawn up. He told the programme: All we’re doing really is underlining [that] we’re not going to be a rule taker, we’re going to be a rule maker. We’re going to have control. We promised the electorate we’d have control of our laws, our borders and our money. We’re laying out a strategy that will deliver that. If we’re just going to merely be a vassal state of the European Union we’re not really leaving the European Union and I think that will reflect very badly on the government and on the next election it will reflect very badly on the Conservative party ... Transition is a difficult one ... what it can’t be is just a continuation of being in the European Union and taking laws that we have no control over. The government accepts that the UK will continue to be subject to EU rules during the transition, although what is as yet unresolved is whether the UK would have any ability to object to new EU rules coming into force during that period that it didn’t like. To their critics, they are the “Mogglodytes”, as Tim Shipman has revealed. Officially, they are the European Research Group, a Tory caucus of hardcore Eurosceptics, currently chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg and pushing the government for a harder form of Brexit. Sixty two of them signed a letter to Theresa May setting out demands for Brexit, and particularly for the transition period, that the prime minister may find it impossible to accept. As Jack Blanchard writes in his Politico Europe morning email, it’s a wonderful example of passive aggressive negotiating. Here is our overnight story about the letter, including the full text of what it says. The backlash has already started. As you would expect, pro-Europeans are denouncing the ERG. This is from the Labour MP Chris Leslie, in a statement issued by Open Britain, which is campaigning for a softer Brexit. The ERG have long felt they can dictate Government policy and they are brazenly advocating the hardest of hard Brexits. They continue to pretend we can have our cake and eat it, but they get away with it because of the Cabinet’s refusal to admit the truth that the Brexit we were promised can never be delivered. With Brextremists on the rampage, people have every right to keep an open mind about whether Brexit is the right choice for our country. More interestingly, pro-European and mainstream Tories are also speaking out. Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, has described the letter as “a ransom note”. The former minister Nick Boles says the ERG does not represent most Tory MPs. Vicky Ford agrees with him. And Anna Soubry - well, she has just let rip at the “unicorn chasers”. More on this all day, I expect. Here is the agenda. 9am: Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, gives a speech on immigration. 9.30am: Unemployment figures are published. Around 9.30am: The Brexit department is expected to publish a written ministerial statement setting out the government’s position on the Brexit transition. 10.30am: A House of Lords committee takes evidence on the impact of Brexit on international player transfers in football and rugby. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 1.30pm: May holds talks at Number 10 with the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte. 2pm: Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, gives evidence to the Commons defence committee. 2.15pm: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

South Korea sees the trip as an opportunity to convince Donald Trump its recent rapprochement with Pyongyang should continue. Its leadership hopes Ivanka can play a moderating role in White House policy – which at times has taken a bellicose stance towards the North. Seoul will also try to encourage direct talks between the US and North Korea. The head of the South’s national security office has said it is working towards a “constructive” dialogue. That is the message Seoul hopes Ivanka will bring back to Washington. But the trip is also a chance to project US solidarity with the South and build goodwill after Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un’s younger sister, was well received during a trip to the opening ceremony on 9 February. “It’s certainly possible that Ivanka will try to do for the United States what Kim Yo-jong did for North Korea,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy. “Ivanka and Kim Yo-jong both derive their power and access from their family ties, and are skilled at getting positive media attention while representing leaders who provoke a lot of controversy.” Comparisons between the Trump family and North Korea’s Kim dynasty abound ahead of the trip, during which the first daughter is expected to meet North Korean refugees – part of US efforts to draw attention to Pyongyang’s dismal human rights record. “Trump runs the White House like a private fiefdom,” said the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper. Ivanka is for “all intents and purposes the first lady of the US rather than Trump’s reluctant wife Melania”. Moon is reportedly planning to lavish her with all the trimmings of a presidential visit, including the possibility of a grand welcome at the airport, despite no diplomatic obligation to do so. South Korea’s first lady, Kim Jung-sook, is also expected to accompany Ivanka during her stay. Exact dates for the trip have not been announced and Pyongyang may send its own high-profile delegation to the closing ceremony on 25 February. “The most likely scenario is that Ivanka plays a positive ceremonial role in public while relaying the administration’s current thinking in private conversation,” Oba said. “She has a chance to repair some of the damage of vice-president [Mike] Pence’s visit and project a sense that she gets along well with President Moon, appreciates South Korea, and values a strong US-South Korea relationship.” Oba and other observers have said the North is trying to drive a wedge between the US and South Korea, and there remains deep uncertainty over the possibility of warming ties lasting beyond the Olympics. Jung H Pak, a fellow at the Brookings Institute and former CIA official, recently stressed the need for a special envoy that could credibly represent Trump on the peninsula, saying “things are about to get very complicated”. “It is critical that there is no daylight between the US and other key stakeholders,” Pak wrote in a column. “Kim [Jong-un’s] tactics to divide and conquer must not be allowed to succeed.” The US has pledged to release plans for joint military exercises at the end of March, which will likely infuriate North Korea. The exercises, typically held in March and April each year, can include more than 300,000 troops from the US and South Korea and elicit annual condemnations from Pyongyang. Pence was in talks to meet in secret with North Korean officials earlier this month during the Winter Olympics opening ceremony, but they were cancelled after the vice-president criticised the North’s human rights record, according to the US side. It is unlikely Ivanka would engage with officials from Pyongyang during her visit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/21/tasmania-on-alert-as-fruit-fly-outbreak-threatens-50m-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T07:44:23Z","webTitle":"Tasmania on alert as fruit fly outbreak threatens $50m industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/tasmania-on-alert-as-fruit-fly-outbreak-threatens-50m-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/tasmania-on-alert-as-fruit-fly-outbreak-threatens-50m-industry","fields":{"headline":"Tasmania on alert as fruit fly outbreak threatens $50m industry","bodyText":"Tasmania’s $50m stone fruit export market is under threat from a fruit fly outbreak, in which more than 60km of the northern coast has been placed under quarantine. Authorities on Wednesday issued a state-wide alert for the pest, which had been detected in produce certified as fruit-fly free and prepared for sale at a supermarket in Devonport. Produce from that supplier has been recalled from retailers, and Tasmanians have been told to double-wrap all fruit and vegetable waste to be placed in the rubbish bin, rather than the compost, to prevent further outbreaks. Larvae of the Queensland fruit fly was detected in apricots in three backyard orchards on Flinders Island and one in Spreyton, a small town on the Tasmanian mainland near Devonport, in January. On Tuesday, the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DIPIPWE) confirmed that five adult fruit flies, as well as larvae, had been detected in another backyard orchard in George Town, which is 40km east as the crow flies from Spreyton and 30km outside the existing control zone. Control zones are established in a 15km radius around confirmed fruit fly sightings. Since the outbreak was confirmed, authorities have received more than 330 reports of potential fruit flies and trapped more than 23 adult flies. The state’s agriculture minister, Jeremy Rockliff, said the supermarket discovery provided a “clearer idea” of how the pest may have evaded the state’s biosecurity protections. The Hodgman government — which is currently vying for re-election — said it would give Biosecurity Tasmania “a blank cheque to respond to this issue as they see fit”. “It now appears that there may have been a failure in the fruit fly-free certification process on the mainland, rather than an issue with processes in Tasmania,” Rockliff said. Taiwan suspended fruit imports from Tasmania earlier this month, prompting concerns that other Asian countries, which are particularly sensitive to fruit fly incursions and which make up about 75% of the state’s fruit export market, could follow suit. The island state’s agricultural export market, which along with forestry and fishing makes up 9% of its gross state product, is heavily reliant on its pest-free status. Anything that threatens that status could have dire economic consequences, said Prof Anthony Clarke, a leading Australian expert on fruit flies and biosecurity at Queensland University of Technology. “Tasmanian trade is based on the fact that they don’t have fruit flies,” Clarke said. “The suggestion that it could be there is very damaging for negotiating new markets.” Fruit flies have not historically survived the Tasmanian winter, but the state government’s fruit fly strategy warns that risk profile is changing with climate change. Queensland fruit fly primarily affect stone fruit, including cherries, the eighth most valuable agricultural export in 2015-16, with a gross value of $64m. Clarke was “pretty confident” the incursion would be controlled, saying it was “a big enough scare” to encourage the state to tighten up its biosecurity controls, including a network of 1,400 insect traps, which are placed 5km apart at key entry points to the state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/is-ewok-having-a-nice-time-the-special-hell-of-a-going-on-a-cruise","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T23:44:00Z","webTitle":"'Is Ewok having a nice time?': the special hell of a going on a cruise | Brigid Delaney's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/is-ewok-having-a-nice-time-the-special-hell-of-a-going-on-a-cruise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/is-ewok-having-a-nice-time-the-special-hell-of-a-going-on-a-cruise","fields":{"headline":"'Is Ewok having a nice time?': the special hell of going on a cruise","bodyText":"There should be a new word, boganfreude – meaning the thrill you get from reading about bogans behaving badly. Boganfreude arises after reading about anyone who gets really sick drinking arak in Bali, or arrested for sex on a beach after a boozy brunch in Dubai. But the Big Kahuna of the boganfreude genre is cruise ship stories. Last weekend up to 23 members of an extended Italian family were reported to be behind brawls – or “bloodbaths” as News Limited called them – terrorising passengers onboard the Carnival Legend. Remarkably, some passengers were underwhelmed by Carnival Cruise’s offer of 25% off the victims’ next Carnival cruise. We love to read about cruise holidays gone wrong. Remember the Sick Ship – a massive gastro outbreak last year that affected 200 people on Ovation of the Seas? Or the hideous excesses of the cruise taken by the late David Foster Wallace, and explored in excruciating details in an 18,000-word Harper’s Essay? Who hasn’t felt a spiteful shiver of delight in reading about people who spew non-stop for a week on a mega-ship, or who have raw sewage seep into their cabin as they sleep? I don’t do cruises anymore. The first one I went on – a uni booze cruise along the Yarra when I was 19, resulted in me almost losing an eye. I danced too close to someone holding a cigarette and it was inadvertently – perhaps – put out on my eyeball. Years later I can hear the sizzle of my right retina as the burning ember connected with the delicate, light-sensitive tissue. I spent the rest of the term wearing a large eye patch; a sad, friendless pirate who had trouble reading the blackboard. The retina eventually repaired itself. I didn’t set foot on a cruise ship until many years later, when I accepted a travel writing assignment to take a seven-night, 1970s disco-themed cruise around the South Pacific. It was a strange experience. The inside of the ship was like an enormous shopping mall or RSL, filled with shops, dining rooms, a theatre, bars, nightclubs and poker machines. Around us and below were the cabins, each level down as socially stratified as the Titanic (one shudders to think how dark and small the cabins must have been for the crew, the Dalits of the ship). On the walls in the public areas there were many screens – always advertising the pokies (BE A WINNER), or that night’s concert, or the exclusive onboard restaurants, where you paid a “supplement” to dine. Even as a captive in this place – where the ship has a monopoly on your money – there was still the feeling of an aggressive market competition for your attention. The first person I met on the ship was a genial farmer whose wife had cheated on him and, on a whim, he booked a cabin – an inside one, without windows. He barely saw his own bed, hooking up with a different woman each night. The ship was full of divorcees and, after the singers from the 1970s had packed away their wigs and makeup, the late-night bars heaved with drunken fumblings. In the dark, at 3am, the place resembled the uni booze cruises of my youth. On a shore excursion, I didn’t watch where I was going and snorkelled – with some violence – into a member of the Village People. Each day a strange man (was he as strange as me?) roamed the deck filming with an iPad everything up close and with intensity (the food, the empty swimming pools, the fingers of the keyboard players in the cheesy reggae band). At the conclusion of dinner each night, people sang: “Aussie, Aussie, Aussie! Oi, oi, oi!” There was a woman at my table (you get assigned a table and dine with the same people each night) who was travelling with a life-sized stuffed ewok. The ewok had its own seat and other people at the table spoke to the ewok as if it was a real person: “Is Ewok having a nice time? Does Ewok want dessert? Did the ewok meet anyone special at the disco last night?” At the Leo Sayer concert Ewok was passed around, aloft and dancing and, by the last night, bloated and bored and as friendless as I’d been the year I wore the eye patch, I succumbed to the collective magical thinking. When a Bob Marley song I liked came on, I asked the ewok’s owner if I could dance with the ewok. And she said yes, and I did. I also got a selfie with the ewok. Maybe the fault is in cruise ships themselves – the way they are designed for excess, they way you are all trapped in there together. A brawl in these circumstances is not so much a surprise as an inevitability. On a cruise, out there the ocean is flat, beautiful and mesmerisingly monotonous. Inside the sensory load is overwhelming. The playwright David Williamson gave a memorable lecture in 2005 that linked cruise-ship culture with a peculiarly Australian sense of entitlement that had developed under the leadership of John Howard. “Aspirational Australia will doubtless party on, playing deck games and comparing prices, but when the ship finally berths they may look out to see a destination much bleaker than they’d imagined … An obsessive focus on material acquisition, encouraged by governments who worship economic growth and little else, have locked us into a probable long-term disaster scenario for Cruise Ship Australia and for the planet as a whole.” To be on the cruise ship was to be aspirational in that early 2000s sense: working class, but no longer Labor, in thrall to materialism but without bourgeois-approved taste, gorging on food and drink without moderation or restraint. It’s a snobs’ view – a birth of this current strain of boganfreude. A more expensive holiday doesn’t make you a better sort of person. But it does mean there are fewer people around to film you brawl."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/21/greens-use-labors-adani-indecision-to-ramp-up-batman-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T07:20:07Z","webTitle":"Greens use Labor's Adani indecision to ramp up Batman campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/greens-use-labors-adani-indecision-to-ramp-up-batman-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/greens-use-labors-adani-indecision-to-ramp-up-batman-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Greens use Labor's Adani indecision to ramp up Batman campaign","bodyText":"The Greens will use Labor’s failure to make an unequivocal statement on whether it will oppose the Adani coalmine to ramp up campaign efforts in the Melbourne electorate of Batman.

Shorten’s positive line on coal has also been added to the Greens’ social media campaign in Batman. Local environmental groups have also used various Labor statements this week to launch a call to action, recruiting activists for a door-knocking effort over the coming weekend. In an email to supporters, the group 350 Australia says: “Bill Shorten needs to stop sitting on the fence and stand with the two-thirds of Australians who want to see Adani stopped. We know that conversations can shift politics, just as we know that the majority of Australians – including Batman voters – want to see Adani stopped.” The call to action also points out that Shorten’s positive statements on coal contradict the core argument this week of Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, “who ... said the mine would displace jobs and sabotage the Paris climate targets”. In a speech to the Sydney Institute on Monday, Butler warned the development of the Galilee basin was not in Australia’s national interest, because it would displace mining and jobs in existing coal regions and would not help the world meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement. GetUp, which can have a significant impact on the outcome of campaigns due to its capacity to mobilise field resources quickly, is yet to decide whether it will ramp up in Batman. The activist group’s national director, Paul Oosting, told Guardian Australia in early February one of the factors influencing his decision would be where Labor ultimately lined up on Adani. A GetUp spokesman confirmed on Wednesday the group was still mulling its options in the contest. Shorten has been signalling since the end of January that Labor will take a tougher line on the Adani project and internal work has been done on potential legal options that could be used to stop the project. But the powerful CFMEU mining union has argued Labor should not take a stronger stand against the project, because that would open up a divisive debate within Labor about the future of the coal industry in Australia and it will also damage the ALP’s political fortunes in Queensland. Shorten is spending the week in Queensland coastal electorates and has been attempting to reassure blue-collar voters that a negative view of Adani did not mean Labor would adopt a no-coal stance. In Rockhampton on Wednesday, Shorten said, “Adani is not the whole coal industry, for goodness sake”. “There’s nothing wrong with demanding that Adani stack up commercially and environmentally, and no amount of pressure from Adani is going to make me back off standing up to make sure that the deals actually add up financially and add up environmentally,” the Labor leader said. “But I want to make this point very clear, that when the boosters of the Adani deal say somehow, if you are sceptical about Adani, that makes you sceptical about the coal industry, that’s just not right. “I have spent my life representing miners, I understand the importance of mining. I have spent my life representing resource construction workers. I have spent my life standing up for blue-collar engineering workers.” With the Batman contest in progress and no definitive statement from Shorten about whether scepticism about Adani meant Labor would ultimately adopt a stance of blocking the project, Labor’s influential internal environmental lobby group on Tuesday called on the federal party to clarify its stance, arguing the Adani project was not in the national interest. The national convener of the Labor environment action network, Felicity Wade, said: “As Labor people, we understand why economically vulnerable communities object to the sense that post-materialist elites in the south want to decide their futures, but that doesn’t change the fact that the Adani mine will be bad for the global climate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/21/investigation-launched-into-care-of-toddler-before-alleged","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T08:25:41Z","webTitle":"Investigation launched into care of toddler before alleged rape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/investigation-launched-into-care-of-toddler-before-alleged","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/investigation-launched-into-care-of-toddler-before-alleged","fields":{"headline":"Investigation launched into care of toddler before alleged rape","bodyText":"The Northern Territory children’s commissioner has launched an investigation into the care and services given to a two-year-old child and her family before her alleged sexual assault in Tennant Creek last week. The investigation – which served notices on the Territory Families department on Wednesday – followed revelations there were multiple child protection notifications made about the child in recent months. On Tuesday it was revealed a 24-year-old man had been charged with allegedly raping the toddler on Friday night. The child was taken to hospital in Alice Springs before being transferred to Adelaide. She was discharged on Wednesday. The office of the children’s commissioner said: “The commissioner, [Colleen Gwynne], will also examine whether the current investigation and assessment policies and procedures are sufficient to analyse and prioritise levels of risk and harm.” It would also look generally at services in the outback town, it said. “There can be no compromises in stopping and challenging violence against children.” Tennant Creek residents said the alleged sexual assault was the “final straw” for a town in crisis and that it had been “forgotten” by territory and federal governments. A community meeting was held on Wednesday afternoon attended by police commissioner Reece Kershaw and the acting chief minister, Nicole Manison. According to people who were at the meeting, it was heated but well attended. Local pubs had agreed not to open until it had finished. Family members had accused Territory Families of not following up multiple notifications made about the child and her younger brother, who lived with their mother, in the weeks before the assault. They stressed the significance of Indigenous family members going to government services with their concerns. In a 12-hour period before the alleged attack on the girl, police received almost twice as many callouts as usual, the ABC reported on Friday. The duty superintendent Rob Burgoyne, said alcohol was a major factor. While acknowledging there were serious issues within the community, the family members said government and authorities needed to do more to work with them in addressing the problems. “They can’t just rely on community members to do it. They have the infrastructure to bring people together and do something about it.” Manison said alcohol was “the biggest cause of social harm in the territory”. The NT government, which recently changed its alcohol management policy from police officers stationed outside bottle shops to a computerised register of banned drinkers, on Wednesday announced an expanded police operation to Tennant Creek to respond to the increased incidents. Manison said more had to be done to address the systemic and social issues that often contributed to higher rates of crime. “We know that these types of tragedies are so often driven out of the fact that we’ve got poverty,” she said. “We have got alcohol involved. We have got poor housing, poor education. They are the systemic problems we deal with day in, day out here in the NT and they are the issues that we are working so hard to address. More needs to be done.” The Northern Territory government and authorities are attempting to address a long-running crisis in child protection and juvenile detention, highlighted by the recent royal commission. Several public hearings over the course of 10 months heard evidence that previous iterations of the Territory Families department had failed to handle an overwhelming caseload of at risk children and notifications of concern, and that many were written off as “unsubstantiated” without investigation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/21/trump-twitter-spat-woman-accused-sexual-harassment","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T04:24:14Z","webTitle":"Trump in Twitter spat with woman who accused him of sexual harassment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/trump-twitter-spat-woman-accused-sexual-harassment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/trump-twitter-spat-woman-accused-sexual-harassment","fields":{"headline":"Trump in Twitter spat with woman who accused him of sexual harassment","bodyText":"The US president has engaged in a Twitter fight with a woman who has accused him of forcibly kissing her when she worked at Trump Tower in 2006. Rachel Crooks’ allegations against Donald Trump have been reported before, but it was her appearance on the front page of the Washington Post on Tuesday – in an article headlined “Is anyone listening? This Trump accuser keeps asking herself that. But she plans to keep talking about that day in 2006” – that offended the president. Responding to the article, Trump used Twitter to dismiss Crooks as “a woman I don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met”. He went on to describe the report as “fake news” and claim that the kiss “never happened!”. “Who would do this in a public space with live security cameras running?” the president asked. Crooks responded by urging Trump to release the security tape from Trump Tower. “Please, by all means, share the footage from the hallway outside the 24th floor residential elevator bank on the morning of January 11 2006. Let’s clear this up for everyone,” she wrote. She later told CNN: “I would think as our president he would have more important things to do than tweet at me and try to discredit my story. “I know what’s true, he knows what’s true and I think he should be afraid of that.” Trump has dismissed Crooks’s allegations of sexual misconduct before. But Crooks is refusing to go away and is attempting to win a seat in the state legislature of her native Ohio in the hope it will help get her message heard. The 35-year-old university administrator launched her campaign in early February as a first-time candidate and a Democrat, after initially coming forward during the presidential election campaign. “I think my voice should have been heard then, and I’ll still fight for it to be heard now,” she said at the time. Crooks is one of more than a dozen women who have accused the president of inappropriate behaviour in the past – allegations Trump has denied."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/07/australian-gun-lobby-donations-rightwing-minor-parties-weaken-reforms-control","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T17:00:09Z","webTitle":"Australian gun lobby invests in rightwing parties in push to weaken reforms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/07/australian-gun-lobby-donations-rightwing-minor-parties-weaken-reforms-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/07/australian-gun-lobby-donations-rightwing-minor-parties-weaken-reforms-control","fields":{"headline":"Australian gun lobby invests in rightwing parties in push to weaken reforms","bodyText":"Australian gun lobby groups pumped more than $500,000 into helping minor rightwing parties win seats in last year’s Queensland state election as part of a growing push to weaken the nation’s strict firearm control laws. As Australia’s gun laws are again held up as an example to the US following the Florida school shooting, election disclosures reveal the pro-gun lobby is pumping thousands of dollars into the campaign war chests of parties such as One Nation and the Katter Australian party (KAP). Australian Electoral Commission returns show that since 2010 the state branches of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia have poured $440,800 into supporting the KAP, the Shooters Fishers and Farmers party and the Liberal Democratic party among others. And the cashed-up firearm groups are using ballooning membership numbers – ironically won as an unintended consequence of John Howard’s changes after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre – to flex their political muscles. “The courtship of the gun lobby by political parties is definitely a growing theme,” Sam Lee from Gun Control Australia told the Guardian. “Industry groups, manufacturers, there’s an emerging NRA-style approach to organising which is all about finding new markets and stopping any strengthening of existing laws.” Last year’s state election in Queensland was ground-zero for an increasingly vocal pro-gun lobby, which flooded the campaign with $500,000 in election campaigning, helping the KAP and One Nation. Queensland election disclosures reveal shooters groups were among the largest donors, with the bulk of the campaign financing directed to a third-party activist campaign aimed against the major parties. The Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia – or Sifa – received $550,000 in the lead-up to the Queensland state election, which it spent on the “Flick ‘Em,” campaign using TV, radio and online advertising to push for voters to “put the majors last”. The campaign aimed to stop either Labor or the LNP forming a majority government. It described itself as a “collective action group” with support from “grassroots, industry and business”. But a Guardian analysis of donation disclosures reveals that the campaign was almost entirely funded by pro-gun groups. Sifa received more than $500,000 in donations from gun groups including $200,000 from the Sporting Shooters Association of Queensland and $21,500 from the Firearm Dealers Association of Queensland. Sifa itself tipped $275,800 into the campaign, the largest individual donation in the lead-up to the election. Laura Patterson from Sifa said the group did not endorse or support individual candidates of parties in the election, and was “pragmatic” in its support. She said the campaign was aimed at electing a minority government to encourage real debate in the parliament and did not “endorse or support individual candidates”. But a campaign review published by Sifa revealed all but one of the seats targeted by the campaign benefitted One Nation or KAP candidates, including the four electorates where the two parties were elected. Sifa was established in 2014 and represents some of Australia’s largest gun importers and manufacturers. Federal MP Bob Katter’s son-in-law Robert Nioa, the managing director of the largest small arms importer in Australia, is a director of the association. Its website states that it was formed “to represent more effectively the social, cultural, economic and environmental impact of the many thousands of Australians who work in the industry – and of our country’s million licensed firearms owners”. The group was appointed to the government’s firearms industry reference group to provide advice to the government on the National Firearms Agreement. It has previously donated $45,000 to the Liberal and National parties, but shifted its support after the byelections in the seats of Murray and Cootamundra last year where it accused the Nationals of having “cynically leveraged the Las Vegas atrocity to protect its seats”. The review said the major parties had failed to offer “genuine political leadership on firearms policy” and that Australians had been forced to “labour under a punitive firearms regime”. The Flick Em campaign is part of an increasingly vocal push by pro-gun groups to influence Australia’s political landscape and wind back reforms introduced by the Howard government after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. Nioa himself has established himself as a major donor in Queensland state politics, pouring $200,000 in donations to the KAP since 2016. And funding disclosures show the Queensland Shooters Union, an affiliate of the US National Rifle Association, spent $4,200 on One Nation candidates in key electorates including the party’s former state director Jim Savage. The strategy appears to be paying dividends. In the lead-up to Saturday’s state election in Tasmania the governing Liberal party quietly revealed it would introduce measures to weaken gun laws which critics said would breach the National Firearms Agreement signed at the Council of Australian Governments last year. Howard reforms contained ‘seed of their own destruction’ Last year Philip Alpers from the University of Sydney’s school of public health published a paper funded by Gun Control Australia that found Australia’s gun laws had been watered down since 1996 by “two decades of political pressure”. Alpers said the tough Howard-era laws contained the “seed of their own destruction” because one of the key requirements for those applying for a gun licence was to have a “genuine reason” for owning the weapon. For many people, that is membership of an approved shooting club. Alpers said that meant a steady stream of membership fees to the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia. The SSAA now has 185,000 members nationally including 68,000 in Queensland, and in 2016 Alpers published a study that found the seven top branches had amassed a financial war chest totalling more than $34m. Some of that money has been directed at helping fund the campaigns of rightwing pro-gun parties. A spokesman for the SSAA in Queensland said the group supported the KAP because the party “support our farmers and understand the issues they face”. “[A]nd similarly, many KAP members are also competition target shooters so they understand the realities of the shooting sports and the issues facing law-abiding shooters in Queensland.” He said the SSAA wanted “evidence-based firearms legislation and policy, rather than laws and policies based on feelings or misinformation”. He pointed to the recategorisation of lever-action shotguns such as the Adler 110, which he said was “based largely on a scare campaign undertaken by anti-gun activists”. “We’d like to see less unnecessary bureaucracy surrounding law-abiding firearms ownership in Queensland, and a greater focus on catching illegal gun smugglers, punishing criminals with illegal firearms, closing porous borders, and a general understanding that law-abiding, licensed shooters are not the problem and should not be used as scapegoats for the actions of criminals,” the spokesman said in a statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/21/joyce-says-no-conflict-of-interest-between-inland-rail-and-properties","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T05:29:00Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce says no conflict of interest between inland rail and properties","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/joyce-says-no-conflict-of-interest-between-inland-rail-and-properties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/21/joyce-says-no-conflict-of-interest-between-inland-rail-and-properties","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce says no conflict of interest between inland rail and properties","bodyText":"Barnaby Joyce says there was no conflict of interest in his ownership of more than $500,000 worth of land holdings, which is why he did not declare it during cabinet deliberations about an inland rail project that passes within 15km of it. On Wednesday The Daily Telegraph reported Joyce had bought a property in Warrumbungle shire, in northern New South Wales, in July 2006 for $230,000 and added adjacent lots in Gwabegar in February 2008 for $342,571. Joyce declared the rural property at Gwabegar on his register of interests, but reportedly did not declare the land holding in cabinet when in 2016 it passed the proposal for the Melbourne-to-Brisbane inland rail brought by the then-infrastructure minister, Darren Chester. The inland rail project includes 300km of new track between Narromine and Narrabri and passes within 15km of Gwabegar, although the nearest stop is in Narrabri, about 100km or one-and-a-half hour’s drive away. The cabinet handbook states ministers and officials in cabinet “must declare any private interests of which they are aware”. “This can include pecuniary interests, held by them or by members of their immediate family, which may give rise to a conflict with their public duties,” it says. The Daily Telegraph report suggested Joyce could benefit from an uplift in the property value when the inland rail is completed. A spokeswoman for Joyce told Guardian Australia the deputy prime minister had complied with the cabinet rule to declare pecuniary interests. Joyce had no role in selecting the route and had “never had any discussions” with Chester about the inland rail route in NSW, she said. “There has never been a proposal to have a stop near Warrumbungle or Gwabegar,” the spokeswoman said. “The fact that a train may travel some 15km away from your property and finally come to halt after another 100km of travel, cannot possibly or reasonably constitute a conflict of interest; more so when the rail route was determined by another minister.” The land holding is and has always been publicly declared and has been “written and spoken about in numerous media outlets over an extended period of time”, Joyce’s spokeswoman said. The current inland rail route does not go through Gwabegar, but a study of the route in 2010 did examine it passing through Gwabegar as one of four options between Narromine and Moree. At a press conference in Rockhampton, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said someone in cabinet had leaked that Joyce didn’t declare a conflict of interest during cabinet deliberations, showing that “[Malcolm] Turnbull’s front bench is undermining each other”. “As to the actual substance – it’s up to the PM to explain: is he satisfied with Mr Joyce’s conduct?” Shorten said. The Labor leader said the Australian public was not interested in Joyce’s private life but “whether there has been any use of public office for private gain”. “People will say what’s going on with special jobs being created? Why does a bloke on $420,000 a year need free rent from a rich property developer mate? The question is – if he’s buying half a million dollars’ worth of land, is it all declared?” Shorten said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/feb/24/secret-teacher-social-media-mind-work-life-balance-stress","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T07:30:09Z","webTitle":"Secret Teacher: social media makes it impossible to switch off from work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/feb/24/secret-teacher-social-media-mind-work-life-balance-stress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/feb/24/secret-teacher-social-media-mind-work-life-balance-stress","fields":{"headline":"Secret Teacher: social media makes it impossible to switch off from work","bodyText":"It’s silly o’clock on a Sunday morning and I’m still in bed when I hear my phone ping with a WhatsApp notification. I take a look and groan. A colleague is asking if I know how we teach subtraction according to our mental calculations policy. This is a regular occurrence – even at the weekend. Social media and messaging apps are a blessing and a curse for teachers. While it has broadened our horizons and inspired new ideas (thank you, Pinterest), it has also increased the intrusion of work into our personal lives. We are always contactable, and in many different ways. What starts off as a message containing a funny aside or lighthearted remark can quickly become a virtual planning meeting. I’ll end up discussing the needs of individual students or even moderating assessments. Sometimes this involves amending work that I have already prepared for the following day. When I began teaching 10 years ago, social media and messaging were used for socialising with friends. But the proliferation of websites offering new takes on an idea or lesson means there’s always something to send about the job, and plenty of apps through which to share your thoughts. This results in a never-ending stream of notifications eating up our time outside work. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve been with friends or family and an over-zealous (but well-meaning) colleague has tagged me in something as innocuous as “how to make your own mud kitchen”. While this is the sort of idea I’d usually like, I am furious that my mind is being forced into work mode. I don’t even seem to be safe when I’m on holiday – one colleague felt it was OK to ask me about planning even though they knew I was out of the country. Teaching matters to me, but I want to work to live – not the other way around. In my opinion, the best teachers have this philosophy. I love hearing what the children in my class have done in their spare time and am happy to tell them about my life outside school. A work-life balance makes us more relatable, human practitioners and the abuse of social media by colleagues threatens to take this away from us. I also need to switch off from work at the weekend. Without this time to myself, I don’t feel able to give my all in the classroom on Monday morning. What’s the solution? I’ve tried deleting or uninstalling apps during my holidays to ensure I get a break. But on my return to work, I’ve found decisions made without my input. Some are significant and have an impact on how we do things. Others have meant an increased workload for me. It’s also been suggested that my social media silence means I’m not a committed member of the team.Schools have extensive social media policies, outlining what educators may or may not post. But there are no guidelines for appropriate practice in terms of private messaging between staff. Perhaps the time has come for this to happen – so that teachers can at least attempt to have a life beyond the school gates.

Like the current Tory government with its EBacc, Gradgrind doesn’t believe in the imagination. He wants his children taught only facts. But as Tom and Louisa – who is married off to the elderly mill-owner, Bounderby (Howard Chadwick) – both soon discover, facts don’t offer the creativity, empathy and love needed to negotiate life. In any case, as Dickens makes clear in his 1854 novel, what is a fact depends very much on other issues, including wealth and social standing. Bounderby, a man full of fictions, can insist the smoke-laden air of Coketown is good for the lungs because he is rich and powerful. Impoverished weaver Stephen Blackpool (Anthony Hunt) can’t access divorce, and the rich easily evade justice. The raggle-taggle circus with its warmth and camaraderie becomes the antidote to the cold, unfeeling, industrialised world, and it provides both colour and a sense of otherworldliness in Conrad Nelson’s production for Northern Broadsides. Some of the acting is very much on the broad side, and Nelson never solves how to get his cast on and off the stage in the Viaduct’s awkward and acoustically unsympathetic space.

A Welsh fruit grower has broken the record for picking the earliest ever British strawberries – grown in glasshouses – and getting them on to supermarket shelves. The berries, grown by Springfield Nursery near Cowbridge in south Wales, went on on sale in Tesco’s Bridgend Extra store. The discount supermarket Aldi was also selling strawberries at its store in Bridgend. They are the earliest British strawberries on supermarket shelves since 2007, when strawberries grown in Kent went on sale on 26 February. “Hats off to Springfield who have achieved this fantastic coup with their expertise and innovation,” said Jordan Blandford, a strawberry buyer at Tesco. “There is always a lot of excitement about the first British strawberries being picked because their arrival means the start of spring is not too far away.” What was once a fleeting treat, to be enjoyed for the few weeks around Wimbledon, has almost become a staple supermarket item thanks to a longer British growing season and a supply of imported produce. Historically, in England, strawberries started appearing on 1 May and were available until the end of September. Aldi said the extended British season had been made possible with milder weather, brighter and longer days and advanced growing techniques from suppliers. Julie Ashfield, Aldi’s joint managing director for corporate buying, said: “Aldi is committed to supporting British suppliers, so it’s always a celebrated milestone when we can offer customers exceptional quality, British-grown strawberries.” Tesco said this year’s production at Springfield would result in about 500 tonnes of strawberries – the equivalent of about 1 million punnets – with the supply lasting until late autumn. The UK’s largest supermarket chain will roll out strawberries grown in Essex from this weekend. Other traditional UK early season growers are based in Kent, Sussex and Lancashire. The strawberry variety now on sale is favori , which has a distinctive vivid colour and produces large berries that are not too crunchy. But consumers scrambling for the early fruit may have to compromise on taste. Peter Melchett, the policy director at the organic farming body the Soil Association, said: “Michael Gove told the National Farmers’ Union conference earlier this week that he wanted to see more fresh British produce grown. It’s important that people understand the importance of seasonality – eating fruit and vegetables when they are in season means they taste better and cost less.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/muslims-like-us-was-enlightening-but-where-were-the-muslim-minorities","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T17:00:23Z","webTitle":"Muslims Like Us was an enlightening experiment, but where were the Muslim minorities? | Ruby Hamad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/muslims-like-us-was-enlightening-but-where-were-the-muslim-minorities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/muslims-like-us-was-enlightening-but-where-were-the-muslim-minorities","fields":{"headline":"Muslims Like Us was enlightening, but where were the Muslim minorities?","bodyText":"It could have been a recipe for disaster. A reality show where 10 Australian Muslims briefly share a house in Sydney’s leafy – and very white – northern beaches that, as the narrator gravely informs us, “had no Muslim residents. Until now.” But SBS’s Muslims Like Us, spread over two nights, actually made for an interesting and at times enlightening experiment, as the temporary housemates, who ranged from non-practising cultural Muslims to devoted ultra conservatives, debated faith, sectarianism, terrorism and national security (of course), politics and, thanks to the presence of Fahad, a gay man, and Rida, a bisexual woman, sexual orientation. There were some minor missteps, such as the performative group prayers at Manly beach that seemed to deliberately make a spectacle of the participants, and the bizarre trip to the site of the Lindt café siege at Martin Place (as if it is up to these 10 Muslims to explain and atone for that terrible day). There were also some major ones, such as describing the housemates as “united in faith but divided in what it means to be a good Muslim”. The orientalism of the phrase “good Muslim” aside, the assumption that all Muslims are or should be devout is just not a reflection of reality. Growing up Muslim, it is impossible to separate religion from culture and family; you were a Muslim simply by virtue of who your family is, and being a Muslim shapes and permeates the lives of the practising and cultural Muslim alike. To its credit, the show did include a sole cultural Muslim (who, as a Shia growing up in the early years of post-Islamic revolution Iran, also happened to be the only non-Sunni in the house); however, he was unfortunately never given the time to explain what this really means. Despite its nod to Islam’s ethnic diversity and its impressive willingness to broach the volatile issue of the sectarian divide, the show’s lack of sect-based diversity meant all discussion of Islamic ideology was centred on Sunni practices and beliefs. As such, the most interesting question Muslims Like Us brings up, however inadvertently, is the fluid nature of persecution, victimhood and what it means to be a minority. When out in public, for example, the housemates are understandably protective of Anjum, who wears a niqab, since her visibility makes her the most likely target of Islamophobic attacks. Inside the house, however, she is the most openly judgmental of those she feels are not following Islam correctly. As well as hiding a “There are 1.6 billion ways to be a Muslim” poster that one of the more progressive participants proudly stuck to the fridge, Anjum picks a fight with Rida, a 20-something bisexual Sufi who insists on leading a ritualistic prayer that the others either refuse to take part in or do so reluctantly. Anjum’s disdain for Rida’s faith is palpable and, ironically, a mirror image of the contempt much of mainstream Australian society shows for Islam as a whole. In fact, their showdown reminded me of the infamous Q&amp;A exchange between Yassmin Abdel-Magied and Jacquie Lambie, with Rida eventually shouting at Anjum to “shut up.” The response from the other housemates is telling. Like Abdel-Magied, Rida was provoked by someone who assumed they knew more about her religion than she did and demanded she abandon it, but when Rida understandably lost her cool, she was admonished by the men present for “crossing a boundary.” She wasn’t the one who crossed it. “Her behaviour is not Islamic and this Sufi thing is not Islamic,” Anjum scoffs while a tearful Rida cries to camera, “She is so focused on representing the right version of Islam that she doesn’t see that she is hurting others … this is what we go through in this community – for being gay, for being minority Muslims, for being [young] girls.” This is an important point that does not get discussed nearly enough. Sunnis make up 80% of all Muslims and as such dominate the religion. Minorities are rarely included in conversations about Islam and are shut out of many of its peak bodies in this country. Consequently, as well as fending off Islamophobia, minorities are forced to defend their Muslimness, both to non-Muslim “allies” and to the dominant Sunni sect in whose shadow they dwell. How do Shia feel about being called “Rawafid” (the refusers) or Alawites (my own community) about being dismissed as heretical “Nusayris”? These are questions that still need to be asked and answered. Oh well, there is always next season. Nonetheless, it was Anjum who also provoked the most empathy from me, her eyes reflecting the deep fear of eternal hellfire that drives her behaviour; covering her face, avoiding activities involving men, and judging other Muslims – all of these are, to her, essential expressions of her faith because they will allow her to escape torment in the afterlife. And there it is. So much of what compels us as humans to be so punitively harsh on ourselves and on others can be traced back to fear.

The Office for National Statistics revised down its estimate for UK growth in the fourth quarter to 0.4%, following an earlier estimate of 0.5% and missing economists’ forecasts that the rate would be unchanged. It said UK production was lower than initially estimated, and said consumers were less willing to spend due to the price rises triggered by the sharp fall in the pound following the Brexit vote. The weaker end to the year weighed on the economy’s performance in 2017 overall, with growth revised down from 1.8% to 1.7% – the weakest in five years. As the global recovery gathers pace, Britain is falling behind other major economies. The German economy grew by 2.2% in 2017, French GDP increased by 1.9%, and the US economy expanded by 2.3%. “A number of very small revisions to mining, energy generation and services were enough to see a slight downward revision to quarterly growth overall,” said Darren Morgan, a statistician at the ONS. “Services continued to drive growth at the end of 2017, but with a number of consumer-facing industries slowing, as price rises led to household budgets being squeezed.” In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the UK economy was heavily reliant on consumer spending for growth, but the latest figures signalled a greater reluctance among UK consumers to spend money, with budgets squeezed by falling real pay, as inflation outpaces wage growth. Household spending grew by just 0.3% in the fourth quarter and by 1.8% in 2017 overall, the slowest rate of annual growth since 2012. Firms also appeared reluctant to spend, with business investment flat in the final three months of 2017. The downward revision to growth came a day after the ONS published figures showing a surprise rise in unemployment in the three months to December. The weaker-than-expected data creates a potential dilemma for the Bank of England, where policymakers signalled earlier this month the economy could be ready for another rise in interest rates as early as May. “The latest GDP data suggest that the economy remains in a fragile state and does not need to be cooled with another rate rise as soon as May,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/feb/22/lecturers-begin-14-day-strike-over-pensions","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T16:55:00Z","webTitle":"University lecturers begin strike action over pensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/22/lecturers-begin-14-day-strike-over-pensions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/feb/22/lecturers-begin-14-day-strike-over-pensions","fields":{"headline":"University lecturers begin strike action over pensions","bodyText":"University bosses are under mounting pressure from the government to return to talks to try to end sweeping strike action by staff that brought widespread disruption to campuses across the UK. As tens of thousands of lecturers and other staff staged a mass walkout on Thursday in protest against changes to their pensions, the government intervened to try to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table. Students turned out in freezing conditions to support their teachers on picket lines up and down the country, and in London’s Tavistock Square a small group of demonstrators carrying banners and drums occupied the headquarters of Universities UK (UUK), which represents university employers. The industrial action is the biggest ever seen in UK universities. The strike will continue on Friday and is scheduled to last for 14 days, spread over a month across 65 universities. If a solution is not found, staff are threatening to extend the dispute to disrupt final-year exams and graduation ceremonies. Increasingly frustrated by the impasse in the long-running dispute, the universities minister, Sam Gyimah, urged both sides to return to negotiations to avoid further disruption for students whose lectures and tutorials cancelled as a result of Thursday’s industrial action. “I am deeply concerned about the impact this strike will have on students, who deserve to receive the education that they are paying for. For many, this is a vital time in their studies,” he said. Gyimah said he had spoken to UUK and the University and College Union (UCU), which represents striking staff. “I call on them to get back to the negotiating table, without pre-conditions, and to find a solution that avoids further disruption to students,” he said. “Where any strike action takes place, we expect universities to keep a close eye on the impact on students, and to put in place measures to maintain the quality of education that they should receive.” The strike comes amid heated debate within the sector about the high cost and ultimate value of some university degrees. The prime minister announced a review of higher education earlier this week as concerns grew that students are graduating with debts of more than £50,000 at the same time as vice-chancellors are receiving substantial pay rises. A UCU spokeswoman said the union was delighted with the turnout on picket lines. where many were first-timers. Chris Knutsen, a final-year economics and politics students at the University of Bath – where the vice-chancellor Dame Glynis Breakwell recently agreed to step down after outcry over her £468,000 salary – was among those on the picket line. Breakwell is a director of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) at the centre of the pensions dispute. “I see it as incredibly important to protect pensions so that the best teachers are attracted to academia, and pensions are a massive part of that,” Knutsen said. “I’m a bit worried about my work, but it’s forcing me to take the initiative and work autonomously.” Hazem Raad, who escaped the war in Syria to study in the UK, was also supporting university staff. “We chose to study in a country of civil rights, and when those rights are compromised we have an obligation to stand in solidarity against the abusers.” A small number of vice-chancellors broke ranks with UUK to come out in support of their staff, among them Stuart Corbridge of Durham University and Chris Day of Newcastle University. Some parents were less supportive of strike action. One mother whose son is a final-year student at Southampton University, said: “I find the situation whereby uncaring academics can simply take their grievances out on young and some quite vulnerable students without any consideration of the consequences absolutely shocking.” A YouGov poll conducted on the eve of the strike suggested that a majority of students support the industrial action and think universities are most to blame. Overall, 61% of students said they supported the strikes; 50% blamed the university employers for the dispute that led to Thursday’s industrial action, 20% thought staff and universities were equally to blame and 2% blamed their lecturers. The strike looks likely to be one of the biggest union disputes since the government made industrial action harder with new legislation. UCU members are striking because they claim that proposed changes to the USS will leave a typical lecturer almost £10,000 a year worse off in retirement. Younger academics face the potential loss of almost half of their total retirement income, they say. UUK says the pension scheme is £6.1bn in deficit and the only way to make it sustainable is to change it from a defined benefit scheme, giving members a guaranteed income in retirement, to a defined contribution scheme, where pensions are subject to changes in the stock market. The UCU insists the existing scheme is performing well and UUK’s refusal to compromise has left them no alternative but to strike. Attention also turned to the £124m running costs of the USS after the BBC reported that its chief executive, Bill Galvin, received a 17% pay rise this year, taking his salary from £484,000 to £566,000. Two other staff reportedly earned more than £1m each. UCU’s general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: “Students should never have been put in this position. We have been calling for talks for weeks either directly or through Acas, so if UUK are willing to now meet without preconditions with a view to resolving this dispute this is good news.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/22/mps-attack-pension-regulator-at-carillion-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T11:33:22Z","webTitle":"Ex-Carillion director viewed pension fund as 'waste of money'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/22/mps-attack-pension-regulator-at-carillion-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/22/mps-attack-pension-regulator-at-carillion-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Carillion director viewed pension fund as 'waste of money'","bodyText":"Carillion’s former finance director considered putting cash into the firm’s pension deficit a “waste of money”, according to the minutes of a meeting written by the pension scheme trustees. The meeting was raised as MPs voiced concerns about Carillion’s attitude to pensions during a parliamentary evidence session in which the Pensions Regulator and accountancy firm KPMG, which audited the firm’s accounts, faced stinging criticism. The regulator said it was investigating whether it could force Carillion bosses to hand back millions of pounds in bonuses to compensate nearly 30,000 pensioners, whose payouts are likely to be cut by up to 15% due to the company’s failure. But it came under fire for a perceived lack of action to force Carillion to pay enough money into the schemes. As MPs questioned officials from the regulator, the work and pensions committee chair, Frank Field, referred to a meeting between trustees and the regulator in 2013, the minutes of which indicate that trustees thought the finance director at the time, Richard Adam, considered pension payments a “waste of money”. Three witnesses from the regulator said they had not been at the meeting. The regulator’s director of case management, Mike Birch, said it later threatened to impose increased contributions on Carillion, prompting an increase in payments of £85m spread over 15 years. Documents released by MPs earlier in the inquiry showed trustees believed that far more, an extra £30m a year, was necessary to fund the scheme, which has a deficit estimated at nearly £1bn. Field said directors instead chose to pay “mega dividends” and were boasting to the City about doing so. He said: “They were shovelling money out to themselves, they were shovelling it to shareholders, why didn’t you get them to shovel it to pensioners?” The regulator’s chief executive, Lesley Titcomb, who faced ridicule for failing to remember key figures, said the organisation should in hindsight have done more to extract higher pension contributions from Carillion. Titcomb, who took the job in 2015 after the period in question, said: “We would not have continued so long in that negotiation situation,” she said. “We need to be clearer, quicker and tougher. We will change further.” KPMG also came under fire for signing off the 2016 accounts just a few months before Carillion announced £845m of writedowns and issued a profit warning. The Labour MP Peter Kyle said: “I wouldn’t trust you to audit what’s in my fridge.” The business committee chair, Rachel Reeves MP, referred to the Guardian’s interview this week with a former Carillion executive, who said financial problems were apparent in mid-2016. She said: “Investors seemed to know, people who worked for the company seemed to know, the only people who didn’t see what was happening were those who were paid to: the directors and the auditors of the company.” Speaking after the evidence session, Field said auditors and regulators were “mere spectators – commentators at best, certainly not referees – at the mercy of reckless and self-interested directors”. Reeves said the auditor’s work appeared to be a “colossal waste of time and money, fit only to provide false assurance to investors, workers and the public”. Peter Meehan, a KPMG partner, said his team had done “the best we could”, insisting most of Carillion’s problems emerged after he signed off the company’s 2016 accounts in March last year. He also cast doubt on a claim by Carillion’s former chief executive Richard Howson that Qatari firm Msheireb Properties had owed the company £200m, a claim the Gulf property firm also denies. Meehan added that KPMG, which received more than £29m in fees from Carillion over a decade, warned directors they were at the “more optimistic” range when assessing the value of their contracts. Separately, Unite raised concerns about “missing” pension payments it said had been deducted from members’ pay packets before Carillion’s collapse but had not reached the retirement scheme. “We need to know what has happened to these payments, possibly involving more than £1m,” said the trade union’s national officer for health, Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe. “At present, they appear to have mysteriously disappeared into the financial abyss.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/22/british-gas-cuts-4000-jobs-blaming-price-cap-and-tough-competition","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T09:32:23Z","webTitle":"British Gas owner to cut 4,000 jobs blaming price cap and competition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/22/british-gas-cuts-4000-jobs-blaming-price-cap-and-tough-competition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/22/british-gas-cuts-4000-jobs-blaming-price-cap-and-tough-competition","fields":{"headline":"British Gas owner to cut 4,000 jobs blaming price cap and competition","bodyText":"Centrica, the owner of British Gas, will shed a further 4,000 jobs by 2020 as part of a cost-cutting programme, which it blamed on the government’s energy price cap and fierce competition in the market. Britain’s largest energy company reported on Thursday a fall of 17% in operating profit to £1.25bn in 2017, owing to poor performance in its business energy supply and North America divisions. Iain Conn, the Centrica chief executive, said: “The only thing I regret is we are going to see 4,000 more colleagues leaving Centrica and it’s partly due to this price cap and competitive pressures.” The majority of the 4,000 jobs lost will be in the UK, where 30,000 of its 35,000-person global workforce are based. The first thousand will go this year through natural attrition and compulsory redundancies. The new cuts of 4,000 staff are on top of an existing plan to reduce headcount by 5,500 by 2020, which will be partly offset by the creation of 2,000 jobs, so total losses are set to be 7,500. Conn refused to rule out additional job losses under the cost-cutting plan, which has deepened from £750m to £1.25bn a year. Matt Lay, the national energy officer at the union Unison, said: “Although Centrica has already shed thousands of jobs, it’s nowhere near out of the woods, and there’s much more misery to come. “British Gas staff shouldn’t be feeling the heat today. It should be Iain Conn.” GMB, the union for gas workers, said the job cuts were an inevitable part of a “failing plan” implemented by Conn. National officer Stuart Fegan said: “Iain Conn must immediately learn from the failure of other, now departed, battlefield generals that you cannot cut your way out of a crisis – GMB will fight these unnecessary job cuts.”British Gas lost about 750,000 customers, 10% of its total, over the year. However, Conn argued that the company was resilient and more than half of the accounts were loss-making, so the impact was limited. British Gas made a profit margin per customer of 5.5%, or £59 out of a typical £1,101 dual fuel bill. The government’s price cap is expected by the end of the year and will limit the bills of millions of British Gas customers on standard variable tariffs. Conn admitted this would dent profit margins. The company also faces a new rival in the form of a merged npower and SSE, as well as new entrants with financial muscle such as Shell, which bought First Utility last year. Despite these threats, Conn said he was confident things would get better, citing the company’s strategy, cashflow and balance sheet. “I don’t agree the worst is yet to come, I believe the best is yet to come,” he said. The company had warned last November of a weak performance in the second half of 2017, which was laid bare in the results announced on Thursday. Operating profit at the unit that supplies energy to businesses was down 67% to £161m. Its consumer energy supply arm dropped 1% to £890m, despite a price cap on 4 million vulnerable households and warmer weather. Conn said he was considering management changes at Centrica’s North American division. He said he deeply regretted the overall impact on shareholders, who saw the share price fall more than 40% last year. The company also announced that by 2020, it would sell its 20% stake in EDF Energy Nuclear Generation, which owns Britain’s existing eight nuclear power stations. “We are not a natural owner and it’s a minority stake with limited control,” said Conn, adding that buyers might include infrastructure funds. The company’s share price rose 4.46% to 138.10p, which was seen as a result of Centrica pledging to keep shareholder dividends steady. Analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown said cost-cutting would help, but overall, political pressure and rising competition meant the company faced “more headwinds than tailwinds”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/25/i-miss-her-so-much-australian-man-pleads-for-wifes-release-from-chinese-prison","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T00:26:28Z","webTitle":"'I miss her so much': Australian man pleads for wife's release from Chinese prison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/25/i-miss-her-so-much-australian-man-pleads-for-wifes-release-from-chinese-prison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/25/i-miss-her-so-much-australian-man-pleads-for-wifes-release-from-chinese-prison","fields":{"headline":"'I miss her so much': Australian man pleads for wife's release from Chinese prison","bodyText":"The last time Almas Nizamidin saw his wife was on Valentine’s Day last year, when he flew from Australia to China to surprise her. Now she’s in prison. A month after his visit to China, his newly pregnant wife, Bizainafu Abudourexit, was caught up in a Chinese crackdown on the Uighur Muslim minority group, detained without charge, and sentenced to seven years in jail with no legal support. Nizamidin had applied for a partnership visa for his wife to join him in Australia, but it wasn’t granted in time. Nizamidin is now waging a lonely campaign as an Australian citizen to get his wife released from a Chinese women’s prison at a time when Australia is navigating a new relationship with China. The high school sweethearts were torn apart geographically, and by force. Uighurs are a Sunni Muslim population of nearly 12 million people with Turkic origins living in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. Nizamidin left Urumqi in 2009, after his family urged him to move to Australia to escape violence soon after major riots in the region’s capital, Urumqi, left hundreds of Han Chinese and Uighur people dead. He was involved in the riots in his final year of high school. Nearly a year since Abuourexiti’s arrest, Nizimidin sits in an Adelaide beachfront cafe twisting a ring he wears on his left hand as he talks. He says life had become “unbearable” in Urumqi before he left adding he had been banned from speaking his native language at school. “It became like an open prison.” He promised he’d return to marry Abuourexiti. “My parents mustered a large chunk of their savings to pay for my student visa to Australia – $40,000 – they could have bought a house for that in China.” He arrived in Sydney with little English and no way to support himself. When he first arrived in Sydney he says the only person he knew was a friend of his father’s. Five months later he moved to Adelaide, with an Uighur community of 300 families. There he started work as a plasterer, and eventually picked up lucrative contracts in the construction sector. In 2010, Nizamidin lodged an application for asylum in Australia. Even though he kept returning to Xinjiang, he said he risked being detained or tortured. “I know it’s dangerous going back, but it’s love. I left on the promise I would return to marry her.” In 2014 he became an Australian citizen and a year later he returned on an Australian passport to marry Abudourexiti. She was detained on 29 March 2017, when she was on her way to a hospital to confirm the results of a home pregnancy test. Abudourexiti received a frenzied phone call from her mother saying Chinese police were at their family home demanding to speak to her. She was taken for questioning and hasn’t been seen since. No one knows what happened to her pregnancy. Abudourexiti’s detention came during what human rights groups say were a wave of arrests of up to 10,000 Uighur people – taken without trial to either prison, or secret detention camps called “re-education camps” – for alleged political crimes ranging from extremist thoughts to travelling, or studying abroad. Abudourexiti studied Islam in Cairo for two years, but returned to China and enrolled at university to study medicine. The Australian government hasn’t pushed Beijing for her release, but says it raised concerns over the wider treatment of Uighur people in China. “The Australian government is concerned about the human rights situation in Xinjiang and has raised these concerns with relevant Chinese authorities,” an Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokeswoman said. Chinese authorities did not respond to questions on the detention of Abudourexiti. Amnesty International called on the Chinese government to release her unless there was sufficient evidence that she committed an internationally recognised offence and is granted a fair trial in line with international standards. William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty, said the case was “absolutely tragic”. “The Australian government should raise concerns about the ways in which Chinese detention practices in the region are seriously out of line with international laws and urge the Chinese government to clarify the legal situation of Buzainafu Abudourexiti.” Nizamidin has fought a lonely battle to have his wife released, speaking to members of parliament, conventions in Europe, and next month is taking his protest to Canberra. He has spent $9,000 applying for a partnership visa and hiring migration consultants, but the partnership visa was declined on 7 February, on the grounds that a new police clearance was needed and she was not contactable as she was in prison. Members of both of their immediate family have been arrested and detained in the past 10 years. “I miss her so much. I want to bring my wife here so she can feel what freedom is,” Nizamidin sayd. This story was amended on 27 February to clarify that Nizimidin said he had been banned from speaking his native language at school in Urumqi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/22/usa-canada-hockey-gold-medal-match-shootout","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T07:48:49Z","webTitle":"USA see off Canada in shootout to capture Olympic women's hockey gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/22/usa-canada-hockey-gold-medal-match-shootout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/22/usa-canada-hockey-gold-medal-match-shootout","fields":{"headline":"USA see off Canada in shootout to capture Olympic women's hockey gold","bodyText":"The United States women’s hockey team ended Canada’s gold medal streak in dramatic fashion on Friday afternoon, defeating their archrivals in a shootout to capture their first Olympic title since 1998. USA’s Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson scored the go-ahead goal in the shootout, the first in Olympic women’s hockey history, after the teams played to a 2-2 stalemate after regulation and overtime, setting the stage for American goaltender Maddie Rooney’s save of Meghan Agosta to clinch the gold before a rollicking crowd at the Gangneung Hockey Centre. “It is everything for our country,” American coach Robb Stauber said afterward. “I can’t tell you how happy I am for our players. We love them, it is unreal. I am just so thankful for the outcome. It was a thrilling final, it was unreal.” American forward Hilary Knight opened the scoring in the dying seconds of the first period, redirecting a shot by Sidney Morin past Canadian goaltender Shannon Szabados. But Canada’s Haley Irwin leveled early in the second frame by deflecting a pass from Blayne Turnbull past Rooney. Five minutes later Marie-Philip Poulin opened a 2-1 lead for the Canadians with a one-timer. That score held until late in the third period. With time running out on USA’s gold medal hopes, Monique Lamoureux-Morando tied the game on a breakaway opportunity created by Kelly Pannek. After a scoreless overtime period, both goaltenders stood tall in stopping the first three shots apiece. In the first extra round Lamoureux-Davidson broke through, faking Szabados out of position and depositing the puck into the back of the net. That set the stage for Rooney, the Olympic debutante who made 29 saves over 80 minutes of regulation and overtime, whose save of Agosta’s shot sealed a long-awaited victory for the United States over their northern neighbors. “I can’t put it into words,” American defenseman Kacey Bellamy said. “This whole year is for everyone that came before us. This is for [former USA team captain] Julie Chu and for all our families at home, the schools that we went to, everyone supporting us. It is a feeling I have never experienced.” The United States outshot Canada by a 42-31 margin. “Upset, disappointed,” Turnbull said. “We did not come here for a silver medal and everyone can imagine what losing feels like. It is not a great feeling at all.” She added: “That is how it works, but in my honest opinion a game like that should never be decided by a shootout.” Canada had won four straight Olympic golds, three times beating the United States in the final including twice in overtime. Their lone failure to win the title came when women’s hockey debuted at the 1998 Nagano Games, when they fell to the Americans in the gold medal match. “It is going to be part of our legacy,” said Knight, a three-time Olympian and USA team captain. “The things that we have gone through as a team on and off the ice, the characters, the group of women we have in the room, it’s quite incredible. “A little bittersweet right now because we won but this team will never really be together again in the same capacity. It has been an incredible journey.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/23/labor-pledges-inquiry-into-universities-and-tafe-sector","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T13:01:18Z","webTitle":"Labor pledges inquiry into universities and Tafe sector","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/23/labor-pledges-inquiry-into-universities-and-tafe-sector","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/23/labor-pledges-inquiry-into-universities-and-tafe-sector","fields":{"headline":"Labor pledges inquiry into universities and Tafe sector","bodyText":"Labor will conduct a major review of tertiary education if elected and “wants prospective students to see Tafe and uni as equally attractive study options”. The party’s education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek will make the announcement at a Tafe in Melbourne on Friday in a bid to “make sure Australians have access to the best post-secondary opportunities in the world”. “This will be the first time a national inquiry has put Tafe and unis on an equal footing,” she said ahead of the announcement. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, questioned why Labor needs a review given it claims to support the demand-driven system and accused it of hiding its plans for the sector. In October the head of the Business Council, Jennifer Westacott, called for a major overhaul of student loans and government subsidies which she said distort the choice between vocational education and university. She argued that a cultural bias and larger subsidies for university courses led people away from vocational education even if they were “better suited” to it, which was not in their interest nor the national interest. Plibersek’s comments about treating Tafe and uni as “equally attractive options” suggest Labor has a similar rebalancing in mind. “Tafe specialises in skills [and] unis are our research powerhouses - and we see many examples of excellence from both,” she said. Plibersek said there is “much more that can be done” to capitalise on their strengths, such as greater cooperation between Tafe and universities, and continuing to increase participation in tertiary education. According to the Department of Employment, 990,000 jobs are expected to be created by 2020, but 920,000 of those will require some form of tertiary education. The department projects about 480,000 jobs will require degree or higher qualifications, while about 437,000 will require certificate, diploma and advanced diploma level qualifications. In December the Turnbull government imposed a two-year freeze on commonwealth grants for universities, effectively ending the demand-driven system because universities have no incentive to enrol more students when payments are capped. The universities sector has estimated the changes leave 9,500 university places unfunded in 2018. Plibersek claimed the number of Australians going to university had increased because Labor uncapped places but participation was uneven, with Indigenous students and students from regional areas under-represented. “The fact Malcolm Turnbull has effectively abandoned the demand-driven system shows he doesn’t care about fixing this,” she said. “Tafe and vocational education is in crisis. The number of students attending Tafe has collapsed due to funding cuts and unhealthy competition from private providers accessing government subsidies.” The Nick Xenophon Team’s education spokeswoman, Rebekha Sharkie, has repeatedly called for a review of tertiary education while opposing Coalition cuts to universities. Labor aims to conduct the review within 100 days if elected and will draw up terms of reference in consultation with the vocational education and training sector, university sector, unions, and business. “This sweeping inquiry is long overdue,” Plibersek said. “No Australian government in history has ever looked at vocational education and unis as a whole like this.” In the 2017 budget the Coalition announced a $1.5bn skills fund, paid for by visa fees, to replace existing agreements with state governments to pay for vocational education. Freezing commonwealth grants to universities and changes to the student loan repayment threshold will save the budget $2.2bn. Birmingham said that Labor “wants to distract from the fact they won’t say if they’d roll back the higher education measures we announced in Myefo”. “Labor criticises reviews, now wants one. They say they support the demand driven system, now they want it reviewed,” he said. Birmingham called on Labor “to admit they still see financial and student outcomes challenges in the higher education sector, rather than hiding their real plans from voters under the cover of another review”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/23/smith-and-wesson-gun-maker-behind-florida-ar15-james-debney","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T12:00:01Z","webTitle":"Meet the British CEO of the firm behind the gun that brought tragedy to Florida","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/23/smith-and-wesson-gun-maker-behind-florida-ar15-james-debney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/23/smith-and-wesson-gun-maker-behind-florida-ar15-james-debney","fields":{"headline":"Meet the British CEO of the firm behind the gun that brought tragedy to Florida","bodyText":"As CEO of America’s second-largest gun manufacturer, James Debney – whose company made the assault rifle used last week to kill 17 people at a high school in Florida – makes $5.3m a year. As a second-amendment proselytizer, Debney, of American Outdoor Brands (formerly Smith &amp; Wesson), has repeatedly made donations to political action committees opposing gun control in the United States. And as a top donor to the National Rifle Association (NRA), Debney wears a distinctive gold blazer with a crest designating his membership in the group’s elite Golden Ring of Freedom society, reserved for million-dollar backers. But that jacket is something of a strange fit for a British emigrant with a background in bin liners. Debney read chemistry at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology in 1989, took a business degree at Keele University and cut his teeth in consumer goods as a former managing director of Baco consumer products and then president of Presto products, a $500m plastics business. By his own admission, Debney knew next to nothing about guns when he took the reins at the US gunmaker, which did $900m in sales last year. “It takes a while to understand the business, especially if you’re British and have a limited knowledge of firearms to begin with,” Debney told the regional business publication BusinessWest in 2012. Judging by the performance of his company in the last two years, the learning curve may not have been particularly steep. As president and CEO since 2011, Debney, 50, has led American Outdoor Brands through an awkward rebranding, an underwhelming expansion into outdoor gear and a 66% collapse in stock price since August 2016. When it hired Debney for the top job, Smith &amp; Wesson calculated that his background expertise in consumer products would apply in the world of gun sales. If you can sell garbage bags, the thinking seemed to be, you can sell guns – at least in the USA. But thrust under the national spotlight by the country’s latest school shooting, Debney is drawing fresh scrutiny as an expert in plastics extrusion who somehow became one of the United States’ most vocal supporters for the NRA, a lobbying group many Americans see as an enabler in the country’s mass shooting epidemic. American Outdoor Brands did not reply to multiple requests by email and phone for comment. A request via an American Outdoor Brands spokesperson to establish whether Debney is a US citizen went unanswered. Nor has the company released a statement on the Parkland, Florida, shooting where one of its M&amp;P-15 weapons was used to bring death to a high school. In an appearance at the CPAC conservative political action conference on Thursday, the NRA chairman, Wayne LaPierre, blamed media and “the elites” for propagating school shootings and presented his group as a last line of defense of “individual freedom”. It’s a message Debney has cheered for years. “The importance of the NRA and its critical role in the protection of second amendment rights in the United States cannot be understated,” Debney said at a 2014 event at which he presented LaPierre with a novelty check for $600,000. The company Debney formerly ran, Presto, a subsidiary of Alcoa, produces more soft goods: food storage bags, plastic wrap, waste bags, and especially variations on the zipper-lock bag, including the ribbed zipper, double zipper and thermoform zipper. After he moved and his product range changed, responding to strong gun sales on the day after Thanksgiving in 2012, Debney heralded an evolution in American attitudes toward guns, saying: “Firearms have now taken that place in the basket of mainstream durable goods that consumers want to buy on Black Friday.” Smith &amp; Wesson began producing the M&amp;P-15 series, eventually including the gun used in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school massacre, in 2006, three years before Debney joined the company. Primarily a handgun manufacturer for 150 years, the Springfield, Massachusetts-based Smith &amp; Wesson was lured into the market for so-called long guns by the booming popularity of the AR-15-style models. “We are entering the $1bn market for long guns with products that provide the exceptional functionality and reliability that Smith &amp; Wesson customers have come to expect,” the company said in a press release at the time. Labeled “assault rifles” outside the industry and “tactical rifles” or “modern sporting rifles” inside the industry, semi-automatic weapons such as the M&amp;P-15 are modified versions of weapons originally designed by the military for maximum fast killing. They have been the recurring weapon of choice in America’s deadliest mass shootings. Debney’s rise at the company coincided with a steady growth in assault rifle sales as a proportion of overall sales. On paper, the strategy worked, for a time. Net sales at the company grew from about $550m in early 2015 to $900m two years later, and the stock price hit $30 in August 2016. “Our vision is to be the leading firearms manufacturer,” Debney told the Boston Globe in 2013, when his company, which employs about 1,500 people locally, topped the newspaper’s rankings of businesses in the state. “And that means, really, you’ve got to be number one, in terms of market share, in every major product category.” In 2012, Debney and his wife, Karen, bought 64 acres in pastoral Massachusetts near the gunmaker’s headquarters in Springfield. The next year, the Debneys, who have a teenage daughter who is a nationally ranked equestrian, applied to the city planning board to approve plans for a commercial indoor riding arena and horse barn site, and Karen Debney’s equestrian concern, Temple Farm LLC, was incorporated in 2015. But as everyone in the gun industry in 2014 knew, the boom was perilously reliant on the emotions of customers, particularly those who might fear that Barack Obama would try to confiscate their weapons, a fantasy the NRA, fattened by gun industry money, actively fed. With the election of Donald Trump, the fears dissipated, and the “Trump slump” saw sales at Debney’s company plunge 36.4% in the third quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier. Today the stock trades at around $10 – one-third of its price at its peak. “There was some fear-based buying that would take place from time to time,” Debney said in a December 2017 conference call. “There is no fear-based buying right now.” Debney had tried to prepare for such a rainy day. His predecessor had expensively acquired a security company; Debney quickly got rid of it. Then he led an effort to slap a new name on the gunmaker, American Outdoor Brands, in an apparent play to make the company more palatable to institutional investors, but also to highlight its foray into the highly competitive field of “survival” and camping equipment – everything from cutting tools to parachute cord to pole saws. But even as the company’s latest report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said such products accounted for only 4% of sales, Debney clung to the notion that expansion in the sector would return the company to health. “Toward the end of the quarter, consumer firearm purchasing began to cool – a trend that underscores the importance of remaining focused on our strategy to continue growing and balancing our business across the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast markets,” Debney said in a March 2017 press release. It was unclear how the company hoped millions in outdoor accessories sales would replace potentially hundreds of millions in lost gun sales. A major competitor in the gun manufacturing industry, Remington, announced plans to declare bankruptcy earlier this month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/23/tesla-battery-taking-straw-off-camels-back-for-sa-energy-demand","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T19:09:18Z","webTitle":"Tesla battery 'taking straw off camel's back' for South Australia energy demand","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/23/tesla-battery-taking-straw-off-camels-back-for-sa-energy-demand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/23/tesla-battery-taking-straw-off-camels-back-for-sa-energy-demand","fields":{"headline":"Tesla battery 'taking straw off camel's back' for South Australia energy demand","bodyText":"The big Tesla battery in South Australia is consistently working to serve the peak energy demand each day, taking the “straw off the camel’s back,” according to the Australia Institute’s latest national energy emissions audit. The report also finds emissions from the National Electricity Market [NEM] continued to drop in January, falling to their lowest levels since 2004, driven by the federal large-scale renewable energy target. Energy expert Hugh Saddler examined the consumption and output of electricity of the Hornsdale Power Reserve, analysing the patterns of charging and discharging of the Tesla battery. He found a consistent pattern of the battery charging overnight when wind generation was abundant and cheap, and discharging into the grid during the late afternoon when demand and spot market prices reached peak levels. Only 30% of the battery’s 100MW capacity was devoted to this sort of trading, with the rest spent stabilising the energy system by maintaining the frequency of the grid at the required 50 Hz and240 volts. Even with the relatively small capacity devoted to smoothing demand – supplying only about 1% of peak demand in the state – Saddler said it is still providing a useful service and demonstrates the valuable role energy storage can play in thesystem. “While the watts may seem small in the context of the whole system, the SA battery is providing critical power at the critical moment – in effect taking the straw off the camel’s back.” He said it is effectively time-shifting wind generation, and exploiting the difference in wholesale energy prices throughout the day. “The world’s biggest battery, in SA, is working in smooth synergy with windfarms,” Saddler said. “Peak wind production is easily the cheapest way to charge the battery, and it stands ready to fill demand gaps if they emerge. The battery has been charging up overnight, when prices are very low and hitting the grid at the right time to keep price spikes lower than they would be otherwise.” The Australia Institute report also found emissions from the NEM had dropped to 152.8 Mt of CO2-equivalent in January – the lowest level since 2004. That happened despite relatively flat demand, driven by more large scale renewable energy projects coming online and the “decrepitude of Australia’s ageing fleet of coal fired power stations”.However Saddler warned that since the renewable energy target was now almost met, the country urgently needs a post-2021 energy policy to lower the NEM’s reliance on coal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/22/liberal-frontbench-spat-breaks-out-over-abbotts-lazy-immigration-views","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T03:14:41Z","webTitle":"Liberal frontbench spat breaks out over Abbott's 'lazy' immigration views","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/22/liberal-frontbench-spat-breaks-out-over-abbotts-lazy-immigration-views","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/22/liberal-frontbench-spat-breaks-out-over-abbotts-lazy-immigration-views","fields":{"headline":"Liberal frontbench spat breaks out over Abbott's 'lazy' immigration views","bodyText":"Public spats have broken out across the Coalition, as the fallout from the Barnaby Joyce affair continues to give licence for other grievances to be aired – even among traditional allies. While the rift within the National party intensifies ahead of Joyce’s return to work on Monday, its senior Coalition partner is weathering its own storm, as former prime minister Tony Abbott squares off against his colleagues over immigration. In the latest wave of internal irritation within the government to make its way to the public sphere, Steve Ciobo, Mathias Cormann and Scott Morrison have all challenged Abbott’s clarion call to cut Australia’s immigration rates. Ciobo said Abbott’s views were “lazy and inaccurate”, while Cormann, currently the acting prime minister, dismissed as plain “wrong” Abbott’s call to cut immigration from 190,000 to 110,000 a year. Morrison argued the economics of Abbott’s plan didn’t play out, claiming it would cost the budget up to $5bn over four years, and impact the nation’s skills level. Peter Dutton, who had previously indicated he may be willing to look at lowering the permanent migration cap, walked back on his original comments on Wednesday, declaring at his National Press Club address the current immigration settings were correct. But it was Morrison, a known ally, whom Abbott took aim at in his response to the criticism - taking to social media to lambast Morrison for not thinking independently. “Scott Morrison has conveniently forgotten the very vigorous discussion about cutting immigration that took place inside government in early 2015 as part of the budget process,” he said. “Because we were achieving a reduction anyway I eventually decided not to adjust the official figure but I kept it on the table as I never accepted the Treasury orthodoxy that more migrants meant more growth and a stronger budget outcome. “If Treasury is right why not solve the deficit simply by ramping up immigration? “I repeat, we should not let Treasury’s accounting rules stop the government from acting in our medium term national interests and Scott should have the gumption to think for himself.” It’s the latest volley in a raft of rifts being made public within the Coalition, which have intensified in the days following Malcolm Turnbull’s public set-down of Joyce for his decision to engage in an affair with a former staffer. Joyce responded by calling Turnbull “inept”, with the working relationship between the two men now under question as the deputy prime minister refuses to step down from the leadership of his party or the front bench. But it is not just the relationship between the two Coalition leaders under question, with divisions within the National party becoming more defined. Andrew Broad was the latest Nationals MP to wander into the fray in the wake of Joyce’s “move on” interview with Fairfax Media. Quoting the late US evangelical preacher Billy Graham, whose death on Thursday created international headlines, Broad passed comment on the character of his leader. “When wealth is lost, nothing is lost; when health is lost, something is lost; when character is lost, all is lost,” Broad tweeted on Thursday morning. “…Telling words for the leadership of the National party.” No clear challenger has emerged for Joyce’s position, with the deputy prime minister telling supporters he expects to survive the political storm which emerged following the public reveal of his affair, and allegations he misused his public office during the relationship. Broad has not previously publicly stated his position, but is counted among National MPs who would vote against Joyce if a leadership challenge became a reality. At this stage, the Nationals party room meeting scheduled for Monday remains non-compulsory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/22/we-need-aid-that-helps-locals-not-multinationals-and-bloated-ngos","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T05:09:10Z","webTitle":"We need aid that helps locals, not multinationals and bloated NGOs | Antony Loewenstein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/we-need-aid-that-helps-locals-not-multinationals-and-bloated-ngos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/we-need-aid-that-helps-locals-not-multinationals-and-bloated-ngos","fields":{"headline":"We need aid that helps locals, not multinationals and bloated NGOs","bodyText":"Foreign aid has the power to save lives but also to corrupt nations. It’s regularly used as a political football as some argue for more financial support to the world’s most vulnerable people while others believe more money should be spent at home. It’s a false distinction, however, because the key issue is whether western aid is well targeted and empowering people to make their own choices on how to improve their lives, allowing them to eventually become more self-sufficient. The aid industry is currently under the spotlight, Oxfam’s past behaviour is rightly challenged, although the problems uncovered affect the entire industry. But what’s required is hearing from aid recipients themselves. The US administration is slashing foreign aid to nations it views as unfriendly or voting against its interests at the United Nations. Nonetheless, the answer isn’t simply more aid. In 2017, Afghanistan was the highest recipient of US aid, US$4.7 billion, but much of the more than US$120 billion given by the US to the country since October 2001 has been wasted, disappeared, stolen through corruption or simply cannot be accounted for by Washington. Australia has also invested heavily in Afghanistan and seen few positive results. Canberra stumbled into the war with little understanding of what it was trying to achieve (apart from blindly following president George W. Bush). It’s now the longest war in US history with no end in sight and a cost of over US$1 trillion. Rethinking how aid is delivered should be a key question for western nations but it rarely makes the headlines. For the last six years, with New York-based director Thor Neureiter and co-producers Media Stockade, I’ve been making the documentary, Disaster Capitalism, to investigate where aid money is going. Focusing on Afghanistan, Haiti and Papua New Guinea (PNG), talking to people trying to live decent lives amid economic chaos and conflict, a constant refrain is how little local voices are listened to. Too often, western governments and aid groups parachute into a crisis and dictate terms to a disoriented population. In Haiti the American Red Cross pledged to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild devastated houses after the 2010 earthquake but today have achieved very little. As Haitian workers’ union leader Yannick Etienne told us, her country became a “republic of NGOs”. Outside governments and NGOs often gave contracts to foreign companies who employed individuals unable to speak French or Creole. The results were inevitable; Haiti’s position as a US-client state producing cheap clothing for Walmart and Target was unchanged because there was no interest in improving the country’s economic situation beyond handouts. US aid critic and insider Timothy Schwartz, who appears in the film, powerfully explains the unhealthy dynamics in his new book, The Great Haiti Humanitarian Aid Swindle, after living there for decades. While acknowledging that not all aid was squandered, he shows in detail how in the first year after the earthquake, the Haitian government got one percent of it. Schwartz condemns the “truth-twisting” – humanitarian groups’ misrepresenting and exaggerating the already bad situation to “get donors to give” – and the many journalists willing to spread these distortions despite the inability of NGOs to get the job done. In PNG, Australia’s role since its 1975 independence is revealing. Canberra views its close neighbour as a client state, dumping its unwanted asylum seekers, enriching Australian resource companies and overlooking corruption. Canberra gives over $500 million per year to PNG and yet its citizens suffer from appalling levels of poverty and domestic violence. The province of Bougainville once had the world’s biggest copper mine, run by Rio Tinto, but its existence sparked a separatist revolution. Outraged by its pollution and lack of financial support, locals rose up in the late 1980s. They eventually won against a PNG army backed by Australia but at a steep cost; up to 20,000 died out of a population of 200,000. The mine remains closed today but Australia, PNG and foreign companies insist that an independence vote, scheduled for 2019, is contingent on re-opening big-scale mining, claiming only this could sustain a sovereign nation. Aid is used as a weapon with the potential for it to be withdrawn if local leaders don’t comply with Canberra’s wishes. Many locals oppose this, angry that compensation was never paid after the battle against Rio Tinto. They push for alternative plans such as tourism, agriculture and fishing. In Afghanistan, the country’s largely untapped resources are potentially worth up to US$4 trillion. Despite a brutal civil war, the Trump administration, following Bush and Obama, is determined to support a mining industry that enriches foreign companies. Sources in Kabul tell me that Trump officials are already visiting to assess the viability of backing a resource boom, and associates of military contractor Blackwater founder Erik Prince are recruiting locals to secure areas where rare metals are under the ground. It’s a recipe for continued chaos. What ties Afghanistan, Haiti and PNG together are the ways in which they’re deliberately kept dependent on foreign aid by western governments and some NGOs. There could be another way if locals were asked what they need and want. Aid that doesn’t principally enrich multinationals and bloated NGOs must be the goal. • Antony Loewenstein is an independent journalist, author of “Disaster Capitalism: Making A Killing Out Of Catastrophe” and writer/co-producer of the documentary, Disaster Capitalism Public screenings of the film with Loewenstein and journalists, organised by the Walkley Foundation, are 22 February in Sydney and 1 March in Melbourne.

Buckingham threatened to take legal action against the party if it proceeded to hear the complaint, on the grounds that it was procedurally unfair. The threat of legal action has persuaded the conflict resolution committee – a randomly selected group of four office-holders – to fold and recommend mediation of the complaint instead. Despite that concession, further factional battles are brewing. Cate Faehrmann is challenging an attempt to prevent her from replacing Mehreen Faruqi in the NSW upper house and there is pressure on Rhiannon to step aside for Faruqi, who beat her in a preselection battle in November. Faehrmann, a former NSW upper house MP and chief of staff to the federal leader, Richard Di Natale, has transferred her membership from the Victorian branch back to NSW but only been given “provisional” status. The three-month provisional status would prevent her nominating to fill Faruqi’s vacancy by the 10 April deadline. She has provided the NSW Greens with legal advice that transferring members are entitled to full membership, and will consider a court challenge if her bid is rejected. Greens factional tensions in NSW erupted when the complaint against Buckingham was revealed on Wednesday. The complaint, signed by eight Greens members and containing testimony from Rhiannon and her partner, Geoff Ash, accuses Buckingham of “serious and false criticisms” for suggesting in a Four Corners episode in August that Rhiannon thwarts democratic reform. On Thursday the NSW Greens co-convenor Debbie Gibson informed members that she and the complaints committee had decided to “suspend the complaints process and disband” after receiving a letter from Buckingham’s lawyers. The group recommended that the Greens seek legal advice about its complaints process because the letter argued the process was procedurally unfair and would not withstand a legal challenge. They urged the parties to undertake mediation. In a statement on Facebook, Buckingham welcomed the “good news” that the push to expel him had been suspended and the complaint committee disbanded. “While the Greens need a robust and fair complaints process, we must ensure that it cannot be misused to try and punish those who hold and express differing political views,” he said. “As a grassroots party with a founding principle of peace and non-violence, political differences within the Greens should be respected, discussed openly and ultimately decided democratically by members.” Linda Eisler, a Green on Canterbury council and one of the complainants, told Guardian Australia that she is “not giving up trying to expose the truth” and would consider options such as raising the Buckingham complaint at state delegates’ council on the weekend or relodging the complaint. The suspension of the complaint is a victory for Buckingham, who faces preselection in April and May this year for the 2019 state election, along with fellow upper house member David Shoebridge. The Greens’ affirmative action rules require a woman to hold one of the top two spots, meaning that Shoebridge could be relegated to the winnable, but difficult, third spot if he loses to Buckingham. Factional opponents of Rhiannon have suggested she may attempt to swap to the NSW upper house by now nominating for the vacancy or the ticket. “I’m not running in any preselection,” Rhiannon told Guardian Australia. “[This] is not going to change ... it was never on the cards.” Since Faruqi defeated Rhiannon in a preselection contest in November, some Greens members have put pressure on Rhiannon to quit the federal Senate, allowing Faruqi to fill the vacancy and contest the next half-Senate election as an incumbent. In Queensland, Senator Andrew Bartlett has announced he will run for the seat of Brisbane rather than contest preselection against the former senator Larissa Waters and challenger Ben Pennings. When he announced the move in February, Bartlett said he would stay on in the Senate “throughout this year”. The senator’s position would help him maintain his profile in the lead-up to the election but Bartlett is likely to face similar pressure to stand down to allow Waters or Pennings to have the benefits of incumbency in the Senate election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/22/hate-filled-narratives-target-minorities-globally-says-amnesty-international","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T05:01:08Z","webTitle":"'Hate-filled' narratives target minorities globally, says Amnesty International","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/22/hate-filled-narratives-target-minorities-globally-says-amnesty-international","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/22/hate-filled-narratives-target-minorities-globally-says-amnesty-international","fields":{"headline":"'Hate-filled' narratives target minorities globally, says Amnesty International","bodyText":"The entrenched “apartheid” of the Rohingya people in Myanmar, which in 2017 erupted into a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign, is emblematic of a broader global trend of dog-whistling, violence, and discrimination against marginalised minorities, Amnesty International has said in its annual report. Amnesty’s excoriating report paints a grim picture of the state of human rights globally, arguing that “hate-filled narratives by governments around the world” havegiven licence to bigotry and discrimination against already-vulnerable groups. “The spectres of hatred and fear now loom large in world affairs, and we have few governments standing up for human rights in these disturbing times. Instead, leaders such as (Egyptian president) al-Sisi, (Philippines president) Duterte, (Venezuelan president) Maduro, Putin, Trump, and (Chinese president) Xi are callously undermining the rights of millions,” Amnesty International’s secretary-general Salil Shetty said. “We saw the ultimate consequence of a society encouraged to hate, scapegoat and fear minorities laid bare in the horrific military campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya people in Myanmar. “The feeble response to crimes against humanity and war crimes from Myanmar to Syria and Yemen underscored the lack of leadership on human rights. Governments are shamelessly turning the clock back on decades of hard-won protections.” The Asia-Pacific region, Amnesty said, was dominated by a failure of governments to protect people’s rights, and in many cases, an active persecution of their own citizens. The Rohingya crisis in Myanmar, which the UN has described as “textbook ethnic cleansing”, saw more than 650,000 Rohingya, most of them children, flee over Myanmar’s border into Bangladesh. They remain there in makeshift camps, with the looming monsoon rains and the cyclone season threatening an even more acute humanitarian crisis. But the persecution of the Rohingya was a global failure, Amnesty argued: for decades the world had failed to address “the conditions that provide fertile ground for mass atrocity crimes”. “The warning signs in Myanmar had long been visible: massive discrimination and segregation had become normalised within a regime that amounted to apartheid, and for long years the Rohingya people were routinely demonised and stripped of the basic conditions needed to live in dignity. The transformation of discrimination and demonisation into mass violence is tragically familiar, and its ruinous consequences cannot be easily undone.” The Rohingya crisis faces an intractable future, with Bangladesh struggling to cope with the influx of people, no obvious third-country resettlement options, and a population too scarred by violence against them to consider returning. “If the Rohingya refugees were forced to return to Myanmar, they would be at the mercy of the same military that drove them out and would continue to face the entrenched system of discrimination and segregation amounting to apartheid that made them so vulnerable in the first place,” the report says. The Amnesty report assesses the state of human rights across the globe, regionally, and for 159 individual countries and territories. It also highlights ongoing atrocities in Syria’s civil war. In the last four days, bombing of civilian areas, including 13 hospitals, in Eastern Ghouta has killed 310 people, many of them children. Pictures and images of dead and injured have shocked the world: UN secretary general Antonio Guterres described the besieged city as “hell on earth”. “Government and allied forces, including Russia, carried out indiscriminate attacks and direct attacks on civilians and civilian objects using aerial and artillery bombing, including with chemical and other internationally banned weapons, killing and injuring hundreds,” Amnesty’s report says. “Government forces maintained lengthy sieges on densely populated areas, restricting access to humanitarian and medical aid to thousands of civilians.” While the Amnesty International report paints a bleak portrait of a world in which human rights regressed in 2017, Shetty argued the punitive approaches of governments had inspired many people to join long-standing struggles for rights, including: the campaign to allow women to drive in Saudi Arabia; the global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and violence; India’s “Not in my name” protests against rising Islamophobia and lynchings of Muslims and Dalits; democracy marches in Zimbabwe; and successful marriage equality campaigns in countries such as Australia and Taiwan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/22/brit-awards-2018-five-things-stormzy-haim-jack-whitehall","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T08:43:58Z","webTitle":"Brit awards 2018: five things we learned, from Haim's humour to Stormzy's power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/22/brit-awards-2018-five-things-stormzy-haim-jack-whitehall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/22/brit-awards-2018-five-things-stormzy-haim-jack-whitehall","fields":{"headline":"Brit awards 2018: five things we learned, from Haim's humour to Stormzy's power","bodyText":"Este Haim was truly the year’s biggest winner Este Haim stole the 2018 Brit awards, miming lip-balm application and the words “call me” while winking like Arrested Development’s Lucille Bluth during Jack Whitehall’s interview with Liam Payne and Cheryl Cole. (Runners up: her sisters Danielle and Alana corpsing in the background.) Alas, for all the tweets, few people on Twitter actually seemed to know who she was – perhaps because she wasn’t holding her instrument, the one that identifies her as Bass Face. But their admiring comments were brilliant nonetheless. “‘Drunk woman’ behind Liam and Cheryl at BRIT Awards makes viewers p*ss themselves laughing,” tweeted Lad Bible. Este retweeted it, adding: “Not drunk, just living my truth”. LS And Ed Sheeran was the night’s biggest loser Despite having the biggest album of 2017 by every metric imaginable, Ed Sheeran went all but ignored by last month’s Grammy awards, winning two minor, un-televised gongs (pop vocal album and pop solo performance). With four nods at this year’s Brits – plus the guaranteed global success award (AKA the “please come, we need you for coverage in tomorrow’s Bizarre column” bribe) – it was assumed that they would attempt to right the Grammys’ snub by lavishing recognition on a homegrown talent. Nope! He didn’t win a single one. None of which will make a difference to his colossal sales, of course, but when a massive-selling artist lacks critical acclaim, they can usually count on industry approval, and in this instance, Sheeran has neither, which has to sting. (Or maybe not: he and fiancee Cherry Seaborn are rumoured to have married in secret – they were both wearing wedding bands at the event – which is much more important than some ephemeral gong.) LS Jack Whitehall should get the job next year, and the year after that The presenter’s job has been monopolised by James Corden in recent years; though as a song-and-dance man he could be amusing, his luvvieish tendencies could make the Brits feel like the self-indulgence that it of course is. But Whitehall – an airy posho whose buffoonishness deflates him to everyman level – had fun with the event’s pretensions. Unafraid to lampoon Little Mix, draw out sexy, watershed-straddling banter from Cheryl and Liam and make himself an idiot in a Man’s Not Hot sketch, he aced his maiden year. The highlight was, after sensitively allowing Gorillaz’ guest stars their time in the limelight, an immaculate pricking of Damon Albarn’s meandering, vague attempt at statesman status: “I think he’s talking about Brexit,” deadpanned a sotto voce Whitehall. BBT Politicised red carpets are getting old fast The Brits spent weeks working out how to acknowledge the entertainment industry’s stands against sexual harassment and inequality, and, after all that, decided to copy the Grammys by asking attendees to wear a white rose on the red carpet. Fine: most guests did so (from the ITV coverage, Foo Fighters seemed to be the only high-profile act who didn’t), but that was about the extent of the tribute. Prior to the event, Brits chairman Jason Iley told me that they hadn’t planned any performances or speeches pertaining to #MeToo or #TimesUp, preferring to leave musicians to speak for themselves should they want to. Accepting the award for British female solo artist, Dua Lipa said she wanted to see more women on the Brits’ stage, Ellie Goulding made an oblique reference to the Grammys’ lack of female winners, and Emma Willis cracked a brief jibe about the lack of a female co-presenter – all of them more significant than the red-carpet rose-wearing. The Brits organisers’ silent, near-apolitical embrace of that protest seems like an attempt to cover their own backs against criticism rather than, you know, actually make a key point about the inappropriate behaviour that affects the music industry just as much as Hollywood. LS Stormzy beat Kendrick to the night’s masterstroke Kendrick Lamar, a man who tends to let his lyrics and performances do the talking rather than interviews or public statements, created an artful, elliptical tableaux that elevated rap to a kind of performance art. He delivered his verse from pop-rap viral hit New Freezer atop a glass cube in which the track’s lead artist, Rich the Kid, silently smashed up a Lamborghini. This was announced as a “satire”, presumably on the acquisitiveness of rap culture; its eerie energy – cheerleader dancers out front, Beckettian theatre-making out back – was like little the Brits has ever seen before. But Stormzy eclipsed its high-cultural aspirations with a freestyle that took the opposite tack. He spoke plainly and brutally about his dismay at the country’s media and political elite, and then – taking a single breath – suddenly modulated his voice into a keener, throatier register as he turned his back on negativity, championing the success of other black Britons. Rarely has black British creativity had such a vociferous affirmation in such a public place. It was reminiscent of Lenny Henry’s barnstorming speech at the 2015 Mobo awards where he reeled off a litany of great predecessors from Desmond Dekker to Moira Stewart – but was more focused, and crucially, beamed into millions more homes.

The two-year-old girl was hospitalised in Alice Springs on Friday, before being transferred to Adelaide women and children’s hospital. She was released on Wednesday. Police have charged a 24-year-old man with sexual intercourse without consent of a minor and he is due to face court in April. Family members of the child have accused Territory Families of not acting on multiple notifications about the safety of the child and younger brother, who lived with their mother. The NT Department of Territory Families has launched a review, and the NT children’s commissioner has launched an own-initiative investigation. Nigel Scullion told Guardian Australia he had asked the NT government to be “as open and transparent as possible about the circumstances leading up to this incident”. “Every child is entitled to live in a safe, happy and healthy home,” he said. Territory Families has confirmed there were notifications - reportedly more than 20 and including six that were substantiated - but said none related to sexual abuse. “In terms of the notifications we received, there were no specific concerns that came to Territory Families about particular harm to this child of a sexual nature,” the department’s chief executive, Ken Davies, told the ABC. “They were not substantial enough to take the child out of this household and away from the mother.” A spokeswoman for Territory Families told Guardian Australia earlier this week it had “engaged with the family to provide a range of programs and connect them to family support services”. Tennant Creek residents attended a community meeting on Wednesday with the police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, and the acting chief minister of the NT, Nicole Manison. The meeting was held five days after the alleged rape. NT police did not inform the public of the alleged rape until media made inquiries. The police commissioner, the minister and the chief executive of Territory Families, as well as the NT chief minister and his deputy were not aware of the incident until Tuesday, the day media reported it. According to attendees of the community meeting, many raised the worsening levels of alcohol and substance abuse in the town, and related crime and violence. They also expressed dissatisfaction with the government’s response to their months-long calls for assistance, including direct entreaties following a spate of suicides in November. Several called on the government to improve their interactions with the Tennant Creek community and in particular its Indigenous community, which made up more than 50% of the town’s population. On Thursday Scullion said the federal government stood ready to support the family and community. “To be absolutely clear, while many facts about the tragic circumstances are still unknown, incidents like these are not unique to or characteristics of being Indigenous,” he said. “These are often circumstances influenced by factors such as endemic poverty, poor health including mental health as well as substance abuse among other things. The reality is the vast majority of Indigenous families love and care for their children, raising them in healthy and happy homes, connected to their land and their culture.” The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner, June Oscar, said she was “deeply saddened” by the alleged attack on the young girl and called for the development of harm minimisation and community-led solutions to manage alcohol abuse in Tennant Creek. “As a community we all carry a responsibility to ensure our children are safe and we must ensure that policies, programs and services adequately support the safety of women and children in regional areas, such as Tennant Creek,” Oscar said. The Indigenous health minister, Ken Wyatt, told ABC Darwin it was easy to blame government inaction but noted equally there were calls for fewer Indigenous children to be removed from their homes. He said he would like to see a better effort in providing wrap-around services to support families."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/21/google-lawsuit-tim-chevalier-diversity-james-damore","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T01:53:36Z","webTitle":"Ex-engineer sues Google, saying he was fired for condemning diversity memo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/21/google-lawsuit-tim-chevalier-diversity-james-damore","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/21/google-lawsuit-tim-chevalier-diversity-james-damore","fields":{"headline":"Ex-engineer sues Google, saying he was fired for condemning diversity memo","bodyText":"A former Google engineer has filed a lawsuit alleging that he was fired for speaking out against James Damore’s controversial memo about gender, the latest development in a litigious battle over diversity and speech at the technology company. Tim Chevalier, a site reliability engineer who worked for Google until November 2017, sued his former employer in California state court on Wednesday. Chevalier, who identifies as queer, disabled and transgender, alleges that Google terminated him over posts he made on internal forums advocating for diversity at Google and criticizing Damore. Damore was fired for “advancing harmful gender stereotypes” in August 2017 after the memo, in which he posited that psychological differences between men and women explain the gaping gender imbalance at Google, was leaked and went viral. Damore’s firing became a flashpoint for conservatives, and in January he filed a class action suit alleging that Google discriminates against white male conservatives. The Damore lawsuit included nearly 100 pages of screen shots of internal communications at Google which the suit alleged demonstrated widespread hostility against conservative viewpoints. The Chevalier lawsuit offers a different spin on the debates that played out on Google’s internal email lists and message boards, which the attorney David Lowe described in a statement as “a cesspool of bullying and harassment”. Google failed to prevent employees from using the internal platforms to discriminate against marginalized groups, the suit alleges, allowing Google employees to call LGBT co-workers “immoral” and post statements such as:“If we have fewer Black and Latin@ people here, doesn’t that mean they’re not as good?” Chevalier regularly participated in these internal discussions, the lawsuit states, “calling out discrimination and harassment for what it was and asking his peers to reflect on perspectives different from their own”. “It is a cruel irony that Google attempted to justify firing me by claiming that my social networking posts showed bias against my harassers,” Chevalier said in a statement. “The anti-discrimination laws are meant to protect marginalized and underrepresented groups – not those who attack them.” In an emailed statement, Google defended its termination of Chevalier. “An important part of our culture is lively debate. But like any workplace, that doesn’t mean anything goes,” a spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano, said. “The overwhelming majority of our employees communicate in a way that is consistent with our policies. But when an employee does not, it is something we must take seriously. We always make our decision without any regard to the employee’s political views.” The suit alleges that Chevalier was chastised by his manager for spending too much time on “social activism” and by human resources for a blogpost he wrote criticizing the Damore memo as “misogynistic”. According to the suit, Google objected to Chevalier’s use of the phrase “white boys” in his blogpost because it “could be perceived as a generalization about race and gender”. Chevalier “learned that Google defines appropriate workplace speech by the standard of what someone with a cisgender, heterosexual, white, male, upper-middle-class background would say,” the suit states. “In truth, Google’s promise to allow its employees to freely speak their minds only apples to people who represent the majority viewpoint and use the majority’s rhetoric.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/21/marco-rubio-gun-control-where-does-he-stand-florida","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T01:34:15Z","webTitle":"Marco Rubio: where does he stand on gun control?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/marco-rubio-gun-control-where-does-he-stand-florida","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/marco-rubio-gun-control-where-does-he-stand-florida","fields":{"headline":"Marco Rubio: where does he stand on gun control?","bodyText":"Just two years ago, the National Rifle Association (NRA) spent more than $1m during a single election cycle to support the re-election of the Florida senator Marco Rubio. Today, Rubio is trying to position himself as a Republican seeking compromise on gun control laws. He agreed to join CNN’s town hall to discuss – with angry, grieving student survivors – what needs to be done after a school shooting left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida. “Only GOP at CNN townhall”, Rubio tweeted on Wednesday, in response to criticism from a Florida newspaper that he had long dodged the issue of gun control. Here’s what Rubio has said about gun control and what he’s saying now: During his campaign for president in 2016, Rubio said that he had bought a gun in order to personally protect his family from Isis. “If Isis were to visit us or our communities at any moment, the last line of defense between Isis and my family is the ability that I have to protect my family from them or from a criminal or anyone else who seeks to do us harm,” he said. “Millions of Americans feel that way.” He also received a rifle as a present on the campaign trail. After the Parkland shooting, Rubio suggested that stricter gun control laws could not have stopped the 19-year-old shooter from getting a gun and opening fire on his former classmates and teachers. “I’m trying to be clear and honest here: someone who has decided to commit this crime, they will find a way to get the gun to do it,” he said. “It’s also unfair to argue that the reason why people are suffering today is because there’s some great law out there that if we had just passed it, it wouldn’t have happened. It’s not accurate,” he told the Miami Herald. Rubio’s arguments against gun control laws sparked anger and protest, including three billboard signs calling for gun control set up outside his office, a reference to the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. On Sunday, he suggested that it might be worth considering a new type of gun legislation that would create “gun violence restraining orders”. These laws would give families and law enforcement a way to petition a court to temporarily take away an at-risk person’s guns in moments of crisis or dangerous behavior. Gun violence researchers and parents of mass shooting victims have touted these laws an an important tool to reduce violence, particularly because family members and law enforcement may be able to see risk signs long before an individual meets the criteria under law to be permanently barred from gun ownership for life. Rubio cited a recent article in the conservative National Review that suggested gun violence restraining orders, also known as “red flag laws”, could be a point of bipartisan agreement that could save lives. Given the amount of money Rubio has received from the NRA, “his support is surprising – but welcome”, said the New York state senator Brian Kavanagh, who has been leading an effort to pass these protection orders at the state level across the country. Whether or not Rubio can get fellow congressional Republicans on board, he could still, Kavanagh pointed out, take action in Florida. “I hope he will follow up his words with real action to ensure [this legislation] is enacted in his home state,” Kavanagh said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/22/full-list-of-winners-at-the-2018-brit-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T00:34:23Z","webTitle":"Full list of winners at the 2018 Brit awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/22/full-list-of-winners-at-the-2018-brit-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/22/full-list-of-winners-at-the-2018-brit-awards","fields":{"headline":"Full list of winners at the 2018 Brit awards","bodyText":"Full list of nominations British male solo artist Ed Sheeran Liam Gallagher Loyle Carner Rag’n’Bone Man WINNER: Stormzy British female solo artist WINNER: Dua Lipa Jessie Ware Kate Tempest Laura Marling Paloma Faith British group WINNER: Gorillaz London Grammar Royal Blood Wolf Alice The xx British breakthrough act Dave WINNER: Dua Lipa J Hus Loyle Carner Sampha British single Calvin Harris – Feels (feat Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry and Big Sean) Clean Bandit – Symphony (feat Zara Larsson) Dua Lipa – New Rules Ed Sheeran – Shape of You J Hus – Did You See Jax Jones – You Don’t Know Me (feat Raye) Jonas Blue – Mama (feat William Singe) Liam Payne – Strip That Down (feat Quavo) Little Mix – Touch WINNER: Rag’n’Bone Man – Human British album Dua Lipa – Dua Lipa Ed Sheeran – ÷ J Hus – Common Sense Rag’n’Bone Man – Human WINNER: Stormzy – Gang Signs &amp; Prayer British artist video Anne-Marie – Ciao Adios Calvin Harris – Feels (feat Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry and Big Sean) Clean Bandit – Symphony (feat Zara Larsson) Dua Lipa – New Rules Ed Sheeran – Shape of You WINNER: Harry Styles – Sign of the Times Jonas Blue – Mama (feat William Singe) Liam Payne – Strip That Down (feat Quavo) Little Mix – Touch Zayn and Taylor Swift – I Don’t Wanna Live Forever International male solo artist Beck Childish Gambino DJ Khaled Drake WINNER: Kendrick Lamar International female solo artist Alicia Keys Björk WINNER: Lorde Pink Taylor Swift International group Arcade Fire WINNER: Foo Fighters Haim The Killers LCD Soundsystem"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/07/this-seasons-hottest-hairstyle-the-ear-tuck","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T08:00:34Z","webTitle":"This season's hottest hairstyle?

The ear tuck","bodyText":"“It’s such a dorky thing to do. Like you can’t find your alice band and you’ve got to do your maths homework.” Tilly Macalister-Smith, a British fashion writer based in New York as director of content for DVF, is talking about the power beauty move of the moment: tucking your hair behind your ears. Forget twice-weekly blow-dries, dip-powder manicures and dragons’ blood sheet masks. The beauty hack of the season is literally at your fingertips. Hook your hair behind an ear or two and you’re good to go. In 2018, the look is not just for getting your homework finished. Margot Robbie did it at the Golden Globes, in a plunging black custom-made Gucci gown, with soft blond waves falling loose on one side, tucked behind the ear on the other, accented with a hazelnut-sized Tiffany diamond earring. Emma Stone, in golden Givenchy, sported an eartuck for the Oscar red carpet last year. Meghan Markle chose it for her first evening engagement with Prince Harry, looking sharp in an Alexander McQueen trouser suit. Gigi Hadid did it on the cover of US Vogue. For high-octane glamour on the S/S 18 catwalks, the Versace show – the one where Donatella took a victory lap with Naomi, Cindy, Helena, Claudia and Carla – was hard to beat. But for Kaia Gerber, the Hadid sisters and the rest of the model army who stalked that catwalk in a baroque homage to Gianni, Guido Palau “didn’t want to parody any old idea of glamour,” he explained backstage. With Donatella, he decided on a look that was “polished and beautiful in a very simple way. Shiny, without too much volume.” The hair was centre-parted, tucked behind the ears and fixed in place with sparkling gold barrettes on both sides. The idea was echoed on several of the most glamorous catwalks. At Valentino, hair-tucking was emphasised by a wash of pink blush on the cheekbones. At Dolce &amp; Gabbana, it was framed by jewelled tiaras. “It has become a look, but it still has connotations of being a buttoned-up schoolgirl,” says Macalister-Smith, a committed (and very chic) hair-tucker. “I mean, it’s so much more sexy to have your hair in your face, isn’t it? That whole cool French girl thing. The body language of tucking your hair behind your ears is quite English, I think. Princess Diana used to do it.” Tucked-behind-the-ears hair boils down to practicality. Which is precisely why it is in vogue now, at a moment when fashion is more engaged with women’s real lives than it has been for years. Just-stepped-out-of-a-salon bounce is much less on-trend than it was a few years ago. The cool salons report that while ladies who lunch of a certain age still keep their twice-weekly standing blow-out appointments, younger clients are dropping the habit. Tucking hair behind your ears – which would have been sacrilege if you had just paid £30 for someone to wield a hot brush for volume around your hairline – looks right again. The inimitably elegant designer Roksanda Ilincic has always tucked back her long, poker-straight hair. “It used to be that I would do it without realising. In fact, I would start the day with my hair down, and catch sight of myself in the mirror and be annoyed that I had done it. But at some point it started to grow on me as a look and these days, if I have an event, I put my hair behind my ears on purpose. I am not so keen on hair that looks very ‘done’. With a nice dress and a red lip, hair that is tucked behind your ears is a good counterbalance.” Tucked hair is practical, but styled up – with lipstick, or a barrette, or an earring – it adds impact. “I can’t work with hair in my eyes, so that’s how it started,” says Pandora Sykes, journalist and co-host of the High Low podcast. “It’s quite old school – a bit Enid Blyton, a bit Margot Tenenbaum – but I quite like the contrast of having one side neat behind my ear, with the other mussed up and slightly forward.” If the behind-the-ear tuck evolved from the Céline hair-inside-polo-neck look – “Which was revolutionary when we first saw it, but is now a generic cool-girl uniform,” Macalister-Smith says – the newest, most cutting edge take on hair tucking is the sideburn tuck. Leaving a section of hair loose in front of the ear takes the tuck from schoolgirl to edgy tomboy. At the Alexander McQueen S/S 18 show, hair was inspired “by a girl coming out of the water,” Guido Palau says. After the hair was tucked behind the ears, strands were pulled out using a fine-tooth comb. “It’s a little dark, a little romantic, a little strange,” the hairstylist adds. This take on the tuck, Macalister-Smith says, is “the hardest to get right. Brigitte Bardot did a version of it that was very sexy. But it is an ‘editorial’ look, really. It tends to look contrived in real life.” The vogue for big earrings, on the other hand, has crossed over happily from catwalk to the street – and in doing so has helped drive the hair tuck. Macalister-Smith began Ear After Ear, an Instagram account for earring lovers, after one snap of a great pair of earrings earned a huge response. “The classic style, when you have big earrings on, is to scrape all your hair back,” she says. “But the tuck is another option. It is definitely connected. If you’ve got a great earring on, tucking your hair behind an ear is like drawing the curtains.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/21/remember-this-sheffield-united-never-win-at-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T16:49:55Z","webTitle":"Remember this: Sheffield United never win at Chelsea | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/21/remember-this-sheffield-united-never-win-at-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/21/remember-this-sheffield-united-never-win-at-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Remember this: Sheffield United never win at Chelsea","bodyText":"When, if ever, can we expect to see the Guardian letters page replete with protests about the mass slaughter of innocent civilians in Syria (‘This is a catastrophe’, 21 February) and calls for sanctions against, and boycotts of, the perpetrators?

Public discourse about it invariably focuses on the threat (or promise, depending on your point of view) of “superintelligent” machines, ie ones that display human-level general intelligence, even though such devices have been 20 to 50 years away ever since we first started worrying about them. The likelihood (or mirage) of such machines still remains a distant prospect, a point made by the leading AI researcher Andrew Ng, who said that he worries about superintelligence in the same way that he frets about overpopulation on Mars. That seems about right to me. If one were a conspiracy theorist, one might ask if our obsession with a highly speculative future has been deliberately orchestrated to divert attention from the fact – pace Mr Gibson – that lower-level but exceedingly powerful AI is already here and playing an ever-expanding role in shaping our economies, societies and politics. This technology is a combination of machine learning and big data and it’s everywhere, controlled and deployed by a handful of powerful corporations, with occasional walk-on parts assigned to national security agencies. These corporations regard this version of “weak” AI as the biggest thing since sliced bread. The CEO of Google burbles about “AI everywhere” in his company’s offerings. Same goes for the other digital giants. In the face of this hype onslaught, it takes a certain amount of courage to stand up and ask awkward questions. If this stuff is so powerful, then surely we ought to be looking at how it is being used, asking whether it’s legal, ethical and good for society – and thinking about what will happen when it gets into the hands of people who are even worse than the folks who run the big tech corporations. Because it will. Fortunately, there are scholars who have started to ask these awkward questions. There are, for example, the researchers who work at AI Now, a research institute at New York University focused on the social implications of AI. Their 2017 report makes interesting reading. Last week saw the publication of more in the same vein – a new critique of the technology by 26 experts from six major universities, plus a number of independent thinktanks and NGOs. Its title – The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention and Mitigation – says it all. The report fills a serious gap in our thinking about this stuff. We’ve heard the hype, corporate and governmental, about the wonderful things AI can supposedly do and we’ve begun to pay attention to the unintentional downsides of legitimate applications of the technology. Now the time has come to pay attention to the really malign things bad actors could do with it. The report looks at three main “domains” in which we can expect problems. One is digital security. The use of AI to automate tasks involved in carrying out cyber-attacks will alleviate the existing trade-off between the scale and efficacy of attacks. We can also expect attacks that exploit human vulnerabilities (for example, through the use of speech synthesis for impersonation), existing software vulnerabilities (through automated hacking) or the vulnerabilities of legitimate AI systems (through corruption of the data streams on which machine learning depends). A second threat domain is physical security – attacks with drones and autonomous weapons systems. (Think v2.0 of the hobbyist drones that Isis deployed, but this time with face-recognition technology on board.) We can also expect new kinds of attacks that subvert physical systems – causing autonomous vehicles to crash, say – or ones deploying physical systems that would be impossible to remotely control from a distance: a thousand-strong swarm of micro-drones, for example. Finally, there’s what the authors call “political security” – using AI to automate tasks involved in surveillance, persuasion (creating targeted propaganda) and deception (eg, manipulating videos). We can also expect new kinds of attack based on machine-learning’s capability to infer human behaviours, moods and beliefs from available data. This technology will obviously be welcomed by authoritarian states, but it will also further undermine the ability of democracies to sustain truthful public debates. The bots and fake Facebook accounts that currently pollute our public sphere will look awfully amateurish in a couple of years. The report is available as a free download and is worth reading in full. If it were about the dangers of future or speculative technologies, then it might be reasonable to dismiss it as academic scare-mongering. The alarming thing is most of the problematic capabilities that its authors envisage are already available and in many cases are currently embedded in many of the networked services that we use every day. William Gibson was right: the future has already arrived."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/24/the-hot-young-widows-club-is-out-to-change-the-way-we-grieve","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"The Hot Young Widows Club is out to change the way we grieve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/24/the-hot-young-widows-club-is-out-to-change-the-way-we-grieve","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/24/the-hot-young-widows-club-is-out-to-change-the-way-we-grieve","fields":{"headline":"The Hot Young Widows Club is out to change the way we grieve","bodyText":"Writer Nora in Minneapolis, psychotherapist Kim in Los Angeles, and book editor Ben in New York are all members of an exclusive group no one wants to join: the Hot Young Widows Club. Despite the tongue-in-cheek name, it is not a niche dating site. The Hot Young Widows Club helps members cope with their grief following the early death of their partners. You don’t have to be either female or considered “hot” to join. Nor do you have to have been married. However, with most members aged 25 to 44, the majority are young to be widowed. A self described “secret Facebook group”, the HYWC is where members can freely vent, rage, laugh or cry – without judgment. It mostly happens online, with occasional meet-ups arranged if people happen to be in the same area. Ben Loehnen, 40, joined last year shortly after his husband, Peter Wertheim, died suddenly from heart failure at the age of 39. He says the support group has given him solace. “What’s so beautiful about it to my reading is that people use it almost like a confessional. There’s some wallowing, there’s tremendous pain on display, but there are also moments of real humor and hilarity and celebration and a reminder that life’s worth living.” Ben, who met Peter at Harvard, is still “reeling” from his death. But he says that “grief can be very performative because you feel that you need to appear to be sad or somber all the time. The brain doesn’t work that way – you do still laugh and smile, etc – and this group allows for that.” Ben’s words are pleasing to Nora McInerny – who co-founded the club with Moe Richardson - because her mission is to change the way we grieve. Nora’s husband Aaron Purmort was 35 when he died in 2014 from brain cancer. She was 31 and their son, Ralph, not quite two. A few weeks earlier her father had died, also of cancer, and she’d had a miscarriage. Her pain was unfathomable. “I didn’t even realize until a year after Aaron died that I wasn’t functioning in a productive way, because I’d never seen anybody grieve at all,” she says. That year was the loneliest of her life. “I had a very hard time being close to anybody,” she said. “I didn’t know how to show them what I was going through and they didn’t know how to be there. “I was so angry. People really want you to be gracious, and you want to be gracious. You want to be the person that at your husband’s funeral, people will go: ‘Oh wow, look at her go, she’s so good at this.’” Nora, who lives in Minneapolis, began dating Aaron in 2010. Within a year, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor after a seizure at work. As they lay in his hospital bed that night, they decided to get engaged. They married in the art gallery where they had met, a month after his surgery. During his treatment, Nora, who then worked in digital marketing, wrote a blog called myhusbandstumor.com. It was infused with her and Aaron’s sharp sense of humor and grew to have tens of thousands of followers. Aaron, an art director, turned everything, even going to the hospital for chemo, into “an event”, she says. “I loved going to the hospital with him, it was so much fun. I would truly forget we were there to get chemo and things were bad. For hospital overnights, he would pack his bag with special movies and we would plan where we would order food in from.” When he died, the unconventional obituary they wrote together blaming his death on a radioactive spider bite went viral. “I’d been so good at being Aaron’s cancer wife, I wanted to be the best widow the world had ever seen. Forget Jackie Kennedy,” Nora says. “I don’t have a lot of the same friends I had before. I used to blame everybody else but me for that, but I didn’t make it possible for them to be there for me. A lot of people just stopped asking me out, because I’d always say no, I wasn’t ready.” Nora wants us to realize that navigating death and mourning is messy and unpredictable. Since Aaron’s death, she has published a memoir called It’s Okay to Laugh (Crying is Cool Too). She hosts a podcast called Terrible, Thanks for Asking where guests share devastating events in their lives. She has also started Still Kickin – named after the slogan on a favourite T-shirt of Aaron’s – which is a nonprofit that gives financial help to people having a difficult time. And, of course, there’s the HYWC, which now has hundreds of members around the world, 6% of whom are men. Nora said: “When it started, it was just me and Moe hanging out. We called ourselves the Hot Young Widows Club. Aaron made up that phrase – he used to make up jokes for me all the time.” Moe’s husband, Andrew, killed himself two months before Aaron died. The hairdresser and her young son, who live near Minneapolis, met Nora after she posted the GoFundMe page for Moe’s family on her blog. They recognize the HYWC won’t appeal to everyone. Nora said: “The combination of those four words: hot, young, widows, club, does make people uncomfortable and I think that’s people who aren’t widowed. That to me is the appeal because it’s, like, now you get to be a little uncomfortable with this. We’re put in uncomfortable situations all the time, for example, you’re filling out a daycare form as ‘parent number one’ and the ‘parent number two’ part is required on the digital form.” There are HYWC T-shirts, mugs and pins. Nora even has a Hot Young Widows Club tattoo. “We have a lot of tongue-in-cheek days,” she said. “Grace in the UK posts Power Widow Wednesday, when you post one thing you’ve done well, it can be so little. There’s Widow Feel Friday, where people share their funny awkward stories, which I love – there’s a lot of dating stuff.” Book editor Ben has found it useful to read how others dealt with important milestones, like a wedding anniversary or with questions such as when to take off your wedding ring. He says: “There are people who are asking do I have to file a tax return for this or about issues around childcare. Then there are people who are saying: ‘I fucking hate my mother-in-law,’ or ‘I had a really good time last night, I went out and drank with some friends and I went home with a boy.’ “Or people start dating and they talk about how awkward it is on the first date to say: ‘I need you to know that I’m 32 but my husband died.’ It’s things they couldn’t say to anybody else because they would be censured and judged.” He adds: “I’ve felt embraced by it and lifted up and reminded that as horrendous as this year has been, there are people with equal and greater privation. There’s a lot of sadness in the world and a lot of people who are figuring out how to get through it.” Members like the fact that the group isn’t strictly moderated. Kim Reddy, 40, has tried other groups since her husband Michael died in 2016 from appendix cancer but she likes the HYWC best. “In other widow groups, the host has even deleted posts because I might have said ‘fuck’. With Nora’s group you can say what you want and there’s no judgment,” she says. “It’s more modern. The people are different to those on other sites, which is a reflection of Nora somehow. It’s very upbeat too. Some of the other groups make me feel very sad.” Kim, who lives in Rancho Palos Verdes with her children Tyara, 26, Brent, nine, and Grace, four, said: “I tried one in person, but it was mostly older people who’d lost their partners to cancer in their 70s and 80s. My situation is unusual. I couldn’t really relate.” Her husband Michael, a firefighter, was 39 when he died, four days after hearing he’d scored 97% in his captain’s exam. “He was so ill and so determined,” says Kim. “I was so numb. I didn’t even cry at his service. I remember thinking this doesn’t feel right why am I not crying? Everyone was crying around me.” She said the HYWC had been “amazing”, adding: “That’s when I realized my odd behaviors were normal.” Kim has met up with other hot young widows on a trip to Minneapolis. “Sometimes I don’t feel comfortable laughing around people who’ve not experienced this because I wonder if they think I don’t miss my husband or love him. In this group, I can make the funniest comment. I met this guy in a yoga class I was attracted to and I was able to say that. I could never say that to someone outside the group at this point. “There is this void in the shape of my husband in my life and it can never be filled but I can still love someone else potentially – although I’ve not gotten there yet.” Nora has. Last year she married Matthew Hart, a commercial interior designer. They have a 15-month old son, Quentin, and live with Ralph, now five, and Matthew’s two children, aged 11 and 16. They met a year after Aaron died. “I had assumed, oh gosh, Aaron is dead, I’m going to be sad forever. Also, that I will be unlovable because no one will compare to him and I will never not love him and who would sign up to that? I was wrong. What I had with Aaron is such a strong foundation to build from. It’s not an emotional liability. I know what a good marriage is. I know what kind of a person brings out the best in me. I assumed they’d have to be in competition but they [Aaron and Matthew] are not.” The more she hears about the experiences of the HYWC community, the more Nora has been struck by the way that friends and family react to death. “You’re in the most fucked up time in your life and people are getting messages from their friends and family with things like: ‘I didn’t hear back about brunch, which is really rude and disappointing. I know you’re going through a hard time, but …’ People have these really specific expectations from a person who’s just gone through something extremely traumatic,” she says. “Seeing those reminds me that I didn’t make this up, it’s not like just nobody gave a shit about me. Truly nobody’s friends know what they’re doing, it’s so common. I’m so glad people have a place where they can post that and not have people say: ‘Oh everybody’s doing their best.’ So how should you behave if someone close to you loses a partner? Nora admits: “I’m not perfect at it. This past week I went to the funeral of a high school friend. I saw his widow and his boys and I walked up to her and said: ‘Oh my fucking God. I’m fucking sorry because it’s so shitty, you’re throwing a good party.’ I added her to the Hot Young Widows Club because I know it’s going to be more long term than the funeral. “I try not to assume. I never knew what people were expecting of me. Were they expecting me to be hysterical? Maybe I’d had a really good day and just wanted to hang out and watch TV and eat take-out and be a person. “I think the thing we can do for each other is say: ‘I don’t know what I’m doing.’” Sound advice, and maybe one day as Nora and the hot young widows continue to challenge our preconceived notions of mourning, we’ll all become better at dealing with it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"fashion/2018/mar/10/balenciaga-celebrated-fatherhood-for-ss18-what-does-a-dad-make-of-their-clothes","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘I left my pride somewhere near the swings’ – dressing as a Balenciaga dad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/10/balenciaga-celebrated-fatherhood-for-ss18-what-does-a-dad-make-of-their-clothes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/mar/10/balenciaga-celebrated-fatherhood-for-ss18-what-does-a-dad-make-of-their-clothes","fields":{"headline":"‘I left my pride somewhere near the swings’ – dressing as a Balenciaga dad","bodyText":"Flawless. Avant garde. Cutting edge. These are words that have absolutely nothing to do with my personal style. Knackered. Functional. Occasionally smart … That’s a bit more like it, I’m afraid. I don’t beat myself up about my lack of fashion nous. I work 40 hours a week as a management consultant, I’m dad to four young girls and I run an Instagram account, Father of Daughters, where 763k people follow my honest struggles as a man surrounded by women. I also have a forthcoming book, written between 10pm and 2.30am over the past nine months. I will forgive myself if, during this period of sleepless nights and frantic days, fashion has not been a priority. Recently, however, the Guardian called to ask for my thoughts on a trend that has, indeed, piqued my interest: it’s called Dad-core and it was all over the Paris catwalks. Balenciaga, which is the most influential fashion brand on the planet right now, so I’m told, called its show a portrait of “young dads in the park with their kids at the weekend”. It was about corporate workers “out of the office, relaxed and often observed at their happiest”. Male models walked down the catwalk with their own children and it was all very photogenic: pre-teens skulked along holding their dads’ hands; curly-haired toddlers were balanced on hips. I’m assured that this was more than canny publicity for Balenciaga’s kidswear collection – though it was that, as well. It was, according to the brand’s creative director, Demna Gvasalia, a warm celebration of fatherhood, and it didn’t stop there: The brand’s S/S18 ad campaign replicated the kind of professional family photographs families would have had taken in the early 90s, complete with marbled backdrop. It is this soft-focus aesthetic that you see replicated here by me and my four kids, Anya, Marnie, Ottie and Delilah. As for the clothes? Dads, in Gvasalia’s imagination, wear outdoor hiking gear, oversized tailoring, worn-out denim and bright polo shirts – outfits inspired by the men the designer sees in off-licences, supermarkets and dry cleaners where he lives in Zurich and Paris. To my untrained fashion eye, they looked very much like middle-aged men from 1991. Funnily enough, that could describe my own father, with my childhood conveniently coinciding with the same decade Balenciaga is mining for inspiration. When I picture my dad, I see a man in his mid-30s to late 40s who wore a stiff suit to the office during the week. He relaxed at the weekend in a pair of boot-cut jeans, a shirt I’d seen him in a thousand times, some sturdy shoes that were purchased for functionality over aesthetics (likely on sale) and a jacket that pre-dated my existence. Most of my mates’ dads wore the same. Back then, fathers were often the ones who took the holiday photos, drove the family taxi, toiled away in the office, but were relatively invisible on the home front. Now, things are different. In the world of celebrity and politics, among men such as David Beckham and Barack Obama, being a great, hands-on dad is as aspirational as having it large was in the 90s. Online, men such as me, who document fatherhood, are fast becoming as popular as the more established “mum bloggers”. These changes run hand-in-hand with new legislation allowing for flexible working hours and paternity leave, with more men working part-time or staying home to look after their kids. Most modern-day dads, if they are financially able, want to spend time with their loved ones and be more involved, not just be behind a desk all day. Certainly, there is no longer one cookie cutter “Dad” stereotype, and nor should there be. (Even if, in the world of fiction, the representation lags behind the reality – Daddy Pig, I’m talking about you.) I suppose my own wardrobe reflects this blurring of boundaries. I do like to look good – it gives me confidence – even if I’m not going to be mistaken for a fashionista any time soon. My normal attire is standard issue among most thirtysomething men; the universal dressed-down work uniform of basic navy chinos, a white shirt and a peacoat, while on the weekends it tends to be a slight variation – jeans, a white T-shirt and some Vans to show I’m still “down with the kids”. (On the rare occasion my wife and I manage to get an evening out, I’ll adult up and change my footwear to a suede Chelsea boot.) Basically, my clothes are nothing like Balenciaga’s, but if this is what one of the coolest designers in fashion thinks dads should wear, I think I should give it a whirl, spending a normal Saturday with my family dressed in clothes straight from the Paris catwalk. I started my road test in the place we spend most of our family time – at home. My first outfit consisted of a single-breasted blazer, a pair of lavender-tinted jeans and a striped single-cuff shirt, all of which hung off my frame like reluctant hand-me-downs. The garments themselves were comfortable and the quality was unquestionable. Yet while the oversized nature of the shirt and jacket combination meant I could easily scoop up my twins and pick up the multitude of discarded toys strewn across the floor like plastic landmines, after hearing muffled laughter from my girls (and my wife) I glanced in the mirror and couldn’t shake the image of Tom Hanks in the end scene of the film Big. I looked like a child wearing a man’s clothes. My self-confidence suddenly took a nose dive and for the rest of the morning I found myself constantly rearranging my shirt and jacket so they didn’t appear to drown me. In the afternoon, after 15 minutes trying to convince the kids to put their shoes on, we made our way out to the park to test the practicality of the clothing and gauge public reaction. With the girls running around in their long-length hoodies (also Balenciaga), I donned an electric blue printed shell hooded jacket that acted like a kite but kept the chill in the air at bay. It was at that point I noticed that men in their mid-50s walking their dogs were no longer looking where they were going, but instead had their gaze fixed squarely on me. Except for the soft cotton fluorescent T-shirt I had on, which shone like a beam across the grassy expanse, I was adorned in the same type of clothing as them, just two sizes bigger. With playtime done, and my pride left somewhere near the swings, I decided it was time to head for home. Was it my lack of expert knowledge holding me back from revelling in my own fashion moment? I know there is a theory that fashion works in cycles and if we wait long enough, our parents’ wardrobes will cease to be a collection of embarrassing historical garments and will once again be in vogue, ready for us to pilfer without their permission. I’m just not sure these are the types of items I would have made a beeline for. The clothes in this collection struck me as a homage to an outdated dad of the past (whose oversized silhouette left me feeling, well, a bit silly), not the dad of the present, and after a bit of research it turns out that I might know more about fashion than I thought. Alistair O’Neill, professor of fashion history and theory at Central Saint Martins, explains that Balenciaga’s collection “is indebted to an oversize approach to menswear first established in the mid-1980s” by Italian designers such as Gianni Versace and Giorgio Armani, and is rooted in “a style of tailoring that was cut away from the body, offering an exaggerated proportion”. This once very fashionable style, he says, is now “outmoded. Balenciaga uses its lack of fashionability as a motor for its transformation into high fashion. They are clothes that on the surface look like the kind someone’s dad bought from Clockhouse at C&amp;A in 1985, and it is their recherché quality that makes them so perverse in 2018.” In other words, the look is highly ironic. Or, as the Fashion’s stylist tells me on the shoot: “It’s really an extension of normcore, making heroes of quite ‘ugly’ things typically associated with hiking and other outdoor sports. There’s a certain level of it being an in-joke – if you know, then you know.” I nod, like I know. And perhaps that’s why this look isn’t working on me, because I am a dad, knee-deep in lunchboxes and nappies daily, whereas this is a take on the “Dad” as a slightly comedic archetype, a wilfully awkward, baggy silhouette. (In the oversized jacket, I felt as if I was wearing the jacket of a man who used to shop at “big and tall” but had discarded it after a successful gastric band operation. I’m told this has been legitimately coined “anti-fit” by the industry, but this sounds suspiciously like “alternative facts” to me.) It doesn’t go down as well in the parks of Ramsgate as I am sure it would if I were the sort of person who attended catwalk shows in Paris and Milan. Put this outfit on a teenage model, perhaps, and I’m sure the oh-so-hip irony would be plain to see. So I won’t be updating my wardrobe. I did, however, find the blue hooded jacket to be a nice piece of clothing. It would no doubt serve its purpose as outerwear while with the family on a windy spring day at a National Trust manor house and has the added bonus of acting as a visible beacon for lost kids. Is it possible I’m not cool enough to wear Dad-core? It might just be, and I can take that. My approach to Instagram, and to life, is to try to keep everything as real as possible – I wouldn’t post pics of kids scrawling on the walls or refusing to walk down the road if I was trying to look perfect – and I think that’s what I’ve learned. Yes, it’s never been more fashionable to be an Insta-dad, or a celebrity dad. But fashion still treats fatherhood with a knowing wink.

This week, following the shootings at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school, three billboards outside a Florida senator’s offices read: “Slaughtered in school”, “And still no gun control” and “How come, Marco Rubio?” This new adaptable protest meme comes, of course, from Oscar favourite Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, in which an outraged mother puts up three billboards after her daughter’s murder remains unsolved. Call it Three Billboarding, perhaps. The tendency of life to mimic art has become a staple of protests in recent years. It’s now almost impossible to tell the difference between a good riot and a particularly angry cosplay expo. Alan Moore’s V for Vendetta kickstarted the trend. The Guy Fawkes masks in the 1988 graphic novel and 2005 film began to turn up on 4chan boards and were taken up by Anonymous for an anti-Scientology event in London in 2008, then spread like wildfire, flooding the Occupy protests. They still appear at the annual Bonfire night anarcho-libertarian Million Mask March in London. More recently, protesters have borrowed from The Handmaid’s Tale – the dystopian 1985 Margaret Atwood novel about enslaved women – using the white visors and red dresses of the 2016 TV adaptation to protest against Trump’s presidency, repressive patriarchy and much more. In Thailand, in 2014, the junta warned protesters it was monitoring a new form of resistance – a three-fingered salute borrowed from The Hunger Games. In the books and films, the gesture moves from a respectful farewell to a revolutionary code – a way for the citizens to say goodbye to repressive power. Finally, the ultimate case of life imitating art is the most meaningless. Up and down the land, be the cause tuition fees or the customs union, placards bearing the phrase “Down with this sort of thing” – originating on 90s sitcom Father Ted – have found their way into real life as a kind of embarrassed trope about the awkwardness and ineffectualness of protest itself. Yes, we can.

Its May launch will be, by my count, Marvel’s seventh or eighth fresh start since 2012, coming just months after the company last rebooted its characters, in September 2017’s Marvel Legacy line, and cementing the company’s reputation as the serial monogamist of the comic book industry. Over the past couple of years Marvel has made some genuinely significant changes to its core characters: it replaced billionaire inventor Tony Stark in the Iron Man costume with a 15-year-old black girl, Riri Williams; deemed Thor unworthy to wield the hammer Mjolnir and passed the mantle to love interest Jane Foster; and in the most divisive storyline ever, “revealed” that Captain America was a secret sleeper agent for Nazi analogue, Hydra. But Fresh Start is a back-to-basics approach, restoring the original versions of Marvel’s triumvirate, as well as bringing back a dead one: the deceased Bruce Banner, who will reclaim his position as Hulk from current jolly green incumbent, Amadeus Cho. In a video, Marvel editor in chief CB Cebulski proclaimed that he’s “never seen more excitement and more enthusiasm for where Marvel comics is going this year”, adding that there hasn’t been “such an overarching line-wide change of talent” since … the Marvel NOW! revamp of so long ago (2012). A number of problems at Marvel led to this revamp. The big one is that most of the characters involved have appeared in Marvel’s movies or TV series (or are about to), including Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones and Daredevil. Yes, perhaps it makes sense for Marvel comics to mirror what’s going on in the multiplexes if it wants to migrate movie buffs to the printed territories. But new readers who are introduced to the characters by the movies should have their eyes opened to the possibilities of what can be done in comics, which eclipse even the biggest Hollywood special effects budget. They should be offered a wider universe, not just a mirror one. Making the source material reflect the adaptations feels like putting the cart before the horse. There was also the negative reaction to last year’s Marvel Legacy reboot, which introduced the infamous Captain-America-as-Nazi storyline. Many readers were appalled by the move, which fell around the time Marvel’s vice president of sales complained that the studio’s attempts to diversifying its universe by adding more female, black, Asian and LGBT characters was not going down well with the core readership. Brian Michael Bendis, one of the company’s star writers and the creator of Iron Man’s female replacement Iron Heart and the Miles Morales African-Latino version of Spider-Man, has since left for rivals DC Comics. And two gay characters with their own titles – Iceman and America Chavez – had their books cancelled at the end of 2017, not long after an industry breakfast that Marvel hosted for comic shop owners at New York Comic Con, where some retailers lambasted the diverse additions, with one repeatedly insisting that kids didn’t want to come in to his store and buy a comic that featured “Iceman kissing dudes”. If Marvel is indeed pandering to a more conservative readership that has grumbled incessantly about the proliferation of black, LGBT and female characters in recent years, then – given the phenomenal box office success of Black Panther this last week – there’s something decidedly rotten in the state of Fresh Start. Maybe they’ll get back some of white, male Middle America that’s drifted away, but comics are and should be progressive and transgressive. Rather than winning back that demographic, Marvel’s execs should perhaps be looking at the news footage of those astonishing survivors of the Parkland school shooting in Florida, and listening to what those kids are saying about change and reform. As far as I’m concerned, Marvel, that should be your market."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/21/referees-body-manchester-city-concerns-tackles-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T15:33:21Z","webTitle":"Referees’ body to meet Manchester City over concerns about bad tackles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/21/referees-body-manchester-city-concerns-tackles-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/21/referees-body-manchester-city-concerns-tackles-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Referees’ body to meet Manchester City over concerns about bad tackles","bodyText":"Manchester City have been granted a meeting with the governing body of Premier League referees to discuss Pep Guardiola’s concern regarding tackles made against his players.

The club believed nine of these deserved a higher sanction than that handed out during the match. The tackle Kevin De Bruyne received from Crystal Palace’s Jason Puncheon in a goalless draw at Selhurst Park on New Year’s Eve and a challenge on Leroy Sané by Joe Bennett in the FA Cup fourth-round win at Cardiff City that caused the winger ankle ligament damage are thought to be among those about which the club are frustrated. Both Puncheon and Bennett were booked which incensed Guardiola and City who believed the players should have been sent off. Yet it is understood the PGMOL, which is headed by Mike Riley, will not consider introducing a rule to allow yellow cards to be increased to reds by a panel. The PGMOL is expected to outline to Guardiola and his staff what considerations referees take before issuing red cards following a challenge. These include the point of contact and whether excessive force is deemed to have been used. Guardiola’s players have joined the manager in addressing the matter. After De Bruyne was again the target of a dangerous tackle by West Bromwich Albion’s James McClean during a 3-0 win at the end of last month, he said: “I don’t know what [opponents] are thinking – you can also pull a shirt, that’s more effective than a tackle. “Sometimes it gets frustrating. A lot of teams are making a lot of fouls against us. We make a foul, we get a yellow card, I don’t know how it’s possible sometimes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/21/late-night-hosts-on-parkland-students-theres-nothing-they-cant-do","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T15:50:29Z","webTitle":"Late-night hosts on Parkland students: 'There's nothing they can't do'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/21/late-night-hosts-on-parkland-students-theres-nothing-they-cant-do","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/feb/21/late-night-hosts-on-parkland-students-theres-nothing-they-cant-do","fields":{"headline":"Late-night hosts on Parkland students: 'There's nothing they can't do'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Tuesday discussed the indictment of 13 Russian nationals by the special counsel Robert Mueller, Mitt Romney’s forthcoming Senate run and the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. Stephen Colbert “It can be a rough and depressing world, but this weekend we finally got some news that was good, and it comes to us from Wakanda,” began Stephen Colbert. “Black Panther broke all sorts of records this weekend: it had the largest solo superhero opening of all time, the largest ever box office in February and the most white people seeing a movie starring a black person who is not Will Smith.” “Meanwhile, back here in America we have our own drama,” he continued. “On Friday, Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for allegedly meddling in the 2016 presidential election, charging them with conspiracy to defraud the United States. First of all, no one saw this coming. There were no leaks. Mueller’s office does not leak. That place is tighter than Mike Pence’s sphincter.” The host went on to explain some of the Russians’ methodology, including posting divisive Facebook ads, posing as political activists, and using talking points involving immigration, religion and race. “According to the indictments, some of the Russians were also in contact with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign,” Colbert explained. “Unwitting: so that narrows it down to the entire Trump campaign.” Colbert noted that Donald Trump believed the indictment exonerates him, having tweeted: “Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know!” Impersonating Trump, Colbert joked: “Maybe they told me I had to run because they had pictures of me with prostitutes.” Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel briefly discussed Mitt Romney’s intentions to run for the Senate in Utah, and his reaction to receiving Trump’s endorsement. After the 2012 presidential candidate announced his candidacy, Trump tweeted: “Mitt Romney has announced he’s running for the Senate from the wonderful state of Utah. He will make a worthy successor to Orrin Hatch and has my full support and endorsement.” Kimmel said this was “interesting because, as you may recall, almost exactly two years ago, Mitt Romney did something that rarely is done in modern American politics,” Kimmel said. “He broke with his party and went full force after Donald Trump, who was a candidate at the time.” Kimmel went on to note that Romney once tweeted, in 2016, that he would not have accepted Trump’s endorsement had he “said 4 years ago the things he said today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, Disabled”. The host said: “But now that Trump has endorsed Romney for senator? Romney said – anyone want to guess?” “Thank you Mr. President for the support,” Kimmel said, reading Romney’s response to the endorsement. “Boy, when Mitt gets to the Senate he’s going to fit right in.” Trevor Noah Finally, Trevor Noah took aim at Republican lawmakers and Fox News hosts for their inaction in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school. “By now, we all know the tragic story of the Parkland, Florida, shooting,” Noah began. “A 19-year-old who had purchased multiple weapons walked into his high school that he was expelled from and shot and killed 17 students and teachers. “My first instinct is to talk about limiting guns, but I’m an idiot. I get it. In my dumb mind I keep thinking that gun violence is somehow related to guns,” Noah said sarcastically. “But the one thing I am sure about is that a lot of people in America think that after a shooting that is not the time to talk about guns. Noah showed Fox News coverage after the shooting. In one clip, Jeanine Pirro suggests having more police at schools and perimeter controls, while Newt Gingrich proposes arming teachers. Another pundit suggests teaching students hand-to-hand combat. “These ideas are so absurd. It might be kind of fun to live in their world. When you think about it, it’s a world free of embarrassment. No idea is too ridiculous,” Noah responded. “Hand-to-hand combat? Does this guy know what a gun is?” Noah said that, despite the suggestions of Fox News, solving problems was ultimately the job of Congress. He showed a clip of the Florida senator Marco Rubio saying last week that even if regulations were passed, shooters would find a way to get a gun. “Nothing inspires more confidence than a lawmaker who doesn’t believe in the power of laws,” Noah replied. “It’s like your pastor saying: ‘Hey man, I would pray for your cancer but who knows if this shit really works?’” Noah continued: “So another mass shooting and we’re in exactly the same place. Don’t talk about the guns and don’t bother changing the laws. It feels like nothing’s ever going to change. Except this time there was one big difference. Those meddling kids.” After showing coverage of the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, many of whom are vocally advocating for gun reform, Noah said: “These kids are inspirational. They’re doing town halls, they’re marching on Congress, all while mourning the loss of their fellow schoolmates. What they lack in experience they seem to be making up for with sharp moral clarity.” “I know some people think: they’re just kids, can they really make a difference?” Noah asked. “Think of it this way: their generation found a way to make it cool to eat Tide Pods. There’s nothing they can’t do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/22/manchester-united-official-youtube-channel-end-13-year-wait","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T14:00:37Z","webTitle":"Manchester United end 13-year wait for official YouTube channel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/22/manchester-united-official-youtube-channel-end-13-year-wait","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/22/manchester-united-official-youtube-channel-end-13-year-wait","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United end 13-year wait for official YouTube channel","bodyText":"Manchester United is to launch an official YouTube channel after a 13-year absence as it looks to build its brand and commercial income in a deal with the world’s biggest video-sharing site. Manchester United is the only Premier League team and the only one of the top clubs globally not to create an official channel since YouTube launched in 2005. The world’s biggest club has relied until now on distributing its pay-TV channel, MUTV, its own online presence and a Facebook page with 72 million followers as the main means of continuing to build, and make money out of, its global fan base. The lure, however, of YouTube’s 1.3 billion users and a slice of its $11bn (£8bn) in annual revenue has galvanised Manchester United into playing catchup with its rivals. “Amazingly, even without an official football channel it is the most viewed club in the world on YouTube,” said Tomos Grace, YouTube’s head of sport for Europe, Middle East and Africa. “But one channel that people are looking for is the official Manchester United voice. The plans they have are very exciting. They want to go big.” YouTube said that since the start of this football season views of Manchester United video content had risen 60% year on year to almost 850m. The club will have been partly spurred on by its local rival, Manchester City, crowing about being the UK’s biggest club on YouTube with 1.1 million subscribers, though its target will be to surpass the world’s most popular club, Barcelona, which has been on the site since 2006 and has 3.8 million followers. “The club’s vision is to be the largest and most engaged sports club in the world,” said a Manchester United spokeswoman. “Our presence on platforms such as YouTube will allow us to achieve this vision.” Despite YouTube’s enormous growth – revenues will more than double from $4.28bn to $10.5bn between 2015 and 2019, according to eMarketer – the deal will not primarily be about making money. For one, YouTube keeps a significant minority share – thought to be up to 45% – of all income. “The revenues are pretty small compared with income from the sale of TV rights and sponsorship,” says Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere. “It is not a brilliant platform to make massive quantities of money if you are already a big brand. It is more about brand building and hitting different demographic groups.” The name of the game in the increasingly globalised football market is reach, particularly as saturation hits in mature markets such the UK, as seen with the plateauing of Premier League TV rights while growth is coming from abroad. Clubs are also worried about losing the increasingly hard-to-reach youth market. Young people are not watching as much football via expensive pay-TV packages or buying season tickets in the numbers they once did. “YouTube will allow us to continue to evolve our demographics, as well as provide us with analytics and insights to feed not only our media and content plans but other cross-club initiatives,” said the spokeswoman. YouTube estimates that 18 to 35-year-olds account for 57% of the total time adults spend on the site. Ampere said that 70% of 18 to 24-year-old UK internet users go on YouTube in any given month, compared with 86% in the US and 90% in Brazil. The UK has the second-highest consumption of football content on YouTube of any country in the world, behind only the US. “Our YouTube channel has no impact on MUTV or our other social media platforms and they will complement each other,” said the spokeswoman. “Each have their own set of content, a large portion of which will be exclusive to each of the platforms.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/21/minnie-driver-oxfam-bosses-knew-what-was-going-on-and-did-nothing","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T17:44:55Z","webTitle":"Minnie Driver: Oxfam bosses 'knew what was going on and did nothing'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/21/minnie-driver-oxfam-bosses-knew-what-was-going-on-and-did-nothing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/21/minnie-driver-oxfam-bosses-knew-what-was-going-on-and-did-nothing","fields":{"headline":"Minnie Driver: Oxfam bosses 'knew what was going on and did nothing'","bodyText":"Actor and activist Minnie Driver has said she stood down as an ambassador for Oxfam to “send a clear message” to the charity’s bosses over sexual abuse, which “they knew was going on and did nothing” about. Driver was speaking at an event in London in which she also elaborated on her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her involvement in the #MeToo movement. Oxfam, which is embroiled in a scandal over the cover-up of its employees using sex workers in Haiti in 2010, has since lost 7,000 donors. Driver was the first celebrity ambassador to step down from her role. “I’ve been an ambassador for 20 years,” she said. “It broke my heart … because here’s the thing; there had been a lot of talk of this going on. I had heard rumours about things, I had asked questions [and] I had been assured that there was nothing going on. “The programmes that I have been involved with are to do with women who have to work as sex workers to supplement their income. They need retraining and help to not have to do that. Young girls who have been told the only thing in their life they can do is prostitution, in Cambodia; in Laos; in Thailand. It cut me to the very heart of what I’ve been involved with. “I needed to send a very clear message … to the corporate people who knew this was going on, who hush-hushed it, who were not transparent and who didn’t do anything about it. They need to clean house.” On Weinstein, Driver told how the producer attempted to block her casting in her 1997 breakout role, Good Will Hunting, because, in his words, she wasn’t “fuckable”. “I remember him taking me aside, saying ‘I am doing you a huge favour because you need to go for parts where that is not going to be a problem’,” she said. “‘You are not going to be a lead actress.’ So even at 23 or 24 I was terrified of him, that he was right. But these men banded around me: Matt [Damon], Ben [Affleck], [producer] Chris Moore, [director] Gus Van Sant said: ‘we’re making the film with this girl.’ But that stayed with me.” Driver also referred to criticisms she made of Damon last year over comments the actor made on the Weinstein scandal, in which he called for restraint in a “culture of outrage and injury”. “What was interesting about Matt Damon was not that he was an ex-boyfriend or that I had any sort of beef with him, because I don’t,” she said. “But he represented every intelligent, nice, white, male who feels it is their job to comment on the way that women metabolise stuff. And what he happened to be talking about in this instance was how women should metabolise abuse.” Driver, who works mostly in America and is currently starring in ABC’s Speechless, has just been granted US citizenship. She has an American son, and wanted to vote in primaries and become more politically active. The #MeToo movement, however, had to move away from Hollywood circles to have real impact, she said, suggesting independent bodies needed to be set up as routine. “What about the woman who is working in a motel in Kansas or its equivalent in Leicester? That’s the only way that this evolves, if it moves out of the clickbait of pretty actresses – who I am really sorry suffered because they did – and into the realm of women everywhere,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/21/celebrity-endorsed-vegan-yoghurt-recalled-for-containing-milk","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T16:01:08Z","webTitle":"Celebrity-endorsed vegan yoghurt recalled for containing milk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/21/celebrity-endorsed-vegan-yoghurt-recalled-for-containing-milk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/21/celebrity-endorsed-vegan-yoghurt-recalled-for-containing-milk","fields":{"headline":"Celebrity-endorsed vegan yoghurt recalled for containing milk","bodyText":"A vegan food brand endorsed by Nigella Lawson and other celebrities has recalled all its yoghurt products after they were found to contain milk. Co Yo, which was founded by a police officer while she was on maternity leave, has withdrawn all five flavours of its “dairy-free coconut milk yoghurt” because it contained “undeclared” milk. The government’s food watchdog, the Food Standards Agency (FSA), said consumers should take the yoghurt back to shops as it posed a health risk to people with dairy allergies. Co Yo said it was “devastated” that its yoghurt contained dairy and blamed the contamination on an external third-party supplier with which it has terminated its relationship. The brand boasts on its website of “a large celebrity fanbase including Fearne Cotton, Boy George, Nigella Lawson, who features Co Yo in her book, Simply Nigella, and prominent food blogger Ella Woodward, who has developed recipes using the products”. In a statement, the company referred to the recall as precautionary. “During recent product testing, a small amount of dairy has been found in our Co Yo yoghurts. “We are devastated by this, especially as being dairy-free sits at the heart of everything we do and we’ve always taken great care to ensure we provide our customers with high-quality, dairy-free products, made in our own dairy-free factory.” Co Yo was launched six years ago by Bethany Eaton, 38, a mother-of-two from Kent and is sold in Waitrose, Selfridges and Tesco as well as Fortnum &amp; Mason and Whole Foods Market – the UK’s largest vegan retailer. The company turned over £4.5m last year. It is still based in Kent and co-owned by Eaton and her husband Paul. The company advised its customers: “If you have any Co Yo products with a ‘use by’ date earlier than and including Friday 16th March, please contact the store you purchased from for a full refund. If you have any concerns about any of our products please don’t hesitate to contact us. Once again, we would like to apologise to all our customers for any concern this may have caused.” The company, which also makes dairy-free ice-cream, says its yoghurt “is handcrafted from the squeezed flesh of the coconut, to which we add five carefully sourced plant-fed vegan cultures producing a velvety smooth dairy-free alternative. There are no added sweeteners or preservatives, just simple, whole ingredients”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/21/who-is-dana-loesch-nra-defender-florida-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T00:22:57Z","webTitle":"Who is Dana Loesch?

The NRA's chosen defender after the Florida shooting","bodyText":"In the days after a mass shooting, the National Rifle Association usually stays completely silent, its social media accounts on lockdown. Even in less fraught times, the US’s leading pro-gun lobby group usually refuses to participate in most news coverage of the firearms debate, choosing instead to attack the media from a distance. But as students who survived the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida last week continue to speak out publicly against the NRA’s “blood money,” the gun-rights group has announced that it will send spokeswoman Dana Loesch to participate in Wednesday’s CNN town hall conversation with Parkland shooting survivors. The move comes as the NRA appears to be attempting to dial down attention to the speech that longtime leader Wayne LaPierre is scheduled to give at CPAC later this week. Instead it is putting Loesch in the spotlight. A longtime conservative talk radio host, Loesch sparked outrage last year for an NRA recruitment ad in which she railed against the left for using “their media to assassinate real news” and said NRA members needed to confront “this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth”. The ad sparked a broad backlash, with one critic calling it “a whisper shy of a call for full civil war”. “This NRA ad is an open call to violence to protect white supremacy,” Black Lives Matter activist Deray McKesson wrote in response. “If I made a video like this, I’d be in jail.” Shannon Watts, a leading gun control activist, criticized CNN’s choice to include Loesch in Wednesday’s discussion. “The Parkland students are recovering from trauma and have only been studying gun policy for a week,” she wrote on Twitter. “Is it really necessary for CNN to pit them against a vicious, dishonest and radicalized NRA lobbyist?” She added: “This is like inviting tobacco lobbyists to explain to kids who have lost loved ones to lung cancer how we can prevent smoking deaths. Lobbyists don’t deserve a seat at this table.” Once an influential mommy blogger, Loesch was already a prominent gun rights advocate when she joined the NRA in early 2017 as a special assistant to NRA executive vice-president Wayne LaPierre. The cover of her popular 2014 book, Hands Off My Gun: Defeating the Plot to Disarm America, shows her holding a rifle while wearing extremely tall heels. The book attacks arguments for gun control. “People need to learn what existing laws we have regulating an issue before proposing new, already existing laws,” Loesch tweeted on Tuesday. Since the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, many of America’s most prominent gun control activists have been women, and they have argued for gun control using the the rhetoric of motherhood and safety. The NRA, which has made steps to attract a more diverse membership, is still overwhelmingly old, white, and male, as are its most prominent leaders. As women have organized against the NRA and gun rights advocates, Loesch has been a prominent female defender of gun rights, explaining how her support for gun ownership fits into her roles as mother and citizen. Even before she joined the NRA, Loesch frequently feuded on Twitter with Watts, a former public relations executive from Indiana who founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, now part of the country’s largest gun control group. Loesch has also attacked the organizers of the Women’s March. Loesch has highlighted the abuse and insults she receives on Twitter for defending her gun rights views. Last October, she wrote that she and her family had been forced to move “due to repeated threats from gun control advocates”. “One guy hunted down my private cell phone number, called when police were here, threatened to shoot me in my front yard,” she wrote. “Another guy created a string of social media accounts, posted photos of my house, threatened to rape me to death.” She tagged the posts #MeToo. Loesch’s role at the NRA has reflected the organization’s position as right wing culture warriors, ready to fight against the left and for Donald Trump on a far broader range of issues than simple gun policy. She has made multiple attack ads criticizing the New York Times, calling the newspaper an “old gray hag” and almost setting a copy of the paper on fire on camera. The Times recently profiled her as the NRA’s “telegenic warrior.” But Loesch herself was not initially a Trump supporter, writing a post on her website in early 2016 about why she did not trust Trump’s transformation on second amendment issues, and listing a long set of concerns about his business associates and business dealings. She endorsed Ted Cruz in January 2016. In contrast, the NRA as an organization, which spent at least $30m to put Trump in the White House, was an early and loyal supporter of the president. LaPierre, the group’s executive vice president and CEO, was treated as Trump’s left-hand man after the president assumed office. At times, Loesch’s tweets have not represented the NRA’s official position – including once when she criticized newly-appointed White House spokesman Anthony Scaramucci’s past anti-gun and pro-gun control tweets. A Tea Party conservative, she built a career as an influential writer and commentator, working for Andrew Breitbart and hosting her own radio show. Her book Flyover Nation: You Can’t Run a County You’ve Never Been To, describes an America split between “Coastals” and “Flyovers”. “Coastals think they understand firearms because they watched a TV movie about Columbine,” as her book jacket puts it. “Flyovers get a deer rifle for their thirteenth birthday.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/feb/27/why-dont-kenyans-run-ultramarathons","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T11:22:01Z","webTitle":"Why don’t Kenyans run ultramarathons?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/feb/27/why-dont-kenyans-run-ultramarathons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/feb/27/why-dont-kenyans-run-ultramarathons","fields":{"headline":"Why don’t Kenyans run ultramarathons?","bodyText":"In the world of ultrarunning, one race stands out as the most competitive, the Super Bowl, the London marathon of ultrarunning: it is the Ultra-Trail Mont Blanc. Since getting involved in ultrarunning a few years ago, I have followed the race online each August. The start is stirring stuff: more than 2,000 athletes gather in the town of Chamonix in the Alps, with the sport’s crème de la crème gathered at the front. These are the supermen and superwomen who will race around the 105-mile route at mind-boggling speeds. They are among the greatest athletes on Earth. Yet, watching it, I saw a big, red flag flying that no one else seemed to mention. Everyone on the start line was white. If these were the world’s greatest distance runners, where were the Kenyans? I don’t need to explain to readers of this blog that Kenyans, along with their neighbours in Ethiopia, dominate the world of long-distance running in distances up to and including the marathon. After that, however, they don’t feature. Why? Asking people at the centre of the Kenyan running world, in the town of Iten, about ultrarunning brings mostly puzzled looks. What is this thing you speak of, they ask? Running further than a marathon? Is that possible? I told one 2hr 4min marathon runner that I had run 100km. He looked at me in disbelief and asked me how many days it had taken. I know 100km is a long way, but if you can do 42km in just over two hours ... well, do the maths, it is less than a day. But the concept was so alien that he couldn’t get his head around it. Left with this puzzle, I decided to do something potentially disastrous, but also potentially gamechanging for Kenyans and for ultrarunning: I decided to introduce them to each other. The big barrier to this is, of course, was money. In Kenya, there are no managers looking for ultrarunners, no one willing to pay for a plane ticket to a race in the hope of cashing in on a share of the winnings. This is because the winnings are small or non-existent. Money is a key motivator for many Kenyan athletes: running offers them a way to change their lives, to escape poverty and to help their families and communities. They don’t always have the luxury of doing it just for the love of it. Yet, as the sport of ultrarunning grows, so do the opportunities to earn money. A handful of top ultrarunners now have agents securing them big sponsorship deals and a few races are putting up big cash prizes in the hope of luring the top competitors. So, for those thousands of Kenyans who dedicate themselves to training and live like professional athletes, but who can never get a spot in a road race, ultrarunning could offer an outlet for them to express their talents. Not everyone in ultrarunning loves this idea. One senior person in an ultrarunning company told me he hoped Kenyans would never discover ultrarunning, for fear they would “kill it by winning all the races”. He said he believed it was a question of branding, that people don’t care when a Kenyan wins a marathon, because they are “machines made for running”. But Kenyan runners are not machines: they work hard to achieve what they do and they deserve the same opportunities as everyone else. Their stories are just as compelling if people take the time to listen. Luckily the rest of the ultrarunning community has been more welcoming, with top US runners Sage Canaday and Gary Gellin already putting some money forward to help the project. Ultrarunner Zach Miller told me he would relish the opportunity to race some top Kenyans and had invited them to train with him in Colorado. My belief is that Kenyans taking part in ultrarunning can only elevate the sport and add another layer of interest by making it even more competitive. It will be a global sport only when its doors are open to everyone. So, a wheel has been spun. Some friends in California and I are crowdfunding to cover the costs for two Kenyans to train for and race in the Lake Sonoma 50-mile ultra race in northern California in April. The race team is delighted, with race director John Medinger saying he was “thrilled to have them” at Sonoma. Convincing Kenyans to take up the challenge has not been easy, but two athletes agreed to put their marathon-running aspirations on hold for a few months to see what would happen if they took to the trails. The first is Francis Bowen, a 2hr 8min marathon runner at his best (he ran his PB in 2011). Now 43, Francis may be the fastest marathon runner ever to try a trail ultra. That is an exciting prospect. The second is Risper Kimaiyo, who has in fact run one ultramarathon, the 50km world championship in 2016 in Qatar. She won. “I just enjoy running long distance,” she says. She trained in South Africa for a while – where ultrarunning is more common – and says she used to run 70km every Saturday. That is why she decided to put herself forward for the world championships. “I went to Qatar and I came up liking it [ultrarunning],” she says. Yet, despite being the world champion, she hasn’t been able to race an ultra since. The opportunity just didn’t exist. Until now. • To help Francis and Risper train for and travel to the Lake Sonoma 50, please pledge your support here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/26/goldcar-car-hire-cancelled-booking-non-refundable","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T07:49:52Z","webTitle":"Goldcar refuses car or refund after late flight arrival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/26/goldcar-car-hire-cancelled-booking-non-refundable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/26/goldcar-car-hire-cancelled-booking-non-refundable","fields":{"headline":"Goldcar refuses car or refund after late flight arrival","bodyText":"We hired a car from Goldcar for collection at Malaga airport.

No other OECD country graduates its students at such a young age. We make worse use of graduate skills than most advanced economies: as graduate numbers have risen, so has the proportion not working in graduate jobs. The expansion of higher education for 18-year-olds has been at the expense of part-time and work-based higher education (leading to an overall decline in social mobility). The root of these problems lies in the doomed pursuit of the perfect market in higher education advocated equally by the government, Lord Adonis and Lord Browne. It is and was crazy to believe that the collective choices of 17-year-olds could ever be an adequate tool to shape higher education. While students don’t react much to market forces, universities – for whom income maximisation is the precursor to teaching and research – certainly do. High fees and market liberalisation have rewarded institutions that prioritise three-year degrees for 18-year-olds, no matter how poor value that education is. Higher education won’t change unless the incentives on universities change: even the abolition of fees will change nothing if universities still find it more profitable to target school leavers. The current system encourages universities to create £8bn of public debt a year that taxpayers will have to write off. There is no comparable public spending over which government has ceded so much control and gained such poor value for money and public benefit. Instead of fruitless attempts to “improve the market” by micromanaging fees and universities, the government needs to take back control of funding and use it to incentivise universities to provide the diverse courses that students and the economy need. That may well mean restricting open-ended provision for 18-year-olds, as Sodha suggests, but should be balanced by increased provision for older students and work-based learners. Professor John Denham Former secretary of state, Department for Universities, Innovation and Skills (2007-09) • Any review of student finance that looks only at universities is hopelessly compromised from the start. Sonia Sodha is quite right to say that we need to channel some proper cash into the non-university routes. Our proposal for a national learning entitlement, published last week by the UCL Institute of Education, does exactly that. We argue that all 18-year-olds should be given access to funding for education fee payments up to a total of £5k a year, up to a maximum of £10k. The central point of the proposal is that they could use this for studying in further education colleges as well at universities, and in recognised adult education institutions. They could study on a part-time basis and spread the entitlement over several years. If universities choose to charge higher fees then students would have to think whether they wish to borrow the difference. The result would be equity between universities and other forms of post-school provision – and so much greater equity for different social groups. It would also spur universities to provide something other than full-time three-year degrees, so we could have badly needed diversity of courses. We argue that adults who have not yet got a university degree could also benefit from the entitlement. This would be a real boost for lifelong learning. We estimate the cost at £7bn-8bn. This is far less than abolishing all tuition fees. More importantly, it would mean real parity across the post-school sector. Professor Tom Schuller UCL and University of Wolverhampton Professor Alan Tuckett University of Wolverhampton Tom Wilson University of Wolverhampton • The only higher education fight that Theresa May has picked is with the policies that her own and the coalition government have pursued since 2010. These policies and the spurious application of market principles have ensured that the costs of higher and further education (regarded as an investment in many European countries) have been transferred to students and graduates not only in universities but also in colleges. In the latter, students who are aged 19 or over now have to take our loans to study for level 3 courses such as A-levels and BTecs if they cannot afford to pay the costs upfront. These “advanced learner” loans accrue the same compound interest and are repayable on the same terms as higher education loans but are rarely mentioned by ministers. That the prime minister herself should now claim that university is “too expensive” is puzzling given that this is the direct result of the fees and funding policies for which she has previously voted. Equally disappointing is the rhetoric which implies that would-be students should study higher “vocational” qualifications at colleges rather than “academic” degrees. One of the great successes of the UK’s modern universities has been their willingness to develop new courses to respond to emerging industries, technologies and needs in both the private and public sectors. As a result, high-quality courses and qualifications combining academic and vocational knowledge and skills are now offered throughout the university sector – a fact that seems to have escaped No 10. A year-long review hidebound by market ideology and funding constraints has only a slim chance of delivering the radical reform required to ensure that access to further and higher education is available to all who can benefit whatever their age, background or family circumstances. We can only hope that out-of-date prejudices that seek to divvy up people, qualifications, institutions and courses on the basis of “vocational” or “academic” or limited and limiting views of future earnings potential of students are given short shrift early in the review panel’s deliberations. Pam Tatlow London • In answering questions after her Derby speech, Theresa May justified an emphasis on student fees in financing higher education, saying, “You’ve got two groups of people: those who go to university and benefit from going to university, and those who do not.” In reality, of course, there are other important groups too. One is those who go to university but do not benefit from it, at least not financially in proportion to the huge debts so many have run up. Another is those who may not have gone to university themselves but benefit from the knowledge and skills of others who have. All of us, whether we have gone to university or not, benefit directly or indirectly from the higher education of doctors and teachers. Many businessmen and businesswomen, irrespective of their own education, benefit from the university training of their employees. The traditional argument for financing higher education through progressive taxation, allowing the heaviest burdens to fall on the broadest shoulders, remains as strong as ever. Donald Mackinnon Newport, Gwent • Cheap jewellery is generally regarded as being less good than expensive, and we don’t want the same to apply to university degrees, which is why they all have to charge the same amount for any particular course. Any review should concentrate on matching students to types of education from which they can benefit most, and then ensuring that whoever teaches them has the appropriate resources, rather than concentrating on the “50% of children should go to university” target. Dr Richard Turner Beverley, East Yorkshire • It costs up to £100,000 to qualify at the bar. This and the below-minimum-wage fees that the junior bar receives will leave the future of our profession in the hands of the elite and privileged few who can afford it. The more diverse the representative, the more representative becomes the justice. The government is failing in this area of social mobility. Equality, fairness and the rule of law demand that this situation is reversed as soon as possible.

The strategy involves consultation between the Ministry of Defence, industry and with the UK’s international partners. It follows completion of a similar strategy for shipbuilding that was completed in September. The announcement was partly aimed at trying to prop up the British aerospace industry. BAE Systems said in October that it was to cut 2,000 jobs over lack of orders for its Eurofighter Typhoon. Williamson, who made the announcement during a meeting of the Commons defence committee, said: “The combat air strategy will bring together the best of British engineering, skill and design.” The chief of the air staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, said: “This strategy will ensure that the RAF can continue to remain at the forefront of the high-end airpower technology and innovation we need to deal with future threats, working in close collaboration with UK industry and our international partners.” No date was set for completion of a new air strategy, in part because of uncertainty over Brexit. Other European countries are considering joint procurement programmes in response to moves towards a European defence force, which the UK has said it wants no part of. Even if there was a speedy completion of the air combat strategy, the gap between the current generation of jets and the introduction of the next generation will still remain too big to bridge. Although BAE’s Typhoon is expected to remain in UK service until at least 2040, developing new aircraft normally takes decades. The MoD is at present phasing in the troubled and well over-budget F-35 fighter, bought from the US, to be deployed on the UK’s two new aircraft carriers. The announcement was welcomed by industry. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of ADS, a trade organisation for companies in the defence sector, said: “The strategic threats faced by the UK and its international partners and allies require long-term thinking and close collaboration between industry and government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/feb/22/energy-company-promises-to-pay-customer-to-use-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T07:01:29Z","webTitle":"Energy company promises to pay customers to use electricity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/22/energy-company-promises-to-pay-customer-to-use-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/feb/22/energy-company-promises-to-pay-customer-to-use-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Energy company promises to pay customers to use electricity","bodyText":"A small energy company has launched a new tariff that will potentially pay customers to use its electricity when demand is low. Octopus Energy’s new Agile tariff tracks wholesale electricity prices, allowing customers to take advantage if there is an excess of supply and the electricity price “goes negative”. Across Britain, whenever more electricity is generated than consumed, wholesale prices fall – sometimes to below zero – at which point suppliers are paid to take energy off the grid. This typically happens on windy, sunny weekend days when wind turbines and solar panels are producing lots of power and demand is relatively low. When this happens customers on the deal will be alerted by text, email or their mobile phone app. They can then start their washing machines or charge their electric car. When demand exceeds supply and the wholesale price rises, users will be charged the higher price. The company has capped the maximum amount customers can be charged at 35p/kWh – about three times its standard electricity price. Greg Jackson, founder and chief executive of Octopus Energy, said: “This tariff is groundbreaking. By reflecting the real cost of energy on the grid every half-hour, customers can capitalise on times when prices are especially low. Indeed, if the wholesale price goes below 0p/kWh, Octopus Agile will actually pay you to take the unwanted energy from the grid. As renewable energy production grows, these events are only going to become more frequent.” The company said most customers will benefit as the wholesale cost is below the standard price 80% of the time. It only expects prices to be at the maximum for 0.1% of the time. If the electricity infrastructure suffers significant long-term failure such a power station falling out of action, customers can switch out of the Agile tariff without penalty, it said. To sign up, customers must have a smart meter and agree to moveable pricing. Gas is charged in the conventional way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/05/sam-rockwell-wins-best-supporting-actor-for-three-billboards-at-oscars-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T01:18:07Z","webTitle":"Sam Rockwell wins best supporting actor for Three Billboards at Oscars 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/sam-rockwell-wins-best-supporting-actor-for-three-billboards-at-oscars-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/05/sam-rockwell-wins-best-supporting-actor-for-three-billboards-at-oscars-2018","fields":{"headline":"Sam Rockwell wins best supporting actor for Three Billboards at Oscars 2018","bodyText":"Sam Rockwell has won the Oscar for best supporting actor at the 90th Academy Awards, prevailing over stiff competition from Willem Dafoe of The Florida Project and Richard Jenkins of The Shape of Water to win his first Academy award. The 49-year-old, whose turn as a disgraced police officer in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, has earned him a string of prizes throughout this awards season, had never been nominated for an Oscar before. Rockwell dedicated his award to the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, and told a funny story about how his father got him out of school to go to the movies. “When I was 8 years old, I was sent to the principal’s office and my father was saying, ‘We have to go. It’s Grandma,’” Rockwell said. “I said, ‘What’s wrong with Grandma?’ He said, ‘Nothing, we’re going to the movies.’” Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, the black comedy takes place in the titular midwestern town and features Rockwell as a racist cop who goes toe-to-toe with a grieving mother (Frances McDormand) after local law enforcement fail to prosecute her daughter’s murderer. Rockwell’s role, in particular his character’s redemptive arc, has ruffled feathers with audiences and critics. The victory completes Rockwell’s steady march toward the winner’s circle after the actor triumphed at the Golden Globes, Baftas and Screen Actors Guild awards. Rockwell saw off competition from co-star Woody Harrelson, as well as Christopher Plummer (for All the Money in the World), Jenkins and Dafoe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/05/allison-janney-wins-best-supporting-actress-for-i-tonya-at-oscars-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T02:29:26Z","webTitle":"Allison Janney wins best supporting actress for I, Tonya at Oscars 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/allison-janney-wins-best-supporting-actress-for-i-tonya-at-oscars-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/05/allison-janney-wins-best-supporting-actress-for-i-tonya-at-oscars-2018","fields":{"headline":"Allison Janney wins best supporting actress for I, Tonya at Oscars 2018","bodyText":"Allison Janney has won the Oscar for best supporting actress at the 90th annual Academy Awards for her brash turn as LaVona Golden in I, Tonya.

McNeill, the pilot, and Moore, the brakewoman, had to go cap in hand to the public when their funding was cut off in September but needed only six days to reach their target of £30,000 to cover the team’s running costs, a sum that ultimately swelled beyond £40,000 and paid off handsomely when they outstripped Britain’s previous best ninth-place finish by Nicola Minichiello and Jackie Davies at the Turin Games in 2006. “We’re buzzing about that result,” said McNeill, the 24-year-old from Consett, County Durham. “We deserved to come here. We knew we could absolutely kill it.” The two Micas came in 1.62sec behind Germany, whose sliding sport resurgence continued as Mariama Jamanka and Lisa Buckwitz surged to gold, pipping the United States’ Elana Meyers Taylor, who settled for silver for a second successive Olympics, this time with brakewoman Lauren Gibbs. Canada’s Kaillie Humphries, the two‑times defending gold medallist, took bronze alongside Phylicia George. Jamanka, the 27-year-old who took up the sport five years ago but has yet to win a World Cup race, finished with a four-run combined time of 3min, 22.45 sec, only seven-hundredths of a second faster than Meyers Taylor. Her first senior-level win could not have come at a more opportune time, marking Germany’s fifth gold in eight sliding events in Pyeongchang with three in luge and one in men’s bobsleigh, already eclipsing the country’s entire Sochi haul of four. But on an unseasonably warm night during which Nigeria won hearts in becoming the first African nation in one of the Winter Olympics’ charter sports, the crowd-pleasing British tandem managed to rate among the biggest sentimental favourites. “Our brains are just frazzled, we are just so happy,” said Moore, a former Commonweath Games sprinter from Cardiff. “We can’t believe we are here to start with and then to come eighth and make history with the best British finish is incredible.” McNeill and Moore started the evening in sixth position, just 0.46sec behind the German pace-setters. A rickety finish to their third run on Wednesday night proved costly in their podium push, but only left them hungrier for more in the years to come. “My limited experience on this track showed a little bit,” McNeill said. “I’ve had less runs than anyone here. I put two great runs down in the first two heats and we were up there in the medal mix. But I had a mistake on the third run, I was just letting it run in turn eight and we caught the roof and it made trouble for a couple of corners.” After coming tantalisingly close to a fairytale podium, McNeill is already looking ahead to the next Winter Games and is bullish on the team’s chances. “We want to go to Beijing 2022 and absolutely smash it and be among the medals,” she said. “We’ve got four years to work on things, get faster on the start and improve my driving skills. I definitely think we’re capable of a medal in four years time.” Moore added: “Four years is such a long time in sport. We can improve on so much. We are only tiny and we can make ourselves stronger and faster. We are so determined to improve. We are very determined girls, don’t put anything past us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/16/lets-move-to-spalding-lincolnshire","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T16:30:09Z","webTitle":"Let’s move to Spalding, Lincolnshire: there’s that slightly bleak Fenland feel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/16/lets-move-to-spalding-lincolnshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/16/lets-move-to-spalding-lincolnshire","fields":{"headline":"Let’s move to Spalding, Lincolnshire: there’s that slightly bleak Fenland feel","bodyText":"What’s going for it?

But vaccinating children should be compulsory","bodyText":"When Roald Dahl’s daughter Olivia was seven, she fell ill. He thought she was on the way to recovery and often read to her. “I was sitting on her bed, showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn’t do anything,” he said. An hour later, she was unconscious. Twelve hours later, she was dead. Olivia died of a disease that we can now prevent, but which some choose not to: measles. Measles cases are soaring in Europe again; last year, there were more than 21,000 cases and 35 deaths, up from 5,273 cases the year before, a massive increase. The eminently achievable aim has always been to eradicate measles completely because the vaccine is so effective, but take-up of measles immunisation is dropping in many countries. There are a number of factors involved, but doctors are worried about the influence of anti-vax campaigns – not only when it comes to the MMR vaccine, which immunises against mumps, measles and rubella, but also for newer vaccines against meningitis, and the HPV vaccine, which is given to girls at 12 or 13, and which prevents the spread of the virus linked to 99.7% of cervical cancers. The MMR vaccine, still described by some as “controversial”, is at the root of this turn against immunisation. Andrew Wakefield’s utterly discredited findings about the “link” between the MMR vaccine and autism continue to be regurgitated. During the general election in 2017, a weird leaflet was pushed through my letterbox banging on about vaccination. I read the small print and it was all connected to David Icke, clearly an expert epidemiologist. Of course. Anti-vax discourse unites a whole set of conspiracy theories about big pharma, big government and so-called nature with a kind of selfishness that says: “I won’t let my precious child be vaccinated but will in fact rely on the herd immunity of others.” It is also underscored by huge amounts of pain from the parents of children with autism, who feel utterly unsupported. It is hard to stand in judgment of someone whose child’s development appears to have been interrupted – and which they believe to be linked to the MMR vaccine. Nor am I completely insusceptible to worries about vaccination. Indeed, I felt totally compromised at the height of the MMR “controversy”. My eldest two had had all their jabs, but my youngest contracted meningococcal septicaemia. The other baby in the room died of the same disease while we were there. My child had every major organ on support. At night, researchers would come and ask to stick more needles in her because they were working on developing the meningitis B vaccine that saves lives today. I would say yes through my tears. She survived, but my GP recommended separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella, not the MMR, as she was so weak. This, you see, was at the peak of the Wakefield scandal. Tony Blair would not say whether or not his youngest has been given the MMR. He was protecting his privacy, but I think his reticence had disastrous consequences for public health. Information campaigns can push up immunisation rates: in Ireland, uptake of the HPV vaccine was very low but a campaign helped address this. But reproducing the evidence about the efficacy of vaccines over and over again is never enough: the debate has to also be emotionally intelligent. I feel that we must prevent disease where we can, and that vaccination should be compulsory or we will slip backwards. Why are we not choosing to prevent deaths from cervical cancer? Partly, again, because of this fear of vaccines, and partly because parents don’t want to imagine their teenage daughters as sexually active. Would they rather imagine them dead? Part of the conversation around parental choice is symptomatic of a wider disease in our society: atomisation. The anti-vax lobby, in their purity, care about their own individual children, not our children in the plural, and not the children of the most marginalised groups, who are the most likely to get ill. If you can’t trust evidence, what do you trust? Socialised medicine means believing in society, and the idea that we can all infect each other for good or for ill. All of us need to protect our children. The anti-vaxers have Donald Trump on their side. What will it take for them to see sense? If you trust that man with your baby’s health, then you will really need more than God and arnica to help you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/21/mount-brexit-threatens-to-blow-as-may-calls-cabinet-to-chequers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T17:21:10Z","webTitle":"Mount Brexit threatens to blow as May calls cabinet to Chequers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/21/mount-brexit-threatens-to-blow-as-may-calls-cabinet-to-chequers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/21/mount-brexit-threatens-to-blow-as-may-calls-cabinet-to-chequers","fields":{"headline":"Mount Brexit threatens to blow as May calls cabinet to Chequers","bodyText":"Tectonic plates are grinding ominously underneath a 16th-century manor house in Buckinghamshire. As Theresa May locks her cabinet away at Chequers on Thursday to agree an escape plan, the sharp uptick in seismic activity suggests Mount Brexit may be about to blow. Every day brings a new tremor. First it was David Davis warning of “Mad Max dystopia” if colleagues light a bonfire of EU red tape. Then the proponents of this scorched earth approach fired back a “ransom note” of new demands. Now the optimistically-named Department for Exiting the EU has appeared to suggest it would rather remain in indefinite purgatory than commit to an end date for transition out of the bloc (for now). With steam venting from every crack, the temptation is to focus on the reaction of the Brexiters for signs of terminal meltdown. It is true that almost everything promised by leavers during the referendum has evaporated in recent days – no escape from EU rules, little or no say over new ones, no end date in sight for what Jacob Rees-Mogg has called “vassal state” status during transition. For all the huffing and puffing, however, there is little else that Rees-Mogg and fellow members of the European Research Group can do but stand by the prime minister’s side during this tumultuous time. Although 62 backbenchers signed the letter calling on her to stick to the principles of Brexit, their bigger worry is that it won’t happen at all if they don’t give May some room for manoeuvre. A closer reading of their demands reveals only the desire to preserve her “ability to change laws and rules once we leave” - a formulation not that far removed from the “managed divergence” the prime minister is planning to try to sell to an even more sceptical audience in Brussels. Controlled outgassing at Chequers may not be enough to reduce pressure from elsewhere in the fractured Conservative party. Tory remainers led by Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry will attempt to force a further softening of the government’s already viscous Brexit strategy in two weeks’ time by calling for Britain to stay in a customs union with the EU. The second of their two amendments to the upcoming trade bill threatens to explode spectacularly if they can garner enough support. The ingredients are there. As fellow “mutineer” Dominic Grieve established before Christmas, there are enough sceptical Tories in parliament to sabotage any Brexit legislation if they join forces with opposition MPs. Until Labour’s own Brexit away-day this week, it was unclear whether its leadership would bow to pressure for a clear position on Britain remaining in a customs union. Now Jeremy Corbyn has spelled it out: Britain will “have to have a customs union” after Brexit, he said on Tuesday. The implications of this have yet to sink while all attention has been on the ERG letter and transition. Remaining in a customs union may make sense from the perspective of preserving the economy or peace in Northern Ireland, but it would rule out the swashbuckling global future promised by Brexiters who want to strike new trade deals independently of Brussels. No role for Liam Fox or his department for international trade. Yet more ammunition for Rees-Mogg’s claim that post-Brexit Britain will have less, not more, influence over its destiny. The sense of betrayal could dwarf the row over whether voters were right to expect £350m a week for the NHS. All of this before where we find out whether Brussels is prepared to go along with May’s attempt to defuse the situation. Every indication suggests her compromise proposal for managed regulatory divergence is dead on arrival as far as Michel Barnier and EU leaders are concerned. Having your cake and putting some aside to eat later is still a long-term logical impossibility in their eyes. Almost as hard to swallow as realising that Brexit may not mean Brexit after all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/02/elizabeth-strout-war-peace-books-that-made-me","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"Elizabeth Strout: ‘My guilty pleasure?

It’s an astonishing piece of work: so Peter Carey, and yet completely on its own, about a couple in the 1950’s who are doing the Redex Trial – a race around the Australian continent – with their navigator. The places the book goes – well, it’s just wonderful; it feels necessary. The book that changed my life Honestly, all the good books I have read have somehow changed my life. A good book creates a sense of opening – of the soul, of one’s life, of other people’s lives. The book I wished I’d written The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love by Oscar Hijuelos. The cultural history of Cuban Americans is something I would have had no knowledge about, but boy, did I admire that book! The book that had the greatest influence on my writing The Collected Stories of William Trevor. I credit him with a great deal of my ability to find my way around a sentence. What a writer he was; he could flip over a sentence so gently, and show the underbelly in a heartbeat. His work is always quietly compassionate. Also the work of Alice Munro has influenced me. Munro and Trevor have been like two bookends in my writing life. The book that changed my mind The Return by Hisham Matar opened my mind. It brought me into unfamiliar territory, and made it familiar; the sense of loss was something I understood right away, and I was so grateful to have read it. The last book that made me cry Local Souls by Allan Gurganus. The first novella in this collection of three novellas, called “Fear Not,” had me tearing up almost immediately, and I could not understand why at first. By the end of it, I was weeping openly. The last book that made me laugh I recently reread The Brothers Karamazov, by Dostoevsky, and I had forgotten – or maybe I didn’t get it the first time around – how funny he is, how funny the book is in places, the observations thrown out. I laughed out loud a number of times reading it. The book I couldn’t finish I can’t remember. But I am not a person who feels obligated to read a book to the last page if it is not doing something for me. The book I’m most ashamed not to have read Moby-Dick. I am so embarrassed that I never read that book; I feel as if I should start it right now. The book I most often give as a gift I give out Trevor’s Collected Stories like a preacher with his Bible. And people are always glad to have it, I have noticed that. My earliest reading memory Pigeon Feathers and Other Stories by John Updike. I must have been about six or seven. Obviously I couldn’t understand much of what was going on, but I did understand this: that to be a child did not pay. Adult life was where the real stuff was happening. My guilty pleasure Seriously? It’s War and Peace. The first time I read it, I was on vacation with my in-laws and sitting by the pool one of them said: “Liz, that’s so pretentious, can’t you cover that up?” I almost died. So now I read it furtively in the privacy of my home. • Anything Is Possible is published by Penguin. To order a copy for £7.64 (RRP £8.99) go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

I have had mixed responses to Diaz’s films recently: I admired the grandeur and mystery of his “Russian adaptations”, that is, his The Woman Who Left (2016), a version of Tolstoy’s story God Sees the Truth, But Waits; and Norte, The End of History (2013), a loose reworking of Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment. Sometimes however, the sheer opacity and impenetrability of his film-making, and of course his natural tendency to let his features run to epic length – and beyond – has been forbidding. In some ways, his work is the cinematic equivalent of open-ended plainsong. The comparison is not entirely arbitrary. Because the extraordinary thing about Season of the Devil is that it is a bizarre sort of musical. The majority of it is sung through. But there is no chance of an original soundtrack album of Season of the Devil going to iTunes. Because the singing in it is of a bleakly subdued sort. It is all unaccompanied and the melodies are a kind of moaning lullaby-lament, the same for the Marcos militia gangsters as for their oppressed civilian victims. The identical musical style is disconcerting, but conveys the sense that everyone is labouring under the same grim harmonies of evil and despair. This musical conceit put me in mind of Joshua Oppenheimer’s documentary about Indonesia, The Act of Killing (2012). Season of the Devil is shot in a deep-focus monochrome, in a series of scenes each shot from a fixed camera position. This makes for some superbly composed images, particularly the exterior daylight locations. But Diaz has an exasperating habit of shooting indoors in the semi-darkness with a single light source directed straight into the camera. In many ways, Season of the Devil isn’t an easy watch. The story concerns Hugo (Piolo Pascual), a well-known dissident poet and author whose wife Lorena (Shaina Magdayao) is a doctor; she journeys out on her own to set up a charity clinic in a remote village where Marcos’s ugly goons have already begun their crackdown in response to a growing disorder linked to political murders. The husband and son of a woman called Kwago (Pinky Amador) have been abducted and killed and she is an almost choric figure of keening desolation. The sinister gangsters of tyranny swagger about, and Marcos himself is represented by a very disturbing figure who has Marcos’s face stitched to the back of his head: a nightmare image, like something Dr Hannibal Lecter might have dreamed up. Inevitably, the shock-troops of oppression turn their attention to Lorena, and it is Hugo’s grim destiny to travel to this village himself to discover what has become of her. Part of the Marcos regime’s approach is to spread bizarre lies and rumours among the rural population: that there is evil and Satanism abroad, and that malign spirits and wicked beasts – obscurely connected with left-wing anarchy – are killing people (when in fact of course it is the Marcos partisans who are carrying out the slayings) and their brutal martial law is needed to suppress the forces of darkness. The widow Kwago is derisively nicknamed the “Owl”, one of the animalistic/communistic figures that they are justified in getting tough with. Ironically, this poisonous campaign of mystification has a kind of truth. There are indeed evil forces aboard, poisoning the well of society in the Philippines: the Marcos secret police. And Diaz’s film is a gloomy, subdued opera of pain about this season of evil. Season of the Devil is the work of a real auteur: every millisecond of his film has been rigorously created. There are moments of dreamlike intensity and the despair of the period is genuinely conveyed. Only the strongest devotee of Diaz could however deny the presence of longueurs in this film, and I periodically feel that his austerity and length is sometimes unrewarding. Well, Season of the Devil is a film that has stayed with me, from the deadpan poetry-reading scenes at the beginning to the bone-scraping anguish of Hugo’s horror at the very end. Season of the Devil has a tragic weight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/21/spying-row-how-corbyn-seized-chance-to-take-on-the-sun","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T19:26:32Z","webTitle":"Spying row: how Corbyn seized chance to take on the Sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/21/spying-row-how-corbyn-seized-chance-to-take-on-the-sun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/21/spying-row-how-corbyn-seized-chance-to-take-on-the-sun","fields":{"headline":"Spying row: how Corbyn seized chance to take on the Sun","bodyText":"Labour felt it had little choice but to respond with increasing aggression this week to “hallucinogenic” stories about Jeremy Corbyn and cold war records kept about him by the Czech security service. That decision saw the party leader go on the offensive, accusing rightwing papers of being controlled by billionaire tax exiles, with the party repeating that it planned to hold a media ownership review if it got into power, and sending a lawyer’s letter to a Tory MP over an ill-judged tweet. The Conservatives, meanwhile, have sought to stoke the row in an attempt to get it picked up by broadcasters – while at the same time trying to pretend they are above the fray by arguing, none too subtly, that it is the party that supports the press and the existing structure of independent regulation. The turning point came in Derby on Monday, when Theresa May was asked what she thought about allegations that Corbyn may have unwittingly met Ján Sarkocy, a Czechoslovakian spy posing as a diplomat in the late 1980s, which had run first on the front page of the Sun last Thursday. The prime minister’s remarks, in response to a question from the Sun, that “where there are allegations of this sort, MPs should be prepared to be open and transparent” arguably gave the BBC and other broadcasters some cover to begin delving into the claims, even though they had only added up to Corbyn admitting one meeting with a Czechoslovakian diplomat, whose name he had not recorded, in November 1986. Labour had attempted to be robust from the off, describing any attempt to claim that Corbyn was “an agent, asset or informer” as “entirely false and a ridiculous smear”. But other rightwing titles were repeating the claims as they took interest in the story and with Tory MPs including the prime minister piling in, the row was threatening to engulf what little story there was and it was felt necessary to contain the story if it was going to be picked up by broadcast media. Once, such an approach would have been considered high risk. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown wooed the press, long maintaining personal relationships with Rupert Murdoch and Paul Dacre respectively, while in No 10. But personal attacks on Corbyn motivate the party’s supporters, particularly younger voters, who don’t read the Sun, Mail or Telegraph, and who don’t necessarily remember the cold war. Ed Miliband broke with the Murdoch press in 2011 following the phone-hacking scandal, promising to break up the Sun and Times empire if he was elected. A controversial attack on his Marxist father Ralph, described by the Daily Mail as “the man who hates Britain” led to a furious row with Dacre’s newspaper in 2013. But if both moves were popular at the time, he nevertheless was badly beaten in the 2015 election. What helped Corbyn enormously was the behaviour of Sarkocy. A paper in his native Slovakia caught up with him, where Sarkocy improbably claimed that Corbyn told him “what Mrs Thatcher would have for breakfast, lunch and dinner” and that Czechoslovakia was responsible for funding Live Aid. So on Monday night, Labour began by targeting Ben Bradley, a young Conservative MP, threatening to sue him for having tweeted that the Labour leader had “sold British secrets” to Communist spies. Bradley deleted the tweet within minutes of the threat, but lawyers for Corbyn on Wednesday demanded an apology and a payment to charity in an attempt to draw “a red line” against similar social media postings in the future. The Daily Mail asked Corbyn at an EEF manufacturing employers’ conference on Tuesday about the claims, allowing the Labour leader to accuse the newspaper of “reproducing some nonsense that was written in the Sun” to cheers and applause. An increasingly confident Labour prepared a social media video on Tuesday in which Corbyn went on the attack, arguing the reporting “shows just how worried the media bosses are by the prospect of a Labour government” – although the Mail accused him of issuing “a chilling threat to Britain’s free press”. Remarkably, as the story was running into the sand, Theresa May shoehorned a reference to the episode at prime minister’s questions, underlining Tory eagerness to keep the subject in the air, joking apropos of nothing that Corbyn loved “blank cheques”, before adding: “Now I know he likes Czechs, but really.” Immediately after that, the Mail asked a No 10 spokesman about what May thought about the media. The spokesman read out a pre-prepared section of a speech she gave earlier this month, in which she had said: “A free press is one of the foundations on which our democracy is built,” in an attempt to claim a moral high ground. Labour, meanwhile, sought to press home the advantage, with a confident briefing of its own, arguing that the Sun and Sarkocy’s allegations were false. Corbyn’s spokesman said these had taken on “ever more absurd, even hallucinogenic forms,” repeating that the party wanted to carry out the second part of the Leveson inquiry into press regulation and insisting that its media review would aim to boost diversity in British media, without specifying any details as to how. In doing so, it risked entrenching an already adversarial relationship with the rightwing press – but the Labour calculus is that, except possibly with older voters, in the social media era that does not matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/22/immigration-macron-liberalism-migrants-refugees","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T09:25:25Z","webTitle":"This immigration law has exposed the brutal limits of Macron’s liberalism | Gabriel Bristow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/immigration-macron-liberalism-migrants-refugees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/immigration-macron-liberalism-migrants-refugees","fields":{"headline":"This migrant crackdown has exposed the brutal limits of Macron’s liberalism","bodyText":"On Wednesday the French minister of the interior, Gérard Collomb, presented the details of a heavily trailed new law on immigration to Emmanuel Macron’s cabinet. Given the long buildup to this announcement – with the government adopting a resolutely “firm” posture on immigration – the details outlined will come as little surprise. But they can teach us about the brutal limits of liberalism that Macron’s politics embody so immaculately. The new law plays on an old trope: it is framed in terms that entrench the division between “asylum seekers” and “economic migrants”. This division, so flippantly cited by the political class and yet so difficult to distinguish in law, will be reinforced by a tightening of the right to asylum. And yet, ultimately, the changes announced will be worse for all migrants. The law is also intended to bring France into line with its European partners – greater European integration being one of Macron’s leitmotifs. In his announcement to the press, Collomb made no attempt to dress this up as anything other than what it is: a race to the bottom. “It is totally necessary – regarding countries like Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, or Sweden – that we have the same types of procedures. Because if you don’t have the same types of procedures, clearly, one looks at where it is easiest to gain asylum, and then everyone goes to that country.” One would be hard pressed to paint a more discouraging portrait of the politics of the European Union. The key measures outlined in the new law are as follows. First, the government is proposing to speed up asylum procedures. The amount of time people have to apply for asylum will be reduced from 120 days to 90. Those whose cases are rejected will see the time they have to appeal against the decision cut in half, from 30 days to 15. This has a particularly Macronesque touch: it is intended to show that the government is accelerating the process for “deserving” asylum seekers while cracking down on the rest – in other words, it hopes to add a gloss of just efficiency to an otherwise punitive set of measures. In reality, this change will probably make things harder for asylum seekers by reducing the amount of time they have to pull together a coherent case. Second, the maximum length of time spent in a detention centre will be doubled, from 45 to 90 days. This measure is cruel in its sheer futility: it is proved to have no bearing on the government’s stated aim – itself reprehensible – of deporting more people (the idea being that it will give the authorities more time to reach an agreement with the detainee’s home country). As pointed out by France’s foremost migrant charity, La Cimade, the previous increase from 30 to 45 days in 2011 saw a decrease in the number deportations. Furthermore, France deports substantially more people than the UK or Germany, despite the fact that people can be detained for as long as 18 months in those two countries. Tripling the length of detention is purely performative, to demonstrate the state’s stringency, and the only real effect will be to increase suffering. Finally, the new law includes a range of measures to dissuade migrants from entering France and make it easier for them to be deported when they do so. Border patrols will be given new powers to carry out checks in migrant and homeless shelters. Police will be given longer to summarily deport people before being obliged to bring them before a judge. The length of time that suspected illegal immigrants can be detained in police stations will be increased from 16 hours to 24 hours. And prison sentences will be introduced for certain cases – one year for entering the country without using a recognised border crossing and five years for using fake identification papers. These measures have been widely criticised by policy experts as well as those working on the ground to help new arrivals. Migrants, supported by students, have occupied university buildings in Nantes, Grenoble, Lyon and Paris in defiance of the government’s hard line. Lawyers and administrative staff of the national asylum court are on strike for the eighth day running. But the criticism has not stopped there. The unity of Macron’s own party, En Marche, has been shaken, with several deputies expressing concerns in the lead-up to the announcements on 21 February. In the press, Macron is being presented as tougher on immigration than Sarkozy – which on paper, if not in rhetoric, is incontestable. Why, then, is Macron pursuing such a policy? The simple answer lies in opinion polls, which suggest that French voters want more border controls. But such explanations miss the bigger picture. Up until now, the political direction of Macron’s presidency has paid little attention to polling or public opinion: just look at the way he rammed through unpopular reforms to French labour law via a series of top-down ordinances. This policy is neither an electoral calculation nor an unfortunate pragmatic necessity – it must stem from Macron’s own convictions. Liberalism has a long history of drawing sharp lines between those who get to enjoy the fruits of freedom and equality and those who do not. This can be observed in France’s history. At certain rare moments, the idea of France – inherited from the French revolution of 1789 – as self-declared universal beacon of human rights, entailed stretching the concept of the nation to breaking point. In his magisterial account of the Haitian slave revolution of 1791, The Black Jacobins, CLR James describes how liberty and equality, the watchwords of the French revolution, crossed borders indiscriminately, spreading like wildfire through Haiti and beyond. It was the forefathers of modern-day liberalism that consistently sought to rein in this revolutionary process by attempting to exclude certain categories of people – “mulattoes”, slaves – from the freshly declared Rights of Man. Macron’s new immigration law places him in this tradition of exclusionary French liberalism. It represents a shrinking from the universal role that France has so long imagined for itself – and that Macron seemed so keen to rekindle (with a sprinkling of Silicon Valley jargon for good measure). His recent assertion – “France is back” – rings hollow. One cannot lead the world into a new liberal era while punishing migrants and refugees in one’s own backyard. In doing so, Macron has exposed the meagre confines of his humanism, and shown how liberalism, in drawing a sharp line at the border, falls short on the most basic questions of solidarity. • Gabriel Bristow is an activist and writer, currently based in Paris • This article was amended to correct the description of the maximum length of time spent in a detention centre"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/28/felix-culpa-jeremy-gavron-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T11:59:12Z","webTitle":"Felix Culpa by Jeremy Gavron review – a story made up of ‘sourced lines’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/28/felix-culpa-jeremy-gavron-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/28/felix-culpa-jeremy-gavron-review","fields":{"headline":"Felix Culpa by Jeremy Gavron review – a story made up of ‘sourced lines’","bodyText":"Collage works best when it works all at once, which is why it meets with most success in the visual arts and music, where, for instance, DJ tracks built out of a swarming multitude of samples are organised around the through line of a beat. In writing, poetry is where collage recurs most frequently, at least partly because poems are short and generally not dependent on the elaboration of plot in order to succeed. In a longer piece of prose it is less effective. That’s because the fundamental building block of prose narrative is not language: it’s time. So any piece of narrative prose that wants to work as a collage must do something more than just skilfully edit together a bunch of quoted words. It must do something with, and to, time: squeeze it, dilate it, punch holes in it, twist it into weird striations. Felix Culpa is a collage novel in that the bulk of its text is made up of lines lifted from other novels. An appendix lists the 100 works by 80 or so writers that Jeremy Gavron has used as his raw materials, though the text is not purely collage: only 14 of the 33 chapters are made up of “entirely sourced lines”. In other words, 19 contain some original interventions. While this may have been impossible to avoid, it can’t help but take the gloss off Gavron’s attempted feat. It’s as though the French novelist Georges Perec, author of the seminal Oulipian novel La Disparition/A Void, a book that famously does not contain a single E, instead wrote a book containing some Es. The plot of Felix Culpa is framed as a mystery: when the novel opens, Felix, a young thief who was sent to prison after accidentally killing an old woman, has died in mysterious circumstances a short while after his release. A writer in residence at the prison begins to investigate Felix’s death, encountering a young woman he was in a relationship with and finally the shepherd for whom he once worked. Felix culpa is also the Latin term for the Christian concept of the “fortunate fall”, the bad action leading to an ultimately good outcome, the archetypal example being humankind’s expulsion from Eden that presaged the coming of Christ. The plot is Christian-contoured, with Felix depicted as a criminal and killer but also as an unworldly innocent, ripe for transcendental redemption whatever his earthly transgressions. The book progresses in very short chapters, the well-spaced lines singly descending the page, as though it is in fact a poem: Still going into the prison, reading the men’s writings, listening to their talk. Fascinating facts and tales from the poky. Pale wall of dreams. Standing in a cell one evening while its occupant brews tea in the wing kitchen. Hung with old calendars and magazine pictures. High narrow slit of a window. Looked out on a bare courtyard lit by electric lamps. Full of the melancholy which seeps into the bones in prison at night. This method does produce interesting, if mild, effects, with just enough variation in the sourced registers to impart a sense of a “voice” that is unsettlingly off, negotiating a liminal world brimming with negative space. But as the story proceeds more or less in sequence, the effect of the collage, as a purely linguistic device, begins to wane. The voice works best early on, when the plot is at its most notional, but by its final phase, lacking the ability to return to the kind of established plot points that drive traditional narrative conclusions, the energy dissipates. The novel is as short as a book of poems, with a word count not far into five figures, and it might have worked better as a series of (not necessarily related) collage poems. A closer inspection of the appendix raises another slight disappointment: the source texts are a very respectable but tame collection of largely 20th-century literary classics written overwhelmingly by men. The few genre books in there are safely canonical selections – JG Ballard, Raymond Chandler. I did wonder if the novel was an elaborately dry satire of the essential sameness of the conventional male “literary” voice, but I don’t think so: in a book that is around 70% description of physical landscape, Gavron makes things very easy on himself by using no fewer than five Cormac McCarthy novels as sources. And if the point of collage is the bringing together of not just disparate, but actively incongruous and even dissonant material to generate new perspectives and tonalities, then Felix Culpa fails to distinguish itself in this way, too. Although Gavron edits his sourced lines skilfully enough, he is not doing anything transformative with the repurposed material. In the end he is making a tastefully “literary” novel out of a bunch of other tasteful literary novels. Imagine if he pulled off a novel in a “high” literary style using only lines lifted from the works of, say, Jeffrey Archer and Dan Brown.

About 100 students from the Parkland school travelled 450 miles to the state capital of Tallahassee to spend the morning meeting with Republican and Democratic party legislators. “Some heard us loud and clear, others did not,” Spencer Blum, a Stoneman Douglas junior, said of the meetings, which took place exactly one week after a 19-year-old expelled former student killed 14 students and three adult staff members with a legally purchased semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifle. The students, however, found themselves under attack from several rightwing commentators. The CNN commentator Jack Kingston said he believed their sorrow was being “hijacked by leftwing groups who have an agenda” while the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly questioned in a tweet if the students were “in an emotional state and facing extreme peer pressure in some cases”. Also in Tallahassee on Wednesday, a sizeable anti-gun rally was taking place on the steps of the city’s capitol building, organised by a coalition of activist groups and supported by students from local schools, who were excused from lessons to attend. By early afternoon, between 4,000 and 5,000 protestors thronged the capitol’s plaza to listen to survivors and other speakers, from groups including the Florida coalition to prevent gun violence. University students from Florida A&amp;M and Florida State universities who had marched from their campuses joined the crowd. Many carried banners, some reading “Am I next?” and “Enough is enough”. Elsewhere in Florida, students at dozens of high schools walked out of classes and staged campus demonstrations in support of the Stoneman Douglas #NeverAgain campaign. Although welcoming to the students, however, Florida’s Republican-controlled legislature appeared reluctant to act in the wake of the shooting. On Tuesday, House representatives voted to reject a debate on a proposed statewide assault weapons ban. Brandon Abzug, a Stoneman Douglas senior who met with several of the politicians, was not surprised. “This won’t happen overnight,” he said. “We know this is a long struggle and we have to do everything we can to influence policy to fix this. If nothing happens we have midterm elections in November, the 2020 presidential election and beyond. “We will use the power of voting, especially for us young voters who will be able to vote in the next election.” Many who made the eight-hour journey to Tallahassee had come straight from their friends’ funerals to board the buses. Barely an hour before, they had said their final goodbyes to classmates Carmen Schentrup, 16, and three 14-year-olds, Cara Loughran, Gina Montalto and Peter Wang. Some huddled in small groups as they awaited departure, comforting each other through their tears and clutching pillows. Others were angry and defiant, shouting their demands for gun reform as they boarded. But their message was simple: end school shootings. “This is how we’re coping, this is how we’re grieving, this is what is holding us together,” Sofie Whitney, a Stoneman Douglas senior, told the Guardian, explaining how their attempts to channel unfathomable grief into a focused campaign had been an exhaustive emotional whirlwind. “The only way to get through is by making the change. There’s a hundred kids from a school that got shot up less than a week ago coming specifically to them, so if those legislators aren’t receptive that’s pretty embarrassing for them.” Whitney, one of the founders of the #NeverAgain movement, which on Sunday announced a nationwide March for our Lives on 24 March, said the students were simply seeking “common sense” solutions to gun control. “We don’t need a full bill to be written overnight but we need some action, we need them to begin helping us make the change,” she said. Meanwhile, the #NeverAgain campaign received the backing of several celebrities including the actor George Clooney and his wife Amal, who pledged $500,000 to support next month’s march. Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg both announced they would match the Clooneys’ donation. Those heading for Tallahassee said they could feel the groundswell of support behind them. “It feels empowering, knowing that our movement is so strong and that celebrities are backing us up,” said an 11th grader named Lorenzo Prado, who lost one of his best friends and the school’s swim team captain, Nicholas Dworet, 17. “It’s not just people who were affected. Hollywood, New York’s talking about it. It shows how big our movement is and how impactful it can be.” During the event in Tallahassee, Rick Scott, the Florida governor, was in south Florida for the funeral of one of the Parkland victims and did not meet the students. He also turned down an invitation to attend a nationally televised gun safety debate in Sunrise, a neighbouring city to Parkland, on Wednesday night. “My goal is to come up with something that’s going to move the needle and make parents feel more comfortable that their kids are going to go to a safe school,” he told reporters, without announcing specifics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/22/corbyn-press-foreign-owners-spy-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"Corbyn is right to warn the press – but wrong to single out  foreign owners | Roy Greenslade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/corbyn-press-foreign-owners-spy-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/22/corbyn-press-foreign-owners-spy-claims","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn is right to warn the press – but wrong to single out foreign owners","bodyText":"The spying accusations by several newspapers against Jeremy Corbyn are laughable. They amount to a smear reminiscent of the false claims made by the Sunday Times in 1995 that Michael Foot was a KGB agent. Playing the red card has long been a tactic employed by editors of the section of the press that is antipathetic to Labour. Rightly, Corbyn has dismissed the pages of nudge-nudge wink-wink in the Daily Mail, the Sun, Daily Express and Daily Telegraph as “ridiculous”, arguing that the detailing of such fantasies “shows just how worried the media bosses are by the prospect of a Labour government”. Those bosses are surely even more worried by Corbyn’s riposte that “change is coming”, a thinly veiled hint that, should he get into No 10, his administration might well set in train a second Leveson inquiry and activate section 40 of the Crimes and Court Act. That is the law that would force media outlets that do not sign up to an officially approved regulator to pay the costs for both sides in libel or privacy claims. If that prospect is not terrifying enough for the proprietors and editors of Britain’s papers, Corbyn’s questioning of the existence of press freedom was more significant. The press is not free, he said, because “it’s controlled by billionaire tax exiles”. Few media academics would disagree with him. They routinely quote the aphorism by the New Yorker journalist AJ Liebling: “Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one.” But the billionaires who regard themselves as the sole exponents of press freedom want people to believe otherwise. Turning reality on its head, they cast those who question their own expropriated “right” to be the guardians of press freedom as enemies of democracy. Arguably, Corbyn’s statement amounts to the most explicit attack by a senior politician in modern times on the philosophical underpinning of press ownership. In so doing, he joins forces with the increasing number of online critics who take issue with mainstream editorial output. He also recognises that this storm has blown up at a tipping point in press history by observing that the general election result, in which he was vilified continuously by pro-Tory papers, resulted in Labour increasing its vote by the greatest proportion since 1945. Therefore, it suggests that the media barons “are losing their influence” and “their bad old habits are becoming less and less relevant”. If so, you might well ask, why bother to go toe to toe with them. Would it not be better to turn the other cheek? Let them do their worst, let them rant, let them smear. The voters appear unmoved by the pro-proprietorial propaganda (aka fake news). That sounds like a good idea in theory. But the reality is that the rest of the media, including the main news broadcasters, felt it necessary to follow the lead of the red-baiting newspaper quartet. It was undeniable that the Mail and its fellow travellers had set the agenda, and to have said nothing in such circumstances might well have lent credence to the accusations. It is also obvious that, despite falling circulations and the general election outcome, these papers do retain a measure of influence. Corbyn has not created the kind of instant rebuttal unit that was a hallmark of Tony Blair’s leadership, but he cannot afford to let lies fester. What he must avoid, however, is making too much of the foreign status of newspaper owners. Home-grown billionaires are no different in their exercise of press power, nor do they intervene any less in the editorial affairs of their titles than those who choose to live outside the country. The central charge here is not about tax, because almost every wealthy individual and every large corporation seeks to minimise what is given to the chancellor. Instead, in the specific matter of press ownership, the greatest hypocrisy is the one Corbyn has boldly dared to challenge: the proprietors’ exclusive right to speak on behalf of the people. That is the myth they perpetuate, as they have done for the best part of two centuries. That’s why Corbyn’s three-word warning could, and should, become a pro-free press promise and slogan: change is coming. • Roy Greenslade is professor of journalism at City University, and was editor of the Daily Mirror in 1990-91"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/22/casual-dining-crunch-jamies-italian-strada-byron-struggling","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"The casual dining crunch: why are Jamie’s Italian, Strada, Byron (and the rest) all struggling?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/22/casual-dining-crunch-jamies-italian-strada-byron-struggling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/22/casual-dining-crunch-jamies-italian-strada-byron-struggling","fields":{"headline":"The casual dining crunch: why are Jamie’s Italian, Strada, Byron (and the rest) all struggling?","bodyText":"In the summer of 2015, restaurant owner David Fox was made an offer he couldn’t refuse. One that today – with financially troubled chains such as Byron and Jamie’s Italian desperately restructuring and closing sites in order to stay afloat – seems to encapsulate the great UK casual dining bubble that has finally, spectacularly, burst. Fox then had branches of his east Asian restaurant brand, Tampopo, in two huge shopping centres: Oracle in Reading and Cabot Circus in Bristol. He was facing a painful rent increase in Reading but, remarkably, the owners of the centres offered him £1.3m to vacate both sites – such was the clamour, presumably, among the biggest restaurant players to snap up any empty space at top-of-the-market prices. “In Reading, the rent was £75,000 and they wanted to put it up to £130,000. I was being offered £650,000 to hand over the keys. It was quite unemotional. When someone offers you 10 years’ money, it’s time to move on,” says Fox, who still runs five restaurants in Manchester and London. “It was symptomatic of how giddy the market was and, for most normal brands, it’s kind of unsustainable.” For Fox, the current turmoil is entirely predictable. Unless every element works perfectly, it is almost impossible to make a return on restaurant sites that might cost £1.5m to open. “I don’t want to sound smug, but we saw it coming,” he says. “There was a lemming-like mentality.” Tampopo’s Bristol site first became a Chimichanga, a reported £600,000 development. It is now a Real Greek. The Reading site is a TGI Fridays. For a time, between 2010 and 2016, it seemed as if Britain’s burgeoning interest in casual, affordable dining was insatiable. Build that restaurant, no matter how outrageous the property and fit-out costs, and they will come. Tills will ring, card machines will whirr. But in recent months, with the so-called “casual dining crunch” biting hard, that optimism has turned to bleak talk of the industry facing a perfect storm. As well as the problems at Jamie’s and Byron (the former is closing 12 branches and is £71.5m in debt; the latter is in the midst of a financial rescue plan), the Italian chain Strada recently shut a third of its restaurants and its rival Prezzo is now looking at restructuring. Numerous venues, from the five-strong Square Pie group in London to, again, Jamie Oliver’s Piccadilly barbecue restaurant, Barbecoa, have gone into administration. “What we didn’t see coming was Brexit and its implications on exchange rates, recruitment and consumer confidence,” says Fox. Stefan Chomka, the editor of Restaurant magazine, says: “There are several things in play that, when they come together, is like a house of cards collapsing. First, there’s the oversaturation. Byron expanded rapidly, Pizza Express kept adding, [as did] Nando’s and Zizzi. There has been huge growth in the casual dining market and there are just too many restaurants. Simultaneously, food costs, staff costs, rents and business rates have all gone up. If you’re operating 100 sites, your margins are being squeezed and squeezed. And times are tough. Even if they spend a little more when they do, people are eating out less. So there are greater costs, more competition, fewer people and, consequently, the shit is hitting the fan.” Had the restaurant industry been expanding cautiously and financing itself from existing turnover, this situation would be tough. Instead, in recent years it has fuelled its expansion by gorging on cheap debt. It has grown fat and complacent and is now suffering the stomach cramps of falling sales. Quite how the restaurant world became so bloated is a moot point. Many blame a sudden gush of private equity money into food when it seemed it would be the leisure economy of the future. Private equity backers, explains Chomka, want to expand rapidly, then sell up while a brand is still buoyant, usually in a three-to-five-year cycle. This, coupled with the availability of cheap bank debt and a new willingness among retail landlords to fill failing former shop units with restaurants, set the scene for unprecedented growth and ridiculous splurging as operators tried to financially outmuscle one another for sites: “The benchmark for how much people are prepared to pay for sites in rents and premiums has risen and risen.” A 2016 YouGov poll commissioned by the shopping centre management company Intu rated eating out as Britain’s favourite leisure activity. In 2017, the government’s Insolvency Service reported a 20% rise in restaurant failures. In the meantime, whole streets, areas of towns and new leisure developments became overrun with too many samey mid-market chains. “It’s idiocy by the landlords,” says Will Beckett, the co-founder of the upmarket Hawksmoor steak restaurants. What Beckett will not accept, however, is that private equity is the bogeyman here (the private equity firm Graphite Capital took a minority stake in Hawksmoor in 2013). “The whole ‘private equity is evil’ thing doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny. There is good and bad private equity, as there are good and bad independents. There is a danger in restaurant companies growing too fast, compromising on quality and weakening the brand. But [private equity investors] know all that. I have a private equity board. We talk about that stuff all the time. If we have to compromise to grow, we tend not to. They understand that.” For Simon Potts, the MD of the private equity-backed Alchemist cocktail bar and restaurant group – which, bucking the trend, will open four sites this year to add to its existing 13 – the issue is not investment, but rigorous planning. “You’ve got to be realistic,” he says. “We won’t have 150 locations, probably 70 maximum. If you tell [investors] you’re going to do 40 sites, however, it’s not unreasonable for them to expect 40. That’s where the pressure comes from.” A pressure that can easily lead to large chains, no matter how they are funded, eroding the food quality or service that once made them stand out. When the market is sluggish and a restaurant chain’s headline sales growth slows down, that chain will attempt to protect its profitability by cutting costs, from ingredients to staffing levels. It can quickly become a spiral of decline as quality falls and customers walk. That sense that large chains are constantly cynically whittling away at their costs fuels huge resentment among foodies. For instance, who would have thought that Jamie’s Italian – a brand supposedly popularising rustic, artisanal Mediterranean cooking – would share a meat supplier, the now-collapsed Russell Hume, with budget pub chain Wetherspoons? Chef Gary Usher owns four bistros in the north-west of England, including his flagship Sticky Walnut in Chester, which pride themselves on “proper” cooking. He scoffs at the large chains blaming external factors – which are punishing for independents, too – for their woes. Yes, last year’s business rates reassessment hit hard (according to analysis by Colliers International, the Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group’s rates went up 28%, or £1.6m), but there could be a far simpler reason why they are struggling. “Strada being in trouble doesn’t surprise me one bit: it’s fucking awful,” he says. “Why do they deserve to stay open? Strada, Côte – I despise Côte – Carluccio’s, Jamie’s, they should be fucking closing. I ate in the Liverpool Jamie’s two months ago and it was possibly the worst meal I’ve ever had. It was appalling. I ordered what was supposed to be sausage ragout. It looked like boiled tomatoes with overcooked pasta, and it tasted the same.” For Potts, the rot often sets in far earlier. Rapidly expanding chains simply “forget the principles that made them fantastic”. Byron failed to replicate its early neighbourhood feel; its remote branches lacked personality. Jamie’s Italian failed to replace Oliver’s star quality as he morphed from a TV chef into a health campaigner. “Now, perhaps, people are more excited about eating at Gino D’Acampo’s,” says Potts. The ITV chef has just announced he will open at least five more restaurants by 2019. To an extent, this is simply fashion. “Brands go through a natural life cycle,” concedes Chomka. He hopes that Byron will act as a cautionary warning of “how quickly a brand can go from being the second coming to closing up to 20 sites”. Will the chains keep coming? Perhaps at a slower rate, but yes. The market is too big, too lucrative, and while distinctive brands such as Nando’s and Wagamama thrive, even in these testing circumstances, restaurateurs will dream of a national presence. Russell Norman is best known for his Polpo restaurants, the Exeter and Bristol branches of which closed last month. “Not because of market conditions, we got it wrong,” he clarifies by email, while expressing his dismay at those who, as he sees it, are revelling in the misfortune of failing operators. Norman may criticise individual chains privately, but anyone willing to do battle in the parlous world of restaurants and wafer-thin profit margins has his respect. Norman recently announced a deal with TRG Concessions (part of the huge Restaurant Group that owns Frankie &amp; Benny’s) to roll out his New York-inspired bar, Spuntino, into UK airports – a curveball move for this once impeccably cool Soho hangout. “It’s a unique opportunity to reach a much larger audience without capital expenditure,” he says. “Our investment is intellectual, culinary and artistic. It’s very exciting.” But is this not the whole problem: credible brands getting into bed with large, profit-hungry organisations? Polpo’s slow expansion has been achieved using “very modest self-generated funds”. What is wrong with that holistic approach? “You cannot blame people for wanting success, nor equate a desire for business growth with greed,” says Norman. “Good restaurateurs could stick with their first success, but ambition isn’t always bad, is it? It carries risks. It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t take them. “The question reminds me of Bowie releasing Let’s Dance. Everyone screamed ‘sellout!’ and thought Bowie was being coerced by his label. They wanted its cool, edgy, esoteric predecessors Lodger and Scary Monsters. But Bowie wanted commercial success and a wider audience, so he hired Nile Rodgers and Let’s Dance was a smash hit.” For some restaurateurs, going big will always be its own justification. Wish Russell Norman luck. In the current climate, he will need it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/23/sports-quiz-week-league-cup-winter-olympics-football","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T11:11:58Z","webTitle":"Sports quiz of the week: League Cup final, Winter Olympics and a great mind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/23/sports-quiz-week-league-cup-winter-olympics-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/23/sports-quiz-week-league-cup-winter-olympics-football","fields":{"headline":"Sports quiz of the week: League Cup final, Winter Olympics and a great mind","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/weekend/376","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T00:00:07Z","webTitle":"Weekend crossword No 376","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/weekend/376","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/weekend/376","fields":{"headline":"Weekend crossword No 376","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/23/why-i-tonya-is-a-game-changer-in-the-world-of-female-sports-movies","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T06:00:40Z","webTitle":"Why I, Tonya is a gamechanger in the world of female sports movies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/23/why-i-tonya-is-a-game-changer-in-the-world-of-female-sports-movies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/23/why-i-tonya-is-a-game-changer-in-the-world-of-female-sports-movies","fields":{"headline":"Why I, Tonya is a gamechanger in the world of female sports movies","bodyText":"If Tonya Harding had been no more than the first female ice skater to land two triple axels in competition, most of us would have forgotten her by now. But in 1994, an associate of her ex-husband attempted to break the leg of her rival, Nancy Kerrigan. In the subsequent media frenzy, Kerrigan was cast as America’s sweetheart, with Harding as a soap opera villain. The incident turned “Trashy Tonya” into a cult figure, subject of TV movies, pop songs, plays and musicals, and now a movie. I, Tonya takes its stylistic cue from Martin Scorsese, presenting her story as freewheeling mockumentary stuffed with larger-than-life characters, obscene dialogue and unreliable narrators. It is played for scabrous black comedy, but is a not unsympathetic character study of an outsider from an abusive background striving to make it in a discipline that expects its skaters to conform to public expectations of sweetness and femininity. One thing I, Tonya is not about is a woman invading masculine turf. In movies, as in life, athletic prowess has long been a boys’ club. Games involving hitting, throwing, violent body contact or sweat-inducing effort have always been viewed as unfeminine. A woman’s role in these macho narratives is to be banished to the sidelines as a Wag, providing eye candy between boxing rounds, or as a cheerleader, egging on the male players. And so most female-centric sports movies revolve around the struggle against misogyny. In Heart Like a Wheel (1983), Bonnie Bedelia overcomes male resistance to make it as a drag racer. In Bend It Like Beckham (2002), a west-London teenager overcomes the opposition of her Punjabi family to make it as a footballer. In Girlfight (2000), Michelle Rodriguez is told: “No girl has what it takes to be a boxer.” For women, making it in a male sport is invariably the story. The very title of Penny Marshall’s A League of Their Own (1992) is the verbal equivalent of a paternal pat on the head. Inspired by the formation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which was set up while male players were fighting in the second world war, the film is a critique of patronising attitudes while simultaneously trivialising its female players’ efforts almost as much as the male characters, with coach Tom Hanks complaining: “I haven’t got ballplayers. I’ve got girls. Girls are what you sleep with after the game, not what you coach during the game.” Sometimes, the male world is so exclusive that the sportswoman has to disguise herself as a man to compete, hence we have Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet (1944), chopping off her hair to win the Grand National. Or Amanda Bynes in She’s the Man (2006), a high-school variation on Twelfth Night, in which she stuffs her long hair under a pudding-bowl wig so she can enrol at a boys’ school to carry on playing football. Occasionally, movie sportswomen do break the mould. Outliers include Robert Aldrich’s final film, The California Dolls (1981), which follows the fortunes of a female tag-wrestling team (Vicki Frederick and Laurene Landon) and their manager (Peter Falk) as they travel through the midwest towards a grudge match in Reno. It’s a road movie as much as a precursor to the Netflix series GLOW, but the climactic bout is a corker. Fresher territory is also mined in Personal Best (1982), in which Mariel Hemingway trains to qualify for the 1980 US Olympic track and field team. It’s perhaps best summed up by Ross in Friends: “Two women … stretching … they take a steam bath together, things get a little playful …” In fact, the lesbian relationship between Hemingway and fellow pentathlete Patrice Donnelly gives way to more conventional heterosexual entanglements, but not since Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia had there been so much athletic nakedness on display. In cinema, as in life, sports seen as traditionally feminine are as much about presentation as performance. Gymnastics hasn’t made much of a mark in the cinema but Stick It (2006) features a rebellious heroine who sneers at the girly gymnastic routines and fights for the right to show her bra straps without having points docked by stuffy judges. And let us not overlook Drew Barrymore’s directing debut, Whip It! (2009), in which Ellen Page rejects small-town beauty pageants in favour of a women’s roller derby team. The “feminine” sport par excellence, of course, is ice-skating. Norwegian spinmeister Sonja Henie, who greeted Hitler with a Nazi salute at the 1936 Olympics, became the first skating superstar (think Ginger Rogers on ice) and one of Hollywood’s top box office draws. More recently, ice-skating movies have formed something of a niche subgenre: romance, rivalry and sparkly costumes. In Ice Castles (1978), the heroine gets too big for her skates, loses her sight in an accident, but hides her blindness to win the championship! In The Cutting Edge (1992), a spoilt little-rich-girl skater teams up with a blue-collar ice-hockey player and they fall in love at the Winter Olympics! In Ice Princess (2005), a science geek takes to the ice for a physics project, falls for a hunky Zamboni driver and ends up torn between Harvard and figure skating! But I, Tonya breaks new ice. Like last year’s Battle of the Sexes, based around Billie Jean King’s 1973 show match against Bobby Riggs, the female protagonist doesn’t have to waste her energy trying to play in a man’s world – she’s already a player, and her world is as female as they come. Like the best sports movies, the sport isn’t the story; it’s part of the character, and both films have bigger thematic fish to fry. I, Tonya is on general release now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/24/an-island-parish-after-the-hurricane-review-anguilla","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T06:30:07Z","webTitle":"An Island Parish: After the Hurricane review – battered Anguilla keeps the faith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/24/an-island-parish-after-the-hurricane-review-anguilla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/24/an-island-parish-after-the-hurricane-review-anguilla","fields":{"headline":"An Island Parish: After the Hurricane review – battered Anguilla keeps the faith","bodyText":"An Island Parish (BBC2) went to Anguilla a while back, and found a relaxed, close community with a lot of churches. Now it returns to the island in the wake of Irma, the category 5 hurricane that blew the place to bits last September. The programme’s usual gentle-stroll-round-a-parish format takes on a little extra poignancy. Some of the churches are broken, many houses were destroyed, the infrastructure is in tatters, some parishioners don’t have water, most people don’t have electricity. And tourists – the island’s main source of income – aren’t coming, because they can’t get there, or the hotel they were going to stay in doesn’t exist any more. Simone and Neville’s business, a restaurant and leisure complex on an outlying islet, simply disappeared. Buildings, trees, everything is gone – stolen by Irma. But Simone is remarkably philosophical and sanguine about it: “Hurricane Irma, she gave us a clean slate,” she says, in her lovely Anguillan lilt. “It’s time to do something fresh … when Mother Nature speaks we’re going to obey, we’re going to rebuild.” Tim the British governor (I know, still!) only arrived just ahead of Irma. Now he’s rushing around the place helping to put things back together, at the same time as trying to get some cash out of the British government for rebuilding. Do we want to see where the foreign secretary stayed when he came over, Tim says? No! Don’t spoil it … too late, this is the bed in which Boris Johnson slept when he blew in briefly after Irma. Now I’m trying not to imagine him in his jimjams, or maybe no jimjams, in the Caribbean … Thanks Tim. It wasn’t just the human population that suffered and lost homes. Irma destroyed most of the island’s turtle nests as well. Not this little one’s though, a rare hawksbill hatchling – even rarer now – scuttling down what used to be the beach to the ocean. Maybe when it comes back in 20 years or so, to start a family of its own, Anguilla will be back to normal. People called it an act of God. Not true, says Father Hodge of the Anglican church. “We need to remember that God does not cause evil,” he says. Yeah Irma, you can huff and puff all you like, but you can’t blow away the faith."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/22/white-powder-letter-prince-harry-meghan-markle-anthrax-scare","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T17:26:27Z","webTitle":"White powder letter sent to Meghan Markle treated as racist hate crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/22/white-powder-letter-prince-harry-meghan-markle-anthrax-scare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/22/white-powder-letter-prince-harry-meghan-markle-anthrax-scare","fields":{"headline":"White powder letter sent to Meghan Markle treated as racist hate crime","bodyText":"Police say they are treating as a racist hate crime a letter containing white powder sent to Meghan Markle, which sparked an anthrax scare. The letter was received this month at St James’s Palace in central London. The powder inside was found to be harmless after being examined by experts. It is understood the package contained a racist note and was received on 12 February. In a statement, Scotland Yard said: “Officers are also investigating an allegation of malicious communications, which relates to the same package, and it is being treated as a racist hate crime.” The force added: “The matter is being investigated by officers from the Met’s counter-terrorism command.” Markle is from a mixed-race background. She is due to marry Prince Harry in May. The letter was received at the palace shortly before a package containing white powder also prompted a scare at the Palace of Westminster. The Evening Standard newspaper said the royal couple had been informed of the suspicious package. The police inquiry is trying to determine if the same person or people were responsible for the sending of the letter to Markle and the parcel to the Houses of Parliament. Anthrax can be weaponised in powder form and is potentially deadly. But there have been a number of scares where harmless white powder has been sent to prominent people. Scotland Yard said in a statement: “Police are investigating after a package containing a substance was delivered to St James’s Palace on Monday 12 February. “The substance was tested and confirmed as non-suspicious.

You might presume a lawyer or a coach – but how about a philosopher? Busy executives in Silicon Valley and beyond are enlisting the services of “practical philosophers” to help them work through difficult decisions. “This is a generation of pioneering philosophers, if you like, entrepreneurial philosophers,” says Prof Lou Marinoff, who has been advocating philosophy with businesses since 2000, and has worked with organisations such as the World Economic Forum in Geneva and Davos and the Comisión Federal de Electricidad in Mexico. He doesn’t offer solutions; he asks questions that help the client gain fresh perspectives and insight. There’s a focus on critical thinking and examining values to explore what’s right and fair. “These are very intelligent people, who are also overworked, more so than most of us. And they don’t have enough time to reflect. A lot of what we do is to create reflective space,” says Marinoff, professor of philosophy at the City College of New York and author of Plato, Not Prozac! Applying Eternal Wisdom to Everyday Problems. Marinoff is also president of the American Philosophical Practitioners Association, which has trained 400 philosophers to practise this kind of service. In the UK, Joe Garner, chief executive of building society Nationwide, formerly of BT Openreach and HSBC, has worked over a number of years with Prof Roger Steare, philosopher in residence at Cass Business School and author of the book Ethicability. When Garner spoke to the New City Agenda group in Westminster last October about decision-making, he insisted that values – the mutual’s social conscience – must be part of the process. “It’s about logic, it’s about the law, but it’s also about love.” Steare has also consulted for large multinationals, including BP following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. One can quite see why big corporates – whose failings have wreaked devastation – might want to interrogate their principles. But what use, in truth, is a philosopher – whose focus is on ethics – to a businessperson or entrepreneur, whose overriding purpose is to make a profit? “There’s an assumption there that profits and philosophy are incompatible,” says Steare. “The tension is not between philosophy and profit, but between deep wisdom and short-term profit maximisation, instead of long-term sustainable value creation.” In sectors such as technology, where businesses can grow at breakneck speed, it’s perhaps a way of holding leaders to account: are their founding principles holding fast, or being subsumed by a race towards profit at any cost? A philosopher can “direct a business toward innovation that combines a good purpose and a real business opportunity”, says Christian Vögtlin, associate professor in corporate social responsibility at Audencia Business School in France. “Philosophical thinking can also guide technology [entrepreneurs] to define boundaries; this can range from questions about privacy rights to teaching virtual intelligence systems about humanistic values,” he adds. Marinoff works with senior leadership teams and managers, as well as CEOs. This might take the form of creating a mission statement, implementing a code of ethics in an organisation or working on corporate responsibility. But why would a company choose a philosopher over another type of business coach? A philosopher can nudge and question, take leaders on uncomfortable journeys, even be a disruptive force – and they should, suggests US-based Andrew Taggart, who consults for organisations in Silicon Valley on how to use philosophy in a practical context. “Doing philosophy as a way of life is inherently challenging and can, at times, be deeply puzzling,” he says. “I see it as my responsibility to push you to think harder and much more clearly about yourself and the world.” In the midst of business pressures, are you someone who will pursue the truth, even if it means discovering painful things about yourself? A tough question, especially when shareholders and HMRC are banging on the door for your quarterly accounts. Short-term financial accounting requirements, are, says Steare, one of the underlying problems facing leaders who wish to be ethical, because what benefits people and the planet in the long term is not usually going to be what’s required to turn a profit in the short term. Bringing a philosopher on board is not for the faint-hearted: the practical application of philosophical thinking, Taggart explains, demands that business leaders interrogate the role played by their product or service in the global scheme of things, “not only to see whether something makes sense in the marketplace, but also to see whether its existence is actually justified”. Practical philosophers tend to be employed as consultants at the moment, and it’s still quite niche, but Marinoff says he would love to see corporates employ their own in-house “chief philosophy officer”, or “philosopher in residence”. “We’re not that expensive compared to other professionals,” he laughs. “There are composers in residence, poets in residence and artists in residence – why not a philosopher in residence?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/feb/22/the-solution-to-university-pensions-better-fund-managers","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T14:05:50Z","webTitle":"The solution to university pensions?

Better fund managers","bodyText":"Never have university pensions been so firmly in the media spotlight as this week. But why are the changes to the universities superannuation scheme (USS) so controversial? Views diverge wildly: vice-chancellors and their representatives say future pensions are unsustainable, while staff see a strongly performing scheme. With an estimated cost of £200,000 to the average member of staff over their retirement at stake, something had to give. Pensions are complex. To try to understand them, we need to go back to basics. Defined benefit pensions involve employees agreeing a monthly contribution with their employer. The employer matches it at an agreed rate, with the pension at retirement guaranteed – or defined. Both contributions are folded into the pension fund, with some covering the costs of current pensioners and the rest invested to secure returns, keeping track with rising prices. In theory, the fund’s boat should be lifted with rising economic tides. The problem is that the boats these pensions are invested in are defying the expected tidal forces. Between 2000 and 2009, investment returns rose so quickly that firms were allowed contribution holidays. It was argued that the excess cash could be better invested in new buildings. We now know that these forces were a figment of the financial sector’s imagination. The destruction of value and collapse of interest rates has meant that, for investors, the economic tide has gone out and their boats have been stranded – with our pension pots inside them. What happens now is anybody’s guess. Life-changing decisions shaping trillions in pension funds are being made on the back of guesswork masquerading as science. The projections on which the USS cuts are based claim the fund will be unable to keep up with future pension payments. This supposed deficit is growing as life expectancy increases. This is compounded by actuarial wizardry suggesting it will cost significantly more to buy future pensions largely because the investments in the fund are expected to have less purchasing power. The boats remain stranded on the beaches of low investment returns. The point is, anybody can project anything – including future pension liabilities. Yet the finance industry’s track record of estimating our future economy is woeful. Estimates of the costs of buying future pensions by the vice-chancellors’ actuarial consultants vary incomprehensibly. So incomprehensibly that many cannot fathom the calculations. Most people prefer to deal with facts. Here they are: current employees pay £2.1bn into the USS fund, which comfortably absorbs the £1.8bn paid to pensioners each year. The USS asset managers need a net annual return of only 3% from the massive £60bn fund to cover these costs – before considering the billions that employed staff contribute each year, which more than cover the estimated cost of future pensions. The good ship USS pension fund is well and truly afloat. It’s never run aground in its history. But with the sleight of an actuarial hand, this rosy picture turns into a financial nightmare. The guiding star most pension analysts follow leads to corporate bonds not the ultra safe index-linked gilts used by the USS. Returns on AA gilts have been at record lows due to the complexities of quantitative easing and its distortion of returns on bonds and the wider financial markets. But the world is changing: the investment strategies of some of the world’s largest and most respectable pensions are moving from ultra-safe bonds towards riskier equities. Yes, there is risk, but look at it this way. You have an annual income of £21,000. Your outgoings are £18,000 but expected to increase. You have £600,000 invested in a mixed portfolio of balanced risk. Could you cover your future outgoings? Add a few zeros, keep the ratios, and you have the USS’s current situation. Its fund managers claim they can’t make these numbers work. Other fund managers think they can. Perhaps it’s time to invest the £60bn fund with a wider group of asset managers who are more willing to take on risk. The alternative is a £200,000 reduction in the value of each staff member’s pension, which is no longer guaranteed or defined but subject to the fluctuations of the market at the time they retire. When the alternative is bleak, sometimes the riskiest route is worth taking.

Many woodland and grassland mosses begin new growth while it is still too cold for trees to leaf and grass to grow, before they can be cast into deep shade by surrounding vegetation. Today the top of a wall beside this lane near the river Tees was decked with new green carpets. The most luxuriant was springy turf moss, Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, familiar to anyone who has a poorly drained lawn. Its unruly red-stemmed shoots, forcing their way like jack-in-the-boxes through the matted remains of last year’s grasses, shone in the early morning light. As I bent to examine its hooked leaves, with their long, silvery hair points, there was a hint of that humic aroma of sun-warmed soil that grows stronger as spring approaches. Nearby was a softer landscape of neat feather moss, Pseudoscleropodium purum. If turf moss is the coconut mat in the doorway, this species is the finest living-room carpet, a tactile forest of tight whorls of leaves and smooth shoots. And then, most splendid of all, there was glittering woodmoss, Hylocomium splendens, its filigree shoots and crimson stems still decorated with last night’s raindrops. I watched a minute springtail plodding its way around the edge of one of the fractal fronds, a day-long epic journey if it followed the perimeter of every golden leaf. These 5cm-tall forests of interwoven fresh growth, descendants of the first plants that began to colonise dry land half a billion years ago, are microcosms, home to a vast array of small animals; nematode worms, mites, midges and molluscs thrive in their shady, damp recesses. It’s tempting to let the imagination wander here too, to pick up a hand lens and follow a millipede into the deepest recesses of the wildwood of mosses. So much of natural history focuses on charismatic organisms like birds and mammals, overlooking the world at the soil surface where the foundations of biodiversity lie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/22/mikaela-shiffrin-winter-olympics-medals-skiing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T13:41:29Z","webTitle":"Mikaela Shiffrin never had to be the Michael Phelps of skiing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/22/mikaela-shiffrin-winter-olympics-medals-skiing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/22/mikaela-shiffrin-winter-olympics-medals-skiing","fields":{"headline":"Mikaela Shiffrin never had to be the Michael Phelps of skiing","bodyText":"By no sane metric could Mikaela Shiffrin’s second Olympics, which concluded on Thursday afternoon with her silver medal in the alpine combined to go with last week’s giant slalom gold, be fairly assessed as anything but a success. She competed in three events in Pyeongchang after the weather conspired to spoil her ambitious bid for a record-breaking five medals in five events. Expectations were warped by months of hype which could only be characterized as unrealistic in the notoriously volatile trade of alpine skiing, where the margins that separate triumph and disaster come down to the most innocuous variables. When it was done Shiffrin’s results in the races she entered spoke for themselves: first, fourth and second. But more importantly, she has rightfully assumed the role that awaited her as the face of the US ski team for the foreseeable future, a mantle held for more than a decade by Lindsey Vonn. That she did it all with uncommon poise and affability in the face of unthinkable pressure is as remarkable an achievement as you’ll see at these Winter Games. NBC had put forth Shiffrin as the face of these Olympics in part due to her transcendent talent, but even more because her events were spread out over two weeks. One-offs like Chloe Kim and Shaun White, brilliant as they are, are no substitute for the appointment television a sprawling narrative engenders. With it came a months-long crescendo of hype that cast Shiffrin as the Michael Phelps of the piste, feeding into the unspoken addendum to the Olympic motto in America: Citius, Altius, Fortius, Plus. Just how many golds would be enough to deliver on advance billing? The chest tightens just thinking about it. But skiing is an outdoor sport and the blustery conditions that prompted three days of postponements at the start of the alpine skiing created a logjam that demanded Shiffrin drop the super-G. Suddenly, the drive for five became the tour for four. She wasted no time when the racing finally started last Thursday, coming from behind to win the giant slalom, her third best event, for her second career Olympic gold. Less than 24 hours later, the American was back on the hill, this time for her signature discipline: the slalom. Four years after becoming the youngest ever Olympic champion in the sport’s most technical event, Shiffrin came in fourth. The curveballs weren’t limited to the schedule: her boyfriend, the French skier Mathieu Faivre, was sent home after badmouthing his team-mates, an odd episode that no doubt entered her mind at a time when clarity was paramount. Then on Monday evening Shiffrin’s program was squeezed from the other end when organizers moved the combined up from Friday to Thursday due to a projected forecast of strong winds, prompting her withdrawal from the downhill and ending hopes of a hotly anticipated showdown with Vonn. They finally met on Thursday, where Shiffrin won a silver as Vonn faltered, a symbolic passing of the torch as snow began to fall at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre. There may always be a sense of “what if” surrounding Shiffrin’s fortnight in Pyeongchang. Who knows what records might have fallen had only the weather complied? But rather than ponder what might have been, better to marvel at what Shiffrin laid down amid outrageous circumstances. Even with a truncated program Shiffrin became the first American woman to win at least a gold and a silver in alpine skiing at a single Olympics since Andrea Mead Lawrence in 1952. She’s only the fourth American to win at least three Olympic medals in alpine skiing, joining Vonn (three), Julia Mancuso (four) and Bode Miller (six). And she’s only 22. That’s why Thursday’s alpine combined, the first and only time Shiffrin and Vonn would compete against each other at the Olympics, was rich with symbolic value. We bore witness to the past giving way to the future – and the future is bright indeed. Shiffrin’s dominance in the slalom is well-documented, but she’s since blossomed from specialist into quite possibly the world’s best all-around skier. Her eye-popping 41 victories in World Cup events before the age of 23 is more than any other skier in history. (Vonn, now five off Ingemar Stenmark’s all-time record of 86, had won four at the same age.) Nothing is guaranteed in alpine skiing, particularly as Shiffrin dips her toes further into the more hazardous disciplines of the super-G and downhill. But at the moment she’s got the world by the tail, time on her side and hard-won experience sizing up, managing and beating back the most heightened of expectations, exponents all of a beautiful mind. It turns out Shiffrin never needed to be the wintertime Michael Phelps, not when the external pressure, as she repeated time and again during the Pyeongchang run-up, are nothing compared to the pressure she puts on herself. Being Mikaela Shiffrin is more than enough. “I’m in a really good place in my career right now,” she said in Thursday’s aftermath. “In four years, it looks good but anything can happen. The thing that I’ve learned most in the last couple years is that as soon as I start to let my brain get ahead of me, of where I’m actually at, then things start to go downhill. “It was important for me at this Olympics to focus on my skiing, not the medals. It’s always, always important for me to focus on where I’m at and what I need to do to get better the next day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/22/dave-ryding-posts-best-british-alpine-skiing-result-for-30-years-at-winter-olympics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T10:23:06Z","webTitle":"Ryding posts best British alpine skiing result for 30 years at Winter Olympics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/22/dave-ryding-posts-best-british-alpine-skiing-result-for-30-years-at-winter-olympics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/22/dave-ryding-posts-best-british-alpine-skiing-result-for-30-years-at-winter-olympics","fields":{"headline":"Ryding posts best British alpine skiing result for 30 years at Winter Olympics","bodyText":"It was supposed to be a men’s slalom battle for the ages between Austria’s Marcel Hirscher and the Norwegian Henrik Kristofferson – with a British skier in the mix for bronze. Instead, when Hirscher lost control on his first run, and Kristofferson got tangled with a gate on his second, Sweden’s Andre Myhrer claimed a surprise gold. Meanwhile Dave ‘The Rocket’ Ryding, who learned to ski on a dry slope in Pendle, Lancashire, was left to rue a spluttering first run as he finished ninth. It was Britain’s best alpine skiing result for 30 years and thus a highly creditable result for Ryding, whose overall time of 1:40.16 was just 1.17 sec behind Myhrer. However, he undoubtedly left himself with too much to do after a cautious first run saw him 1.37 sec back at halfway. “I had a couple of mistakes there that were a bit costly but the Olympics always give you a bit of the yips,” he admitted. However, while Ryding is 31, he insists he is good enough to come back in Beijing four years’ time and win a medal having finished 17th in Sochi in 2014. “I came to skiing really late so I’m still warming up,” he said. “I’m more than motivated to keep going – obviously a little tired, stressful this job, but more than motivated to keep going and keep improving. Myhrer is 35 and the last winner, Mario Matt, was also 35 and at the next Olympics I’m 35 so I’ll try to keep that trend going.” Ryding also predicted that Britain could become a top skiing nation in eight years – provided there was extra investment in the sport. “We’ve got to keep the structure and support,” he said. “It’s not easy, you’ve got to have the skills and in slalom it’s fine margins. It’s not an easy sport but I’m 100% sure if we keep working then why not. “For a top five nation you’d have to say at least two Olympic cycles. You can never predict the future but look at the freestylers, and the alpine’s coming, it just takes time and patience.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/22/french-man-who-kept-porn-on-work-computer-loses-privacy-appeal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T12:45:18Z","webTitle":"French man who kept porn on work computer loses privacy appeal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/22/french-man-who-kept-porn-on-work-computer-loses-privacy-appeal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/22/french-man-who-kept-porn-on-work-computer-loses-privacy-appeal","fields":{"headline":"French man who kept porn on work computer loses privacy appeal","bodyText":"A man who kept a stash of pornography on his work computer has failed to convince judges his right to a private life was infringed when his employer opened the personal files containing the material without his knowledge. Eric Libert was fired by the French national rail operator SNCF in 2008 after his boss discovered the pornographic files and a series of forged certificates. He asked the European court of human rights to rule on his case after he was unsuccessful in the French courts. He argued that, since he had marked the files “personal”, his employer was not allowed to look at them in his absence – in accordance with French law. Libert claimed France failed to uphold his right to a private life, provided by the European convention on human rights. However, on Thursday, judges sitting in Strasbourg said SNCF bosses had acted properly because it was not sufficiently clear the files contained material Libert considered private and dismissed his claim. Libert had worked for SNCF since 1958 – most recently as the deputy head of its regional surveillance unit in Amiens, in north-eastern France. He was suspended from his duties in 2007 and, on his return the following March, he found his work machine had been seized. He was told his bosses had found the forged certificates and a large number of files containing pornographic images and films and he was dismissed from his post that July. On Thursday, the judges noted that French law does offer protection to employees who store personal material on their work computers as long as it is clearly marked as such. In that case, the judges said, an employer would need to notify the staff member of their intention to look in the files or open them in their presence. Because Libert had marked his files personal, not private, it was not clear whether or not the information in them related to his personal work details, the court said. According to a spokesman for the court, had he marked them sufficiently clearly as private, then Libert would have been given time to put the files in order. Libert has three months to request that the judgment be referred to the grand chamber of the court for a final ruling. If no such request is received, or if a referral request is rejected by the grand chamber, Thursday’s ruling becomes final."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/22/debt-for-dolphins-seychelles-create-huge-new-marine-parks-in-world-first-finance-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T12:00:35Z","webTitle":"Debt for dolphins: Seychelles creates huge marine parks in world-first finance scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/22/debt-for-dolphins-seychelles-create-huge-new-marine-parks-in-world-first-finance-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/22/debt-for-dolphins-seychelles-create-huge-new-marine-parks-in-world-first-finance-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Debt for dolphins: Seychelles creates huge marine parks in world-first finance scheme","bodyText":"The tropical island nation of Seychelles is to create two huge new marine parks in return for a large amount of its national debt being written off, in the first scheme of its kind in the world. The novel financial engineering, effectively swapping debt for dolphins and other marine life, aims to throw a lifeline to corals, tuna and turtles being caught in a storm of overfishing and climate change. If it works, it will also secure the economic future of the nation, which depends entirely on tourism and fishing. With other ocean states lining up to follow, the approach could transform large swaths of the planet’s troubled seas. The challenge for the Seychelles is clear on the coral reef fringing Curieuse Island, once a leper colony and now a national park. The mass bleaching caused by warming waters in 2016 has left the white limbs of branching corals lying like bones in a ploughed graveyard, with rare flashes of the cobalt-blue coral survivors. “The biggest changes are climate change,” says David Rowat, a marine scientist and diving school owner for 30 years, who says storms and bleaching events are becoming more frequent. Some clownfish have never returned since the major bleaching in 1998, he says: “The ‘nemos’ all went.” As the reef recovered, the 2016 bleaching was a “kick in the teeth”, Rowat says. Overfishing, and the killing of dolphins, sharks and turtles as bycatch in tuna nets, is also taking its toll across the Seychelles’ vast ocean territory. The new marine plan bans fishing around biodiversity hotspots, keeping them healthy and better able to resist climate change. The biodiversity jewel in the Seychelles crown is the Aldabra archipelago, which rivals the Galapagos in ecological importance. Spinner dolphins, manta rays, humpback whales and nurse, lemon and tiger sharks share the waters with hawksbill and green turtles, and seabirds from some of the world’s largest colonies soar above. Dugongs - or sea cows - are the most endangered species in the Indian Ocean and shelter here, while 100,000 rare giant tortoises slowly roam the land. The new protected area around Aldabra is 74,000 square kilometres - almost the size of Scotland - and bans all extractive uses, from fishing to oil exploitation. The second new protected area is 134,000 sq km, centred on the main Seychelles island of Mahe. It allows controlled activities but is, for example, banning “fish aggregating devices” – rafts that concentrate fish but drive up bycatch. Together, the parks cover 15% of the Seychelles ocean and the government will double this by 2021, putting it far ahead of an international target of 10% by 2020. The parks resulted from the first ever debt-swap deal for marine protection in which $22m of national debt owed to the UK, France, Belgium and Italy was bought at a discount by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the NGO that has assisted the Seychelles. TNC also raised $5m from donors to pay off part of the debt and cut the interest rate charged to the Seychelles government on the outstanding loan. This has freed up $12m over the next 20 years to help implement the new marine plan. “The Seychelles is positioning itself as a world leader in ocean governance,” says environment minister, Didier Dogley. “But we are not doing this because we have such a great ego but because we truly believe these initiatives will create prosperity for our people, conserve critical biodiversity and build resilience against climate change.” Leonardo DiCaprio, whose foundation donated $1m towards funding the debt swap, said: “These protections mean that all species living in these waters or migrating through them are now far better shielded from overfishing, pollution, and climate change.” Benoît Bosquet, environment practice manager at the World Bank, which is not involved in the Seychelles marine plan, said: “They are a leader in this field worldwide and may be an example for many other countries.” However, despite the biggest consultation since the Seychelles nation was founded, some islanders have not welcomed the new plan. On Praslin island, as he unloads his catch of job fish and white spotted snappers onto Grande Anse beach, fisherman Richard Bossy, says: “We are worried. They want to make a lot of regulated areas where we can’t fish. Fishing is already harder and we are going to lose a lot. If there is not enough enforcement, it will never be implemented.” Leroy Lesperance, who charters glass-bottomed and game-fishing boats to tourists on Praslin, is also sceptical the plan will become a reality: “I am 44 and I have heard this talk since I was at school.” But others have bought into the idea, including Graham Green, a young fisherman at Baie St Anne on Praslin: “If the fish are protected where they are spawning, I’ve heard they will get bigger. We need to do it if we are going to be catching fish in 20 years.” Green expects the benefits will take perhaps five-10 years to be realised, but sees it as an investment: “You couldn’t start a business today and be a millionaire tomorrow - if you could everyone would be a millionaire.” Another challenge to the marine plan is a controversial new military base planned for the island of Assumption, about 20 miles from the Aldabra atoll and to be paid for by India. One well-informed source, who asked for anonymity, told the Guardian: “I am worried that it could damage the biodiversity of Aldabra. We are talking about big ships coming in to berth.” That implies pollution and the dredging of channels, which can cover corals in silt, he says. “The Assumption saga will certainly test the credibility of the marine spatial plan process,” says Keith Andre, from the Fisherman and Boat Owners Association. But Seychelles vice-president, Vincent Meriton, says the military base will have to pass environmental assessments and will actually benefit protection, by enabling better surveillance around the isolated Aldabra archipelago: “This facility will allow us to better monitor. It augurs well.” Meriton also says the Seychelles will need to use new satellite surveillance programmes that use machine learning algorithms to detect the tell-tale movement patterns of fishing boats, already in use in some parts of the Pacific. Oil exploration is another dilemma for the Seychelles, which could be sitting on “world-class” reserves, according to Patrick Joseph, CEO of PetroSeychelles, a state-owned company. It has given up some high-priority prospects, such as the Wilkes seamount which is now in the Aldabra protection zone. But, pointing to the revisions to the plan expected every five years, he says: “If the price of oil goes a bit higher, there will be companies drilling here in the Seychelles.” Andre, pointing to the possibility of seismic surveys in the protected zone around Aldabra, says: “The nature and impacts of these activities contradicts the authenticity of the entire process.” Many of the details of exactly what is allowed in the protected zones could not be finalised until the areas were selected and are still being worked out, meaning many difficult negotiations still lie ahead. “It is a chicken and egg situation,” says Helena Sims, TNC’s project manager in the Seychelles. “But we have built trust from the bottom up and if we keep that and are transparent I am positive our targets can be met.” The Seychelles debt swap is a vital test case for this new way of funding ocean conservation. Rob Weary at TNC did the deal and expects to close a $60m debt swap deal with Grenada this year and a series of others in the Caribbean in the next couple of years. Mauritius also has serious interest. Despite the election of Donald Trump scuppering for now planned swaps of US debt for Palau and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, Weary is confident debt swaps for marine conservation are going to grow: “In the next three to five years we could potentially do a billion dollars of these deals. We have a sight line to that.” “All eyes are on us to see whether it works,” says Sims. The Seychelles, which is 99% ocean, will have gone from 0.04% to 30% protected area in a few years if it does. Questions, such as oil exploration, remain. But environment minister Dogley says: “We don’t have answers for everything now but the marine spatial plan has started the process of thinking about these things - before we were not. The debt swap triggered everything.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/24/reusable-bags-and-no-elephants-travel-the-world-without-trashing-it","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T21:14:58Z","webTitle":"Reusable bags and no elephants: travel the world without trashing it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/24/reusable-bags-and-no-elephants-travel-the-world-without-trashing-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/24/reusable-bags-and-no-elephants-travel-the-world-without-trashing-it","fields":{"headline":"Reusable bags and no elephants: travel the world without trashing it","bodyText":"Holidays can be a trashy experience – environmentally speaking, that is.

Choose your destination wisely Look beyond the glossy holiday brochures and consider a destination’s environmental track records before booking. Costa Rica, for example, has 1.1m hectares of natural reserves and a 93% reliance on renewable energy. Cambodia, on the other hand, has one of the world’s worst deforestation rates and wildlife poaching is rife. Check Yale and Columbia universities’ environmental performance index before deciding on an overseas destination; it ranks countries’ performance on environmental health and ecosystem vitality. Australia is currently third, after Switzerland and Luxembourg. Think carefully about where to stay. Look for leading eco certification badges, such as the non-profit Global Sustainable Tourism Council. Denmark’s Green Key program now operates in 56 countries (France has the most awarded sites), while Los Angeles-based Green Globe measures businesses in 90 countries against 44 criteria. Beware TripAdvisor’s GreenLeaders program, though; it’s a self-reporting system that gives hotels room to make claims with little external verification. For closer-to-home holidays, non-profit Eco Tourism Australia represents 500-plus environmentally responsible ecotourism operators across Australia, while Green Getaways lists Australian eco resorts, luxury eco cottages and green hotels. Opt for sustainable modes of transport The curse of living in Australia’s wide brown land is that getting beyond one’s own state often involves flying, one of the most polluting ways to move from A to B. According to Choice Australia, airlines spewed forth 781m tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2015 – if global aviation was a country, its emissions would rank seventh in the world, between Germany and South Korea. Airline carbon offsetting programs attempt to address this with limited success, as few passengers choose to pay the extra fee. “Offset programs are worthwhile,” says Petra Stock, Climate Council’s energy and climate systems analyst. “The best offset programs are those that reduce pollution at source through renewable energy or energy efficiency programs, for example.” Prevention is better than cure, however, as planes also release black carbon, nitrous oxide and sulphur oxide, which further contribute to the heat-trapping greenhouse effect. “Offsets shouldn’t be thought of as a free pass to pollute, but rather as an additional solution after first trying to avoid and minimise transport pollution,” Stock says. If flying is unavoidable, pack light, as every extra luggage gram adds to the flight’s fuel burn and emissions. When travelling long haul, fly non-stop where possible: taxiing, taking off and landing are responsible for the greatest carbon emissions. If possible, choose public transport for short-haul travel, especially when you arrive at your holiday destination. Avoid creating mountains of rubbish Too many travellers leave a trail of trash – sidestep this by thinking ahead. Fly with your own headphones, for example, rather than relying on the plastic-wrapped airline offerings, and take a reusable shopping bag to skip plastic bags. Plastic water bottles are the major scourge left behind by travellers to clog streets, rivers, parks and beaches, so avoid them by carrying your own flask. Not sure if tap water abroad is safe to drink? In-bottle filters such as Sawyer or Fill2Pure make removing nasties as easy as filling a bottle, screwing the lid on and drinking.At the very least buy one large plastic bottle and refill a smaller day bottle, rather than turfing multiple small bottles each day. “Forty per cent of the rubbish reported to us by volunteers is plastic. Of that just over half is plastic bottles,” says Terrie-Ann Johnson, Clean Up Australia Day managing director. “These bottles simply won’t go away – they’ll outlive us – and they won’t find their own way to the bin for recycling. So we all need to take responsibility.” Say no to other single-use items. Avoid tiny shampoo and conditioner bottles, as any opened products get ditched as soon as you leave. Or choose hotels that work with non-profits such as Melbourne-based Soap Aid, which collects waste soap from 300 hotel groups and redistributes them to schools and homes in developing nations. Support local people and animals Tourism has a big impact on small local communities, and travellers’ choices can dictate market movements. Elephant riding is a classic example: long revered as a selfie opportunity for tourists, multiple damning reports now make clear these animals are suffering, and traveller demand only perpetuates the agony. A World Animal Protection report documenting the conditions of 3,000 elephants used in tourist venues across Asia found three out of four endured poor living conditions such as chaining, inadequate food and stressful interactions with visitors. Paying to ride elephants or walk with tigers or lions also supports an industry that illegally captures, transports and abuses thousands of animals each year. In 2016, TripAdvisor stopped selling tickets for wildlife experiences where tourists come into contact with captive wild animals, in recognition of these concerns. But demand is the ultimate driver for change – vote with your dollar and avoid supporting animals used for entertainment when travelling. Make choices that benefit people. Opt for small group tours with local guides, and buy locally made souvenirs that support artisans over cheap mass-made junk. Beware the scourge of voluntourism, short-term volunteer projects in developing nations that can do more harm than good. Such trips can rob locals of jobs and cause abused and abandoned children to form unhealthy emotional attachments, a 2010 report found. A more ethical option is volunteering at home, through organisations such as Conservation Volunteers Australia, NatureWise and Volunteering Australia. So next time a holiday beckons, consider the small actions travellers can take to leave a lighter footprint on our planet.

The twentysomething couple were both keen gamers; Oliver even worked at a development studio, Bossa, the company behind offbeat hits such as Surgeon Simulator and I Am Bread, making their YouTube videos and trailers. It seemed like a fun idea – it’s just that Oliver had never coded a game before and Ruby had never written anything. The result is Purrfect Date, a game in which you … well, date cats. It was released on PC in December and iPhone earlier this month, where it was recently made App of the Day and is attracting rave reviews from players. Given the popularity of cats on the internet and throughout social media, its success might not seem that surprising. But for Oliver and Ruby, its creation was deeply personal. As passion projects often do, Purrfect Date became about life and relationships and helping each other. It’s not a game about cats: it’s a game about love. “We’d often ask, what would be the perfect game for our friends and family?” says Oliver. “Then we thought: but what about us?” Ruby chimes in: “We just started listing things. It would have to have cats in it, and our favourite TV show is Lost so we could set it on an island ... We didn’t expect it would be played. We just made it for each other.” In Purrfect Date, you take on the role of a researcher arriving on Cat Island to assist a mysterious scientist named Professor Pawpur. Your job is to track and register the feline inhabitants, using a handy device named the Cat-A-Log (“For the last two years, my life has basically been cat puns,” says Ruby). On the first night, however, a cat-scratch infects you with a disease that will slowly transform you into a cat unless you discover the antidote. You can now converse with the friendlier felines of the isle, but with those foreign hormones racing through your bloodstream, you also find that you can date them. Purrfect Date is sweet, funny and engaging. The romance aspect is innocent and friendly rather than physical, the six dateable cats quickly becoming fluffy symbols for lots of romantic traits and tropes. It’s a playful expression of something that’s been happening in game development since free tools and digital stores started democratising the medium several years ago: creators subverting video game conventions to explore personal, emotional and moral themes, using their own experiences as inspiration. For Ruby and Oliver, it’s also subtly autobiographical. “This game is basically our relationship,” says Ruby. “There’s so much of our personalities in there – lots of jokes and loving insults. The sphynx cat is quite helpless in her vanity. She is very much me on a bad day … The game is an expression of our love for each other.” But Purrfect Date’s development wasn’t easy. The narrative is deceptively complex: the game has to track exactly who has spoken to which cat and about what, forming a matrix of possibilities, and the script is over 120,000 words long. In the midst of wrestling with this, a year into development, Ruby found herself unexpectedly hospitalised when she woke up one night with pains in her chest and back. “I was having trouble breathing, I was scared I was having some sort of heart attack,” she says. The couple rushed to A&amp;E where a doctor told her it was probably heartburn. “It was quite anticlimatic. I felt a bit of a wimp. But then the same doctor came back with some test results and he had a completely different look on his face ...” Ruby had an inflamed liver; her gall bladder had to be removed. The scenario was crushingly familiar: Ruby was born with a kidney disease that has required two kidney transplants; her father donated one when she was six and her mother the other when she was 19. Her mum was about to come to the rescue again. After the operation, Ruby was bedridden for weeks, too fragile and exhausted to think about the game. But she and Oliver were committed to a release date. The schedule was falling apart. “I was in bed and useless,” says Ruby. “I was crying to Mum, ‘I don’t know what to do’ – and she said, ‘I can help.’” Ruby’s mum is actor Charon Bourke, who starred in dozens of TV series and theatre productions in the 1980s and 90s before quitting to care for her daughter. Recently, she’s taken up playwriting, and took a keen interest in Purrfect Date, reading the scenes as Ruby wrote them. And so, for the two months Ruby was out of action, her mum took over the writing. “She loved reading the game, and she could definitely see me in each of the cats,” says Ruby. “She’s a huge World of Warcraft fan, but for this I made her read visual novels to understand the inspiration. She’s really interested in new stuff – she wants to know what the kids are up to. She was able to copy my style really closely.” Creative collaborations often result in tension between the people involved – but Oliver and Ruby found that Purrfect Date brought them closer. “We had the privilege of really getting to know and understand each other on a whole new level,” says Ruby. “It’s been invaluable to our relationship.” Another relationship provided further inspiration: when Ruby was a child, she had a pet named Pushka. “She was a strange cat,” says Ruby. “She was so patient and tolerant of me, a very needy, clingy kid. She would allow me to bandage her up to play doctors; no other cat I’ve met since would stand for it. I think she understood I was unwell and it made her forgiving. She passed away a while ago and in April I’m going to get a tattoo of her in the style of the game.” Purrfect Date is a reminder that everything we create, whether it’s a quick sketch, an epic novel or a cute game about going out with cats, says something about us. It holds the authors – their lives, their loves, their hopes – within it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/feb/25/the-big-picture-garry-winogrand-street-photography","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-25T08:30:16Z","webTitle":"The big picture: Geoff Dyer on Garry Winogrand's heavily laden car","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/25/the-big-picture-garry-winogrand-street-photography","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/25/the-big-picture-garry-winogrand-street-photography","fields":{"headline":"The big picture: Geoff Dyer on Garry Winogrand's heavily laden car","bodyText":"In some of his pictures, Garry Winogrand falls in love with the woman he photographs.

These apps, which are designed, written and maintained by humans, fail for many reasons. Since we know that our applications will sometimes fail, we need ways to debug them. Application logs are important for analysing specific reported or known problems. Clearly, an application log without any personal data would not provide much useful analysis as it would be very generic. Fortunately, our application logs are fully encrypted, access is controlled, and we have fine-grained control over where data is stored and how long we keep it for. This means we can temporarily store personal data for legitimate use. Also essential to improve quality is a monitoring system that groups related errors together and sends alerts if necessary. However, third-party error aggregation tools often offer less control and, more generally, we do not want to store personal data in additional systems unless absolutely necessary. Under GDPR, we will have a duty to consider the need to store personal data even more carefully. Our existing setup At the moment we capture the same exceptions and error messages for application logs and monitoring. This presents a problem because exceptions usually originate from unexpected circumstances, so it is easy to save personal data when an exception is caught. Similarly, a seemingly innocuous log statement - for example, logging an HTTP response body when a parsing failure occurs, can often contain personal or sensitive data. Although we don’t want adding logging and alerting to be onerous, we want to be certain that we are not sending personal data to third-party systems. Since most of our server side code is written in Scala, we can use the type system to help us to avoid making this mistake. A technical solution in Scala In our code we usually insert data into a string and pass directly to the error logger. This results in a string which is written to the application logs as well as a monitoring system (in our case this is Sentry). To avoid leaking personal data, the code must remember which parts of a string relate to the program, and which relate to the data being processed at the time of an error. Once we have this information, we can be more selective about where to send each error. We can illustrate this with a simple code example: First, we introduce some data that we want to hide In Scala, a string can be interpolated with ‘s’. Despite appearances this syntax is not actually a string. In fact, under the covers Scala converts the string to a StringContext and calls its method ‘s’ See https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/string-interpolation.html for more information on string interpolation. The fact that interpolation is just calling a method on StringContext is an important aspect of interpolation, and we took advantage of this. We can implement an implicit class taking a StringContext and implement our own method that returns a case class instead of a string. Now we can generate a log message using the ‘scrub’ prefix, instead of standard string interpolation. We can then use this souped-up object to decide what is safe to send to which system. To extend this idea, we can define a custom logger which only accepts our Scrubbed case class, and routes the anonymised and private messages to the right system. This prevents anyone working on the project from passing in ‘unsafe’ strings at compile time, and helps us to avoid inadvertently sending personal data to a third-party system. Here is an example of where we are using it in production on one of our public projects. Final thoughts Of course like any system, it is not perfect, merely good enough for now. A lot of data inserted into strings is not actually private in any way, for example whether an environment is PROD or DEV. Exceptions are currently treated as unsafe, however the stack trace at least should be safe. In future we could have a way of helping the compiler prove whether or not interpolated strings are safe, perhaps by using typeclasses or other implicits. Until then, we will get benefits from the current implementation until it becomes a limitation.

Sometimes it’s a thankless task – my legs scissored together, locked in spasm as I fight to break free of its stranglehold. I’m convinced cannabis has allowed me to live more of a normal life than would have been possible with the constant pain. I’ve always smoked it. But in recent years I’ve been making cannabis oil and turning it into tinctures. A few drops of my special brew numbs any niggling aches, clear my mind and help me get a good night’s sleep, spasm-free. But smoking a joint or making cannabis tinctures could land me in jail for five years under our current drug laws. For someone living with MS or any other affliction that can be soothed by cannabis – including Parkinson’s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder or cancer – the stigma of a criminal record is not ethical or fair. Since the “war on drugs” was launched in the early 1970s millions of people with medical problems have been getting a bum deal. Cannabis, for centuries lauded for its therapeutic benefits, was unjustly demonised, tossed in with the likes of heroin and cocaine, to be expunged from the reach of society. However, the war was lost long ago. It is estimated that the illegal global drug market is worth about $400bn a year. The figure represents the total failure of the policy and excludes the billions wasted fighting it. Several UK police forces, including Durham, effectively decriminalised the personal use of cannabis to prioritise resources. And public opinion supports a change in the law, especially when it comes to medical cannabis. That is only likely to increase after the fight by the mother of a six-year-old boy with a rare form of epilepsy who has been refused a licence to be treated with cannabis oil. Changes in the law in parts of the US, Canada and Germany mean that the use of medical cannabis is now legal there. The shift in policy has given people the opportunity to choose their medical path, allowing many to escape addiction to prescription opioids. The UK government appears reluctant to follow suit. Yet since 1998 it has licensed GW Pharmaceuticals to produce Sativex. The medicine, for people with MS, is derived from cannabis plants, mostly grown by British Sugar. It is a step forward, but ultimately it has ringfenced the development and sale of medical cannabis at a massively inflated price. Only a handful of those with MS receive it: the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which authorises the use of drugs by the NHS deems it too expensive (a year’s supply can cost upwards of £5,000). You either have to live in parts of Wales or be able to afford a private prescription to benefit. The formula in each 10ml Sativex bottle includes the chief components in cannabis – THC and CBD (2.5mg of each). It costs £125 a bottle and lasts on average 10 days. In comparison an ounce of medical cannabis will cost me £250 and hold upwards of 900mg of each component. Once extracted into cannabis oil and dosed accordingly, it can produce about 350 bottles of a product that does the same job, at a fraction of the cost. Obviously by making the spray I am breaking the law – but it helps indicate the hypocrisy of the government’s stance and its inertia in facilitating real reform. The production process is certainly not rocket science, and cannabis is a common herb in many countries, and should not cost an arm and a leg. People are just being held to ransom by an outdated law. Much rests on the second reading of Paul Flynn’s private member’s bill on Friday advocating cannabis be made legal for medical use. If it eventually passed into law, it would be a landmark day for people living with a chronic disease or in constant pain. Big pharma and major corporations involved in the industry such as British Sugar may balk at a regulated free market in medical cannabis, seeking to protect their interests. The drugs minister, Victoria Atkins, has shown antipathy for any kind of reform to the laws on medical cannabis. (Incidentally her husband Paul Kenward, is the managing director at British Sugar.) Flynn has got a lot of backers in his corner, though. Legalising medical cannabis might be personal to me, but it should be personal to us all. There are more than 11 million people living with a disability in the UK, and an ageing population means few will be immune from the pain that lies ahead. The benefits seen from the US and across the world offer us a template to build upon. • James Coke is a writer.

Eve Muirhead, who skipped the team to a bronze medal in 2014, scored two points on the final end to secure a surprise 6-5 victory. “It was a great team performance,” Muirhead said. “It shows we have a lot of determination, a lot of patience and I’m really delighted to get the semi-final spot. As a team, we love playing under the pressure. You thrive under that. When you’re on the ice, you don’t think of anything else.” The result means it will be the first time in Olympic curling history that Canada, who won gold at last year’s world championships without losing a game, will not have finished in the top three. “As a team I think we played really well,” Muirhead said. “Everyone is communicating great. The last few games we’ve got better and better and that’s important building into the play-offs.” Glenn Howard predicted more was to come. “The last five ends of that game were by far the best five ends we’ve played this week,” GB’s Canadian coach said. “That’s what I want to see. The girls were out there to win it.” Britain’s men will have to beat Switzerland in a play-off to make the final four after being crushed 10-4 by the USA, with the winners going on to play Sweden in the semi-finals. The GB skip, Kyle Smith, said: “We struggled to create anything. We got a couple of fortunate steals but we didn’t make enough of the simple shots and gave away a few simple twos and threes.” Britain’s Billy Morgan qualified for the big air final on Saturday after a thrilling second jump scored 90.50, securing him the sixth and final qualification place in heat two. The 28-year-old, who was a major doubt after injuring his knee in December, was delighted with his performance. “I had to dig deep and I did. Basically it meant I needed to get the highest score I could for a back triple. “The standard is mental, everyone has been killing it. I will need a lot of luck after seeing what’s going on. Watching practice it has been mental but anything can happen and I will try my best.” Morgan’s preparations had been interrupted by problems with his ear. “I woke up this morning with a completely blocked ear and I had to go have it syringed,” he said. “I was panicked, I just felt terrible. “With your ear blocked it’s a horrible feeling and I wouldn’t have felt too comfortable going in and doing this not feeling great. When I got here I was still feeling a bit dizzy but I think the adrenaline kicked in and took over and I was all right.” Britain’s two other big air snowboarders, Rowan Coultas and Jamie Nicholls, missed out on the final after scoring 84.50 and 81.25 points respectively. The 20-year-old Coultas, who is seen as one of Britain’s best hopes for the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022, said: “I’m feeling amazing, I’m so stoked to land those runs. It went to plan, I managed to smash training and get it a few times. “I’d never done the trick in a competition before so maybe that’s why I’m so stoked. Nicholls said:“My first run I felt a little nervous. Obviously being the first male snowboarder to drop in to the first big air at the Olympics, it was scary.” The 24-year-old added: “I was stood up there for a while, the crowds were cheering and going for it and I was just stood up there and I was quiet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/mar/02/new-ways-working-learning-resilient-childrens-social-workers","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T09:20:12Z","webTitle":"New ways of working and learning can grow resilient children’s social workers | Paul Burstow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/02/new-ways-working-learning-resilient-childrens-social-workers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/mar/02/new-ways-working-learning-resilient-childrens-social-workers","fields":{"headline":"New ways of working and learning can grow resilient children’s social workers","bodyText":"We expect a great deal from children’s social workers – they work with chaotic families, they have to look into the darkest parts of society, juggle large caseloads and hold huge amounts of emotional collateral. When things go well, their work often goes unnoticed; when things go wrong, the sky falls on their head. It is perhaps unsurprising that this story plays out in the numbers too; the vacancy rate for children’s social workers was 17% last September, according to new data published by the Department for Education. The same data suggests more than two-thirds of vacancies are covered by agency staff. A third of social workers leave the profession within two years, and the average career span is just eight years. With all this considered, workforce must be a priority for the What Works Centre for Children’s Social Care. The DfE data also raises critical questions about how we improve recruitment, resilience and retention of this essential workforce, and points us to places to learn from. Last year Ofsted published its verdict on Camden children’s services where my trust, the Tavistock and Portman, works in partnership with the council and its schools. The trust supports social workers by providing expertise and training and our staff are integrated in frontline social work and early help teams. The collaboration has seen the adoption of a new model of systemic thinking and reflective supervision. Systemic thinking is a technique for making sense of challenging situations and developing practical approaches for transforming them. Ofsted acknowledged the value of this approach, saying that a learning culture sees systemic practice enabling social workers and other frontline workers to increase their skills and knowledge through continuous training and development. Ofsted added: “Social workers enjoy working in Camden and benefit from manageable caseloads and analytical, reflective group supervision.” And inspectors said the approach “allows social workers to explore and implement imaginative and bold approaches to assess and support families”. Adopting systemic ways of working can have a big impact. An evaluation in Hackney found that the organisation’s culture fostered reflective learning and support. Among the eye-catching results were a 55% reduction in sick days taken and a 54% reduction in spending on agency staff. In the London ‘tri-borough’ of Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Kensington and Chelsea, the Focus on Practice systemic practice training for 660 practitioners led to dramatically improved staff retention rates and a 10% reduction in the number of looked-after children in one borough. Promoting this type of practice also requires whole system reform and sustained leadership. These approaches have their critiques as well as champions but as Camden has shown, adopting a systemic approach – and making group reflective supervision the way of learning – benefits children, young people and families. With workforce pressures growing, we must focus on the resilience, retention and recruitment of social workers. A third of social work graduates never go onto practice and almost six in 10 leave the profession within five years. Add to this the demography – which suggests that around 30% of the workforce is already eligible to retire or will be in the next five years – and the scale of the challenge is stark. The good news is that these issues are receiving increased attention. The new Centre for Systemic Social Work, funded by the DfE, is supporting the next generation of social workers to implement these approaches across children’s social care through its practice leaders development programme. And the What Works Centre for Children’s Social Care, which the Social Care Institute for Excellence is helping to set up, is exploring how we can generate better evidence on building a more resilient workforce, including on the role played by outcome-focused and systemic approaches to supervision.

The booking process involved the option to pay for many extras, one being allocated seats, or we “may be separated at check-in”. Her mother was, indeed, given a seat seven rows away but I could purchase an adjoining seat for €32 (£28). Is this deliberate to make customers pay? RA, Denmark It must be. Since 2016 Ryanair has made it compulsory for at least one adult in a party that includes children under 12 to pay £4 for a seat reservation so they sit next to a parent/guardian. Despite repeated complaints, Ryanair claims it hasn’t changed the random seat allocation policy. “More middle seats are allocated because more passengers are taking our reserved seats. They (paying customers) overwhelmingly prefer aisle and window seats, which is why those who choose random (free) seats are more likely to be in middle seats.” The Civil Aviation Authority is examining whether companies are deliberately splitting up groups so they have to pay to sit together.

Millions more people around the world should be prescribed pills or offered talking therapies, which work equally well for moderate to severe depression, say the doctors, noting that just one in six people receive proper treatment in the rich world – and one in 27 in the developing world. If cancer or heart patients suffered this level of under-treatment, there would be a public outcry, they say. “Depression is the single largest contributor to global disability that we have – a massive challenge for humankind,” said John Geddes, professor of epidemiological psychiatry at Oxford University. It affects around 350 million people worldwide and instances rose almost 20% from 2005-2015. “Antidepressants are an effective tool for depression. Untreated depression is a huge problem because of the burden to society,” said Andrea Cipriani of the NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, who led the study. In the UK, Geddes said “it is likely that at least one million more people per year should have access to effective treatment for depression, either drugs or psychotherapy. The choice will need to be made by doctor and patient.” The debate over antidepressants has unfortunately often been ideological, said Cipriani. Some doctors and patients have doubts over whether they work at all and point to the big placebo effect – in trials, those given dummy pills also improve to some degree. Some people suspect drug companies of fiddling trial results. Some patients simply do not want to take pills for a mental health condition. The study published in the Lancet took six years, Cipriani said, and included all the published and unpublished data that the scientists could find. It was carried out by a team of international experts. They looked at results after eight weeks of more than 500 trials involving either a drug versus placebo or comparing two different medicines. The most famous antidepressant of them all, Prozac – now out of patent and known by its generic name, fluoxetine – was one of the least effective but best tolerated, measured by a low drop-out rate in the trials or fewer side-effects reported. The most effective of the drugs was amitriptyline, which was the sixth best tolerated. In a commentary in the journal, Sagar Parikh from the University of Michigan in the USA and Sidney Kennedy from the University of Toronto in Canada pointed out that three drugs scored best for efficacy and tolerability: agomelatine, escitalopram, and vortioxetine. Three others scored particularly poorly: fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone. The first three “might be considered first choice” by doctors, they write, although the two most effective drugs – amitriptyline and venlafaxine – might still be first choice for severe depression. But Cipriani said any of the drugs might still have their uses. The trial data cannot show which drug would be likely to work best for any one individual. Antidepressants and psychological therapies – of which the most frequently used is CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy) – have similar success rates. Around 60% of people respond by about two months to the drugs with about a 50% reduction in their symptoms - an improvement in mood, better sleep and so on. But, he said, “about 80% of people stop antidepressants within a month”. New treatments are badly needed, the experts say. Most of the drugs in the study are known as SSRIs, which are thought to work by increasing levels of a chemical messenger called serotonin in the brain, but nobody knows for certain. “We don’t have any very precise treatments for depression at this point in time,” said Geddes. However, the doubts and controversy over antidepressants, allied to the difficulties in discovering new neurological drugs, have led to the drug companies quitting a field that once – after the launch of Prozac – looked likely to be very lucrative for them. “It is a massive problem that the industry has pulled out because they found this area very challenging to work in,” said Geddes. Other experts said the study was of major importance. Professor Carmine Pariante, spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the analysis “finally puts to bed the controversy on antidepressants, clearly showing that these drugs do work in lifting mood and helping most people with depression. Importantly, the paper analyses unpublished data held by pharmaceutical companies, and shows that the funding of studies by these companies does not influence the result, thus confirming that the clinical usefulness of these drugs is not affected by pharma-sponsored spin.” Dr James Warner, reader in psychiatry at Imperial College London, said: “This rigorous study confirms that antidepressants have an important place in the treatment of depression. Depression causes misery to countless thousands every year and this study adds to the existing evidence that effective treatments are available.” Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said taking antidepressants was frequently portrayed as a negative thing “but this in itself can add to the unfortunate stigma that sometimes exists around people with mental health conditions”. The research should reassure patients and doctors, she said. “Depression is a significant mental illness which, if left untreated or unmanaged, can cause a huge amount of distress for a patient, their family and friends. It should never be swept under the carpet or ignored.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

Cora, described by the bank as “highly lifelike”, is the result of a link-up with a New Zealand tech company whose co-founder was involved with creating digital characters in the blockbuster films Avatar, King Kong and Spider-Man 2. Cora is currently able to answer basic verbal questions such as “How do I login to online banking?”, “How do I apply for a mortgage?” and “What do I do if I lose my card?”. NatWest said it could help cut down on waiting times because it would be able to deal with simple problems, adding that Cora’s AI skills would eventually expand to answering hundreds of different questions, even detecting human emotions and reacting verbally and physically with facial expressions. The bank implied that a digital human could improve on the real thing by “providing consistent, accurate answers all the time in a way that humans can’t always do”. While some will be excited by the news that the “AI revolution” is coming to the UK’s high streets, others will fear that the 71% taxpayer-owned bank is investing in this technology in order to replace branches or staff. It is not clear what the bank’s army of counter staff think about the possibility of hi-tech robo-bankers taking their jobs. In December Natwest’s parent group RBS announced that 197 NatWest branches and 62 RBS outlets would close, putting nearly 700 jobs at risk and sparking warnings about the end of high street banking. But NatWest insisted Cora is not part of a plot to axe members of staff and that it would complement, not replace, branch, phone and online services. Cora has already been tested in one of the bank’s Liverpool branches and, earlier this week, one of its Newcastle outlets. “She” is still in the pilot phase, but the bank would like to see the technology rolled out in some form during 2018. As well as being put in branches, Cora could be used by customers at home on their laptop or PC and, in the long run, on smartphones. For about a year now, the bank has deployed a text-based chatbot, also called Cora, which customers can use on NatWest’s online help pages and that can answer more than 200 basic banking queries. However, a spokesman said that by drawing on advances in artificial intelligence, computing power, neuroscience and psychology, a new Cora prototype had been built. “It could serve as an additional way for customers to get help, on top of the usual branch, telephone and online services, and in the long run could answer hundreds of everyday banking questions.” The technology comes from New Zealand-based firm Soul Machines, which uses biologically inspired models of the human brain and neural networks to create a “virtual nervous system” for its digital humans that can detect human emotion and react verbally as well as physically through facial expressions. NatWest said that, like a real person, the digital human is trained to deal with new subject matter, “and when she makes mistakes, she learns, so that over time the interactions become more and more accurate”. While the bank indicated it would deploy the technology only if it successfully completed the pilot, Cora – which is modelled on an engineer at Soul Machines – could be used to help free up time for human advisers to answer more complex queries. She could also be used outside normal working hours and days. “Testing to date has suggested customers that have avoided digital services in the past may be more inclined to interact with digital humans like Cora, and it could help blind and partially sighted customers who are unable to engage with visual content,” the spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/21/keep-giving-oxfam-so-should-you-charity-mark-haddon","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T16:54:16Z","webTitle":"I’m going to keep giving to Oxfam, and so should you | Mark Haddon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/21/keep-giving-oxfam-so-should-you-charity-mark-haddon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/21/keep-giving-oxfam-so-should-you-charity-mark-haddon","fields":{"headline":"I’m going to keep giving to Oxfam, and so should you","bodyText":"If there is one clear thing we have learned from the revelations about the behaviour of certain Oxfam staff in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and in Chad in 2006, it is how much our standards and expectations have changed over the intervening years. The idea of a sex scandal has largely been stripped of the titillating ring it once had. The story has mostly centred on the abuse of women by men who had power over them. Prostitution has been treated as an unquestionable wrong, and it is now widely accepted that being paid for sex is something women can find themselves forced into, not just by the men who are paying but also by their economic and social vulnerability. Cast your mind back: 2011 was the year in which the BBC shelved a Newsnight documentary about the Jimmy Savile scandal. It would be a further 11 months before ITV’s Exposure: the Other Side of Jimmy Savile lifted the lid on what had been an open secret for a long time. Operation Yewtree would not get under way until 2012. Gary Glitter, Rolf Harris, Stuart Hall and Max Clifford had not yet been charged in the UK with child sex abuse. When that finally happened there was widespread disbelief that so many beloved celebrities could have done these things and an equally widespread belief that these were old men being dragged into court for behaviour that was once merely roguish. The country was about to start a long, slow and painful process, the latest chapter of which was the prosecution of the junior football coach Barry Bennell. A process that continues, I earnestly hope, until there are fundamental and lasting changes made in every workplace and organisation. Finally, we are beginning to accept that sexual abuse is endemic and that anyone naive enough to think that their organisation is immune needs to look longer and harder, to investigate proactively, to encourage victims and witnesses to speak up, and to protect them when they do. Many institutions are still desperately trying to work out how to do these things. Others have woken up to their responsibilities only in the past year or so after a series of scandals forced their hand, including in sport, parliament and the fashion industry. Paradoxically – and partly in response to certain men’s shameful actions and the charity’s inadequate response in Haiti and Chad – Oxfam started this necessary and difficult work before most. It employed a head of safeguarding, set up a hotline for whistleblowers, sent safeguarding teams to overseas programmes, and began publishing a list of all safeguarding incidents. Indeed, some of the supposed revelations over the past few weeks were detailed in a letter sent to Oxfam donors last year. My wife, Sos, and I have been Oxfam donors for decades. We admire the work it does in crisis response, development and campaigning. We admire its willingness to examine its practices and change accordingly. We admire how financially efficient it is. And in particular we admire how in recent years it has moved towards employing local people and charities to carry out development projects that can be replicated and sustained entirely by the communities themselves. I have visited a number of Oxfam-funded projects in the UK, Ethiopia and Jordan, and everywhere I have been I’ve seen women’s lives improved by better access to work, to an independent income, to education, housing and healthcare. We know people who work for Oxfam and, perhaps more significantly, we know those who used to work there, and have no reason to speak other than candidly about the charity. We will keep supporting Oxfam and donating money because the vast majority of the people it employs are deeply honourable people who do vital work, and because it is making a huge effort to stamp out abuse (you can read its action plan here). But most important of all, we will keep supporting Oxfam and donating money because of the millions of people throughout the world who depend on that vital work. It is these people who seem to have been left out of the conversation in the past couple of weeks: people in Yemen who, after three years of war, are now facing the world’s largest cholera outbreak; more than half a million Rohingya people fleeing to Bangladesh to escape the violence in Myanmar; 3.8 million people driven from their homes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; recipients of Oxfam aid and support in Bolivia, Malawi, Kenya, the Philippines, Niger, Rwanda, South Sudan and Zimbabwe. I am sad and angry about what happened in Haiti and Chad, but I am also sad and angry that people in the UK who had no interest whatsoever in the welfare of those people are now occupying the moral high ground or, worse, using this crisis as a way of furthering their own campaign against overseas aid in general. Taking money away from Oxfam is not an act without consequences. If you want to stop donating to the charity, make sure your money still gets to the people who need it. And whichever charity you choose, ask what they are doing to root out and prevent abuse. Because it will be happening and it will come to light. It has to come to light. The only route out of this terrible mess is for every charity – for every organisation of any kind – to turn a harsh light on itself, to accept its failings and to change them. It will be a painful journey, but it is one they are all going to have to take. And the sooner they start, the better. • Mark Haddon is a novelist and poet • This article was amended on 1 March 2018 to clarify that in 2012, Gary Glitter, Rolf Harris, Stuart Hall and Max Clifford had not yet been charged in the UK with child sex abuse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/21/uk-employment-workers-philip-hammond-gig-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T13:03:09Z","webTitle":"UK employment is up – it’s just a shame the workers are so miserable | Faiza Shaheen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/21/uk-employment-workers-philip-hammond-gig-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/21/uk-employment-workers-philip-hammond-gig-economy","fields":{"headline":"UK employment is up – it’s just a shame the workers are so miserable","bodyText":"We hear it again and again - politicians boasting about “more people in work than ever before”. At the same time we hear about a woman having a baby in the Sports Direct toilet because of a culture of fear at the company, BHS workers losing their pensions, Carillion construction workers left without work and even a DPD parcel delivery driver, Don Lane, collapsing and dying after being fined £125 for going to a doctors appointment. The gig economy has become synonymous with worker exploitation. Cases are lining up – from Pimlico Plumbers to university lecturers – the news is not one of jubilance but of desperation. So what does the headline employment statistic published this week, telling us that employment remains at near record levels, really indicate? Is it a sign that the economy is indeed doing well? The new report from the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class), which looks beyond headline figures to provide a grassroots perspective, finds that workers are in a bad way. This hardship isn’t just confined to those on zero-hour contracts, or even those on low incomes. Over a third of all workers state that they do not earn enough to keep up with the cost of living, and this is true even for three in 10 of those earning over £40,000. After a decade of poor wage growth, a huge majority still do not see a light at the end of the tunnel, with only one in five believing they’ll get an inflation or inflation-beating pay rise this year. About 20% of households have taken on a second job to boost incomes, and a further 20% have tried or contemplated it. It’s no surprise, then, that only one in four workers thinks the economy works for them. The labour market is taking its toll on our mental health. According to Class’s survey, over half of workers have noticed an increase in stress and workload over the past 12 months. In one interview we were told that half of mental health workers are themselves reporting mental health problems and feelings of failure. It’s a bitter irony. These findings are a stark reminder of just how inadequate the way in which we measure economic success is. There’s been a growing chorus of people that argue against the use of GDP, but the fact our top-line employment figures fail to capture an accurate picture as well is surely a sign that we need a broad overhaul of how success or failure is captured in statistics. We must start to take subjective measures such as indicators of wellbeing, workplace stress and perceived job security much more seriously. Consumer confidence indicators are used to gauge macroeconomic conditions, but measures of confidence in the economy shouldn’t simply be about how much people are willing to consume. Measures and targets focus minds, and currently we have very little that directs our politicians to run our economy in a way that prioritises people, or indeed the planet, over profit. Ultimately recoupling the economy to workers’ livelihoods and quality of life will take more than a new measure. We found that the long-term impacts of privatisation and more recently austerity have made many workplaces a hotbed of stress. Undoing this means giving workers more power and ending the cuts. And we need to start listening. When things don’t add up you don’t just keep plugging in the same numbers, and shouting about success. The economy may well be doing well by traditional measures, but these measures simply fail to reflect the reality of people’s lives. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, and others can continue to repeat the stats, but in doing so they are alienating millions of people while looking increasingly detached and delusional. • Faiza Shaheen is the director of the Centre of Labour and Social Studies"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/live/2018/feb/28/uk-weather-beast-from-the-east-batters-britain-for-second-day-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T05:30:29Z","webTitle":"Hundreds of drivers stranded on M80 as icy spell continues – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2018/feb/28/uk-weather-beast-from-the-east-batters-britain-for-second-day-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/live/2018/feb/28/uk-weather-beast-from-the-east-batters-britain-for-second-day-live","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds of drivers stranded on M80 as icy spell continues – as it happened","bodyText":"This live blog is now closed. Head over to our new live blog for the latest weather developments to get you through a freezing Thursday: I am signing off now but we are keeping this live blog open for any developments overnight. Thanks for joining me. Here’s a round up of what has happened this evening: A man in his 60s has died after being pulled from a frozen lake in south-east London. Hundreds of people stranded on the m80 in Scotland were facing the prospect of being stuck in their cars overnight. The Red Cross delivered blankets and bedding to hundreds of passengers stranded overnight at Glasgow airport. The south-west of England and Wales will be hit by blizzards on Thursday and Friday, the Met Office has warned. Thousands of schools across the UK will be closed until next week as parts of the UK faced red and amber weather warnings. The NHS is set to be put under increasing thanks to the “perfect storm” of below-zero temperatures, flu and winter vomiting bug, NHS England warned on Wednesday. A young boy had to be rescued after he got stranded on an island of ice on a lake in Essex on Wednesday afternoon. Read the full story here: As hundreds remain stuck on the M80 near Glasgow which became gridlocked during heavy snow, local people are taking matters into their own hands by bringing hot drinks, food and blankets. While many who are stuck are using social media to voice their frustration, some are sharing their appreciation for volunteers coming to their aid. Nicola Sturgeon has just tweeted about the situation on the M80 where hundreds of people are still stranded, calling it a “very difficult situation”. She says everything possible is being done to clear the motorway and get help to those who need it. Hundreds of drivers are still stranded on the snow-hit M80 in Scotland and are facing the prospect are being stuck in their cars overnight. Fuel and water supplies are being delivered by emergency services and drivers are being warned not to abandoned their vehicles. Police Scotland released a statement via Twitter to say they are working with partners to try and get the road moving again. The statement also said if drivers felt their journey was absolutely necessary, they should avoid the M80, which is covered by the red weather warning. Supt Phil Davison said: Efforts have been ongoing for some hours to get gritters onto the section of the M80 between junctions four and seven, moving larger vehicles to the side to allow them to spread their salt. If you are stuck, please don’t abandon your vehicle, this will only make it more difficult to move gritters through and there will be concerns for the welfare of the occupants. Supplies of water and fuel will be provided where there is an urgent need. If your journey is in red or amber warning area and cannot be delayed until conditions have improved, avoid the M80 [and] find an alternative route. Other roads across Scotland are also affected. He added that Traffic Scotland and local radio stations were providing updates. Scotland’s transport minister Humza Yousaf has said he will be holding talks with a number of employers after people were left stranded in snow while travelling for work. Motorists have been facing disruption on many routes as extreme weather hit large parts of the country, while those on the M80 have been at a standstill for a number of hours. People had been told to avoid travelling after the warnings for heavy snow and ice were issued – including the highest level red alert in central parts of Scotland. Speaking to Reporting Scotland, Yousaf said: Some employers have been extremely flexible, but clearly some haven’t. There will be some conversations I’ll be having after this weather event because I have seen HGVs that are carrying home furniture, stationery and piping. Now, I’m not convinced that that is all necessary and many of the incidents we’ve seen have involved a loss of traction from HGVs. The south-west of England and Wales will be hit by blizzards on Thursday and Friday, the Met Office has warned. A storm system – named Storm Emma by the Portuguese met service – will collide with the cold air already over the UK. Heavy rain from the storm, which is currently over the Bay of Biscay, is expected to turn to snow when it reaches the south coast of England and will combine with strong wind to produce the blizzards. Craig Snell, a meteorologist for the Met Office, said the storm would push up into the rest of south-west England and then up into Wales. These parts of the UK should expect to see a lot of snow on Friday. He said: Those areas should expect 10-20cm of snow with Exmoor, Dartmoor and the higher areas of south Wales such as the Brecon Beacons getting up to 50cm. The Red Cross has delivered blankets and bedding to hundreds of passengers stranded overnight at Glasgow airport. It remains unclear when flights will resume and the airport’s operations manager estimated that around 600 needed a place to bed down. Across the north of Scotland, energy companies have asked the Red Cross to check on vulnerable customers in case of power cuts. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish Government’s minister for transport, has advised people stuck in traffic jams on the m80 to stay in their vehicles. He said welfare was being provided to those who are stranded. Earlier Yousaf said he was looking at the traffic cameras and seeing “far too much traffic” on the roads, and reminded people that travel should be avoided. Police Scotland superintendent Helen Harrison, who is coordinating the multi-agency response, reiterated the message. She said: I would urge everyone to consider if they have to travel in the areas affected by the red and amber warnings. The red warning is the highest that the Met Office issues and is not taken lightly. It indicates conditions will be treacherous with drifting and lying snow, winds creating blizzard conditions and very low temperatures. A man has died after trying to rescue a dog from a frozen lake in south-east London, according to reports. The man, who was in his 60s, was taken to hospital after being pulled from the water at Danson Park boating pond, Scotland Yard said. A spokeswoman for the London Fire Brigade said the man was rescued by a member of the public. Police, firefighters and the air ambulance all attended the scene. The man was confirmed dead at a south London hospital. The dog was reportedly rescued by boat before being reunited with its owner. A young boy had to be rescued after he got stranded on an island of ice on a lake on Wednesday afternoon. The boy had run onto the frozen lake near Basildon, Essex before getting stuck when the ice began to break around him. The boy’s friend dialled 999 and firefighters were able to rescue him using inflatable sledges. Area manager for Essex Fire Service Tony Clark warned: “There is just no way you can tell if the ice can take your weight or not - by the time you find out it can’t, it’s too late. “Our warning to people is to not go on icy ponds or lakes in any circumstances, just by taking one step onto the ice you are risking your life - it’s simply not worth it.” Highways England has issued an amber “be prepared” alert covering the Midlands and the East, South East and South West of England. The severe weather warning is in place until Friday morning. Highways England’s head of road safety Richard Leonard said: Our gritting teams have been out treating the roads throughout the day and will continue to spreading salt 24 hours a day to keep the roads moving. Drivers should plan their journeys, monitor weather reports and pack a snow kit of blankets, food, water and a shovel if they really need to travel. You should avoid driving during heavy snow if at all possible. Councils across Wales are urging schools not to open tomorrow or Friday after weather warnings were upgraded to amber . The Met Office has issued large parts of Wales with its second-most severe weather warning, which is in force from midday on Thursday. In the warning, the Met Office forecaster said that “long delays and cancellations to public transport is expected, whilst some roads may become blocked by deep snow, stranding vehicles and passengers. Long interruptions to power supplies and other utilities are likely to occur” in places covered by the amber warning. The councils that have advised schools to close include: Cardiff Caerphilly Bridgend Rhondda Cynon Taf Ceredigion Blaenau Gwent Merthyr Tydfil Vale of Glamorgan Neath Port Talbot Other councils including Swansea and Carmarthenshire are leaving the decision to individual schools and have urged parents to check school websites for information. Southeastern rail has apologised to customers for “significant delays and cancellations” and urged commuters to avoid travelling during peak hours. The Southeastern spokesman said: Our priority is to get passengers home this evening, but heavy snow across the South East has led to significant delays and cancellations across the rail network. We’re advising passengers not to travel if they’re able to avoid it, and to make a plan for leaving work earlier than normal. Wherever possible, please try to avoid the peak hours. We’ve been working hard to run as many trains as possible today, and the weather conditions have been extremely challenging. This has resulted in cancellations and delays and we apologise to passengers who’ve had trouble getting to where they want to go. Our staff are doing all they can to keep people moving and have been out since the early hours shovelling snow from platforms and walkways. We’re continuing to focus on getting as much information as we can out to passengers. This is Nicola Slawson taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. In Scotland, which is being hardest hit by the “beast from the east”, Edinburgh airport remains open despite “most airlines” having cancelled their operations. Hospitals are set to come under even greater strain as a result of the extreme weather as the NHS as a whole battles a “perfect storm” of below-zero temperatures, flu and winter vomiting bug, NHS England warned today. Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, the chair of its National Emergency Pressures Panel, which is helping the NHS manage the extra demands on it this winter, said after its meeting today: Given the severity and duration of the cold weather, the panel warned that the NHS should be ready for continued pressure as a result of this cold snap, which typically triggers a rise in hospital attendances and admissions. Hospitals in many parts of England have come under even greater pressure in the last 10 days as temperatures have plummeted and stayed persistently low. One hospital in the Midlands, which asked not to be identified, said that a significant number of the extra patients arriving at its A&amp;E were people with flu, chesty colds and breathing problems. Quite a few of those were older people who, despite feeling unwell, had held off seeking medical care, especially from their GP, and therefore needed to be admitted when they did finally arrive at hospital. The hospital in question had run completely out of beds and, on one day last week, was unable to admit 160 patients who it believed needed to be on one of its wards. “It’s been very difficult. The numbers turning up have been unprecedented in my 20-odd years in the NHS”, said one official at the hospital. Keogh, who stepped down after a decade as the NHS’s national medical director in January, said: The panel wants to thank all NHS colleagues for their continued hard work and dedication in the face of a ‘perfect storm’ of appalling weather, flu and norovirus. With the severe conditions expected to continue we ask patients, their families to bear with us as we seek to minimise any disruption. The worst flu outbreak since 2009-10 is causing serious problems for hospitals, with 4,000 beds occupied by those struck by the virus. NHS England said in a statement: This pressure comes as the NHS is already contending with the worst flu outbreak this decade, which peaked at the start of February. We estimate this has meant up to 4,000 hospital beds a week are still being taken up by sufferers. Patients who contract the virus typically stay in hospital two and a half days longer than others. Norovirus – the winter diarrhoea and vomiting bug – is also restricting the number of beds hospital bosses have available to use for patients admitted as medical emergencies, NHS England said. The renewed spike in norovirus means that the number of beds closed by diarrhoea and vomiting have been up to 143% higher than the same time last winter. Last week, on average over 950 beds [a day] were closed, up from fewer than 500 for the same week last year. It added that its unprecedentedly in-depth and detailed “winter plans were having an impact in the face of the most challenging circumstances for several years. [Since January] the NHS has been confronted with persistently high flu hospitalisations, a renewed spike in norovirus and prolonged cold weather which drives up hospital admissions”. Keogh also highlighted how, despite coming under intense strain since before Christmas, the NHS “saw and treated 92,000 more patients in four hours this January than the same month last year, provided around 1.5 million more flu jabs this winter than last and latest data shows the number of bed days lost to delayed transfers of care has fallen to its lowest for approaching three years. In addition to this, 111 answered 1.33 million, an average of 42,900 per day, and an increase of 4.8% on January 2017”. More NHS staff who have contact with patients have had the flu jab this winter (67.6%) than last year (63%), which should help reduce the number of doctors, nurses and other personnel going off sick. The snow has forced the cancellation of the St David’s Day celebrations at the Senedd – the Welsh National Assembly building. The National Assembly for Wales Commission said arrangements to reschedule some of the tomorrow’s events were being considered and further information would be released through its social media channels. Stagecoach has cancelled its bus services throughout Fife for the rest of the day. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has cancelled non-essential surgery because of safety fears. The health board also said outpatient appointments would be postponed. However, emergency and crucial operations will go ahead as planned. The day’s snowfall has at least four fans: England’s only polar bears, who have been enjoying the sub-zero conditions at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park, in Doncaster. Victor, Pixel, Nobby and Nissan have been enjoying the snow that has blanketed their home. Staff at the park said the snowfall is the deepest anyone in the Doncaster area can remember for years. Carnivore keeper Adam Pfluger said: They absolutely seem to love it. Nissan and Nobby especially, the two youngsters, they’ve really enjoyed rolling around in the snow. We’ve been out in the paddocks to hide their food in the snow and stuff like that for them. They’ve had a really good time trying to dig through all the snow trying to find their breakfast. Victor, our oldest, is a little bit more sensitive to the cold weather. I think he’s had a bit more of a life of luxury before this. I think he prefers the warmer weather. But even he’s been laid out in the snow and has been seen rolling around. A pair of suspected thieves were arrested after they left a trail of footprints in the snow, Cheshire police say. Officers had received a report of a theft from a van at about 11.25pm on Tuesday. The arrested men, both aged 39, were from Manchester and Stockport. Glasgow airport had temporarily suspended flights while runways were cleared and had hoped to operate some today. Now, it’s announced the suspension of all flights – inbound and outbound – for the rest of the day. Due to continued severe weather conditions and the large number of flights which airlines have had to cancel, there will be no further flights to or from Glasgow airport for the remainder of the day. Further heavy snowfall is forecast and we will provide updates regarding tomorrow’s scheduled services later this evening. We would advise passengers not to travel to the airport and anyone with travel plans should contact their airline directly for specific flight information. Heavy snowfall in Lincolnshire has prompted the police to declare a critical incident as the A46 Lincoln bypass remains blocked. Lincolnshire police said it was partner agencies to alleviate the traffic issues and respond to those that need help. More than 70 traffic related incidents have now been reported, it said. Drivers stuck on the A46 are advised to stay in their vehicles while police try to remove a broken down lorry. Deputy chief constable Craig Naylor said: “We are dealing with a serious situation which is impacting on services for all agencies. The roads are in a very difficult position. The plans we have put in place as a SCG allow us to keep things going but these are reduced services under significant demands. “If you can avoid calling for an ambulance or avoid calling the police or fire service please do.” Several councils in Scotland have announced that all schools in their areas will be closed on Thursday. They include: Falkirk Clackmannanshire North and South Ayrshire East Lothian East Dunbartonshire The Scottish government is calling on employers to be as flexible as possible, as police urge people to avoid non-essential travel in the areas affected by red and amber warnings for heavy and persistent snow showers. A further meeting of the Scottish Government’s Resilience Room has been held today to ensure preparations are in place to deal with the forecast conditions. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said: “This is the first red warning that has been issued for snow under the current system which means that conditions in affected areas will be extremely treacherous. “I would urge people to follow police advice and avoid travel in those areas affected by the red and amber warnings. We recognise it will have an impact on people travelling to and from work over the next 24 hours and so I would encourage employers to be as flexible as possible with their staff.” Yousaf went on to encourage people to check on elderly neighbours and others who may be particularly vulnerable. He added: “Winter maintenance fleets are working 24/7 to treat the trunk road network and will be standing ready to assist motorists if required. We have more gritters available this year than ever before.” Chief Superintendent Stewart Carle, head of Police Scotland’s Road Policing raised concerns about the road network becoming overwhelmed as people leave work early to avoid the snow. “The warning covers the commuter periods both this evening and tomorrow morning, and so we would ask people to think very carefully about making alternative arrangements for these times and to consider whether they really need to make that journey, particularly on the road network which may become overwhelmed as people leave work early to beat the storm. We’d urge employers to be as flexible as possible in terms of their staff perhaps not being able being able to come to their normal places of work and to consider alternatives.” “As far as this afternoon is concerned, we’d ask people to think seriously about how they may be getting home either before or during the time of the Red warning as safely as possible.” Here’s a selection of video of Glasgow before the worst of the weather is forecast. National Rail is ordering passengers home early in central Scotland where the red warning is due to come into force in less and hour. Scotrail repeated the message. A spokesman said: “Safety is central to this decision. In areas where the red weather warning applies, customers should head for home now. There will be no train services in the red weather warning area tonight, or first thing tomorrow morning.” Readers continue to send in their photos of snowy scenes. Rotherham based photographer Ryan said the only change today was having to pick the children up early from school: “The snow’s a good excuse to get the sledges out though - and the dogs love it.” Artist Jackie Ward’s Hard to Find gallery is a bit more hidden today than usual in Brinsley, Nottinghamshire: Teacher Ben Kirk, 41, snapped this image of a horse in Waltham, north-east Lincolnshire: You can continue to share your images and video via GuardianWitness using the contribute buttons above. The Caledonian sleeper rail service from London to Scotland has been cancelled because of the red weather warning. At least 2,000 schools across England were closed today with yet more snow and ice forecast later in the week, writes Emily Hawkins. The east of the country saw the most closures. They included: More than 350 in Suffolk 493 in Kent, according to a council spokeswoman More than 50 in East Sussex 244 in County Durham More than 500 in Essex More than 370 in Norfolk Hundreds more schools were also closed in Scotland. All schools were shut in East Dunbartonshire, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Falkirk, Fife Council, Scottish Borders, Stirling Council, and East Renfrewshire Council. The World Health Organisation has warned that the cold weather sweeping much of Europe poses a heath risk particularly for the homeless, refugees and other vulnerable people. It urged governments to help protect those most at risk. “Cold can aggravate existing conditions and raise the risk of increased blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes,” warned Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe. She added: “Affected countries should stay alert. Measures must be taken to protect people at risk.” In a statement the WHO added: Frequently, poor households are the hardest hit as the poor can least afford to adequately heat their homes. Homeless people, and refugees and migrants can be especially vulnerable. Their risk increases if they lack proper clothing, food and medical care. Health and social services often face the challenge of caring for an increased number of patients suffering from various cold-related illnesses. Disruptions in services and infrastructure can further indirectly aggravate the health effects. Glasgow city centre is unusually quiet this lunchtime, 90 minutes before the red extreme weather warning is due to come into force. Suburban streets were rowdier than usual as children with an unexpected day off came out to play, but there is far less traffic on the roads. The windchill factor remains strong, with gusts whipping up banks of fallen snow. Although traffic had broken up snow on main roads, side streets remained slippery as most people decided to stay indoors. ScotRail have just started telling staff and customers in affected areas to head home now as they are starting to run the rail service down because of the red weather warning that the Met office posted for 3.00pm today until 10.00am tomorrow. Ireland’s National Emergency Coordination Committee has urged the public red weather warning zones in the south and east of the country, to make sure they are at home by 4pm tomorrow. Some of the country is already under a red warning alert but the conditions are expected to deteriorate further tomorrow as Storm Emma arrives from the south-west. Sean Hogan, the national director has warned that the blizzard conditions expected in the south and east of Ireland have not been seen since 1982. “Our main concern at national level remains Thursday night into Friday,” he said with Storm Emma bringing heavy snowfalls starting at 4pm Thursday afternoon, spreading up from the south With winds up to 100k, conditions will be hazardous for all travel. All schools and colleges and centres of further education in the red weather warning zone will be closed Thursday and Friday, the government has announced. “People should not venture out of doors,” said Hogan during the red weather alert. Dublin is expected to be in near lockdown. The Met Office has issued a rare red warning urging the public to take action against heavy snow forecast over central Scotland from 3pm on Wednesday. Scots were urged to leave work early and avoid all travel until 10am on Thursday. First minister, Nicola Sturgeon, urged the public to follow the advice of the police and local authorities as up to 40cm of snow is forecast to fall and widespread drifting predicted. Heavy snow across Scotland has already prompted the closure of hundreds of schools and caused major travel disruption on the road and rail network. Amber be prepared warnings are still in place for several other areas of the UK. A new warning for up to 50cm of snow in parts of the west country has ben issued. The remains of Atlantic Storm Emma is forecast to bring further bouts of heavy snow when it hits cold air over Ireland, Wales and western England. A red weather alert is enforce for most of Ireland. Members of the public have referred a record number of rough sleepers to a specialist helpline. More than 3,600 alerts were sent to StreetLink, which connects homeless people to local services, between Monday and Tuesday morning – the highest total for a 24-hour period. More than a thousand schools have been forced to close in England. Several lorries became stuck in snow drifts and jack-knifed on roads, causing delays and closures on main roads including the A1. Officials in Lincolnshire advised residents not to travel at all because of “horrendous” conditions. Heavy snow caused the closure of the West Coast railway line between Carlisle and Glasgow. More train services have been cancelled in East Anglia and the south-east. A pair of suspected thieves were arrested after police tracked them down by following their footprints in the snow. Officers in Macclesfield said they arrested two men on Tuesday on suspicion of breaking into vehicles. Novotel Canary Wharf has issued time lapse footage of London get blanketed in snow. Stein Connelly, Traffic Scotland’s operations manager has urged Scots to to leave work early to avoid the worst of the snow this afternoon and this evening. He pointed out that the red extreme weather warning applies from 3pm on Wednesday to 10am on Thursday. In a video update he said: “Can you leave earlier? Speak to your employer. The message is still the same: avoid travel during this time.” Officials in Lincolnshire are advising residents not to travel at all because of “horrendous” conditions as snow ploughs and gritters struggle to clear the county’s roads. Darrell Redford, Lincolnshire county council’s network resilience manager, said: “The conditions out there at the moment are horrendous - we haven’t faced a challenge like this for quite some time. “Given the overwhelming amounts of snow that we’re seeing, we’re having to focus solely on our major routes for the moment, as we attempt to get the county moving again. “That means many other roads will be hazardous and we’d urge you not to travel at all. “We will get on top off this, but it will take time.” Lincolnshire police reported seven road collisions and five stuck lorries. The Met Office has a useful visual summary of what to expect from the severe weather over the next three days. Met Éireann has expanded a red weather warning for snow and ice to cover most of Ireland. It forecasts up to 25cm of snowfall in some areas and blizzards on Thursday night and Friday. Scotland’s transport minister, Humza Yousaf, repeated his plea for Scots to only make journeys that are absolutely essential. Following the red extreme weather warning, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, urged the public to take care and follow the advice of the police, and local authorities. The red warning for Scotland warns of significant drifting and 40cm of snow in some areas. The chief forecaster says: Snow showers already affecting the area will become heavier and more prolonged later on Wednesday afternoon and at times through the evening and overnight period, with 5 cm of snow falling within an hour in some places and lying snow reaching 20-30 cm and possibly 40 cm in a few places by mid morning on Thursday. Strong easterly winds will lead to significant drifting of lying snow. The Met Office has issued the first red extreme weather warning in the current spell. It warns of heavy snow in central Scotland for later on Wednesday and Thursday. It says: Roads will become blocked by deep snow, with many stranded vehicles and passengers. Long delays and cancellations on bus, rail and air travel are expected. Some communities could become cut off for several days. Long interruptions to power supplies and other services. Red warnings are issued when extreme weather is expected. They mean the public should take action now to keep themselves safe. The Met Office has updated its amber weather warning for heavy snow for Scotland and north east England and ice and snow for much of the west country and Wales. It warns of 50cm of snow in parts of Dartmoor and Exmoor on Thursday. Here’s a breakdown London and South East England, South West England, Wales and West Midlands Widespread snow is expected to develop through Thursday afternoon and evening, accompanied by strong easterly winds, leading to drifting of lying snow in places. Around 10-20 cm is likely to fall quite widely, with the potential for up to 50 cm over parts of Dartmoor and Exmoor. As less cold air follows from the south, there is a chance of snow turning to freezing rain in places, with widespread icy stretched forming making driving conditions dangerous. Central Scotland, Tayside &amp; Fife, Grampian, Highlands &amp; Eilean Siar, North East England, North West England, SW Scotland, Lothian Borders, Strathclyde, Yorkshire &amp; Humber Snow showers will bring variable snow cover, but parts of northeast England and Scotland are expected to see the most frequent snow showers. During this time, 5-10 cm of snow is expected quite widely. Where showers become organised though, most likely across Scotland and over the hills of northern England, some places are likely to have an additional 15-25 cm of snow, locally as much as 40 cm. Strong winds will lead to drifting of snow and severe wind chill, while lightning could be an additional hazard, particularly near coasts. This warning has been updated to extend the area further west over parts of Scotland. Meanwhile in Cumbria, an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 has been recorded by the British Geological Survey. It was around “about 130 times smaller” than an earthquake in parts of South Wales and south-west England earlier this month. The epicentre, timed at 7.33am, was Mosser near Cockermouth. The AA said it has responded to 90 cases of drivers stuck in the snow this morning. Edmund King its president said: “The worst areas are Kent, East Anglia and North East but the problems are spreading. Drivers need to stick to the major routes where possible.” Traffic Scotland has a gritter tracker for any of those doubting attempts to try to keep the roads clear. Readers around the UK have been sharing images of the scenes where they are. Jasper Martens, 39, VP marketing for PensionBee in London was surprised to find the 7.37 train from Brentford to Waterloo empty: “Most seats are taken when I get on but I think the irregularity of the trains this morning put people off.” Composer James McBean, 25, sent in this picture from York: Student Bronwyn Molony, 23, Dublin, liked the “eternal optimism” of the owners of this cafe who put tables and chairs outside for customers. In Camberwell, sport PR consultant, Amelia Fisher-Starzynski, 38 and her dog Pancho have been enjoying the fresh snow: You can continue to share your images and video via GuardianWitness using the contribute buttons above. The A46 Lincoln bypass is looking pretty beastly. Police have urged drivers to be patient as snow ploughs try to clear the route. There is currently severe disruption on the rail network. Problems include: the closure of the west coast main line between Carlisle and Scotland; a broken down train on the Heathrow Express; delays or suspensions to all services to and from Glasgow; more suspensions of services in East Anglia; and disruption between Manchester and south Wales. The Irish Met office, Met Éireann, has issued a red weather alert for snow and ice covering Dublin, Kildare, Louth, Wicklow and Meath. A ski centre has been forced to close because of the heavy snow. Chatham Ski and Snowboard Centre in Gillingham, Kent, shut on Wednesday “due to weather conditions”. In a post on its Facebook page, it said: “Centre currently closed as we have an inaccessible car park and we have to be able to have emergency vehicle access and staff are struggling to get to site.” Diplomats in the Norwegian embassy in London and are smugly snug. The A11 between from Thetford to Norwich is blocked adding to the long list of road closures. Even a gritter lorry crashed on the A11 according to Heart Anglia News. Scottish Transport Minister Humza Yousaf has acknowledged that it will be “difficult day” on the roads and railways in Scotland, but he is looking on the bright side. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme, he said: “What we have seen is, which is a positive, is a reduction in the number of people travelling.” Yousaf said there had been a “number of issues” with HGVs and cars on the road, “particularly on higher ground”. He added: “People, I hope, are heeding the advice of not only avoiding travel, but also extra time, and planning extra time for their journey where they can.” With the amber weather warning in place for much of Scotland until 6pm on Thursday, Yousaf told people: “It might look OK as you open your curtains this morning if you are thinking of travelling out, but bear in mind progressively over the day the situation may get worse.” Glasgow has pretty much ground to a halt this morning as many morning commuters took heed of warnings to work from home after waking up to heavy snowfall. The snow is continuing to fall now with blustery winds whipping it off high rooftops and onto the street. There are reports that motorway driving is particularly treacherous this morning around Glasgow, with Police Scotland warning drivers to avoid driving if at all possible. More the 400 Scottish schools are closed this morning, with bus and rail networks also severely affected and Glasgow airport temporarily suspending operations while runways are cleared. There are currently plans to re-open at 9am. Members of the public sent a record number of alerts about people sleeping rough on the streets at the start of this freezing week, according to StreetLink. The service run by the charity Homeless Link, which connects people sleeping rough in England and Wales to local services, said it received more than 3,600 alerts over the 24-hour period starting on Monday morning. More than 2,000 of the alerts were about people sleeping rough in London. Matt Harrison, Director of StreetLink, comments: “Sleeping rough is dangerous and bad for people’s health at any time of year, but naturally it becomes an even greater concern in freezing weather conditions like those we are currently experiencing. “This record number of referrals is inspiring to see, and is the first step people can take to ensure individuals sleeping rough receive the support they need to get into the warm and move away from homelessness for good.” In case you missed it yesterday the Guardian published a series of photographs by Grey Hutton who has spent the winter photographing rough sleepers with a thermal imaging camera. Players had to help clear snow off the pitch last night at the Abax Stadium, during a League One football match between Peterborough and Walsall. The A1 is also closed in both directions at Adderston in Northumberland after two lorries got stuck in snow, according to Northumbria Police. More than 60 miles south a jacked knife lorry near Scotch Corner prompted another A1 closure. Well over a thousand schools are closed across the UK. The latest include: 36 in Middlesbrough 5 in Cornwall 351 in Essex 266 in Suffolk 23 in Leeds 35 in Stockton-on-Tees 120 in Aberdeenshire All schools in Glasgow All schools in West Lothian All schools in Renfrewshire Police in Leicestershire have warned drivers that the A1 is closed in both directions between the A1139 and A6121. Further up the A1 in Gateshead it’s more like a carpark than a road, according to Peter Grogan. And driving conditions are hazardous even when the traffic is moving. North Yorkshire county council insists that all the main roads were gritted. It may be easier to list the schools that are open in Scotland. Pity the children of Dundee ... Don’t try this at home ... Hundreds of schools are also closed in the England. The latest include: 363 in Norfolk 21 in Newcastle upon Tyne 44 in Cumbria 41 in Gateshead More than 60 in County Durham More than 100 in Essex Stuck inside for a second day running and going a bit mad? Distract and entertain yourself with our wonderful snow quiz. More school closures in Scotland. All schools and nurseries in Glasgow now added to the more than 400 already announced shut. Police and fire services across the UK have been kept busy overnight, with reports of stranded vehicles and crashes as several more centimetres of snow fell. Several roads were also closed during the night and into the morning due to treacherous driving conditions, the Press Association reports. Some roads in north-east England were left impassable. County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service tweeted that officers had been dealing with accidents in the “terrible weather”, including one involving a classic Mini which had crashed perilously close to a cliff. The A66 in Durham was closed between the A1M and the A685, while in Cambridgeshire, the A1 was shut both ways between the A1M and the A6121. Cambridgeshire Police said conditions had caused long tailbacks, and a snowplough under police escort was deployed to get traffic moving. The London Overground is being affected, expect delays on some lines. Seems the Irish Sun has decided to forgo the traditional front page weather shot. The Met Office in Ireland has issued a status red snow ice warning - its highest possible alert level - for Dublin, Kildare, Louth, Wicklow and Meath. Total snowfall up to midday Thursday may reach up to 25cm, it warns. According to the Ireland Meteorological Service heavy overnight snowfall has led to accumulations of snow between 5 and 10cm. “Snow showers will continue to occur during today and again tonight with further accumulations.” “Status red” warnings are the highest alert level available to Ireland’s weather service, and the Met’s website says the severe weather warnings “should be a comparatively rare event”. They imply “that recipients take action to protect themselves and/or their properties”. “This could be by moving their families out of the danger zone temporarily; by staying indoors; or by other specific actions aimed at mitigating the effects of the weather conditions,” the Irish Met says. Warning updates will be issued in “due course”. Things are looking complicated for travellers relying on Virgin trains on the east coast. So there has been some rather heavy snow in Ireland. Here is the view from Kildare: And Dublin Airport, where delays are happening: And Dublin ... The bad weather has affected the tube in London - the Central line is suspended between Epping and Woodford in both directions. The weather features heavily on the front pages again today. The Daily Star goes with “Snowmageddon”, The Express: “Killer freeze to get worse”, the Mirror: “Rage of the beast” and Metro has the simple splash: “The Beast”. London City airport has said there will be disruption to flights today because of snow overnight. Check with your airline before you travel. And there are more problems affecting Tfl: Your daily reminder to please take care on the roads. Some good travel news - it is situation normal at Gatwick. Bounds Green has turned white: The latest from Tfl: More than 400 schools across Scotland have been forced to shut as the extreme weather worsens. East Dunbartonshire Council, City of Edinburgh Council, Falkirk Council, Fife Council, Scottish Borders Council, Stirling Council and East Renfrewshire Council announced all schools in their areas will be closed on Wednesday due to potential of dangerous conditions. Transport minister Humza Yousaf said amber alerts for snow and freezing winds from the early hours of Wednesday could be changed to red for extreme weather in certain areas, with motorists urged not to travel. Yousaf told BBC Radio Scotland: “There is a possibility that the amber warning could be in some areas upgraded to a red. “That is a warning for snow that we have never seen since the modern system has come into place in Scotland, that’s what the Met Office tell me. “We are right on the cusp, we are at the strongest possible amber warning, and right on the cusp of potentially becoming a red. “That means a high likelihood of a high impact so that could be not just treacherous but frankly dangerous if you travel.” The Press Association reports that the entire east coast, central belt and as far west as Greenock will be hit – while the worst affected areas could see up to 40cm of snow and a wind chill of minus 10C. Police Scotland has urged motorists in affected areas not to travel by road, however other transport services are likely to be impacted. A red weather warning means a high potential of “widespread damage”, travel and power disruption and risk to life. Part of the A1 in Cambridgeshire is shut in both directions, between the A1M junction 17 and the A6121 at Tinwell. Cambridgeshire Police said traffic was at a standstill on both the north and southbound carriageways between Stamford and Wansford. A snowplough has been deployed under police escort to help get traffic moving. Highways England said the A66 had also been closed in Durham, between the A1M and the A685, while the A59 in North Yorkshire was closed westbound after the A61 between Harrogate and Skipton. Hello to the early risers out there and welcome back to our coverage of the freezing weather system that has been dubbed the ‘beast from the east’. After blanketing much of the country in snow and delivering below-zero temperatures on Tuesday, the extreme weather continues and is forecast to worsen in some parts of Britain. Here is the latest: Three weather warnings for snow are in place for Wednesday, with the south-east England, north-east England and Scotland set to be most affected. Heavy snow showers are expected up until around 10am hitting the East, South East and East Midlands, the Met Office said. This will bring up to 15cm of snow, which is likely to cause vehicles to become stranded and cause delays to road, rail and air travel, the Met Office said. Four people died in car crashes amid the heavy snow on Tuesday. An amber weather warning for snow is in place for parts of Scotland and the North East between 6am on Wednesday and 6pm on Thursday, which will bring up to 40cm of snow in some areas. A yellow warning covers most of the rest of England and northern Ireland all day and into the evening. Forecasters warned that long delays on bus, rail and air travel, plus disruption to phone networks, could occur. Strong winds will lead to drifting of snow and severe wind chill, the Met Office said. Highways England said drivers should reduce their speed and pack a snow kit of blankets, food, water and a shovel. From Thursday, forecasters predict that another weather system, Storm Emma, will bring blizzards, gales and sleet. Here is how things are looking this morning in Waterloo:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/06/alaska-shipyard-meditation-men-masculinity","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-06T11:00:11Z","webTitle":"The Alaska shipyard where the 'manliest men' meditate each morning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/06/alaska-shipyard-meditation-men-masculinity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/06/alaska-shipyard-meditation-men-masculinity","fields":{"headline":"The Alaska shipyard where the 'manliest men' meditate each morning","bodyText":"In the dark hours before sunrise, Vigor Alaska’s shipyard bosses circle up their crews. Dwarfed by vast steel segments of a new ferry, welders, painters and electricians twist their bodies. They roll their heads, shoulders and wrists. They ask about each other’s families. They celebrate pregnancies, raises and second chances. They jump. They lunge. They do push-ups and backbends. Seagulls call. Rain drizzles. Then – in jeans and work boots, sweatshirts and hardhats – they meditate. “I thought it was kind of weird,” said Irineo Munoz, 33, who started working for Vigor Alaska as a machinist in 2015. A former gang member from California, Munoz moved to Alaska after his release from prison. As public debate remains intense over gender roles in society and the workplace, Vigor’s morning routine defies gritty, masculine stereotypes associated with industrial labor. Crews meditate, stretch and socialize – on the clock – for a few moments at the start of each workday. Every Wednesday, around lunch time, they’re given more time to meditate. Smaller groups of employees get routine leadership training. Some are so committed to the transformative leadership style that they’re mentoring other employees in their off time, sharing interpersonal skills and self-mastery techniques. An hour of employee-led peer counseling is available, once a week, during the workday, paid. Munoz, who goes by Alfonso, has become a meditation convert and might just turn his shipyard gig into a career. “I am glad that they give me time to connect with my higher power.” Vigor Alaska said it hoped to instill “soft skills” in its industrial workforce, in pursuit of a more productive team with less turnover. Finding a good job and keeping it helps prevent recidivism, and Vigor considers itself a second-chance employer, forgoing background checks and giving felons - and anyone else who has struggled in life – a fresh start. In Vigor’s shipyard, strength is measured by more than physical power, big builds and heavy machines. Self-esteem and personal success also matter. “My co-workers are some of the manliest men you’ll find. The men of men,” said Scott Jackson, 36, a lifelong resident of the island, career firefighter and the shipyard safety officer. At 6ft 3in and 250lb, he is hard to miss as he walks the yard, tying down unsecured cylinders of compressed gas, remedying potential hazards that catch his eye. Skeptical of Vigor’s methods, he had heard rumors of guys standing around sharing feelings, chanting and doing “mushy, gushy” stuff. When he experienced men like himself tearing up as they spoke about life’s frustrations on and off the job, he was sold. “It helped me communicate in a more effective way rather than outbursts of feelings,” said Jackson, who had a self-described reputation for being stern and abrupt. He and other employees have said the skills they have learned at work have carried over into their home lives. They are not as stressed or frustrated, leaving them with more energy to put into family and free time. Trained on the job as an electrician before learning to weld, Chris Comstock, 37, arrived in Ketchikan seven years ago as a former meth addict with a life in a shambles. When the shipyard took him on as a general laborer, he said, he used anger to conceal his insecurity. Eventually, he learned real confidence did not come from bravado. After several promotions he now works in recruitment, screening potential new hires. He is also devoted to helping current employees overcome tough times. “We don’t see their trauma when they walk up to us,” said Comstock, a tall, energetic man quick to flash a smile. “We just see the person in front of us. And if they are in their trauma, chances are we consider them a problem. ‘They are a troublemaker. They didn’t show up for work. They smell like alcohol.’ On the surface that’s what we’re dealing with.” “I was a felon on probation and the day I got off of probation I started drinking,” said Marita Fuller, 27, a former heroin addict, single mom, and one of 22 women employed at the shipyard, outnumbered 10 to one by men. When Fuller relapsed, instead of firing her, the company helped her get into treatment and back on her feet. For her, morning meditation is a welcome pause before the bang-clang of pounded steel cuts through the buzz and hum of heavy equipment, before safety bells sound and welding sparks fly. “I focus on my breath, and I tell myself I’m going to have a good day,” she said. The practice also appears to be good for business. Staff turnover reduced by nearly half from 2016 to 2017, and safety has improved, according to Doug Ward, director of shipyard development. Passionate about personal mastery, Vigor Alaska’s general manager at the time, Mike Pearson, introduced the soft skills trainings in 2014 as a component of a “whole human model” approach to employee development. Pearson has since transferred to Vigor’s Seattle-based headquarters, where he has initiated similar practices. Yet for some shipyard employees, a good day means having no part of the “mushy gushy” stuff of feelings and trendy talk. “We should be out there getting something done,” said Bob Gilman, 64, a career journeyman and self-described “fix-it guy”. A shipyard employee since 1992, Gilman is frustrated about limits on vacation pay, a turnstile entrance he calls a “cattle guard”, and new paint lines showing where to walk – changes implemented after Vigor took over in 2012. Still, he acknowledges seeing some wisdom within the changes. Each morning after Gilman rolls out of bed, at home and before he heads to work, he stretches. “I think it’s probably a good thing. That meditation shit? Not so much,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/28/geoff-cousins-reveals-how-bill-shorten-wavered-on-adani-mine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T02:15:59Z","webTitle":"Geoff Cousins reveals how Bill Shorten wavered on Adani mine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/28/geoff-cousins-reveals-how-bill-shorten-wavered-on-adani-mine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/28/geoff-cousins-reveals-how-bill-shorten-wavered-on-adani-mine","fields":{"headline":"Geoff Cousins reveals how Bill Shorten wavered on Adani mine","bodyText":"The businessman and environmentalist Geoff Cousins is absolutely unequivocal. He said the federal Labor leader Bill Shorten called him, just before Christmas last year, looking for help in how Labor might strengthen its policy on the controversial Adani coalmine – and then Shorten followed up several times since, asking to be given more time to convince colleagues to support the shift in position. Shorten had previously reached out to Cousins, who served a term as president of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), to seek counsel about environmental policy matters. But just before Christmas, the phone call from Shorten was specifically about Adani. “He rang me not long before Christmas last year. He said ‘I want to change our position on Adani’,” Cousins told Guardian Australia on Wednesday. The Labor leader then asked whether Cousins would accompany him to north Queensland to help him work through the options. Shorten asked if the visit could be kept out of the media, that it not be a “photo opportunity”. “We had him many kilometres out to sea off Port Douglas, snorkelling, which was interesting to see – a leader of the opposition snorkelling around a very remote place,” Cousins said. “We had with us Professor Terry Hughes, one of the world’s leading experts on reef science, and he had laminated photographs of that exact spot over the last many years so Shorten could see, whilst he was snorkelling above, what that exact area looked like 10 years ago, five years ago, and so on. “He was visibly affected by that, he was in the water a good long while. It was quite a dramatic thing to see a senior politician actually prepared to look deeply into that.” Cousins said they then flew over the Adani mine site. “He was able to see first hand that there was no activity on that site or around it. “We then landed nearby and we had a distinguished groundwater scientist with us who was able to show him some remarkable natural springs, which have plants in them which don’t exist anywhere else on Earth, and discuss with him the impacts on groundwater and the artesian basin. “He had to walk a long way and spend a lot of time with people, and he did that extremely well. At the end of it all, Shorten said to me this was compelling material to see and hear.” Cousins gave him legal advice obtained by the ACF, and some other documentary material. That legal advice, seen by Guardian Australia, argues the commonwealth environment minister has discretion to revoke the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act approval for Adani “on at least two grounds”. The first ground would be “new information of the consecutive bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, indicating increased sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions” and the second would be “new information of the insufficiency of offsets for the endangered black-throated finch, indicating a threat to the continued survival of the species from the Carmichael project”. That same advice, from the Environmental Defenders’ Office in Queensland, argues the revocation would not trigger a sovereign risk issue, or leave the government exposed to a compensation claim from the company, because the power in section 145 of the EPBC Act to revoke an approval “is clear and unambiguous, and is essential for the minister to protect the environment from significant impacts not assessed prior to an approval being granted”. The advice says the power of revocation under section 145 of the EPBC Act “is not properly considered the acquisition of property and therefore does not attract the obligation to pay compensation”. Cousins said: “At the end of the trip, we sat down, and Shorten said ‘How do we crystallise this in essence?’ “I told him you’ve got to get to the point where you have a clear policy with action, and appropriate action in this case relates to a revoking of the licence. “Anything less than that is nice statements. What you need to say is the following: ‘When we are in government, if the evidence is as compelling as we presently believe it to be regarding the approval of the Adani mine, we will revoke the licence as allowed in the act.’ “Shorten said to me ‘I get it, I understand.’ “He said ‘I’m going to lead on that, I’m going to go forward, there comes a time when you need to lead and this is it.’” “I said to him, ‘That is great.’” Cousins said Shorten also gave him a specific timeframe for when he would publicly unveil Labor’s shift in position. The Labor leader told the businessman he intended to deliver a speech to the National Press Club in January, but wouldn’t flag this change in position there, because he wanted to make the announcement in Queensland. “He said by the end of the following week he would be back in Queensland and he would do it there,” Cousins said. “He said this in the airport conference room as we were leaving on another. That’s the way we parted. “Shorten rang me, I think, a week or so later and said this is proving more difficult that I thought, bringing my colleagues around, and I can’t meet that original timeframe, but I’m going to do it.” Cousins said in order to hold support for Labor’s pivot from the environment movement he had to telegraph an intention to revoke the licence in the event the environmental evidence stacked up. “Shorten said I understand that, I just need some time.” Cousins said they had the same conversation a couple of times after that, then “finally last week, I spoke to him and said I can no longer assure my colleagues in the environment movement that this is going to happen, because a lot of time has now passed”. “I said where are we, we are coming up to the first week of March – I said you’ve either got to give me an assurance Bill that this is going to happen, with a timeframe, or I’ve got to tell my colleagues this is not going to happen. “Shorten said to me I will call you on the weekend. This was last Friday. Shorten said he would advise definitely one way or another. “No phone call came.” Cousins said he believed Shorten was sincere in wanting to lead on Adani, “But that’s his problem. He’s got to do what he’s got to do and I’ve got to get on with our campaign.” The businessman then made the decision to be interviewed by the ABC on Tuesday night, outlining what he says occurred behind the scenes. Cousins timeline aligns with the Labor leader’s public statements between late January through to late February. In a statement to the ABC in response to the Cousins interview, a Shorten spokesman said Labor was deeply sceptical of the Adani mine proposal and if it doesn’t stack up commercially or environmentally it shouldn’t go ahead, but “Labor doesn’t rip up contracts and we don’t create sovereign risk”. Shorten has also this week updated the pecuniary interests register to confirm the Australian Conservation Foundation paid for charter flights in north Queensland and a tour of the Great Barrier Reef. Shorten’s office has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/28/wednesday-briefing-ex-trump-aide-makes-plea-deal-in-russia-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T06:32:27Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Ex-Trump aide makes plea deal in Russia inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/28/wednesday-briefing-ex-trump-aide-makes-plea-deal-in-russia-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/28/wednesday-briefing-ex-trump-aide-makes-plea-deal-in-russia-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: Ex-Trump aide makes plea deal in Russia inquiry","bodyText":"Top story: Rick Gates agrees to help Mueller investigation Hello – it’s Warren Murray and despite the snow this service is running on schedule. A raft of charges against Paul Manafort associate Rick Gates have been dropped after he agreed to help prosecutors in Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation. Nearly two dozen criminal fraud charges against Gates have been withdrawn as part of a plea agreement in which he is being shown leniency in exchange for his full cooperation. It adds to pressure on Manafort – Donald Trump’s former campaign manager – to cooperate with investigators or face Gates testifying against him and a potential long prison sentence. Meanwhile Trump’s son-in-law and aide Jared Kushner has had his top-security access downgraded – locking him out of sensitive intelligence discussions. Kushner failed to disclose on his security clearance forms dozens of contacts with foreign officials, including a meeting in December 2016 with Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the US, and another with the head of a Russian state-owned bank that had been sanctioned by the US. And the National Security Agency chief, Mike Rogers, says Donald Trump has given no orders to disrupt Russian meddling in US politics. Rogers told Congress: “Clearly, what we’ve done hasn’t been enough … I need a policy decision that indicates there is specific direction to do that.

But why not work with horses and dogs, rather than wild animals with complex needs? “We’re very capable of meeting those complex needs,” he argues, “and that’s been determined by a number of scientific studies into animal welfare in circuses.” Read Patrick Barkham’s feature and see what you think.

The earthquakestruck the Southern Highlands, Hela Province and the Western Highlands region early on Monday morning, but the extent of the devastation took days to emerge because of the area’s remoteness. Southern Highlands governor William Powi said on Wednesday that authorities in his region were still trying to assess the extent of the damage, and his people were traumatized, with the disaster causing “catastrophic havoc and destruction.” Uvenama Rova, secretary general of the PNG Red Cross, said he had confirmed reports of 11 deaths in the southern highlands region and five in Hela province, though his contacts in the affected regions reported “many” more deaths, entire villages buried under landslips, and mass grieving by affected communities. The Red Cross also said it knew of houses that had “sunk” in the town of Tari in Hela province, where concrete roads had also been destroyed, bridges snapped and the town’s hospital forced to turn away patients. Rova said according to information from ExxonMobil, which had mining operations in the affected regions, more than 10,000 families were affected by the quake. ExxonMobil has suspended its $19bn liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, the country’s biggest export earner, as dozens of aftershocks continue day and night, including a 5.7 quake on Tuesday afternoon, the US Geological Survey reported. Information has been hard to come by in the affected regions, as many roads have been blocked by major land slides, and essential services such as power and communications cut to remote villages, with further landslips expected as heavy rain fell overnight. “This is the largest earthquake we’ve ever had and its right in the centre of our country, and we don’t know how many casualties yet, we are still in the assessment stage,” said Rova. “But we do know schools and infrastructure are devastated, and normal activities within Tari and Mendi town have shut down.” A local blogger said there were reports of dozens or even hundreds of people killed in the Southern Highlands regions, though the Guardian and the Red Cross could not confirm those reports. Prime Minister Peter O’Neill and a team of ministers visited the affected areas on Tuesday, and an emergency meeting of the PNG cabinet was scheduled for Wednesday, with the government expected to declare a national state of emergency. Australia’s foreign minister Julie Bishop said her government had already received a request for help from PNG, and would be sending a RAAF C-130 to conduct aerial surveillance of the affected regions, and provide logistical support to the defence force. In a statement O’Neill said information was still coming in regarding the level of devastation and soldiers were on route to the affected regions. “There are communities that have suffered from this natural disaster, and we are sending our soldiers and other Government agencies to support our people in their time of need.” “We know that there have been houses lost, roads cut by land slips and disruption to services.” This article was amended on 1 March to correct the factual error that that the earthquake was the strongest to hit the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/28/number-of-ministers-able-to-approve-terrorism-control-orders-doubles","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T02:55:34Z","webTitle":"Number of ministers able to approve terrorism control orders doubles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/28/number-of-ministers-able-to-approve-terrorism-control-orders-doubles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/28/number-of-ministers-able-to-approve-terrorism-control-orders-doubles","fields":{"headline":"Number of ministers able to approve terrorism control orders doubles","bodyText":"The creation of Peter Dutton’s Department of Home Affairs has doubled the number of ministers who can approve terrorism control orders to four and given the power for the first time to an assistant minister, Alex Hawke. The Attorney General’s Department revealed the expansion of ministers who can approve orders for people to be subject to house arrest and personal surveillance at Senate estimates on Tuesday evening. The ministers who can now approve the orders are: the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton; the assistant minister for home affairs, Alex Hawke; the minister for citizenship and multicultural affairs, Alan Tudge; and the minister for law enforcement and cybersecurity, Angus Taylor. Labor’s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has warned the revelation shows the creation of the Department of Home Affairs has watered down checks and balances in counter-terrorism legislation and there is no clear basis for the ministers to exercise the authority. Control orders can stop people leaving Australia, communicating with certain people, accessing technology and force them to remain at a specified premises for a maximum of 12 hours within a 24-hour period, wear a tracking device, and report to a police station. Courts can issue control orders – on application by the Australian federal police and after ministerial approval – against any person “if it substantially helps prevent a terrorist attack”, meaning no conviction is required. Before the creation of Dutton’s mega-department the attorney general was responsible for authorising control orders, and the justice minister also had the power. On Tuesday, Sarah Chidgey, the first assistant secretary of the Attorney General’s Department, told estimates that authorising one minister “authorises all ministers in the portfolio to exercise that power”. She confirmed it was the first time an assistant minister could approve control orders. The assistant minister for science, jobs and innovation, Zed Seselja, said that Hawke had been “switched over” to the home affairs department and “wouldn’t have had the powers before”. Dreyfus told Guardian Australia: “Malcolm Turnbull has handed over control of the Department of Home Affairs to Peter Dutton, who has given three junior ministers, none of whom sit on the National Security Committee, the power to authorise counter-terrorism measures under the criminal code.” “These orders restrict the liberty of Australian citizens and, while a necessary tool to combat terrorism in specific circumstances, have only ever been issued by the attorney general in highly sensitive situations,” he said. “It is wrong that a junior minister like the minister for citizenship and multicultural affairs, who has no responsibility for these national security issues, should be given this significant power merely as a consequence of departmental restructuring.” Dreyfus said Labor supported “strong measures to combat terrorism” and had worked constructively to make national security legislation “more fit for purpose”. “In his inept haste to appease the right wing of the Liberal party, however, Mr Turnbull should not erode the important checks and balances in our national security system by downgrading approvals for sensitive counter-terrorism measures to junior ministers.” The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties opposes control orders but its president, Stephen Blanks, said if the state is to have such a power to detain people it “should be in the hands of the senior law officer, the attorney general”. “It is unsatisfactory for the power to approve this order to be in hands of junior ministers or even senior minister like Peter Dutton, who is not a lawyer,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/28/takata-airbag-recall-to-affect-more-than-2m-cars-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T00:28:11Z","webTitle":"Takata airbag recall to affect almost 4m cars in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/28/takata-airbag-recall-to-affect-more-than-2m-cars-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/28/takata-airbag-recall-to-affect-more-than-2m-cars-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Takata airbag recall to affect almost 4m cars in Australia","bodyText":"The Australian government is taking the unusual step of ordering a recall of nearly 4m cars fitted with Takata airbags which have caused deaths worldwide, including at least one death in Australia. The assistant minister to the treasurer, Michael Sukkar, announced the recall on Wednesday morning. “The sad thing about this is that this has been waiting in the wings for months and months,” Labor’s consumer affairs spokesman, Tim Hammond, told reporters in Canberra. “It is an indictment of this government that they have taken so long to pull the trigger on a compulsory recall.” Labor called for a recall in August last year. Manufacturers Ford, Holden and Volkswagen are among the carmakers that will be expected to urgently replace the airbags, which can explode. “We put the safety of Australians first and foremost at all times,” the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told reporters. The Australian compulsory recall is one of the largest of its kind and follows voluntary recalls by carmakers last year affecting 1.7 million vehicles. Some cars have already been voluntarily recalled by manufacturers, with Wednesday’s action concerning those that have yet to be fixed. An investigation by Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission found that Takata airbag inflators without a desiccant – a drying agent – or with a calcium sulphate desiccant had a design flaw. It said that over time the ammonium nitrate propellant could degrade, potentially leading to the airbags being deployed in error. Worldwide, at least 23 deaths and more than 230 serious injuries have been reported in connection with the Takata airbags, Sukkar said, with a man killed in Australia last year. Full details of the makes and models recalled can be found here on the ACCC website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/28/i-love-salvaging-items-from-the-street-thats-how-i-got-my-new-dryer","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T01:13:37Z","webTitle":"I love salvaging items from the street.

We didn’t use it very much but they’re handy to have if the domestic engineering has gone awry and you need to dry some socks or school uniforms in a hurry. The problem with the dryer was that the door wouldn’t close properly. My first instinct was to fix it but I could only get it to work if I propped against it an extremely heavy object like a bag of soil. Clearly not a long-term solution – I’ll just have to get a new one, I thought. But then a few days later I spotted a dryer that had been left outside someone’s house for the council to pick-up. I inspected it and it looked OK. It still had the cable and plug, which was promising, and it didn’t look broken ... So, I stuck it in the car and took it home. When I plugged it in, of course, it was dead. But a quick google of the model number revealed all manner of advice. I could see straight away just from the search results that this particular model has a recurring problem with the drive belt coming off. All I had to do, the chat boards told me, was unscrew a panel on the back and clip the belt back on. Pretty straightforward. And it worked. Even though the belt still occasionally comes off, it’s very satisfying to see it functioning. Buoyed by this triumph, I doubled down when I found a discarded microwave. The one in the kitchen was on the blink so I thought it might come in handy. It was clean and worked perfectly well. Not long afterwards, ours gave up the ghost for good so the “new” one was duly installed. I know I’m not the only person who finds pleasure in salvaging such things. Soon after moving into our house, we decided that an old wardrobe – itself rescued from the streets of London – was surplus to requirements and it was put out in the lane. It was gone the next morning. A few days later, our neighbour opened up his garage and I thought I spotted a familiar-looking piece of furniture: there was our old wardrobe in the corner of his garage. We have since teamed up on a salvaging project after his wife spotted an old table football set in the street when she was walking the dog late one Sunday night. We carried it back and after a bit of tightening up here, and a bit of WD40 there, you can have a decent game. Very satisfying. It’s not the money saved that I find so satisfying so much as the avoidance of waste. Waste has always bothered me, possibly a deep-seated result of having parents who grew up in the 1930s Depression. My dad was always fiddling about with things to fix them and so if he were alive today he would be amazed at what people chuck out. He’d barely be able to get down the street without collecting something because, in these times of super-abundance, the chucker-outers outnumber the salvagers.

I think we need better idiot control,” Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, who is wary of even modest reforms, repeated to reporters on Tuesday. The renewed debate over gun laws comes after Donald Trump urged Congress to take action following the murder of 17 students and faculty members at a Florida high school on Valentine’s Day. The president has suggested he would be open to strengthening background checks and threw his support behind a ban on bump stocks, a device that in effect converts semi-automatic guns into automatic weapons and was used by a gunman last year when he killed dozens of people at a country music concert in Las Vegas. On Wednesday, Trump plans to host a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House to discuss legislative alternatives. The meeting includes members from across the ideological divide who have introduced legislation after the Parkland shooting to address gun violence and school safety. Among the lawmakers invited to the meeting are John Cornyn, the Senate’s second-ranking Republican, and Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut and leading advocate for stricter gun laws. The two have introduced the only gun-control legislation so far with a serious chance of passing the Senate, a bill to improve reporting in the background check system. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who was jeered by student survivors during a televised town hall for not committing to refuse money from the National Rifle Association, will also attend, as will Republican congressman Steve Scalise, who remains a staunch supporter of gun rights after being shot by a gunman targeting a congressional baseball practice last summer. Scalise met with Parkland survivors earlier this week, and shared with them his own experience recovering in the wake of a mass shooting. Republicans in the US Senate, along with a handful of Democrats, blocked a bill in 2013 that would have implemented universal background checks in the aftermath of the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. A series of mass shootings in the subsequent years was similarly met with a resounding silence. In the Senate, a growing number of Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, are coalescing around a modest background checks bill, known as Fix Nics. The bill, co-sponsored by Cornyn and Murphy, would strengthen reporting and information sharing in the existing background checks system. The bill, however, does not address loopholes for private sales, family transfers and purchases at gun shows. “If we were to only debate the Fix Nics, we would be slamming the door in the face of all of these kids who are demanding change,” Murphy, the bill’s Democratic co-sponsor, told reporters. “Let’s be clear. The American public has hit a turning point. They are not going to accept incremental change.” Although Fix Nics is far more narrow in its scope than the universal background checks bill that was debated after Sandy Hook, it has already run into familiar obstacles – calling into question whether Congress is capable of passing any gun safety measures. Democrats have complained the bill is more symbolic than substantive, and have suggested that they could block the bill if Republicans refuse to allow debate on a broader set of gun safety measures, that would include legislation requiring background checks for virtually all gun sales. “Rather than just passing one narrow bill and moving on, we Democrats intend to push our Republican colleagues to have a real debate on gun safety,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, told reporters during a weekly press conference, just hours after a meeting with student survivors of the Parkland shooting. Speaking before Schumer, Cornyn said he was open to a structured debate on gun control “as long as we get to an outcome that leaves us something other than empty-handed”. He emphasized the push by Republicans to pass the modest bipartisan bill before the weekend. Conservatives in the House of Representatives are meanwhile demanding that the Fix Nics bill be paired with controversial concealed carry legislation that loosens gun restrictions by enabling gun owners with concealed-carry permits in their states to take their firearms across state lines. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, declined to say on Tuesday if he would be willing to decouple the two bills. Though a bill that combines the two measures would probably fail in the Senate. Well over half of House Democrats have signed on to legislation that would restore the expired “assault weapons” ban. The legislation, introduced by the Democratic congressmen David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Ted Deutch of Florida, would ban the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which is increasingly used to carry out mass shootings, including the Parkland massacre. However, there is little chance the legislation would be brought to a vote in the Republican-controlled House. And on Tuesday, Ryan said as much. “We shouldn’t be banning guns for law-abiding citizens,” he told reporters. “This is a passionate issue for the president,” Meadows said. “In personal conversations with him I would characterize his willingness and desire to get something done is unequal to anything I’ve seen since he’s been president. He wants us to act today and is not going to be very receptive to long delays and excuses.” Mark Meadows, the chairman of the influential House Freedom Caucus and an ally of the president, said the conservative group has been working in close coordination with the White House on a series of “fresh” proposals that would address safety on school campuses. But conservatives remain opposed to any legislative effort to impose new restrictions on the right to bear arms would be a nonstarter for his caucus – a view he said has been conveyed directly to the president. “When you think about the Trump voter, a lot of that is represented in the Freedom Caucus,” Meadows said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/feb/27/max-mosley-accused-by-daily-mail-of-publishing-racist-leaflet-in-1960s","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T22:07:56Z","webTitle":"Max Mosley accused by Daily Mail of publishing racist leaflet in 1960s","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/27/max-mosley-accused-by-daily-mail-of-publishing-racist-leaflet-in-1960s","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/feb/27/max-mosley-accused-by-daily-mail-of-publishing-racist-leaflet-in-1960s","fields":{"headline":"Max Mosley accused by Daily Mail of publishing racist leaflet in 1960s","bodyText":"Max Mosley, the privacy campaigner, has been accused of publishing a byelection campaign leaflet that linked immigrants with sexually transmitted disease, tuberculosis and leprosy. The pamphlet, supporting a candidate for his father Sir Oswald Mosley’s Union Movement in a 1961 parliamentary contest, was unearthed by the Daily Mail in archives in Manchester. The paper claims its discovery raises questions about evidence that Mosley gave under oath in a high court trial when he successfully sued the News of the World in 2008. Mosley has insisted that he did not recall the leaflet, and said he would not be deterred from his campaign for reforms to protect ordinary people from press abuses. The disclosure has also prompted questions for Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who has accepted £500,000 in donations to his office from Mosley. Asked in the 2008 trial about his political activities as a young man, Mosley acknowledged that he was the election agent for Union Movement candidate Walter Hesketh in the 1961 byelection in Moss Side. But he said it was “absolute nonsense” to suggest that he had put out leaflets alleging that coloured immigrants brought diseases with them. Pressed on whether the literature urged voters to “send blacks home”, he replied: “Not as I recall.” The election leaflet states that it was “published by Max Mosley”. It includes the warning: “Protect your health. There is no medical check on immigration. Tuberculosis, VD and other terrible diseases like leprosy are on the increase. Coloured immigration threatens your children’s health.” It also states: “If enough people vote for me in this election, the government … will be sending coloured immigrants home, instead of bringing more in” and urges voters to “let us give the coloured people a fair deal by sending them back to good jobs and good wages at home in Jamaica”. The document has come to light as Mosley pursues an effort to prevent newspapers from referring to the sex party reported in the News of the World, which prompted the 2008 court case. The former Formula One head has campaigned for tighter press regulation since the now defunct Sunday tabloid wrongly reported that the party was “Nazi-themed”, and has donated funds to regulator Impress. Asked by Channel 4 News about the line “coloured immigration threatens your children’s health”, Mosley said: “I think that probably is racist. I will concede that completely.” But he said he had “no reason to apologise to anyone”, and added: “This was a statement in a leaflet which I am not even sure is genuine, which would never reflect my view. It would not reflect my view then or now because I simply wouldn’t dream of insulting people.” He went on: “If that leaflet is genuine, I am responsible for it and it shouldn’t have been issued. I have never been a racist, I am not a racist, never will be a racist.” Mosley told the Press Association: “I do not recall the leaflet referred to, which was allegedly issued 56 years ago. I said so in court and challenged lawyers for the News of the World to produce it, which they failed to do. I obviously would not have done that if I knew of its existence. My record in motorsport demonstrates that I do not tolerate racism and, like most people, my political views have changed over time. “It appears that the historical investigation pursued by the Daily Mail is yet another misconceived attempt to intimidate and deter me. I will continue to campaign for the vital reforms needed to protect ordinary people against the bullying of newspapers like the Daily Mail.” In response to the leaflet, Watson told the Mail: “My views on press regulation are well known and have not changed. The views expressed by Max as a young man are not the views he holds now, just as the Rothermere family no longer uses its newspapers to support fascism.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/27/crewe-ignored-police-advice-to-move-on-barry-bennell","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T20:43:10Z","webTitle":"Crewe ignored police advice in late 1980s to ‘move on’ Barry Bennell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/27/crewe-ignored-police-advice-to-move-on-barry-bennell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/27/crewe-ignored-police-advice-to-move-on-barry-bennell","fields":{"headline":"Crewe ignored police advice in late 1980s to ‘move on’ Barry Bennell","bodyText":"Crewe Alexandra were advised by the police to sever their ties with Barry Bennell but continued to employ him for a number of years despite being warned they should “move him on”, the Football Association’s independent inquiry into the sexual-abuse scandal has been told. According to evidence seen by the Guardian, the club’s then chairman, Norman Rowlinson, decided to consult the police after he and other directors were warned in the late‑1980s that there had been a specific complaint about their youth-team coach. Rowlinson, who died in 2006, is said to have been so concerned during a specially convened meeting of Crewe’s directors that he broke off from their talks to make a telephone call before returning to explain that he had asked the police to run a check on Bennell. Crewe had been warned they were employing a possible paedophile, the inquiry has been told, and Rowlinson is said to have told his colleagues: “I’ve just spoken to the chief superintendent. They’ve got nothing on him but suggest that we move him on.” Bennell was employed until 1992 when there are contrasting reports about why he left Gresty Road. Crewe’s account is that it was because of football-related reasons. Bennell has said there was a complaint against him and the Guardian has been told he had gone within two days of being challenged by a group of parents. The inquiry, led by Clive Sheldon QC, is due to be published this year and has also heard that one senior member of Crewe’s staff replied “Well, surprise me ...” when it got back to the club that there were grave concerns about Bennell’s behaviour. Bennell is serving a 30-year prison sentence after being convicted of 50 specimen charges relating to junior players from Crewe and Manchester City from 1979 to 1990. Bennell had become so notorious, according to evidence supplied to the inquiry, the father of one boy, a future professional, approached Crewe when his son was offered coaching to explain he was “very apprehensive” about letting him train with the club. The father was said to request that Bennell did not approach his son. Crewe insist they never received any warnings and their director of football, Dario Gradi, currently suspended by the FA, has said there was “never any cause for concern” even though Bennell’s victims have talked about youth-team players knowing them as “the paedophile lads” and extraordinary levels of rumour and innuendo within the club and throughout the sport. At a fans’ forum on Monday the chairman, John Bowler, who has been on the board since 1979, was asked to respond to allegations from the former managing director Hamilton Smith that Crewe had been warned about Bennell and were guilty of a cover‑up. Bowler declined to comment and has never responded to Smith branding him a “lying bastard” in the Channel 4 documentary Football’s Wall of Silence. Gradi, whose association with Crewe goes back to 1983 and includes more than 1,200 games as manager, has always denied any wrongdoing. Yet he and Crewe are facing more questions after reports that the NSPCC was informed in 2011 that a member of staff was asked to wipe Gradi’s computer of pornography, with suggestions that a group of Irish under-13 players who were staying at his house had seen it. A BBC investigation alleged that the former employee decided to go to the NSPCC, as well as later speaking to Cheshire police, to report what had happened. The man told the NSPCC he raised his concerns with Bowler, who was said to have dismissed Gradi’s behaviour as “quirky and nothing more”. The former employee, who has not been named, was said to have contacted the NSPCC again in November 2016 after one of Bennell’s victims, Andy Woodward, waived his anonymity to speak to the Guardian and instigate what the FA’s chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as the biggest crisis he can remember in the sport. In a statement Cheshire police said: “In December 2012 Cheshire police received reports regarding concerns about material on a computer. Following inquiries, it was established that no criminal activity had taken place. The person who made the report was updated at the time.” Crewe have told the Guardian they are not going to comment. The BBC’s information is that the former employee has approached the Sheldon inquiry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/feb/28/lewis-gilbert-master-craftsman-bond-working-class-trilogy-alfie","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Lewis Gilbert: master craftsman who went beyond Bond with a 'working class trilogy' | Peter Bradshaw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/28/lewis-gilbert-master-craftsman-bond-working-class-trilogy-alfie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/28/lewis-gilbert-master-craftsman-bond-working-class-trilogy-alfie","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Gilbert: master craftsman who went beyond Bond with a 'working class trilogy'","bodyText":"Lewis Gilbert was the brilliant master-craftsman of the postwar cinema, whose staggeringly prolific career epitomised the technique, professionalism and dash that made British moviemaking tradecraft respected everywhere. He started in wartime film units and the British studio system, making war movies with tremendous elan and punch, like Reach for the Sky and Sink the Bismarck!, and also comedies and character dramas like The Admirable Crichton and The Greengage Summer, which were robustly confident and terrifically watchable. He also famously took the helm of three very successful Bond movies, one with Connery, two with Moore: You Only Live Twice, The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker, maintaining that uniquely British brand with wit and clout. But Gilbert was a lot more than a safe pair of hands: he created what was known as the “working class trilogy” of British cinema, and in doing so put himself at the vanguard of this country’s social revolution. He made Alfie (1966), Educating Rita (1983) and then Shirley Valentine (1989) – and this third film revived his elegant comic trick of getting the lead character to break the fourth wall and speak directly to the camera. When he got Alfie to stop what he was doing and take the audience into his confidence, it was of course a mannerism which had been current in the theatre for hundreds of years. But it was unusual in the cinema, and even now there are very few film-makers or actors who can carry it off – certainly the remake with Jude Law never had anything like the kind of freewheeling, subversive insolence. Because when Lewis Gilbert got Alfie speaking directly into the camera, it was a political act. He was speaking up, talking back. His was a working-class voice which presumed to address the audience from a position of strength, as opposed to just being cheeky, getting into trouble, and finally learning a lesson. Lewis Gilbert’s Alfie (author Bill Naughton adapted the script from his own stage-play) was sexy in a way that Billy Liar and Jim Dixon weren’t. And Alfie itself was probably the nearest that British cinema ever came instinctively to moving away from Free Cinema and the kitchen sink to the world of the French New Wave. With Educating Rita (by Willy Russell) Lewis Gilbert probably gave Michael Caine the best role of his career, and superbly handled the relationship between Caine’s bearded, disillusioned OU lecturer Frank Bryant and Julie Walters’s wonderfully funny student Rita, looking for a glimpse of a better life, the life of the mind, before she succumbs to her destiny of marriage and motherhood. Their relationship is governed by class, and takes on the theme of self-betterment through education. Rita’s belief in this is naïve in one sense, although she has an idealism and integrity that Frank realises he has gradually permitted to wither in himself. And it is invigoratingly concerned with aspiration and success: themes which were interestingly revived in Billy Elliot, a film in which Julie Walters’s presence carried the sense-memory of Rita. And then, Shirley Valentine was the third great figure (also written by Willy Russell), almost an evolutionary step further from Alfie and Rita. She is the older woman, played with breezy Scouse chutzpah by Pauline Collins who takes off on holiday and rediscovers in herself an appetite for the fun, laughs and sex that she wasn’t getting on the home front. Again, Gilbert stage-manages Shirley’s slyly murmured confidences to the audience about all the daft things men would say in an attempt to have their wicked way. Tom Conti’s suave waiter affecting to be entranced by her stretch marks is something she sees through but likes at the same time. Shirley Valentine is perhaps the ancestor of the escapist golden-years comedies like the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, but with far more of an edge. His Stepping Out, with Liza Minnelli leading a dance class, recapitulated many of the themes of Educating Rita – with the same gutsy, never-say-die ethos. Lewis Gilbert was a powerhouse of invention and movie showmanship."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/27/hope-hicks-trump-russia-house-committee","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T19:27:27Z","webTitle":"'We got Bannoned': Trump aide Hope Hicks frustrates House panel on Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/hope-hicks-trump-russia-house-committee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/hope-hicks-trump-russia-house-committee","fields":{"headline":"'We got Bannoned': Trump aide Hope Hicks frustrates House panel on Russia","bodyText":"A member of the House intelligence committee said “We got Bannoned” on Tuesday, after a closed-door interview with Hope Hicks, a key aide to Donald Trump, as part of the panel’s Russia investigation. Bloomberg reported that Denny Heck, a Washington Democrat, invoked Bannon, Trump’s former campaign manager and White House strategist, who refused to answer some questions in front of the panel. The House is now considering whether to hold Bannon in contempt. A Republican, Chris Stewart of Utah, said Hicks would not answer questions about events and conversations since Trump took office. Hicks, Trump’s communications director, arrived on Capitol Hill after 10am through a rear entrance to the committee’s interview space. She did not answer shouted questions from reporters. The panel is investigating contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russia, as is special counsel Robert Mueller. Hicks has been interviewed by Mueller. As one of Trump’s closest aides, she is a key eyewitness to his actions over the past several years. She was his spokeswoman during the 2016 campaign. Trump has denied any collusion with Russians interfering in the US election. In the hours before Hicks’ arrival the president tweeted several times, quoting cable news commentators who said they had not seen evidence of collusion. One tweet encouraged investigations of his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton. A last tweet simply said “WITCH HUNT!” In the White House press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Sanders denied any collusion between Trump aides and Russia and said of Hicks’ appearance: “We are not going to comment on any individual’s specific interactions with the committee.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-public-transport-end-austerity-trust-the-state","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T18:39:34Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on public transport: end austerity, trust the state | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-public-transport-end-austerity-trust-the-state","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-public-transport-end-austerity-trust-the-state","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on public transport: end austerity, trust the state","bodyText":"Northamptonshire county council’s bankruptcy was made in Downing Street. Up and down the country there are increasing numbers of local examples of the ruinous effects of austerity. Each is unhappy in its own way but, when aggregated together, they reveal how an entire social infrastructure is being shredded. In the case of Northamptonshire, the most eye-catching measure is that all bus subsidies will be cut on Wednesday. This does not mean buses will stop running across 900 square miles in the east Midlands, but it will almost certainly see many socially needed routes scrapped. Bus services paid for by councils in England and Wales are mostly used by older people, schoolchildren, and the less well-off. It is these groups that will end up marooned and isolated, with few other options for getting around. Northamptonshire is just the tip of the iceberg: cuts to public funding have helped shrink Britain’s bus network to levels last seen in the late 1980s. The National Audit Office estimated that bus budgets have been slashed by 40% since 2010. Routes have been either scrapped or shortened and timetables have been reduced. At the same time bus fares have gone up. The austerity of David Cameron and Theresa May has meant bus services faced death by a thousand cuts. Unlike the railways, buses are fading silently. Despite more journeys being made on buses than trains outside of London, they rarely appear on Westminster’s radar. Rail commuters are voters who politicians understand: largely middle class and found in marginal constituencies. Bus users are numerous, but constitute a less politically noisy base. Britain is the most centralised country in the western world. The Treasury hijacked devolution as a way of palming off responsibility to local councils for making cuts, while keeping the power to make policy. There’s plenty of evidence to suggest ministers need to start spending and reverse course – not least because Brexit is as much a revolt against Westminster as against Brussels. Connectivity is key to resolving this. England’s coastal areas have among the worst outcomes for social mobility. One of the reasons is that these areas, over a fifth of England’s local authorities, were “not served well enough by public transport”, in the words of a government report. Ever since the mid-1980s when the bus industry was deregulated, except in London, there have been calls to re-regulate it. With yearly revenues of £5.6bn, this would be no small feat. Ministers have granted powers to elected mayors to undo the worst excesses of bus deregulation. But in bypassing councils, they signalled a lack of confidence in them. Local authorities wanted to set up municipal companies that could buy new buses and pay back the investment through ticket sales. The Tories mistakenly blocked this. They should stop wearing ideological blinkers about the state. Municipal bus companies are innovative. Letting more exist would defuse some criticism about a chaotic, fragmented bus system. But it would also show that after the divisive vote to leave the EU, Westminster politicians recognised the country was far too centralised and wanted to reach out to those who felt left behind. That would be something to put on the side of a Brexit bus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/01/the-breeders-all-nerve-review-kim-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T12:00:20Z","webTitle":"The Breeders: All Nerve review – reunited rockers get dark and deep | Alexis Petridis' album of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/01/the-breeders-all-nerve-review-kim-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/01/the-breeders-all-nerve-review-kim-deal","fields":{"headline":"The Breeders: All Nerve review – reunited rockers get dark and deep","bodyText":"A sense of “What if?” hangs over the career of Kim Deal. It seems a strange thing to say about someone who’s been a member of not one but two seminal rock bands, an alt-rock figure so beloved that journalists unironically open profiles of her with the words “It is not possible to overstate the importance of Kim Deal” and to whom everyone from Kurt Cobain to Courtney Barnett has paid homage. Nevertheless – what if Pixies frontman Black Francis had acceded to Cobain’s public suggestion that he “allow” Deal to write more songs for the band? The Pixies’ later albums would have been bolstered by the material that Deal used in her side project the Breeders, the band’s internal strife might have pacified, and arguably the most influential rock band of the 80s might have ended up as commercially successful as they were critically acclaimed. And what if the Breeders hadn’t dissolved in dissolute chaos after their second album, 1993’s Last Splash, sold a million copies? Who’s to say they wouldn’t have ascended to the kind of perennial arena-packing success enjoyed by some of their peers? They certainly had the songs, and in Deal a frontwoman so self-possessed and charismatic she didn’t need to do anything much beyond get on stage in her everyday clothes to magnetise an audience. Instead, there was rehab, a lineup that one member left “for my own mental health”, sporadic, understated subsequent albums – 2002’s minimal Title TK and 2008’s introspective Mountain Battles – and the consolation that, as Breeders producer Steve Albini noted, the “whole deal could have turned out infinitely worse”: among their contemporary graduates from alt-rock cultdom to platinum success were Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Now, the lineup that made Last Splash has reassembled, bassist Josephine Wiggs marking her return with an icy, perfectly enunciated vocal on MetaGoth, her voice at odds with the warm, husky intimacy of Kim and Kelley Deal’s harmonies. It’s tempting to say that the lost years hang heavy over some of the songs on All Nerve – “I hit the hull, oh God, I hit them all, you don’t know how far I would go,” run the lyrics of the title track – but equally, it’s a brave listener who starts making confident assertions about what any of the songs on All Nerve are about. From the Pixies 1988 classic Gigantic onwards, Deal has specialised in lyrics that manage to be both haunting and elusive, and All Nerve is no exception, throwing up far more questions than answers. Do the words that float over the lulling, hypnotic bassline and torpid guitars make Walking With the Killer (a song Deal first recorded solo five years ago) a latter-day murder ballad told from the viewpoint of the victim – “I didn’t know it was my night to die, but it really was” – or something less straightforward, more metaphorical? Is Blues at the Acropolis really a stern bewailing of the lack of reverence shown by tourists for ancient monuments? What’s going on in Skinhead #2, which opens with the simultaneously striking and baffling line: “I need spit to crush these beetles on my lips”? All this is set to music that is rich and deep and repays repeated listening. All the Breeders’ trademarks are here: the guitar lines that sit at unexpected angles to the chords, the shifts from light to dark, the curious sense of humour. (“I always struggle with the right word,” sings Deal on Wait in the Car, before proving her point by mewing like a cat.) But there’s nothing as sunlit and immediate as Last Splash’s Divine Hammer. All Nerve lasts barely half an hour, which means the odd longueur stands out – a cover of Amon Düül II’s Archangel Thunderbird is fun rather than essential, although it’s certainly intriguing how perfectly Pixies-like the track’s ancient, angular krautrock riff is. The album isn’t intense in the “raging guitar noise” sense of the phrase. Songs frequently unravel into stillness before gathering themselves up again, and there’s something tense and deliberately contained about even the brashest stuff here. You expect opener Nervous Mary to explode cathartically, but it never does; Spacewoman switches from quiet to loud in patent style, but does so at an oozing pace. The best material might be the most spectral: Walking With the Killer and the beautiful, barely-there shimmer of Dawn: Making An Effort. But there’s a real concentrated power about its sound, which is intimate and raw, befitting its title: the vocals close-miked, the band recorded in such a way that they sound as if they’re playing live a few feet away from you. For an album full of space and silence, it’s remarkably relentless and weighty – maybe not the stuff of arena-packing success after all, but formidable enough that, while it plays, what ifs seem beside the point. This week Alexis listened to Tracey Thorn: Sister (Andrew Weatherall Remix) Assisted by the vocals of Corinne Bailey Rae, Weatherall turns the standout track from Tracey Thorn’s new album into ghostly, dubbed-out slow motion electro-disco."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/28/the-legume-boom-how-we-went-nuts-for-posh-peanut-butter","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T16:35:29Z","webTitle":"The legume boom: how we went nuts for posh peanut butter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/28/the-legume-boom-how-we-went-nuts-for-posh-peanut-butter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/28/the-legume-boom-how-we-went-nuts-for-posh-peanut-butter","fields":{"headline":"The legume boom: how we went nuts for posh peanut butter","bodyText":"In 2012, Stuart Franklin and his wife Kathryn returned to the UK after seven years in New Zealand.

Not the kind you can get in any corner shop, supermarket or newsagent, laden with palm oil, sugar and preservatives; it was the pure stuff they craved, made solely from peanuts. Such a thing is big business in Australia and New Zealand, early adopters of peanut butter. In the UK six years ago, it was a scarce commodity. Knowing that there is little more to making peanut butter than roasting peanuts and grinding them to a pulp, they began making their own in their kitchen. Friends and family were grateful recipients of any surplus and their reactions provided the encouragement the Franklins needed to set up another company. Proper Nutty was founded in 2014. From a rented factory space in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, the pair make two varieties of peanut butter – one slightly salted, one unsalted – and sell directly to customers from their website and supply independent retailers all over the UK, as well as about 50 branches of Morrisons in the Yorkshire area. They currently make 1,000 jars a day (a day that regularly starts at 4am and ends at 7pm). Demand, however, is such that by the end of March, Proper Nutty will have moved to a new factory just outside Huddersfield, nine miles from the current unit, where production will increase to 1,000 jars of peanut butter an hour. Proper Nutty’s expansion is evidence of a wider peanut-butter boom in the UK. It has been on sale here since the 1930s, with Sun-Pat – today one of the UK’s biggest brands, making 4,510 tonnes a year – launched in 1946. In the days of rationing, peanut butter was a cheap protein source for children and a guilty pleasure for adults, but it wasn’t long before things began to change. In 2016, Whole Earth became Britain’s top-selling brand. The “healthy” peanut butter-maker doesn’t add sugar, although it does use sustainable palm oil. The brand was created by American brothers Craig and Gregory Sams in 1967, who operated out of their forward-thinking London organic shop, Seeds. Our favourite way to consume peanut butter remains spreading it on toast, but it has become popular in sandwiches, dropped into smoothies, in baking and, increasingly, eaten straight from the jar or smeared on the end of a banana ahead of a session in the gym. The market for spreads is worth just over £512m a year, according to figures compiled by Kantar Worldpanel. Honey is out in front, with a 25% market share, while jam (20%) clings on to its second spot for dear life. If sales of peanut butter continue at their current rate (2017 saw a 17.1% increase on the previous year) and sales of jam continue to dip – down 1.5% on 2016 – peanut butter will overtake preserves this time next year. Peanut butter’s sales march is no flash in the pan, says Franklin. “We’ve seen double-digit growth for almost 10 years now, which is one of the reasons we’re investing in the new factory. The market for artisanal, pure peanut butter was in its infancy 10 years ago. That’s why we started our business – we couldn’t find what we wanted on the shelves anywhere.” Where nutritionists once warned us to be wary of fat, more contemporary thinking has sugar as the enemy. Little surprise, then, that jam, marmalade and, in particular, curd – down almost 10% last year – are falling down the menu. “Five years ago fat was demonised, now it’s sugar,” says Dr Annie Gray, food historian, BBC presenter and author of The Greedy Queen: Eating With Victoria. “Curd combines both, which is, of course, why it’s absolutely delicious, but also why it is slipping out of fashion.” It is this turnaround by the nutritional community that helps explain peanut butter’s sales boost. Among fitness heads, peanut butter is treated as something of a wonder substance, high in monounsaturated fats, which have been proven to help lower cholesterol, reduce heart disease and lower blood pressure. Sales of sports nutrition products in the UK have gone up even faster than those of peanut butter, with the total market worth almost £800m in 2017, double what it was in 2012. Peanut butter manufacturers, noticing their product was being swallowed up by calorie-hungry runners and the like, reacted with marketing language designed to attract even more. Kirstie Hawkins, brand controller of Whole Earth peanut butter, says the biggest growth area for the company has been its 1kg tub, which is particularly popular with athletes, while Franklin says many of the inquiries he gets are from bodybuilders looking to buy Proper Nutty by the case. If the lucrative peanut butter market is a new thing, the gooey substance itself is anything but. There is evidence the Aztecs used to roast and mash peanuts into a rough paste as far back as the 14th century. Peanut butter as we now know it, however, doesn’t go back quite that far. Its invention can be credited to a number of people. Contrary to popular belief, botanist and inventor George Washington Carver was not one of them. He did, however, come up with more than 100 different products using peanuts including shampoo, chilli sauce, shaving cream and glue, although none became successful. Canadian pharmacist Marcellus Gilmore Edson got the ball rolling. In 1884, he patented a process for milling legumes between two heated surfaces and mixing with sugar to make a peanut paste, although it was never used in a commercial product. In the US in 1895, Dr John Harvey Kellogg, of Corn Flakes fame, wanted to make a more digestable substitute for butter. He found that boiling the peanuts rather than roasting them achieved that result, and he marketed his product as a protein replacement for patients without any teeth. In his Good Health magazine of January 1896, Kellogg was the first person to use the term “nut butter”. He went on to include the paste in numerous recipes, although stopped short of actually inventing peanut butter. From that same year, the Atlantic Peanut Refinery’s trademark for “German Peanut-Butter” is the earliest on record, while the Lane Bros Health Co became the first to sell straightforward peanut butter a year later in 1897. In the decade that followed, many more firms popped up selling types of peanut butter, notably Krema, founded in 1908, which remains the oldest peanut butter-maker still in operation. In 1922, the same year the National Peanut Butter Manufacturers Association was founded, Joseph L Rosefield invented a process enabling peanut butter to stay fresh for a year and, a decade later, founded Skippy, today the world’s second-largest manufacturer, behind Jif. In the US, a nation that has seen two peanut farmers elected president (Thomas Jefferson and Jimmy Carter), peanut butter sales reached $2bn (£1.45bn) in 2017, with 90% of US households eating it. In the UK, peanut butter is consumed by about 40% of households, meaning there is still considerable room for growth. Gray believes that peanut butter’s success, while a symbol of our growing interest in nutrition, is also indicative of the infantilisation of our choices and our seemingly never-ending obsession with American culture. However, she says that the “hipsterfication” of peanut butter, with its lurch toward an organic, high-quality product, can only be a good thing, particularly if it drives customers to small, independent companies. “The more options people have, the better,” she says. “Or possibly, the more confusing. What’s happening now is like when companies realised you could make adult chocolate and there was a boom in chocolate flavoured with all these beautiful, grownup things, containing 100% cocoa and so on. Manufacturers have been very clever in identifying new markets and expanding into them, but we all benefit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/28/dossier-on-sexual-misconduct-in-labour-party-sent-to-corbyn","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T00:01:48Z","webTitle":"Dossier on sexual misconduct in Labour party sent to Corbyn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/28/dossier-on-sexual-misconduct-in-labour-party-sent-to-corbyn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/28/dossier-on-sexual-misconduct-in-labour-party-sent-to-corbyn","fields":{"headline":"Dossier on sexual misconduct in Labour party sent to Corbyn","bodyText":"A dossier of 43 stories of harassment, abuse and sexual violence against women at all levels of the Labour party has been submitted to Jeremy Corbyn’s office, prompting calls for the party to reform the way it deals with claims of sexual misconduct. Women who submitted their stories anonymously to the Labourtoo site over a two-month period gave examples of being raped, serially groped, facing inappropriate sexual comments and being urged not to report what had happened. The incidents, which took place in political settings ranging from Westminster to all around the country, also highlighted a number of weaknesses in the way Labour has handled the issue in the past. Among themes that emerged from the stories, which the Labour party has said will be urgently fed into ongoing reviews, were: that problem individuals are “common knowledge” but no action is taken against them. there is low or no confidence in the party’s formal complaint or disciplinary processes. women felt there was a lack of support in taking up their cases, with some actively dissuaded from doing so. The Labour website, inspired by the #metoo movement, was set up anonymously by six Labour women involved in the party at different levels and has the support of the chair of the women’s parliamentary Labour party (PLP), Jess Phillips. “I find the report horrifying and I fully support the recommendations being made,” she said. “The women’s PLP have also pushed the party and leadership to consider a completely independent investigation system that means there is no fear or favour for people coming forward. At the moment the NEC is the arbiter and it is too open to political persuasion.” The report was handed to Corbyn’s office and to senior figures in Labour HQ ahead of a parliamentary debate on proposals to tackle harassment from a cross-party group led by the Tory leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom. It comes alongside Comres polling for the Young Women’s Trust charity, which lays bare the scale of the problem across Westminster, revealing that 24% of MPs say they have been personally aware of sexual harassment or abuse happening in parliament. In the poll of more than 150 MPs, 89% of the women and 58% of the men said that sexism still exists in parliament. The Labour report includes examples from stories that provide evidence of each of the themes outlined. In a section about how problem individuals are known about, “councillor who was very well known to senior figures in the local Labour party for being a serial groper of women” is mentioned. A woman described the man placing his hands around her hips and placing Labour stickers on women in such a way “that meant he could touch her breasts”. Another described being at a party where an elderly councillor trapped her at the bar and began “rubbing his groin against my back”. When the researcher told others, the response was “well that’s just who he is”. On low confidence in the system, the group described an intern who said she was sexually harassed by a married male MP at a Christmas party, who was drunk and began “stroking my arm”. But she felt unable to report it as the people whom she could tell would want to protect him. In another case, an allegation of rape and sexual assault led to someone being asked to resign from his position quietly. “He got away with his reputation intact,” said the woman, calling it unacceptable and essentially a cover-up. Another woman said “no one cared” about a claim of rape, while in a separate case “lewd, inappropriate sexual comments” made in front of other male party members were brushed off. The report suggested a lack of safeguards for women in dangerous situations, with an MP “stroking” a woman’s leg at a constituency Labour party fundraiser and then getting into the car she was travelling home in. Another story described a drunk senior party official pushing a woman on to a bed and groping her. The Labourtoo group, which asked for women in the party to submit their stories, issued a statement saying that while they were prepared for what they found “we found it genuinely distressing to read about this level of inexcusable behaviour taking place within the Labour party”. They said harassment and abuse weren’t restricted to the corridors of Westminster, but took place at all levels, and that women needed the confidence to report their experiences. “We need a system that is not open to political bias or interference from friends and allies”. The recommendations include a fully independent complaints process, with panels made up of people with no link to the party, compulsory training for all staff, comprehensive policies to cover bullying, harassment, domestic abuse, sexual assault and more, and a confidentiality process. It also suggests mandatory DBS checks for those seeking selection as candidates. Labour sources said party procedures had been strengthened, including a hotline for members to report complaints and an independent specialist organisation to offer confidential advice to victims. But they said these shocking stories would help boost understanding and pave the way for further improvements. Pointing out that harassment and misogyny were widespread problems in society, they said that Labour was committed to overcoming them both within the party and more widely. While the anonymous reports will not trigger direct action, the party urged those who have suffered harassment or discrimination to make a complaint so they can be fully investigated. “Labour is committed to continually improving our procedures, which is why Karon Monaghan QC has been appointed to make an independent assessment of the party’s current procedures for dealing with sexual harassment and an independent specialist organisation is conducting an audit into the procedures from the perspective of those who have experienced sexual harassment,” said a spokeswoman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/02/james-wood-interview-upstate","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T12:00:07Z","webTitle":"Critic turned author James Wood: ‘Sometimes I think I’ve lost my nerve.

I’m not slaying people any more’","bodyText":"Upstate, a new novel by the literary critic James Wood, asks readers to consider a fundamental question: can one think one’s way into happiness? Or as Vanessa, one of the protagonists and a serially miserable person suspects, does deep, untrammelled thought lead to paralysis at best and at worst to despair? “If one knew how to think and then how to stop thinking, how to open and close the circle of thought, one flourished in life,” she surmises. On the other hand, “what if one’s series of circles just kept on multiplying? What if it was hard to stop thinking about pointlessness, to stop thinking about metaphysical absurdity, to stop thinking about the brevity and meaninglessness of things?” To which Wood adds, “if intelligent people could think themselves into happiness, intellectuals would be the happiest people on earth.” He starts laughing at the fact, evident to anyone who has spent time with either academics or novelists, that the opposite tends to be true. As it turns out, Wood himself is an exception to this rule. The 52-year-old, who lives in Boston with his wife, the novelist Claire Messud, and their two teenage children, describes himself as naturally “buoyant”, a disposition in evidence at a cafe in New York. Wood is in the city to teach a masterclass at Columbia University, a duty he combines with being a book critic at the New Yorker and professor of the practice of literary criticism at Harvard. It is a life of satisfying intellectual endeavour and no small public acclaim, but even as a boy, says Wood – the son of two teachers who struggled, in an act of what he has called “financial insanity”, to send Wood to Eton – he displayed an essential cheerfulness that others in his family decisively lacked; it’s a concern of Upstate, his second novel and seventh book, to consider where the roots of these variants lie. It is set partly in Wood’s native Durham and concerns the efforts of Alan, an ageing father, to parent his two adult daughters, Vanessa, a philosopher on the edge whom he goes to visit in Saratoga Springs in upstate New York, and her brisk and ostensibly happier sister, Helen. It’s an interesting and little explored subject for fiction – what the job of parenting entails when the children grow up – and the two women are finely drawn, particularly in relation to each other. “For so long now,” writes Wood, “the closed circuit of their relationship had been that Helen did things while Vanessa thought things.” Alan meanwhile is wry, baffled, as crippled by love for his daughters as he was before they were grown, a man who recognises “the engrossing fanaticism” of family but is powerless to soften its impact. He is also the source of the book’s sharp humour. I have never read a better summation of the general unease of the British person at large in New York than the sense Alan has, at all times in the city, “that something is going to fall on my head”. The novel grew partly out of the state of mind Wood was in after his mother’s death in 2014. She was a great influence; no-nonsense, Scottish, hugely invested in her four children, above all, religious, and three years later Wood is still trying to figure it all out. “She had many strengths,” he says. “Bravery, fortitude, possessive love, ambition for her children, of which I have absolutely been the beneficiary. But she wasn’t a happy person.” In fact, he continues, “I think she might actually have been closer to the Calvinist idea that it was one’s religious responsibility to be unhappy.” Wood, by contrast, spent at least the early years of his childhood “very happily sandwiched between older and younger siblings”, a protected middle child in a safe, loving home. (The first few years at Eton would prove tricky, when he was conscious of the class difference between himself and his peers). If this temperament and background can be said to have a stylistic expression, it is there in Wood’s brevity and precision, and in the sense that everything he does is underscored by humour. A great strength of Upstate is its general snap and vigour, and one sees this across Wood’s criticism, too. (He made the point, in a delicious takedown of The Goldfinch a few years ago, that while Donna Tartt herself was ageing along with the rest of the population, her novels seemed to be becoming more childish.) He is also, of course, his mother’s son and reserves a great deal of admiration for the way she went about things, working an extra job at the weekend to meet the cost of the school fees, and fighting him over his lapsed faith as a teenager – a woman unwilling to give an inch in any area of her life. On the matter of the religion, says Wood, “I couldn’t help but think as a teenager that she had made herself unhappier with her Christian faith. But then I would also think, OK, so if we removed the religiosity, would she overnight become a happy pagan? No. We are the way we are, we’re framed by our parents and the particular set of anxieties – social, political, and others that we have – so that one begins to feel we’re all carrying around a very fixed inheritance; as if there’s a bottle that’s filled up, or half filled up, or a quarter filled up at our birth and that level never changes, which is a terrible thing. That can’t be true, can it? Very miserable people can get less miserable.” He considers this. “I do believe in therapy, and so on.” A fixed inheritance would also negate all one’s efforts as a parent, something that Alan, in the novel, tries to counteract by persuading his gloomy daughter that his own cheerfulness takes hard work to maintain. “When Alan says that he’s thinking like a parent. He is in effect saying, look, it wasn’t no work having you and raising you. Certain things ran themselves and then certain things decisively didn’t, and the fact you’re not a raving lunatic takes effort. This is the eternal thing: that kids don’t realise until they’re much older, and usually not until they’re parents, how effing hard their parents worked for them.” And although, says Wood, nothing is ever this clear to a novelist at the time of writing, he can see now that when he wrote that scene it was not with his parents but his children in mind, the kneejerk parental urge to forearm them, however clumsily, against all the terrible things that can happen. “It’s the instinctive thing of saying, yes, life is a bit of labour. You know? It can’t just be sitting around, thinking about Kant.” When Wood met Messud they were both students at Cambridge University and already set on their careers; Wood’s first freelance review in the Guardian would appear when he was 21 and by the time she finished her graduate degree Messud would be at work on a novel. The pair moved to the US in 1995 when Wood was offered a job at the New Republic, and for the last 10 years he has worked at the New Yorker, while writing many stylish books of essays, including The Irresponsible Self (2004) and How Fiction Works (2008). That last title was written when his son and daughter were young children and is divided into short, numbered paragraphs. “I was writing in the evening,” he explains, “and knowing I would have a couple of hours only, it was helpful to know I was only working on a paragraph.” Without discussing it in advance, he and Messud naturally arrange their writing schedules around one another so that they aren’t both finishing a novel at the same time – what he calls “that instinctive marital tact which I suppose is just a slightly more formal version of the tact one needs anyway; you have your egotistical evening and I’ll have mine tomorrow night”. So unavoidable are the interruptions – of children needing to be picked up or helped with homework; of journalistic and teaching deadlines – that it has become a staple gift between the couple “to give each other a little card and it’ll say inside you have been given three nights at a hotel of your choice. Because that’s the most precious thing, to say to your spouse, I’ll take care of it; leave the house now and don’t come back for three days.” Wood’s first novel, The Book Against God, was published in 2003 to mixed reviews, and there is an inevitable glee to be had in taking a hatchet to the novel of a famous reviewer. (The New York Times averred that while “Wood writes like a dream and the novel is often wildly funny,” nonetheless it “tries – and, it should be said, fails – to achieve the kind of artistic and moral augustness that it so obviously aims for” and Upstate received similarly snotty notices in the Times and Sunday Times last weekend.) These things are deeply unpleasant and, Wood says, have made him soften towards his own targets, but it is also his habit to move briskly on. At Eton, after a couple of years of shame and embarrassment – “I dreaded the idea of my parents turning up on the school open day in their old Austin Maxi” – he shrugged it off. “And then in the last couple of years I’d become my own person. I’d found my little niche on the arty and journalistic side and I was proud of it; I thought, ‘Let them come in the Maxi because we don’t have a Porsche.’” Literary criticism has changed immensely since Wood started out, both commercially and, along with all other types of journalism, in terms of its accommodations with digital media. As a literary editor on the Guardian books desk, he recalls the then editor, the late Peter Preston, mildly remarking to him that it would be nice if not all the books reviewed were by Yale University Press and cost £50. Now, says Wood, it is hard not to write with social media in mind. “Sometimes I think I’ve lost my nerve a little bit. I think it’s growing older, and a certain reservoir of anger literally runs out. That’s fine. So you’re not doing manifestos and slaying people any more. You’re wiser and more generous, and you’re trying to write yourself, and have had the experience of being reviewed yourself.” Values have changed, too; I mention Sarah Churchwell’s recent essay in this paper about revising the canonisation of some male American novelists, and Wood agrees. “So many of those writers, whatever their virtues, are almost unreadable – I have my own particular issues with Updike, say, but I found him essentially unreadable because I really thought he did not like women. Apart from appreciating their bodies, I thought there was no sign that he liked them, and that is hard to deal with.” There is something else that has changed in criticism, he says, and that is the awareness, over the last 10 years, “that one is instantly being written about and often extremely judgmentally; that there’s a constant critical attention on the judgment that one might be making about someone like Donna Tartt, has crept into my bones. There’s a good and bad side to it; the good side is if you can not ruin someone’s day, month, year, then do so. The bad side is the extent to which one is possibly becoming lily livered.” (On the Donna Tartt thing, he says, there is less anxiety since “you can argue that she’s a grownup, she’s enormously rewarded, and awarded, and I’m sure it stings that I didn’t quite like the novel, but it’s all right.”) If Wood has a niggling regret as a reviewer, it is for a review he wrote 30 years ago, straight out of the gate. “When I think about the things I did wrong, that I’m ashamed of, the first fiction review I ever wrote for the Guardian was a review of a first novel; the author was Kate Pullinger and the novel was called When the Monster Dies and the first line of my review was ‘Lord, if it only would’. And it proceeded from there. I thought I was having a whale of a time, announcing myself. Then a month or two later someone told me that the review had appeared on the day of her publication and she had spent the launch party in tears. And I don’t think I’ve reviewed a first novel with any hostility since then.” He quotes the novelist Mary McCarthy, who was still writing venomous book reviews well into her dotage and who, when asked why she continued to be so ferociously unappeased, said, “there is so much to hate”. Wood looks amazed. “And I thought how terrible to go out of one’s life on that note. If that’s what you think, it’s never ending. There’s always crap to get rid of, more than you can clear.” He smiles. “But who wants to do that?” • Upstate is published by Jonathan Cape.

It’s my favourite breakfast and one of my all-time favourite Mexican dishes. So much so, that we often have it for dinner at home when we want something easy. The charred peppers and the chipotles give the salsa an irresistible smokiness and it’s spicy enough to brush off any cobwebs for those stumbling across it in their pyjamas. (Serves 2) Ingredients 2 large red peppers ½ large onion, sliced A good slug of basic olive oil, not extra-virgin, as it will burn 1 heaped tbsp chipotles in adobo, available in tins from supermarkets or online 3 cloves of garlic 1 tsp coriander seeds Dried oregano 3 tbsp moscatel vinegar, or use cider vinegar 1 tbsp muscovado sugar 1 tbsp sea salt 4 eggs 4 10cm corn tortillas Small bunch of coriander, chopped Optional ingredients Avocado, sliced Refried beans Method Turn the grill up as high as it will go – on this occasion, char is your friend. Toss the peppers and onions in oil and put on tray close to the grill to scorch. Turn peppers every few minutes so they char all over (in total this will take about 20 minutes). Remove both from oven. While you are letting the peppers cool, put a frying pan on the highest heat possible to warm up, with a good slug of oil. While the pan heats up, remove the stalks and seeds from the peppers and add the charred skins and onions to a blender, along with the chipotles, garlic, coriander seeds, vinegar, sugar and oregano. Blend for 1 minute. Add salt to taste. Fry the eggs on high heat to achieve crispy bottoms but gorgeous runny yolks. (You need a really runny egg for this dish to work well.) Set aside. Leave the pan on high heat (if there is a lot of oil remaining, absorb some of it with a dab of kitchen roll). Now toast the tortillas for 15 seconds on each side. Take two hot tortillas and start building the rancheros – eggs first, then a generous covering of salsa and coriander to garnish. I like to serve them with avocado and refried beans on the side but they are delicious by themselves. Mexican beer is incredibly light, so works well at breakfast time (I favour Corona or Pacifico).

On 24 January, Márcio “Marcinho” Matos, involved in the fight for rights of landless peasants in Bahia in north-east Brazil, was shot in front of his son. Three days later, Temístocles “don Temis” Machado, a prominent figure in the struggle of Afro-Colombian communities across the Colombian Pacific, was murdered in his home in the Isla de Paz community. Machado, of the Black Communities’ Process (PCN) and Matos of the Landless Workers’ Movement (MST) were tireless land defenders These killings are designed to silence and break the frontlines of the struggles against corporate power, catastrophic climate change and the unlimited extraction of the world’s natural resources. The violent tactics aim to bypass local communities whose lives and livelihoods stand in the way of corporations looking to profit from exporting primary materials for global markets, whatever the human and environmental cost. In Colombia, despite the historic peace agreement between the state and the leftwing Farc guerrillas, the social and armed conflict is intensifying. Machado lived in Buenaventura, on Colombia’s Pacific coast, a predominantly Afro-Colombian region with diverse ecosystems and rural and urban territories intersect. Buenaventura is also home to the country’s largest port, through which about 75% of imports and exports pass, generating huge corporate profits and much of the country’s tax revenue. However, the wealth that passes through the city makes for an uncomfortable contrast with the city’s appalling social realities. It has become known as a place where free trade presides over mass murder. Last year, Machado played an vital role in organising a three-week civic strike that brought Buenaventura to a grinding halt. The strike was a historic moment for the people of a region long mired in the legacies of slavery, poverty and racism. It mobilised more than 150,000 people in opposition to the government’s persistent neglect of its Afro-descendent population to the rallying cry “to live with dignity”. In Brazil, a never-ending corruption scandal has unlocked the worst political crisis the country has seen since its transition to democracy. As it enters an election year, the country’s growing political instability is reflected in the rising popularity of the chauvinist presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, a supporter of the dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. His rise to power has been paved by three powerful lobbying interests: the military, ultra-conservative evangelicals and the landowning elites behind Brazil’s industrial agriculture. This constellation of vested interests makes for a dangerous cocktail, leaving any who stand up to these industries particularly vulnerable. Efforts to undermine land rights have led to recurring attacks against indigenous peoples and peasant workers, a rollback of safeguards for the Amazon rainforest and definitive cuts to the institution tasked with protecting the rights of indigenous people. Brazil continues to be the most dangerous country, not only for environmental defenders – but also for peasant workers. In this context, the MST – a 1.5-million-member movement – is one of the strongest social movements in Brazil, campaigning against the industrial export agriculture model that excludes peasants and drives rising inequality and environmental degradation. Matos, who organised landless and impoverished farmers to realise their human rights, embodied this collective resistance. Many of the world’s largest extractive companies are registered in the UK and conduct their business through London, based on free trade agreements with numerous countries in the global south, including Colombia and Brazil. These industries are also heavily financed by UK banks, pension funds and insurance companies. Many of the key actors benefit from close and longstanding connections with the UK government, which often gives UK-based companies diplomatic support overseas, acting as an extra lobbying arm. It is this structure which lies at the heart of the threats to environmental and human rights defenders around the world. Rather than looking to a future of increased profit-driven extraction, we need to challenge – as these defenders did – the economic growth model that drives needless resource speculation, inequality, injustice, forced migration and climate change. This means naming not just those who are killed but the corporations they were confronting and the governments which support them. It means making perpetrators accountable at every level. Above all, it means listening to the voices of those defenders left behind to continue the fight at all costs for their lands, livelihoods and culture. For every land and human rights defender murdered, another steps up, ready to continue. The murder of these two men was an attempt to assassinate communities who fight for their rights. It is a part of a perverse strategy that tries to put out the fire at the heart of the social struggles they led. To honour their memory, we must extend our active solidarity to their communities, amplifying their calls for the justice they died for. • Sebastian Ordoñez Muñoz is senior international programmes officer (Latin America) for War on Want"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/28/company-tax-cuts-would-boost-wages-by-just-750-over-time-treasury-secretary","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T08:01:24Z","webTitle":"Company tax cuts would boost wages by just $750 over time – Treasury secretary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/28/company-tax-cuts-would-boost-wages-by-just-750-over-time-treasury-secretary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/28/company-tax-cuts-would-boost-wages-by-just-750-over-time-treasury-secretary","fields":{"headline":"Company tax cuts would boost wages by just $750 over time – Treasury secretary","bodyText":"The Treasury secretary John Fraser says the Turnbull government’s $65bn company tax cuts will boost wages by just $750 over time, but the cuts should still be pursued because Australia will have one of the world’s highest tax rates if they aren’t. Speaking at Senate estimates on Wednesday, Fraser told senators that Australia relied heavily on foreign capital flows so it needed to have a competitive company tax rate. He said Australia’s 30% headline company tax rate was one of the highest in the world, and after the United States slashed its corporate rate this year, and with Belgium, France, and the UK planning to cut their tax rates, it presented a “challenge” for Australia. “The scale of the changes and the pre-eminence of the US in the global economy mean that this is a big event. It will attract capital to the US, raise investment and boost their economy,” Fraser said. “For Australia, one thing is clear after these changes. We will have one of the highest corporate tax rates amongst advanced economies. In a competitive world for corporate capital flows this represents a challenge.” His comments were welcomed by the Coalition, which has been arguing forcefully for the need to keep Australia’s corporate tax rates “competitive”. But when asked to describe how the government’s proposed tax cuts would boost Australian wages, Fraser said any wage increases would be minor. “In the modelling we did on the tax cuts, I think we saw a $750 increase in wages, coming from the corporate tax cuts,” he said. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson then asked him to clarify if that meant the average Australian worker would be getting an extra $750 a year from the tax cuts. Fraser said the $750 figure did not refer to an annual increase in wages per worker – it referred to the estimated “level lift” in wages that would occur across the economy once the tax cuts had been fully phased in, and after companies had responded to those tax cuts by increasing investment in Australia, and after that investment had led to productivity growth. He did not say how long it would take for that process to run its course. Michael Kouparitsas, a principal adviser from Treasury’s macro-modelling policy division, provided more detail. “We released a paper at the time of the 2016-17 budget [that] detailed all of the wage increases, including after-tax increases,” Kouparitsas told senators. “The primary mechanism [by which wages will lift] is by deepening capital stock ... the orthodox view is we’ll raise productivity and that will drive a real wage increase.” Peter Whish-Wilson asked: “So what kind of wage increases are you forecasting from the tax cuts?” Kouparitsas replied: “It’s in the range of over 1%.” Peter Whish-Wilson asked for clarification: “Per annum?” Kouparitsas replied: “No, it’s a level increase. We’re talking level increases from policies like this.” Whish-Wilson: “So not much really, because you’re only talking about 1% over time?” Kouparitsas: “Yeah, so the [$750 increase] is reflective of once the capital stock has fully deepened.” The statements from Fraser and Kouparitsas clarified past statements from Malcolm Turnbull who has promoted his tax cut package by saying the average worker would have an extra $750 in their pocket “each and every year” if the corporate tax rate was cut from 30% to 25%. In February last year, in a speech to the National Press Club, Turnbull said: “If we had a 25% business tax rate today, full-time workers on average weekly earnings would have an extra $750 in their pockets each and every year.” Treasury’s analysis of the tax plan relied on a static general equilibrium model, meaning Treasury compared how the economy would change from its current “steady state” to a new “long-run equilibrium” after taxes were cut. It provided no indication of the time it would take to achieve the new long-run equilibrium, meaning the government does not know how long it will take for the level of average wages to increase by $750. The model also does not say workers’ wages will be $750 higher “each and every year” after the process has run its course. It says the level of average wages will increase by $750 in the long run (equivalent to a $14.40 a week pay rise)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/28/the-far-side-of-the-moon-review-robert-lepages-space-race-drama-ignites-emotions","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T03:56:38Z","webTitle":"The Far Side of the Moon review – Robert Lepage's space race drama shines on stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/28/the-far-side-of-the-moon-review-robert-lepages-space-race-drama-ignites-emotions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/feb/28/the-far-side-of-the-moon-review-robert-lepages-space-race-drama-ignites-emotions","fields":{"headline":"The Far Side of the Moon review – Robert Lepage's space race drama shines on stage","bodyText":"In 2000, French-Canadian auteur Robert Lepage staged a play about the space race. It was a huge hit, attracting rave reviews, eventually being staged in 45 cities around the world, being made into a film (released in 2003) and winning a swag of awards. That stage production, revived almost two decades later and currently touring Australia’s festival circuit, doesn’t feel dated. Apart from a few near-obsolete bits of technology as props (who still has a landline at home?), it could have been written today. It is ostensibly the story of two brothers. Philippe is a hopeless academic who we meet in front of a panel of unseen academics, trying to defend his thesis on the effect of space travel on popular culture. He has an air of failure about him. His younger brother, with whom he shared a room when they were young, is his opposite: Andre, a television weatherman, is brash, materialistic, loud and confident – a yang to Philippe’s tentative and unsure yin. But Philippe is a lot more relatable. The world is not enough for him. He yearns for escape, an experience of life beyond our planet. He sees people on Earth like goldfish, constantly circling the same places and situations. How can they be happy with that? Why can’t they be like him – curious about space, how to get there, and how to communicate with other beings while there? The brothers’ struggles are essentially an allegory for the play’s overarching theme: the space race between the United States and Russia. Archival footage charts elements of the race. The networks eventually tire of showing it, but Philippe’s passion does not wane. In a flashback to his teenage years, one of the play’s more poignant moments, he takes LSD and lies on the Plains of Abraham – the plateau outside Quebec where the pivotal battle between British and French armies took place in 1759 – and stares at the moon, trying to see a Russian satellite. It’s hard to believe The Far Side of the Moon is a one-man show. Yves Jacques – taking over from Lepage himself – plays all roles including both brothers, their mother and a doctor. The one-act production runs at a lengthy two-and-a-half hours (it could have lost 15 minutes of plot), making it a feat of endurance and versatility for the performer, and Jacques is exceptional. The fairly simple story is made magical by inventive staging that shapeshifts as frequently as Jacques changes character, deploying everything from mirrors to chalkboards, cameras, trick lighting and video, from newsreels to home movies. (One of the play’s funnier sequences is when Philippe films the interior of his apartment – room by room – in an effort to explain to the aliens the domestic habits of humans.) Laurie Anderson’s score is a real treat – appropriately spacey and atmospheric. There is also a small amount of puppetry, but the main prop is a washing machine – a round portal projected on to the stage. More than it initially appears, it becomes an MRI machine, an access point to space, a birth canal and a goldfish bowl. Tickets to The Far Side of the Moon are rarer than hen’s teeth, with all of the three performances at Perth festival sold out. But theatregoers in Adelaide and Auckland may still be able to snatch some up for forthcoming performances. The play reminded me a little of the work of Michel Houellebecq – showing us that here on Earth we are all essentially alone and cut off from each other. Despite its beauty, The Far Side of the Moon made for melancholy viewing. Perhaps things are better in space. • The Far Side of the Moon is showing at Adelaide festival from 2 to 7 March, and Auckland Arts festival from 22 to 25 March • Guardian Australia was a guest of Perth festival"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/27/us-civil-rights-report-kerner-commission","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T23:18:29Z","webTitle":"Half-century of US civil rights gains have stalled or reversed, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/us-civil-rights-report-kerner-commission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/us-civil-rights-report-kerner-commission","fields":{"headline":"Half-century of US civil rights gains have stalled or reversed, report finds","bodyText":"Civil rights gains of the past half-century have stalled or in some areas gone into reverse, according to a report marking the 50th anniversary of the landmark Kerner Commission. Child poverty has increased, schools have become resegregated and white supremacists are becoming emboldened and more violent, the study says. “Don’t let anybody tell you that the problem is Donald Trump,” the Rev William Barber, a prominent North Carolina pastor, told a conference launching the 469-page report in Washington on Tuesday. “Long before Trump mastered a modern-day version of the con of the southern strategy, he had an audience that had been cultivated for 50 years.” President Lyndon Johnson formed the original 11-member Kerner Commission as Detroit was engulfed in a race riot in 1967. The commission’s report concluded: “Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white – separate and unequal.” Johnson’s major policy initiatives, the “great society” and “war on poverty”, had a positive impact, according to the report, Healing Our Divided Society: Investing in America Fifty Years After the Kerner Report, released by the Eisenhower Foundation. The African American achievement gap in reading decreased by half during the early 1970s and early 1980s. The report adds, however, that with the elimination of major federal programmes under Ronald Reagan during the 1980s, the achievement gap in reading grew once again and is now 30% bigger than it was 30 years ago. Fred Harris, the last surviving member of the Kerner Commission, told Tuesday’s conference at George Washington University: “We made progress on virtually every aspect of race and poverty for nearly a decade after the Kerner report and then that progress slowed, then stopped and in many ways was reversed, so that today racial and ethnic discrimination is again worsening. We are resegregating our cities and our schools, condemning millions of kids to inferior education and taking away their real possibility of getting out of poverty.” Harris, a former Democratic senator from Oklahoma and, with Alan Curtis, co-editor of the new report, added: “There are millions more poor people today than there were then. There’s greater child poverty; poverty’s harder to get out of. More poor people are in deep poverty than was true 50 years ago and income inequality is worse now and worsening.” The report says the percentage of American children living in poverty increased from 15.6% in 1968 to 21% in 2017. The percentage of people living in deep or extreme poverty – defined as less than half the poverty threshold – has also gone up since 1975. After a dramatic improvement in racial integration in education, especially in the south, court orders and housing patterns have led to a resegregation of public schools. In 1988, about 44% of black students went to majority white schools nationally; only 20% of black students do so today. Three decades after the Fair Housing Act of 1968, black homeownership rose by almost 6%, but those gains were wiped out from 2000 to 2015, the report continues. It blames the decline on the disproportionate effect that the subprime mortgage lending crisis had on African American families. Mass incarceration has increased the prison population from about 200,000 at the time of the Kerner Commission to about 1.4 million today, it also notes. African American men are nearly six times as likely to be incarcerated as white men. Catherine Lhamon, chair of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, told the audience: “We have seen other times since the Kerner Commission when presidential administrations and Congress tested our ideals. Speaking for myself, I think of the Reagan administration as the nadir for civil rights before now but what worries me is this Trump administration is taking a page from the Reagan playbook and consolidating it. That scares me, frankly, and that is what I think needs to drive all of us for a meaningful call to action. “This administration works to destabilize the federal judiciary, appointing judges who are affirmatively opposed to federal civil rights enforcement and to federal civil rights themselves. This administration issues speech after speech and tweet after tweet challenging equity principles and announcing that the administration will not enforce them. This administration generates dangerous policy and regulatory limitations on our rights.” In his address, broadcast via video link, Barber highlighted the importance of voter suppression in states that can make all the difference in elections. “We have less voting rights today than we had on August 6, 1965, when the Voting Rights Act was passed,” said Barber, president of Repairers of the Breach, a religious and social justice not-for-profit group. “This, my friend, is the election hacking no one wants to talk about because it would force us to deal with systemic racism in America, and study after study shows us that the political landscape would look very different without voter suppression.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/27/opioid-crisis-justice-department-jeff-sessions-taskforce","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T21:34:42Z","webTitle":"Opioid crisis: justice department to back local lawsuits against manufacturers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/opioid-crisis-justice-department-jeff-sessions-taskforce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/opioid-crisis-justice-department-jeff-sessions-taskforce","fields":{"headline":"Opioid crisis: justice department to back local lawsuits against manufacturers","bodyText":"A new federal taskforce will target misdeeds of opioid manufacturers and distributors, and the US Department of Justice will back lawsuits brought by local governments against makers of the prescription painkillers at the root of the opioids public health crisis, the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced on Tuesday. The announcement comes as the Trump administration ramps up efforts to curb the epidemic, which killed 64,000 people in 2016. The government’s efforts are part of an election campaign promise Trump made to Appalachian states that heavily supported the president and which have borne the brunt of the crisis. Sessions said he would seek “reimbursement” for costs the government incurred as a result of painkiller manufacturers’ allegedly “false, deceptive, and unfair marketing of opioid drugs”. “The hardworking taxpayers of this country deserve to be compensated by any whose illegal activity contributed to these costs,” Sessions said. Sessions said the opioid crisis cost the US an estimated $115bn in 2017, and has cost $1tn since 2001. Over the next three years, the crisis is expected to cost an additional half-trillion dollars, he said. The new Prescription Interdiction and Litigation Unit, or “Pill” taskforce, will target manufacturers who “contributed” to the epidemic. The taskforce aims, in part, to “bring down the number of opioid prescriptions”, Sessions said. “We think there are just too many.” Sessions also announced the department would issue “party of interest” statements in lawsuits filed against manufacturers. To date, 14 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against drug manufacturers, and more are expected, and 41 are investigating the firms. Separately, in Ohio, a federal judge is presiding over a multi-district group of lawsuits brought by many US cities and counties against leading pharmaceutical companies and distributors at the heart of the opioid painkiller trade. Drug overdoses killed 64,000 Americans in 2016. The death toll is expected to continue to rise. At the figure’s peak in 2010, researchers found there were 81 prescriptions for the powerful narcotic painkillers issued for every 100 people in the United States. Drug manufacturers are largely blamed for kicking off the opioid crisis in the early 2000s with marketing campaigns that encouraged family doctors to make widespread use of the drugs. Public health researchers believe marketing of those pills and, later, attempts to begin scaling them back spurred demand for heroin and fentanyl. Ohio’s attorney general, Mike DeWine, on Tuesday called the statement of interest filing from the Department of Justice “a game changer” and “very, very significant”. “The facts are that about 20 years ago, drug manufacturers decided that they wanted a much bigger market,” said DeWine. Drug companies, he added, “went to primary care physicians … to convince them that these were wonder drugs and told them at the time that these drugs were ‘not very addictive’. “We know these are very addictive and yet these drug companies continued to do this.” The pharmaceutical industry is considered one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington DC and has spent $3.7bn since 1998 trying to sway members of Congress. It has largely been successful. An April 2016 law is blamed for neutering the US Drug Enforcement Agency’s ability to pursue drug distributors, and political efforts to rein in drug prices have also failed. Sessions himself has made controversial comments about opioid prescribing, telling an audience in Tampa earlier this month that “people need to take some aspirin sometimes”, and he has claimed marijuana fueled the drug overdose epidemic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/feb/28/artist-resurrects-obscure-fossils-in-gorgeous-living-colour-franz-anthony","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T11:37:07Z","webTitle":"Artist resurrects obscure fossils in gorgeous living colour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/28/artist-resurrects-obscure-fossils-in-gorgeous-living-colour-franz-anthony","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/feb/28/artist-resurrects-obscure-fossils-in-gorgeous-living-colour-franz-anthony","fields":{"headline":"Artist resurrects obscure fossils in gorgeous living colour","bodyText":"Although the coiled shells of ammonites are a familiar fossil when it comes to reconstructing past environments through art, invertebrates like cephalopods (the group that includes octopuses, nautiluses, “squids” and their relatives, as well as fossil forms ammonites, belemnites and lesser known ancestral groups) normally only feature in the jaws of plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs. Artist Franz Anthony has sought to address this disservice (#justiceforcephalopods) with a series of illustrations focusing on a diverse line up of extinct cephalopods to show these animals off in their own right and not just as background characters – or lunch – in palaeoart. I caught up with Franz to chat about the series of works, palaeoart in general and the challenges of illustrating animals known only from their hard parts and not much else. Full disclosure: I’ve been following the progress of this project, been asked about some finer points of anatomical details and I’m just in love with the finished works, so consider me deeply impartial in presenting this work here. First up, why the focus on fossil cephalopods? FA: My cephalopods series is a part of an even longer series in which I illustrate extinct creatures that don’t normally get enough attention. While we’re seeing a surge of younger palaeo artists (myself included) joining the playground, I feel like most of the efforts are concentrated in the “higher” animals – most especially dinosaurs. I think it’s not necessarily a bad thing, as deep down I’m a bird nerd myself! However, I’ve always been more interested in creatures that are more “ornate,” as in having body segments, fins, armour, or display structures, rather than being a continuous blob of fur. This is why I’ve also covered the often forgotten Ediacaran biota and ostracoderms in the series. Cephalopods, the third plate in my series, happen to be well-known by many but the reconstructions we see on the internet are often outdated or flat out non-existent. This is often the case with obscure taxa that were described 200 hundred years ago! Is this series a specific commission? FA: This series is a part of my personal project that are hosted on Earth Archives (eartharchives.org), a site that I run with some friends. It’s a site where illustrators and writers get together to tell notable stories in natural history, to make the public aware of the latest developments in the science. Are these in a ‘usual’ style or is there a unique style for this series? Are there other artists or works you’re particularly influenced by? FA: As some people have pointed out on Twitter, I’m influenced by Ernst Haeckel. His plates from Kunstformen der Natur are clearly relevant to my personal interests: they’re ornate, very detailed, and display an array of creatures that are often overlooked. In a time when digital photography can immortalise countless creatures in high definition, I’m interested in illustrating creatures that photographs can’t capture (yet). I’m mostly concerned about things that are too small, too rare, or long gone. Extinct invertebrates just happen to fit the bill … or beak? With tens of thousands of different species to choose from, how did you go about picking and researching the ‘cast’ you’ve illustrated? FA: I must admit I jump head first into projects without knowing much about my subjects. I’m a generalist, so while I knew of some fossil cephalopods and had heard that some details about are often incorrectly depicted, I didn’t know the details. I started my research from Wikipedia like every other millennial, but then I realised a lot of cephalopod literature is not as readily available as, say, dinosaurs or pterosaurs. This is when I decided I wanted a comprehensive reading material to orient myself. Danna Staaf’s newly-released Squid Empire was exactly what I needed. Her book tells the story of cephalopod evolution from their appearance in the fossil record to today, and actually highlighted several important taxa that practically don’t show up in search engines. When it was time to decide which taxa should make it into my final images, I had a few things in mind: I wanted to show as many body shapes as possible, give equal attention to various parts of the evolutionary tree, and make sure the taxa are historically or scientifically important (geologically oldest, first discovered, etc). How do you go about making each image? FA: I started sketching them in Photoshop. Since I knew the final ensemble image was going to be a Haeckel-esque plate, I had to figure out which shape goes where. It felt like playing a jigsaw puzzle on your computer, except with extinct cephalopods. Afterwards, I uploaded my plate sketch and summoned forth Twitter’s most dedicated cephalopod enthusiasts to ask for assistance from people who know better. It got me the attention of Thomas Clements (and yourself), who helped me in figuring out basic cephalopod classifications. Ultimately, due to the lack of space or information, I had to drop multiple interesting animals from my final image like the oddball Nostoceras, the octopus Keuppia, and the dubious “giant vampire squid” Tusoteuthis. As we’ve mentioned here at Lost Worlds Revisited before, soft tissue cephalopod fossils are extremely rare. With so few soft tissue detail available, how did you decide on colour, number or limbs, skin patterns etc? FA: Of course, it’s hard to figure out what they actually looked like in life when we haven’t even found traces of their soft tissues. I had to rely on phylogenetic bracketing [assuming the least number of evolutionary leaps and conservation of shared characters in extant species]. When it came to ammonites, I thought it was safer to depict them with ten arms instead of dozens of tentacles. I also learned by consulting Danna Staaf that there’s a recent study involving nautilus embryo which suggests that nautilus’s iconic hood is fused tentacles. This means it’s likely that ten-limbed, tentacleless cephalopods wouldn’t have it, unlike in most outdated palaeoart! This is why I love finding new information, as it challenges misconceptions that I might have held for my entire life. As for the colours, I had to rely a lot on other shelled marine creatures. In general, I avoid blue or green since the pigments very rarely exist in nature, while the patterns are decided on their general lifestyle. Bottom-dwelling creatures might have been more drab, while free-swimming ones would benefit from having a disruptive pattern. That being said, two of my reconstructions are based on studies on their actual colours! Sphooceras is thought to have had nautilus-like stripes, while Phragmoceras seems to have existed in various morphs, one of them having zig-zag patterns near the bottom side. It amazed me how both taxa, over 400m years old, could’ve preserved such tiny details. It was so difficult to track down the literature, but I’m glad I spent the extra time to do so because it felt like I got even closer to their real life appearance. I’m also happy about the belemnite Passaloteuthis, since its oversized hooks have been known to science for 200 years but nobody that I’m aware of had attempted to reconstruct what they would’ve looked like in life. There’s a strong campaign amongst palaeo artists to advocate commissioning palaeoart rather than using the usual (but cheap or free) art out there and involving palaeo artists as the research stage rather than commissioning art the day before a press release is due out. How important do you think this is? FA: Deep down, I’m a still graphic designer and commercial illustrator. I’ve noticed that this is a problem that’s plaguing other fields of visual communications too, not just palaeontology. As the media landscape turns into story-churning factories, they are left with very little to no budget to “embellish” the thousands of stories they publish each month with original art — so they subscribe to affordable stock image providers. No matter how much we artists complain about this less than ideal situation, this is our reality now and we too have to readjust our business model [this is also the case here at Lost Worlds Revisited...] Though we may think of “bad palaeontology stock photos” as grinning, naked theropods with odd proportions, less-loved creatures like cephalopods are hit even harder. This is where Studio 252MYA comes in. I founded the studio in 2016 after realising there are lots of young artists out there who have built considerable portfolios on their own, but are too awkward/time-strapped to network. By gathering everyone’s portfolio in one spot, we offer media companies and content creators the vast selection of a stock image site, but with up-to-date and more carefully crafted artwork. While the big bulk of our creations can be seen on Earth Archives, we’ve also provided images for Youtubers, museums and National Geographic We’re a small collective and still growing, so whether this model is the right way to go, nobody is sure yet. All I know is that I’m trying to help young artists while keeping up with (and cussing about) the demands of today’s reality. What’s next? When are you going to do all the fossil cephalopods? Asking for a friend of course ... FA: There will always be cephalopods! Though I’m a generalist, I’ve always loved cephalopods to some degree. I can’t promise I’ll do anything elaborate in the near future, though, since I have at least two other Haeckel-esque plates lined up: trilobites and echinoderms. I also have other ideas that focus less on the animals and more about the environments, and a few others that are more “edgy” and graphic to (hopefully) turn the attention of the wider audience to palaeontology. I’m trying to stay diverse! You can find Franz’s cephalopod work and the fossils that inspired them here: 500 million years of cephalopod fossils."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/28/michael-b-jordan-live-with-parents-millennials-shame","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T11:00:15Z","webTitle":"Why do we still shame adults who live with their parents?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/michael-b-jordan-live-with-parents-millennials-shame","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/28/michael-b-jordan-live-with-parents-millennials-shame","fields":{"headline":"Why do we still shame adults who live with their parents?","bodyText":"Over the weekend, the internet was on fire again (shocker), this time over the Black Panther star, Michael B Jordan, and his housing situation.

In fact, this sleeping arrangement is so degrading, the media has even coined a patronizing name for the losers who do it: boomerangs. They’re the millennials who’ve failed to live up to the idea of success our Protestant work ethic-obsessed society has shoved down their throats. They’re the ones finally doubting our long-held convictions that material gain, self-reliance, and that all important guiding principle – freeeeeeedoooooom – are what determine our sense of worth and give us purpose. Unlike most of the world, where family is number one and cooperation is valued over competition, Americans tend to think we don’t need family. Or anyone actually. I’m not saying family isn’t important to us. Of course it is. But it’s not quite as important as self-determination and the right to pursue individual happiness (like moving out at 18 and maybe even owning a gun), and we like to shame any millennial who dares to question our collective allegiance to this destructive bootstraps mentality that unbridled capitalism hinges on. Michael B Jordan, thankfully, was able to refute any trolls trying to claim he might be one of these capital-L losers who mooches off his parents. The truth is, he’s actually a super generous guy who wanted to repay his parents’ love by purchasing a house big enough to host them. But even this explanation didn’t satisfy everyone. In America, we like to put parents in homes, not invite them to live in ours. Obviously #notallAmericans. But enough. This whole conniption fit over Jordan’s housing situation is yet another disturbing example of America’s internalized shame around that story we’ve been taught to worship: the American dream. If you don’t believe me, google “millennials, entitled, home” and see for yourself. You’d think boomerang were a bigger threat to American values than even communism. I get it, though. I myself never questioned this lone wolf, bootstrap mentality until I started hanging out with Americans who weren’t white, middle class, or Protestant. And once I started dating foreign men and living outside of America, I was quite disturbed at how much I judged people who didn’t leave home at 18. Nobody seems to shame boomerangs as much as we do in America. Not even in Europe, where I currently live and work. Here, it’s totally normal to stay at home until even 30. Almost half of Europeans do, actually. What’s not normal to them is having thousands of dollars of debt right out of the gate. Even knowing all this, I’d still rather swallow knives than move back home. When I lost my waitressing job awhile back and struggled to pay $1,100 a month for a one-bedroom basement apartment with no kitchen in Los Angeles, it never once occurred to me I could move home. I’d hate myself, my parents might too, and, more importantly, my sex life would die. There’s nothing less attractive to an American than a grownup living with mommy. Now, with thousands of dollars of new debt to my name, at least my pride is still intact, though! The craziest part about all of this is America’s refusal to accept living at home as a practical solution sometimes. And it doesn’t help that baby boomers continue to blame iPhone and laziness for boomerangs, not a depressing job market thanks to robots, trade, and legalized slavery (sorry, “prison labor”), massive student loan debt, and a unprecedented housing crisis. No, the culprit are loose bootstraps on these pesky millennial brats. Until Americans can stop shaming the generations failing at the American dream and loosen our attachment to a mentality that’s bankrupting our youth, we will continue to fall behind the rest of the world in our quality of life. How self reliant are you when you’re living off of credit cards? I guess at least people will date you.

Adm Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency and chief of US Cyber Command, told the Senate armed services committee: “Clearly, what we’ve done hasn’t been enough.” Asked if he had been granted the authority by Trump to counter Russian cyber-attacks at source, Rogers said: “No, I have not.” He added: “I need a policy decision that indicates there is specific direction to do that. The president ultimately would make this decision in accordance with a recommendation from the secretary of defense.” Trump has dismissed investigations into Russian interference in the US election – and potential collusion between Trump aides and Moscow – as a partisan exercise. The president spent part of Tuesday morning tweeting quotes from conservatives who defended his campaign on Fox News. The president capped off the tweet storm by writing: “WITCH HUNT!” Trump has repeatedly refused to acknowledge the consensus of the US intelligence community and its allies that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election in an attempt to defeat his opponent, Hillary Clinton. The president also insisted last week that “the facts” proved he had been tougher on Russia than his predecessor, Barack Obama. Rogers had a different view, suggesting to lawmakers that the Russians “haven’t paid a price, at least, that has significantly changed their behavior”. Rogers cited Trump’s decision in January to delay the implementation of new sanctions against Russia that Congress passed on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis last year. “I believe that President Putin has clearly come to the conclusion there’s little price to pay here, and that therefore I can continue this activity,” Rogers said. “Everything, both as the director of NSA and what I see on the cyber command side, leads me to believe that if we don’t change the dynamic here, this is going to continue and 2016 won’t be viewed as something isolated. “This is something that will be sustained over time.” The Trump administration delayed sanctions against Russia even as top intelligence officials testified that Moscow was seeking to disrupt the 2018 midterm elections. Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, has told lawmakers US officials he expects Russia to again spread propaganda and utilize social media to disseminate fake news, “to try to build on its wide range of operations and exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States”. Congress passed the sanctions against Russia last August, in response to Moscow’s election meddling in the US and other countries, as well as its aggression in Ukraine. The Trump administration tried to weaken the legislation but was thwarted by Congress, forcing the president to sign the measures into law. Democrats in Congress are now seeking to force Trump to implement the sanctions. “We need to put our foot to the gas pedal,” Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia who introduced a bill in the House, said on Tuesday. “If the president is not going to do it, then Congress needs to.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-qatars-world-cup-labour-rights-and-wrongs","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-27T18:32:53Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Qatar’s World Cup: labour rights and wrongs | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-qatars-world-cup-labour-rights-and-wrongs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-qatars-world-cup-labour-rights-and-wrongs","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Qatar’s World Cup: labour rights and wrongs","bodyText":"Qatar is one of the world’s richest countries and expects to spend more than $200bn on major infrastructure projects ahead of the 2022 World Cup. Yet it appears the wellbeing of the workers building these facilities has too often been held cheap. In October, responding to criticism, Doha promised major labour reforms including axing a system described as “modern day slavery”. But safety remains a pressing issue. The “supreme committee” organising the event has long said it is striving to enact higher than usual welfare standards for World Cup projects. It has recorded 10 deaths since October 2015, but has classified eight of these (including three of men in their 20s) as “non-work-related”, despite immense scepticism from campaigners. On Tuesday, an inquest in Brighton examined one of the remaining deaths, of the British worker Zac Cox, who died last January after falling 40m as he installed a walkway in the roof of the Khalifa stadium in Doha. His relatives’ distress was compounded by the response when they tried to find out what had happened and why: months of silence from the Qatari authorities (broken only a week ago). Building contractors were seen to be less than helpful. Mr Cox’s relatives belatedly discovered that an investigation was carried out weeks after his death, which concluded that it was caused by the failure of the lifting equipment provided to him on site and that this equipment was known to be in poor condition. This was the conclusion of the coroner. Yet the report – now submitted to the inquest – was never published, nor given to relatives by his employers or Qatari authorities. The family wants an independent inquiry and is urging the Foreign Office to pursue the case urgently with the Gulf state. Fifa too, which profits so handsomely from the World Cup, has a responsibility to press authorities to ensure that workers’ deaths are quickly, thoroughly and transparently investigated. Mr Cox’s relatives deserve justice and accountability. The number of workers at World Cup stadiums is expected to rise from 12,000 to 36,000 this year. The concern is that no other family should lose a loved one under similar circumstances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/mar/07/boomerang-offspring-damage-parents-wellbeing-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T13:22:45Z","webTitle":"Boomerang offspring damage parents' wellbeing, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/07/boomerang-offspring-damage-parents-wellbeing-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/mar/07/boomerang-offspring-damage-parents-wellbeing-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Boomerang offspring damage parents' wellbeing, study finds","bodyText":"Grown-up children who return to the family home after a period away, often at university, cause a significant decline in their parents’ quality of life and wellbeing, according to a revealing report which explores for the first time the impact of the so-called “boomerang generation” on family life in Europe. The study by the London School of Economics (LSE) shows that after decades of growing independence among young adults and a dramatic decline in intergenerational co-residence, the trend is now shifting in the other direction. And as grown-up children are increasingly driven back into the family home by rising housing costs and job insecurity, there are damaging consequences for parents. Researchers found that couples, who have enjoyed a new lease of life as their children fly the nest with improved marital relationships and a fresh interest in new hobbies, may regard their offspring’s return as “a violation” of an exciting stage in their lives. With about a quarter of young adults in the UK now living with their parents – the highest number since records began in 1996 and a trend replicated across Europe – the impact on family life appears to be widespread. The LSE research, which is based on analysis of longitudinal data from the over-50s in 17 European countries between 2007-2015, is the first to look at the impact of the growing boomerang phenomenon. While the report acknowledges that co-resident adult children can be a source of emotional and practical support for older parents, it says they are also a source of conflict and stress in the family home. Using a quality of life measure based on 12 key indicators, the study looked at participants’ sense of control, autonomy, pleasure and self-realisation. The scale ranged from 12 to 48 with higher scores equating to a better quality of life. Researchers found that when an adult child returns home to a previously empty nest, the score dropped by an average of 0.8 point marking a “substantial” impact on wellbeing similar to what might be seen when someone develops an age-related disability. Dr Marco Tosi, one of the authors of the study alongside Prof Emily Grundy of the LSE’s social policy department, said a similar trend could be seen across European countries, though the effect was more pronounced in Protestant than Catholic countries. “Our work shows that in contexts where family orientations and welfare institutions foster individuals’ independence, returns home by adult children have negative implications for parents’ wellbeing. “When children leave the parental home, marital relationships improve and parents find a new equilibrium. They enjoy this stage in life, finding new hobbies and activities. When adult children move back, it is a violation of that equilibrium.” One mother, whose 23-year-old daughter returned to the family home and has remained there, responded to the report’s findings, saying: “I really love having my daughter at home but our role as parents is to want our children to be independent. “Everything in my psyche says this young woman should be living independently. I feel everything in her psyche is saying: ‘I should be living independently.’ It hits at a very deep level.” The study, Returns Home by Children and Changes in Parents’ Wellbeing in Europe, explains: “Over the past half-century, intergenerational co-residence has declined dramatically in western countries. “However, this pattern has recently altered, and in some countries multigenerational co-residence has increased, a shift interpreted as a family response to high unemployment rates, poor job prospects and financial hardship among young adults. “The findings show that returning home was correlated with a decline in parents’ quality of life when there were no other children in the parental home. Parents enjoy their independence when their children leave the home, and refilling an empty nest may be regarded as a violation of this life course stage.” The report is published in the latest edition of the journal Social Science &amp; Medicine and was based on data from France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Poland. Dr Tosi said although the study did not directly draw on data from the UK, there was very likely to be a similar effect, particularly as it was a Protestant country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/mar/07/talking-horses-gronkowski-ready-to-take-first-steps-to-kentucky-derby","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T10:06:56Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Gronkowski ready to take first steps to Kentucky Derby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/07/talking-horses-gronkowski-ready-to-take-first-steps-to-kentucky-derby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/07/talking-horses-gronkowski-ready-to-take-first-steps-to-kentucky-derby","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Gronkowski ready to take first steps to Kentucky Derby","bodyText":"It is a long and rarely-trodden path from Sunbury in south-west London to Louisville, Kentucky, but one of the runners in the 7.10 at Kempton Park this evening will take the first step along the 4,000-mile route when the track stages the Road to the Kentucky Derby Conditions Stakes over a mile. The race was originally scheduled for last Thursday’s meeting, which was lost to the weather, but has been saved because it carries precious qualification points for the Run for the Roses at Churchill Downs in early May. Along with the Patton Stakes at Dundalk on Friday, points will be awarded on a 20-8-4-2 basis to the first four home, while a third qualifying race at Kempton on 30 March, with 30 points to the winner, will decide which European-trained horse will get a guaranteed spot in the field in Kentucky. Aidan O’Brien’s Mendelssohn, who has a dirt pedigree, is among the entries at Dundalk and is seen as a contender for the Kentucky Derby despite having won the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf at Del Mar in November. The name in Wednesday night’s field that is guaranteed to ring a bell with American fans, however, is Jeremy Noseda’s Gronkowski, who is named after 28-year-old Rob “Gronk” Gronkowski, a tight end with the New England Patriots. The three-year-old Gronk is likely to start favourite this evening, having taken well to all-weather surfaces with two wins from as many starts including a six-length success in a three-runner race at Newcastle last time out. He is no better than 6-5 this morning, but this is a race with more depth than the betting might suggest and there are several dangers in the field. Fortune’s Pearl, fifth home in a Group Three at Newmarket in September, is a contender, but John Gosden’s Court House (7.10) looks like the value bet at the early odds. He missed the kick at Lingfield last time but still recovered to record an easy win in a decent time, and 6-1 is a fair price about the son of Dawn Approach getting at least one hoof on the plane to Kentucky. Jumps racing returns after a blank day on Tuesday and Cabernet D’Alene (3.40) looks a likely winner at Fontwell Park. Nick Williams’s runner showed improvement to win by 11 lengths at Market Rasen in January in a useful time and a 10lb rise in the weights may not be enough to stop him. Prestbury Park (4.00) and Warriors Valley (3.00) should both go well at Lingfield Park, while Discoverie (1.50) is the pick of the prices on the card at Catterick Bridge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/07/bristol-post-apologises-for-faces-of-evil-front-page-21-years-ago","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T10:30:52Z","webTitle":"Bristol Post apologises for 'Faces of Evil' front page 21 years ago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/bristol-post-apologises-for-faces-of-evil-front-page-21-years-ago","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/07/bristol-post-apologises-for-faces-of-evil-front-page-21-years-ago","fields":{"headline":"Bristol Post apologises for 'Faces of Evil' front page 21 years ago","bodyText":"The Bristol Post has published a front-page apology for a story it ran on its cover 21 years ago that featured the mugshots of 16 black men alongside the headline “Faces of Evil”. The newspaper’s editor, Mike Norton, said the article, published on 17 April 1996, “destroyed what little credibility and trust the Post had within Bristol’s African and Afro-Caribbean community”. The so-called “faces of evil” were men jailed for dealing crack cocaine but, in an article explaining the apology, Norton says the effect of the front page was “so powerful that it offended and ostracised a large section of the city’s community”. “The Evening Post – as it was called then – was already disconnected from the city’s black communities,” said Norton, editor of the paper for 12 years. “It was another Bristol institution that the people in those communities didn’t feel was for them. “They were already wary of telling the Post about their news or their successes. They already had a suspicion that the paper wrote about black people only when they committed crime. The Faces of Evil front page, with its black faces ranged in rows like slaves held in cages, cemented that view.” Norton said he did not blame the journalists who conceived the front page and admitted if he had been the editor at the time he would have published it too. He said the newspaper in 1996 had “absolutely no agenda to exclude anyone” but “it also wasn’t good at being inclusive and, thanks to that page, the perception became a self-fulfilling prophesy”. Norton said that in addition to the apology he was arranging for more black writers to contribute to the newspaper and giving opportunities to black and minority ethnic young people who want experience of journalism. The move comes at a time when Bristol has been called on to confront its historical association with the transatlantic slave trade. There have been demands – resisted by some – to rename various buildings, street names and venues to remove references to figures or institutions associated with slavery. A name seen throughout the city is Colston, for Edward Colston, who used his wealth accrued as a slave trader to support philanthropic projects in the city such as schools, homes for the poor and hospitals. Along with Roger Griffith, of Ujima Radio, and Tom Morris, of the Bristol Old Vic, the Bristol Post is launching a campaign, Year of change in the city, which will feature debates and conversations hosted at venues across the city."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/08/plot-35-review-cine-memoir-uncovers-a-family-mystery","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"Plot 35 review – cine-memoir uncovers a family mystery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/08/plot-35-review-cine-memoir-uncovers-a-family-mystery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/08/plot-35-review-cine-memoir-uncovers-a-family-mystery","fields":{"headline":"Plot 35 review – cine-memoir uncovers a family mystery","bodyText":"Éric Caravaca is the French actor and director who has starred in films such as Philippe Garrel’s Lover for a Day, Patrice Chéreau’s His Brother and The Officer’s Ward by François Dupeyron – to whom this film is dedicated. It is a sad, thoughtful, if slight piece of work, a 67-minute cine-memoir about his family, personal myths and memories. It was worked on over a long period: Caravaca’s dad, a wary interview subject, died during filming. Caravaca’s parents, Angela and Gilberto, were from Morocco but came to France in the early 60s, when Éric and his brother Olivier were born. But there was a family mystery: their sister Christine died in infancy in Morocco, in circumstances his parents were always reluctant to discuss. Her grave, in “Plot 35” in Casablanca’s French cemetery has had its photo removed. The official story was that the little girl died of maladie bleue, or blue baby syndrome – but it was more complicated than that. She had Down’s syndrome, making her liable to this condition. Caravaca almost, but not quite, gets his mother to admit this on camera – though his father is reasonably frank. This was an era in which shame irrationally attached to the condition, and Caravaca’s mother was brought up in an atmosphere of denial and avoidance. The trauma of Christine’s birth and death coincided with the tumult of Moroccan independence; thecouple’s need to escape had an international dimension. As Caravaca puts it: “A child dies at the same time as colonial civilisation.” An interesting, reflective film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2018/mar/08/international-womens-day-2018-live-protests-press-for-progress-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-08T22:21:23Z","webTitle":"International Women's Day 2018 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/mar/08/international-womens-day-2018-live-protests-press-for-progress-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2018/mar/08/international-womens-day-2018-live-protests-press-for-progress-live","fields":{"headline":"International Women's Day 2018 – as it happened","bodyText":"That concludes our coverage of International Women’s Day, which, like all of our lives, was marked by both inspirational and cringeworthy moments. Pioneering and overlooked women were recognized, like photographer Diane Arbus who today received her New York Times obituary. Protests were held in Spain, London and France to demand equality. Susan Sarandon reminded us of the good guys out there, when she revealed actor Paul Newman gave her part of his salary. Cyprus vowed to close the gender pay gap. There were also tone deaf moments women are all too familiar with. McDonald’s was criticized for turning its golden arches upside-down (“W”!), rather than increase wages. President Trump talked women’s empowerment. Thank you for following us through it all. Here is every woman who has ever won a Nobel Prize. As we alluded to in our previous post, women are underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) careers. So to highlight those fighting to change that gender imbalance, check out these resources. First, from coder and American Association for the Advancement of Science fellow, Maryam Zaringhalam. Her list of women in sciences starts with her mother, a doctor. NASA’s Planetquest reminded us of Natalie Batalha, Sara Seager, Debra Fischer and Jessie Dotson, astronomers and astrophysicists leading mission such as the Kepler spacecraft and the Hubble telescope. And don’t forget about the women at CERN, the world’s largest particle physics lab. We don’t hear about them very often, but actually women have been working in science... well, forever. Check out the story below of Enheduanna, the Sumerian high-priestess expected to make accurate astronomical predictions in 2300 BCE. Examples from the last couple centuries? In 1938, Lise Meitner solved the problem of nuclear fission. Thirty-five years ago this week meitnerium was discovered, and became the only element named solely a woman who was not a mythical figure. Katherine Johnson not only helped integrate a school in West Virginia, but also made calculations for NASA space missions. She was later played by Taraji P Henson in Hidden Figures. Because that clearly does not cover everyone, Scientific American compiled a whole list of women in science. And so did the 500 Women Scientists project, a resource for everyone to use to highlight women’s voices. In some fields, women have been underrepresented for a very long time. One good example? Philosophy. The numbers of women in philosophy mirror those math, science and engineering.* Tania Lombrozo, a philosopher from the University of California Berkeley, explored why in an NPR story. To borrow a metaphor from a paper by [Louise] Antony [a prominent philosopher], philosophy could involve a ‘perfect storm’ of social and psychological factors that conspire to make it difficult for women to persist in the field. No single intervention is likely to change the climate.*More on that in a moment. *More on that in a moment. In other news from the swamp, a record number of women are running for Congress this year. One of the 575 running for a US House, Senate or governor’s seat is Fayrouz Saad. She is seeking a House seat just north-west of Detroit, Michigan. Right now, 106 of the 535 Congressional seats are filled by women – or 19%. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Saad said members of her family were sometimes told by strangers, “I can’t wait for Donald Trump to deport you.” I had this moment of clarity after the election that rather than hoping someone else steps in, why shouldn’t I?... I want to run as soon as possible.” If Saad wins, she will be the first Muslim-American female member of Congress. Here’s an official statement from the Trump White House about women’s empowerment, accompanied by pictures of his almost entirely white male cabinet sitting around a bunch of rockets. Enjoy. On International Women’s Day, we celebrate the many incredible contributions made by women of all ages in the United States and around the world. We honor the vital role of women in our communities, businesses, civil society, and government. And we reaffirm our Nation’s commitment to ensuring that every person has the opportunity to succeed. Despite some recent progress around the world, too many women still face tremendous barriers to participation in all aspects of life. This must change. Women are critical to economic growth and global stability. When women are empowered, communities and entire nations thrive. Over the past year, my Administration has championed the creation of international initiatives to promote women’s economic empowerment. Through the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi), we are working to improve access to capital for women entrepreneurs in the developing world. With the formation of the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders, we are engaging with the private sector to reduce barriers to women’s participation in business. And through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation’s new “2X Women’s Initiative,” we are mobilizing $1 billion for investment into projects that support women in emerging markets. Moreover, I have worked with Congress to enact policies that encourage American women to pursue careers in the international arena. In October, I signed the Women, Peace, and Security Act, which promotes the participation of women in conflict prevention and post-conflict peace efforts around the world. Involvement in these efforts will provide women with important opportunities to use their skills and abilities to mediate difficult situations and to keep our country safe. Today, my Administration is launching USAID’s WomenConnect Challenge. In an increasingly connected world, women are lagging behind in access to the internet. In fact, 1.7 billion women in low and middle-income countries around the world remain unconnected today. The WomenConnect Challenge will help women in these developing countries gain access to the digital technology that is so foundational for productivity and participation in the global economy. My Administration is also supporting women in the United States by empowering them to continue driving the success of our Nation. In 2017, the Small Business Administration increased capital loans to women-owned businesses by more than $575 million. Through these and many other initiatives, we seek to empower women of all backgrounds to achieve their economic potential and shape our world. As we mark International Women’s Day, we remain committed to the worthwhile mission of enhancing women’s leadership in the world and building a stronger America for all. International Women’s Day is also tennis star Serena Williams’ first day back in tour. One of sports “most remarkable figures”, Williams gave birth last year and then survived a blood clot (which, naturally, she diagnosed herself). I never questioned my return,” the 36-year-old said on Wednesday before her comeback match in the Paribas Open in Indian Wells. Former First Lady Michelle Obama’s latest initiative works to improve education for women and girls around the world. Here’s an email we just received from the Obama Foundation: Growing up, my parents always had a clear message for me and my brother: there is nothing more important for your future than getting a good education. Nothing. Even though neither of them had a college degree, they were determined to give us that opportunity. And let me tell you, my education changed everything for me – opening doors I never could have imagined and allowing me to pursue the career of my dreams. ... Girls who go to school marry later, have lower rates of infant and maternal mortality, are more likely to immunize their children, and are less likely to contract malaria and HIV. Girls who are educated also earn higher salaries – 10%-20% more for each additional year of secondary school. And sending more girls to school and into the workforce can boost an entire country’s economy. ... Every single one of us has a role to play in helping girls get the education they deserve, and International Women’s Day is the perfect time to make that commitment. Back in London, the Press Association reports that the staff of BBC are protesting for fair pay, chanting “Equal pay for equal work”. They stood outside BB Broadcasting House at 4:22pm GMT. Why 4:22? It is 9% short of a typical 9am-5pm working day, symbolizing the gender pay gap at BBC. Here is more from the Press Association: A huge cheer went up for Carrie Gracie, who resigned as BBC China editor earlier this year over pay inequalities, as she was brought to the front of the crowd. “Yes it was great to see so many people, and it’s great to see so many men. Isn’t that cool?... “And it just makes the point that this is not like some people have presented it as a small group of entitled women. A piece published this week by one of my colleagues in Washington DC highlights a male-dominated institution being pushed to change – the US Senate. One of their own, US Senator Tammy Duckworth from Illinois, is about to be the first US Senator to give birth in office. “I feel like the Senate is actually in the 19th century as opposed to the 21st somehow and that’s really unfortunate,” the Democrat told my colleague Lauren Gambino, during an interview in her office. It’s a reflection of a real need for more women in leadership across our country, whether it’s legislatively or in boardrooms or the military.” Duckworth was one of the first women to fly combat missions in Iraq, lost both her legs when a rocket-propelled grenade hit hit her helicopter in 2004, and became the first disabled woman to serve in Congress in 2012. However, when Duckworth takes her upcoming leave, she will have a host of challenges thanks to current Senate rules. More from Lauren’s piece: The upper chamber does not allow votes by proxy, which means Duckworth could be summoned while on leave to take critical votes. Unlike in the House, children are not allowed to accompany members on the floor. Meanwhile, if she needs to breastfeed during a vote, her best option would probably be the women’s restroom off the Senate floor. Hello from New York, and many thanks to Elle Hunt. Here in the US, cities as far flung as Los Angeles and Toledo, Ohio have scheduled protests and networking events for women. As well, many women celebrities marked the occasion by tweeting about campaigning – yet relatively unknown – women. The first female presidential nominee of a major US political party, Democrat Hillary Clinton, called out the US women’s hockey and soccer teams, who demanded equal pay. The New York Times published obituaries for 15 “remarkable women” previously “overlooked” by the paper. Some of the famous names the paper excluded – photographer Diane Arbus and Ida B Wells, a, 1890s newspaper editor in Memphis, Tennessee who chronicled lynchings in the South. While we acknowledge women today, it is also worth noting US-specific work that needs to be done. America is one of the only industrialized nations to lack paid family leave. Many the lowest paid professions – such as teacher’s assistants, personal care aides and restaurant hostesses and waiters – are dominated by women. It is also one of the most expensive places to give birth, and has some of the worst birth outcomes. As well, not all of the ways America marked International Women’s Day have escaped scrutiny. Many criticized businesses such as McDonald’s as only paying lip service. The restaurant chain dominates one of the lowest paid industries in America, which is both dominated by women (65% of the workforce) and which pays women broadly less (median weekly earnings of just $370 for women, $413 for men). Many thanks for all the contributions made so far to this blog. Keep them coming, I’ll be looking below the line for more! Before I hand over our rolling coverage to Jessica Glenza, my colleague at Guardian US in New York, I wanted to share some of the incredible photographs of women on strike today in Spain – thanks to this commenter for the reminder. More than 5m women are estimated to have taken part in Spain’s first nationwide “feminist strike” on Thursday, with the protestors’ slogan: “If we stop, the world stops”. And with that, Jess is on with the blog ... For the International Day of the Girl in October last year, Beyoncé lent her song Freedom to a campaign to achieve gender equality by 2030. Today, on International Women’s Day, one of the writers credited on the song has spoken of the challenges she herself has faced in the music industry. Carla Marie Williams, who co-wrote Freedom for Beyoncé’s widely-acclaimed Lemonade album, says women are held back in the male-dominated world of music, and called for more investment by record labels and publishers to bridge the gender gap. “Equality in the music industry definitely doesn’t exist, it’s male-dominated through and through,” the Brit-winning and Grammy-nominated writer told my colleague, Nadia Khomami. The music industry has not escaped the spotlight being shone on sexism in the entertainment industry at large. At the end of last year, hundreds of female musicians in Australia published an open letter demanding “zero tolerance for sexual harassment, violence, objectification and sexist behaviours”. Madonna and Grimes both recently expressed frustration with how their respective teams were handling their new material, interpreted as evidence of “an industry that loves to sell the idea of female independence but does not like to enable it”. And last week, Kim Deal – of the Breeders and formerly the Pixies – spoke frankly about how far that discrimination went in the industry: “I’ve said before that misogyny is the actual backbone of the music industry, and without misogyny the music industry would crumble.” A Guardian analysis last year found that more than two-thirds of the live music acts that performed in the UK on one night in October were male-only, prompting many women working in music to offer their advice to others hoping to break in to the industry. McDonald’s has flipped its iconic golden arches to become a W, “in celebration of women everywhere, and for the first time in our brand history” – to which many have responded, “try again”. For its own commemoration of International Women’s Day, McDonald’s overturned its logo on Twitter, Instagram and its other digital channels; supplied 100 restaurants in the US with special branded garb; and – at one franchise in California – went so far as to install a new sign. McDonald’s global chief diversity officer, Wendy Lewis, said in a statement to Business Insider that the stunt was “in honour of the extraordinary accomplishments of women everywhere, and especially in our restaurants”. But her vow that the company was “committed to their success” was called into question by social media users who called on McDonald’s to pay its employees a living wage. In response to the campaign, Momentum put out a video highlighting how McDonald’s low wages and zero-hours contracts meant some women workers faced poverty and homelessness. The videos, produced in collaboration with the Bakers’ Union, are in support of striking McDonald’s workers. “This empty McFeminism has nothing to do with women’s liberation and everything to do with McDonald’s attempt to sanitise its image,” said Laura Parker, Momentum’s national coordinator. “If they actually cared about women, they’d pay their workers a living wage and stop forcing them onto zero hours contracts. “It’s completely unacceptable that zero hours contracts at McDonald’s have left women workers without enough money to feed their children – and have even made some of them homeless.” In Ireland, campaigners seeking to repeal the 8th Amendment are celebrating a “historic and momentous” step forward in their bid to allow access to abortion. As reported by the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent, Henry McDonald, and Harriet Sherwood, the wording of a national referendum to overturn the constitutional ban on abortion was agreed by the cabinet on Thursday. Ailbhe Smyth, the convenor of the Coalition to Repeal the 8th Amendment, welcomed the news as a “significant milestone”, well overdue. “It has been a very long time coming. ... We need abortion care that is safe and regulated, in line with best medical practice, and today brings us a crucial step forward in trying to achieve this important goal.” The referendum bill is being debated in parliament, with full details due to be published on Friday. The campaign to repeal the 8th will ramp up in the weeks leading up to May’s referendum, with Orla O’Connor of the National Women’s Council indicating that it would be “rooted in the experiences of women and girls and the type of healthcare services they need”. Cyprus’ septugenarian president Nicos Anastasiades has pledged he will do whatever it takes to “close the gap” of gender inequality amid criticism over his failure to appoint more women to government office. “Every day steps of progress should be made for the gap to shrink and with each passing day our world to become fairer,” said the conservative president in a tweet marking International Women’s Day. His own efforts “in this direction will be continuous,” he vowed. Anastasiades, who won a second presidential term in office last month, has been criticised for having only two women in his cabinet despite high anticipation that more would be appointed given the island’s burgeoning population of highly qualified female professionals. A former British colony, Cyprus is among the most patriarchal of EU member states. Most of the voters who abstained form casting ballots in the two-round presidential vote were women, pollsters say. In her own message to mark the day, the communications minister Vasiliki Anastasiadou, who was promoted to the post last month, said: “March 8 ... is a day of reflection because so much more has yet to be done until women gain the place they deserve in the whole spectrum of life, as equal members of our society. The women of Cyprus have achieved much. We can, however, do much more.” Religious leaders on the ethnically divided island also expressed concern at the the violence and discrimination women suffered on Cyprus. In a joint statement, the five [male] leaders representing the island’s Greek Orthodox, Muslim, Armenian Orthodox, Maronites and Catholic communities, voiced consternation that “violence against women and girls continues to be one of the most pervasive manifestations of discrimination against women in Cyprus. This includes economic, psychological, sexual and physical violence.” Thanks, Alexandra – and hello, all. Thank you for following along with our coverage of International Women’s Day 2018 thus far, and please keep your contributions coming below the line – thanks to Ruth for this comment about her late Mum, who didn’t listen when she was told that “ladies” could only be nurses or teachers. That’s all from me today, my colleague Elle Hunt will be taking over this liveblog shortly. Thank you all for your contributions! I probably shouldn’t like this so much, but I really want a Amelia Earhart Barbie. The famously sexist Barbie doll maker Mattel (until 2016, remember, Barbie was a white woman so stick-thin it was argued were she real she would not menstruate) has released a new batch of dolls inspired by modern-day women. Role models include Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim, record-breaking Wonder Woman director Patti Jenkins, conservationist Bindi Irwin and British professional boxer Nicola Adams Obe, reports InStyle. They join the existing “Sheroes” line which includes: Ashley Graham, Ava DuVernay, Gabby Douglas, and Misty Copeland. Mattel also introduced its “Inspiring Women” collection, which focuses on historical figures including Amelia Earhart, Frida Kahlo, and NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson. Say what you like about Manchester (it rains all the time! it looks like the back of a fridge!*) but they do know how to pull off a decent marketing campaign. Today, that involves renaming itself Womanchester for the day, with lots of people getting on board using the hashtag #Womanchester. The name change is intended to remind people that “Manchester was the home of suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst, and is the “birthplace of progress and innovation”. Organisations and people supporting the name change include Womanchester City, Womanchester Airport and Greater Womanchester Mayor Andy Burnham. Womanchester City also playing a blinder in bigging up the women’s game *This is a joke, promise. I love Manchester. I have to or our north of England editor Helen Pidd would kill me. One of the great joys of International Women’s Day is tracking the progress of comedian Richard Herring, as he responds to every ill-informed Twitter user asking if there is an International Men’s Day (there is, it’s November 19th). This year he’s cannily using the enjoyment many people get from his sterling efforts to rise money for domestic violence charity Refuge. And has so far raised £72,000 and counting ... To coincide with International Women’s Day, Public Health England has released a report looking at the health of women in prisons, which unsurprisingly concludes that acceptable standards are not currently being met, reports my colleague Frances Perraudin. The report recognises that people in prison are typically in poorer health than the rest of the population, but notes that women prisoners are often in a worse condition than their male counterparts. 65% of women in prison suffer from depression compared to 37% of men. Despite representing just 5% of the prison population, women account for 23% of all self-harm incidents in prison. A blogpost on the PHE website reads: Historically, prisons have almost invariably been designed for the majority male prison population – from the architecture of prisons, to security procedures, to healthcare, family contact, work and training.” 53% of women in prison report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse during childhood and 41% of prisoners say they observed violence at home as a child. “These negative childhood experiences can have a profound impact on women’s health outcomes and their offending behaviour. Women also tend to have roles as parents or primary care givers in families, meaning time in prison no only impacts on them but on their families and the people they look after,” it adds. Between 24% and 31% of all women in prison have one or more child dependents. Commenting on the report, Eytan Alexander, CEO at UK Addiction Treatment (UKAT), said the report showed there was “still a way to go until standards are where they should be”. “We have treated women where abuse has played a part in their lives, and where they’ve either experienced prison themselves, or have been affected by a family member in prison,” he said. “The impact reverberates across the family and it’s important that if a woman is incarcerated, that the root cause is addressed in order to avoid future offences and substance abuse.” UN Women have been tweeting about the global #WikiGap event, organised in partnership with the Swedish Foreign ministry. The idea is to get more women contributing to the website, to address the gender imbalance on the world’s largest online and user-generated encyclopaedia. The Swedish foreign ministry states: Knowledge is power, and Wikipedia has the potential to colour our view of the world. But there is great imbalance between men and women on the website, like in society at large. Ninety per cent of those who add content to Wikipedia are men. There are four times more articles about men than women. The figures vary regionally, but no matter how you look at it, the picture is clear: the information about women is less extensive than that about men. Regardless of which language version of Wikipedia you read. We want to change this. #WikiGap is an event during which people around the world will gather to add more content to Wikipedia about women figures, experts and role models in various fields. On 8 March – International Women’s Day – the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Swedish embassies will host simultaneous events in more than 50 countries, from Sweden to Tanzania, Egypt and Colombia. Sweden is the first country in the world to pursue a feminist foreign policy. We do this based on the conviction that gender equality is fair and right, and because it is a basic condition for sustainable peace and security. The New York Times is doing something pretty cool. It is using International Women’s Day to launch Overlooked, a project to write the obituaries of the people who never received them. It’s starting with 15 obituaries of women today, including prominent British women Lillias Campbell Davidson, Charlotte Bronte and Ada Lovelace. The NYT will continue to publish the obituaries throughout this year, expanding to include others who were overlooked, especially people of colour, with new obituaries published every week, they said. Women are marching all around the world today. Here are some photos: More than 100 female detainees at the Yarl’s Wood detention centre are continuing their hunger strike, with more than 500 people also fasting to show solidarity with their cause. A woman who gave her name as Afiya in a statement, said in a statement. We wish we could be celebrating with you on this day, but we are not free to do so. It is true that women have made much progress in the past century since the suffragettes won the right for some women to vote, but a hundred years does not negate an entire history of women being treated at best as inferior and at worst as property. We have a long way to go. Today we celebrate what has been achieved, but we cannot take for granted the rights and freedoms that have been won. We women here in Yarl’s Wood did not anticipate our freedom would be taken from us or the impact it would have. We are on a hunger strike because we are suffering unfair imprisonment and racist abuse in this archaic institution in Britain. This is a desperate measure due to desperate circumstances. We feel voiceless, forgotten and ignored. We need a voice and more importantly we need someone to listen. Diane Abbott MP, Shadow Home Secretary, said: Refugee and migrant women are often struggling to be heard. They can and do make such a great contribution to this country, but also face some very grave challenges. I’m glad to support their campaigns for greater liberty, dignity and safety. It’s time for us in Parliament to ensure that this centenary year for women’s suffrage is about listening to and including all women, especially those who have been historically marginalised from British politics. Marchu Girma, grassroots director at Women for Refugee Women, said: A century on from women getting the vote, there are some women in our society whose voices are still unheard. For far too long refugee and migrant women have gone unheard, and now we are now asking for our needs to safety, dignity, liberty to be met. We believe all women count. This is a really powerful and inspiring video featuring Dr Amani Ballour who is committed to challenging gender stereotypes in war-torn east Ghouta. “I believe we as women can change this reality,” she says. French president Emmanuel Macron visited a Paris-based property business on Thursday morning and declared it to be “exemplary in matters of professional equality between men and women”. The company, Gécina, employs almost 500 people. The visit came as the French government draws up measures to boost gender equality in and outside the workplace after its “Tour de France” consultative exercise that led to around 50 suggestions. French daily newspaper Libération made male readers pay 50 centimes more than female readers to mark International Women’s Day. In the cities of Perpignon and Strasbourg, feminists and supporters renamed streets after women. Only 2% of French roads carry women’s names. In France, research from the Inequality Observatory shows women still earn on average 24% less than men for the same work. A group of associations and unions have called on workers, male and female, to stop working at 15.40 today, the time when women could be considered to be working for free given the pay gap. Lisa, 43, Nairobi, Kenya Women with disabilities from different countries in Africa are meeting today in Nairobi to strategise for change to end violence against women and girls with disabilities. We are exchanging our experiences and good practices to promote progress and end systemic gender-based violence. We want to tell the world and in particular, women’s rights activists that women with disabilities are women first! To governments, multilateral and bilateral agencies and donors, women with disabilities are making progress around the world. Monika Radojevic, 22, London I’m going in to speak to years 5 and 6 at Kenmont Primary School about three important lessons that three important women have taught me. I’ll be speaking about Michelle Obama who taught me to dream big and shout loud, my own mother who taught me to be kind, and Mexican artist Frida Khalo who’s love for life despite her pain taught me to love myself more. I hope most of all that young children are inspired by other powerful women to have big dreams of their own. Catherine Sealys, 51, Saint Lucia This year women are excited, they are ready, they are motivated and they have been educated by the “me too” and “Time’s Up” Movement. And they are ready to come out and make a difference. Our organisation Raise Your Voice Saint Lucia will be hosting a march to call on the government of Saint Lucia. We want to send a strong message to our legislators that the time is now to make amendments to existing legislation and enact new laws to protect women and children as the law stands we are legally victimising our women and children, specifically those who are in common law relationships and children born into a common law relationship. A statue of rent strike heroine Mary Barbour has been unveiled today in Glasgow’s Govan following a long-running fund-raising campaign. Barbour was a central figure in the Glasgow rent strikes of 1915, coming to national notice when she formed eviction resistance groups of women which were described as ‘Mary Barbour’s Army’, and remains one of Scotland’s most beloved women activists. The statue was commissioned after £100,000 was raised by campaigners, led by former Labour MP Maria Fyfe and depicts Barbour on the day she led a 20,000-strong march for tenants’ rights through the streets of the city. Standing for the Labour Party, Barbour went on to become on of Glasgow’s first women councillors. The Law Society has revealed that the number of female solicitors practising in England and Wales now outnumbers men for the first time ever, my colleague Owen Bowcott reports. The figures have emerged on International Women’s Day along with a survey of members which shows that 91% of those consulted believe that more flexible working would help improve diversity in the profession. The newly released Law Society figures show that there are now 69,995 practising female solicitors in England and Wales, making up 50.1% of the 139, 624 total. There are fewer men: 69,629, amounting to 49.9%. While the overall number of female solicitors has overtaken men, the senior ranks in most law firms are still dominated by male partners - showing that there is further to travel on the road to gender equality in the legal profession. “As women solicitors practising in England and Wales outnumber men for the first time in history, people working in law ... have spoken out about the challenges the profession faces in achieving gender equality,” the Law Society’s vice president, Christina Blacklaws, said. “While more and more women are becoming lawyers, this shift is not yet reflected at more senior levels in the profession. Our survey and a wider programme of work ... seeks to understand progress, barriers and support remedies. “Unconscious bias in the legal profession is the most commonly identified barrier to career progression for women, while flexible working is seen as a remedy by an overwhelming 91% of respondents to our survey. “Interestingly, while half of all respondents said they thought there had been progress on gender equality over the last five years, there was a significant difference in perception by gender with 74% of men reporting progress in gender equality compared to only 48% of women.” The Law Society survey, answered by nearly 8,000 solicitors, recorded only 11% of respondents saying that unconscious bias training was carried out consistently in their organisation. Almost half (49%) said that the work/life balance required in order to reach senior levels was unacceptable. Nearly two-thirds (60%) said they were aware of a gender pay gap in their place of work and approaching half (46%) said that traditional networks/routes to promotion were ‘male orientated’. Gatwick Express honours women in announcements to mark IWD Europe has worked hard to eradicate gender inequality – promoting gender mainstreaming in all EU policies and those of member states – but countries like Greece still have a long way to go, writes my colleague Helena Smith. Sixty six years may have elapsed since Greece got its first woman MP, but in terms of gender equality the country still lags at the bottom of league tables Europe wide. In contrast to Sweden which came in with 82.6 points, topping the latest study put out by the European Institute for gender equality, Greece scored a mere 50 points and came in last. In terms of equal pay, access to financial resources, education, household work and time devoted to it, decision-making and health, the country trailed its counterparts. But the pay gap does seem to be closing according to figures released by Eurostat on the eve of International Womens’ day. The difference between average gross hourly earnings of male and female employees (as a percentage of male gross earnings) fell to 12.5 percent in 2014 – the last year for which figures were available. In 2010 it stood at 15 percent. An International Women’s Day flag is flying over parliament for the first time on Thursday, as MPs and peers mark the day with a debate in both Houses of Parliament. Labour’s shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler said she had been inspired by the flag flying over the Transport for London building on Monday and had approached Speaker John Bercow to see if the flag could be flown in parliament. Bercow signed off the plan with less than 24 hours to go before IWD. Bercow said the flag would “remind us of what has been achieved and how far their is to go to achieve full gender equality” and said it was an initiative supported by MPs from all parties as the House commemorated 100 years of the first women getting the vote. “This is very much a cross-party initiative, this is a cause dear to all their hearts,” he said. “Whilst rejoicing in all the great things brought about by the Pankhursts, by Emily Wilding-Davison, by Millicent Fawcett, and indeed by modern campaigners, we must not sit smugly and think job done, there are still issues of unequal access to the labour market, occupational segregation, women and members of minority groups scaling the heights professionally, there is a substantial gender pay gap.” If you needed another reason to admire the late Paul Newman (and really, does anyone?) the Press Association has supplied it, reporting that the actor gave Susan Sarandon part of his payment on the new-noir thriller Twilight to close the film’s gender pay gap. Joe Nerssessian, of the Press Association reports: Hollywood actor Paul Newman once gave up a portion of his salary to top-up co-star Susan Sarandon’s lower fee, the actress has revealed. The pair worked together on 1998 neo-noir thriller Twilight, which also starred Gene Hackman and Reese Witherspoon. After the negotiation term Favoured Nation - which ensures each actor in a film is paid the same as their co-stars - was only applied to the two men in the film, Newman volunteered some of his fee. Sarandon told BBC Radio 5 Live: “Emma Stone once came forward and said she got equal pay because her male stars insisted upon it and gave up something of theirs. That happened to me with Paul Newman at one point, when I did a film with him ages ago.” She added Newman had “stepped forward and said ‘Well, I’ll give you part of mine’. So yeah - he was a gem”. The actress, 71, also said she believes there will “always be a casting couch” in Hollywood. “I think what will go away is the unwanted exchange, but I think that giving yourself sexually, or being drawn to power and wanting to have sex with someone that’s in power is also a choice.” “What we don’t want to have is being exploited and to have the Harvey Weinsteins of the world holding it over your head and holding it over your project - that is the most despicable.” Newman died aged 83 in 2008. The Lib Dems are calling on Parliament to rename the House of Lords the House of Peers to better reflect the role women play in the upper chamber, the party said today The bill, being laid in the House today by Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, will highlight the fact that the House of Lords is a gendered title and put the issue on the legislative agenda for the rest of the parliament Christine Jardine said: The current gender-specific House of Lords title is no longer appropriate. It feeds into an outdated and unacceptable narrative that political decision-making is a man’s job.” “In this centenary year of female voting and election rights, it is surely time to recognise that our upper chamber is not a male preserve. A group that supports women’s rights using music influenced by Ethiopian heritage is thriving – despite losing UK aid funding, writes Claudine Spera You can watch the amazing Yegna in action in this film: A protester who was taking part in an Women’s Strike UK action at the Department of Health and Social Care has been arrested, the group says. According to the group: Trans women and their allies were peacefully protesting the Department of Health this morning to call urgent attention to the failings in the provision of healthcare for trans people. The group added: 2K people will meet at 1pm in Russell Square, Bloomsbury, London 61 University campuses across UK are on strike Actions in 7 cities - London, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Derry and Brighton The UK will be one of 56 countries on strike. Noshin Salari Rad, one of the organisers of the strike said: Thursday is about solidarity between all women– trans women, women of colour, indigenous, working class, disabled, migrant, sex workers, Muslim, lesbian and queer. My colleague Anna Kessel has just informed me what I’d rather be doing today (I’m joking of course, what else would I rather do then liveblog IWD???) A groundbreaking women’s football history conference aims to blow apart perceptions of the sport is kicking off at the National Football Museum in Manchester today. Anna writes: The two-day conference, which begins on International Women’s Day, hosts academics, journalists and artists from around the globe. Lectures range from the acclaimed writer and sports activist Shireen Ahmed discussing football and the hijab, to a study on women and the 1966 men’s World Cup from Professor John Hughson. If you are unfortunate enough to be an Evertonian like me, it’s worth a glance for the pictures of Elaine Shaw and friends on their trip to Rotterdam to see Everton play the 1985 Cup Winners’ Cup final. The great thing about International Women’s Day is that is shines a light on institutional sexism is all sorts of areas. Culture - both high and low - remains hugely dominated by men, and nowhere is that more evident that in the classical music sphere. Which is why it’s great to see movement by some institutions to address the glaring inequality. Music college Trinity Laban has used International Women’s Day to pledgs that music by women – past and present and across many genres - will make up more than half of its concert programmes in 2018/19 academic year. Harriet Harman MP, Chair of Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music &amp; Dance, is launching Venus Blazing at a lunchtime concert by Trinity Laban’s Chamber Choir celebrating the 90th birthday of British composer Thea Musgrave, at 1pm in Greenwich today. She said: Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music &amp; Dance is strongly committed to diversity in all elements and it has a mission to constantly challenge the status quo. Venus Blazing is a great example of just how it can do this. It will encourage and inspire its students – many of whom will go on to shape the future of the performing arts – to engage with the historic issue of gender imbalance in music by women, and ensure that it does not continue into the next generation. I welcome this bold initiative to raise awareness of the disparity that has long existed in music and shine a light on music that has so frequently been overlooked. I am also greatly looking forward to hearing some of the musical treasures by women I might not otherwise have had the chance to hear. Radio 3 are also putting in a shift - joining forces with academics to bring to light the work of five forgotten women composers. This Comment piece from Dawn Butler, shadow Women &amp; Equalities secretary, is very much worth a read. It can be read alongside the Guardian’s story here: My colleague Lucy Lamble has been at the London School of Economics in London this morning, where Danish development cooperation minister, Ulla Tørnæs, one of the people who set up the She Decides movement in response to Trump’s Global Gag rule, has called for a “new normal” in the face of pushbacks to women’s rights over their sexual and reproductive rights: International Women’s is a day to celebrate the incredible journey millions of women and girls around the world have taken. A journey towards a life in dignity, with equal opportunities, freedom and prosperity. [A hundred years ago, for the first time the British Parliament passed an act granting most women – yet not all – the right to vote. Look at you now. What a long way we have come. But the journey is far from over. For many girls and women, the journey has not yet even started.] In several parts of the world, gender equality and women’s enjoyment of human rights is but a distant hope. And women’s rights are even under increasing pressure. Various conservative and religious movements globally are adding pressure. This needs to change. We cannot, and should not, accept the setbacks we now see. All of us have a responsibility to act. To stand up and fight for those millions of girls and women, who do not enjoy the same fundamental human rights as we do. Last week in Pretoria, Denmark and South Africa co-hosted the first “SheDecides-one-year-on -conference’ with a special focus on youth. In Pretoria, representatives from governments, parliaments, civil society, bright academics, and – notably – young people from North and South, all committed to stand up collectively to a vision of a New Normal. A New Normal where women and girls can decide freely about their own bodies. Their own lives. And their own futures. Where SheDecides. Without question. Action is needed for women and girls - but really to the benefit of us ALL. Spanish newspaper El Pais has posted this rather cool little video, explaining that they are not fully staffed today because of the women’s strike. And showing the empty desks of female journalists who have not come into work today. ¡Qué bueno ! This is rather cute from French left-leaning newspaper Libération To draw attention to the gender pay gap in France, which is 25% according to the paper, they are selling today’s edition at two different prices. Women get a 25% discount at the newsstand. Bravo! If you fancy getting involved in some radical action in the UK today, it’s worth taking a look at this Facebook post from the Women’s Strike Assembly - UK and following @Women_Strike Women in Spain are taking part in the county’s first nationwide “feminist strike” to mark International Women’s Day, reports Sam Jones in Madrid. Some are downing tools for the whole day, while others are stopping for a two-hour stretch (from 11.30 to 13.30 or from 16.00 to 18.00). But the action goes beyond the traditional workplace: women are also being encouraged to abandon their unpaid work - such as cleaning, social care and child care - to show how unfairly these tasks are distributed. There are also signs of more direct action in Catalonia, with protesters occupying streets in Barcelona, shutting down a railway line out of the Catalan capital and blocking a road between Barcelona and the town of Manresa. Protests are due to be held later today in cities across Spain. Protests are also under way in Madrid, with workers and students picketing the city’s Complutense university. Some prominent Spanish journalists are absent from news websites, radio and TV programmes today as they, too are on strike. Spain’s health, social services and equality minister, Dolors Montserrat, has described today’s action as “a social revolution for men and women”, but stressed that it “isn’t a war between the sexes”. Montserrat told the Espejo Público programme that while she was pleased to see so many women exercising their right to protest, it was up to individual women “to decide how they want to strike” or whether they wished to go to work as normal. Good morning and happy International Women’s Day! I hope all our readers have had a decent breakfast this morning - because we’ve got an awful lot of patriarchy smashing to get through. Huge thanks to the powerhouse that is Claire Phipps in Sydney - it is so exciting to hear of the manifold ways people are marking IWD around the globe. On that note - what are YOU doing to mark the day? I’d love to hear what IWD means to you, and what action you are taking.

It’s time for me to hand over the live blog to my colleague Alexandra Topping, who’ll take you through the next part of International Women’s Day as it rolls across the globe. The mood this year feels different. Real change is underway: women in Saudi Arabia can now drive, or go to sports matches. Milestones have been reached: it’s 100 years since (partial) women’s suffrage in the UK. There are loud conversations around harassment, pay inequality and more. Time’s Up and #MeToo have edged beyond hashtags into palpable anger and hunger for action. In other ways, though, it feels as if little has changed. A man who bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy” sits in the Oval Office. A prime minister is asked in a TV interview when she conceived her unborn child. Women still routinely face sexual harassment at work. Reported cases of female genital mutilation continue to rise. Do get in touch to share what’s going on where you are: via the comments below, to Guardian Witness here or via the button at the top of the blog. And thank you for reading. The Catholic church is an “empire of misogyny”, the former Irish president Mary McAleese has said ahead of a conference in Rome calling for women to be given leadership roles by the Vatican. “The Catholic church is one of the last great bastions of misogyny. It’s an empire of misogyny,” McAleese told reporters. “There are so few leadership roles currently available to women. Women do not have strong role models in the church they can look up to.” She said a church hierarchy that was “homophobic and anti-abortion is not the church of the future”. McAleese, a keynote speaker at the Voices of Faith conference, was refused approval by the Vatican, forcing organisers to relocate the event to another venue in Rome. No reason was given for the refusal, but McAleese is a vocal advocate for women’s and LGBT rights. Two other women invited to speak at the event were also refused Vatican accreditation. Chantal Goetz, one of the conference organisers, said: “We feel we have reached a crisis point. Young people leave the church in alarming numbers. We watch the exodus of talented, educated young women.” Speaking of strikes, here’s Ada Colau, mayor of Barcelona, on why she is joining the nationwide feminist strike in Spain today: To show that without women the world really does stop … As people in public positions, we have the duty to mobilise on behalf of those who can’t go on strike. This is the century of women and of feminism; we’ve raised our voices and we won’t stop. No more violence, discrimination or pay gap! On the first day of the UN Decade for Women in 1975, the women of Iceland took the day off to demonstrate the importance of all their work, waged and unwaged, in the countryside and the city. Almost all women who were physically able came out of their homes, offices and factories, and even female television presenters were replaced on the screen by men holding children. Some 90% of women took part. They called it a day off but we at the International Wages for Housework Campaign called it a strike, and took as our slogan their placard which said: “When women stop, everything stops” … But how can you strike if you can’t risk being sacked or endangering those you care for? This has always been the dilemma, especially of the carer on whom vulnerable people depend. In countries such as Spain, where there is general recognition of the strike validity and even union backing, it’s easier for women to walk out for at least part of the day – hundreds of thousands are expected to do just that. Where such support is not yet forthcoming, women can still publicise our situation and what we want changed in call-ins and letters to the press, returning from lunch even 10 minutes late, banging pots in the streets or at the window, as women in Spain did against the 2003 Iraq war. New figures from the TUC published today show that women in the UK effectively work the first 67 days of the year for no pay, thanks to the gender pay gap. When all workers, full and part-time, are included, the pay gap is 18.4%. But in education, it’s 26.5%, meaning it will be 7 April before the average female worker in the sector is earning the same as the average male worker. Hundreds of South Koreans are staging a protest in support of the #MeToo movement on International Women’s Day, Associated Press reports. Protesters, many wearing black and holding black signs reading #MeToo, gathered in central Seoul. They called for bringing alleged sexual offenders to justice, as well as action on other issues such as closing a gender pay gap. Since a female prosecutor’s revelation in January of workplace mistreatment and sexual misconduct, South Korea’s #MeToo movement has gained major traction. The list of women who speak out is growing daily. Several high-profile men have resigned from positions of power, including a governor who was a leading presidential contender before he was accused of repeatedly raping his secretary. Here’s British PM Theresa May’s message for International Women’s Day in which she flags many of the prominent women now in positions of power in the UK, 100 years after some women won the right to vote. May has also written for the Guardian today setting out details of the government’s new domestic violence bill, which will extend the definition to include financial abuse, and proposes electronically tagging those suspected of abuse. More than a thousand female aid workers from around the world have signed an open letter calling for urgent reform across the humanitarian sector, reports Rebecca Ratcliffe: The letter, addressed to the leaders of international charities, the UN and donors, urges organisations to treat allegations of sexual harassment and abuse as a priority. Whistleblowers must be listened to and protected, said the signatories. “Trust in our sector can only be restored when we ask and answer the difficult questions and openly challenge those who exploit and hide behind the good work of many,” read the letter, which has the backing of 1,111 female aid workers from 81 different countries. “It is the behaviour of these men, not our complaint of their behaviour, which damages the sector’s reputation and public trust.” The aid sector is reeling from allegations that charities including Oxfam, Save the Children and the UN mishandled claims of sexual misconduct. At a summit in London this week, the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, described the revelations as a “wake-up call” for the sector, and called on delegates to establish an independent body to ensure standards and scrutiny. Thursday’s letter warns of the need for action rather than words. “We are gravely concerned that the culture of silence, intimidation and abuse will continue as soon as the media spotlight on this issue begins to dim,” said the signatories. “We need effective leadership, commitment to action and access to resources.” 8 March is also, of course, International Richard Herring Telling People On The Internet When International Men’s Day Is Day. The comedian has for several years sought out commenters who – unable to access Google or other search engines – put out an online plea on International Women’s Day: “When’s International Men’s Day, then?” The answer, as Herring cheerfully reminds them all on Twitter, is 19 November. This year, to add extra warmth to his mission, Herring is raising money for Refuge, which supports women and girls who have experienced domestic violence. Here’s his fundraising page, should you want to spur him on. Today the Irish government will publish details of the forthcoming referendum on a repeal of the abortion ban: The gathering momentum among the Irish public and its country’s politicians for liberalisation of abortion rights says much about the culture wars. It tells us they are winnable and that minds can be changed. It shows us how to campaign and reminds us that female autonomy is always in jeopardy – that the goal of every fundamentalist in a culture war is to strip the female body of autonomy, be it through virginity tests or restricting access to contraception or safe legal abortion. It is worth noting that Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party, propping up the government, is also fundamentally anti-choice … There are so many brutal stories, I don’t need to tell them, from women who cannot have cancer treatment because they are pregnant, to the everyday ones of women begging money from friends for the price of a Ryanair flight. I have been chanting “Get your rosaries off my ovaries” all my adult life. Friends in Ireland have distributed information about abortion every way they could, for at one point even the dissemination of information was criminalised. Now a diverse young population free of the Catholic church is coming to power. What has been especially significant is that this is a once-taboo issue on which politicians have changed their minds in public. A changing demographic forces change. The popular vote in favour of gay marriage showed that demographic that they could do just that. Despite the conversational shifts we’ve seen in 2018, in plenty of ways it feels as if little has changed for women: An Iranian woman who publicly removed her veil in protest against Iran’s compulsory headscarf law has been sentenced to two years in prison, the judiciary said on Wednesday. Tehran’s chief prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, who announced the sentence, did not give the woman’s identity but said she intended to appeal against the verdict, the judiciary’s Mizan Online news agency reported. Dolatabadi said the unidentified woman took off her headscarf in Tehran’s Enghelab Street to “encourage corruption through the removal of the hijab in public”. More than 30 Iranian women have been arrested since the end of December for publicly removing their veils in defiance of the law. Demands for an end to violence against women, equality in the workplace and more diverse representation in positions of power are nothing new on International Women’s Day – the cry for change is as regular as the day itself. But this year, feminists argue, could be different: people may just be listening. Since sexual harassment scandals tore through Hollywood last October, the repercussions keep on coming. In multiple workplaces, across unrelated fields, we are starting to see what change might look like. At the start of the year 300 Hollywood employees, including many high-profile stars, launched the Time’s Up legal fund to support women fighting sexual misconduct; in less than a month, all UK companies with more than 250 employees will have to report their gender pay gaps; across the globe women are confronting repressive laws and speaking up at home and at work. We asked leading feminist thinkers if they were hopeful this International Women’s Day – and what change they wanted to see. See their answers here: In Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi has made a speech today calling on women to build peaceful democracies. Aung San Suu Kyi has come under sustained criticism – most recently losing a human rights award from the US Holocaust Museum – over her failure to act in what has been described as an ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. Today she spoke of the need to ensure women’s rights. A country’s human rights values will be enhanced when women are granted their rights. Also by using women’s strength and ability, it will be supportive to the development of the economy as well. A report from the UN Population Fund at the end of 2017 found more than half of Rohingya refugees fleeing from Myanmar to Bangladesh were women and girls. In the UK, more than 100 MPs and peers from all parties have written to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, calling for women in Northern Ireland to be allowed access to abortion services locally rather than having to come to England. The letter, signed by 131 parliamentarians including eight Conservatives such as the former education secretary Justine Greening and the former chancellor Ken Clarke, the former Liberal leader David Steel and the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, follows a UN declaration that forcing women to travel for an abortion is an infringement of their human rights. With the government advertising its support for women’s rights ahead of International Women’s Day on Thursday, the timing of the letter is likely to be embarrassing. The Conservatives govern in alliance with the DUP, which opposes abortion. Abortion is allowed in Northern Ireland only if a woman’s life is at risk or there is a serious or permanent risk to her mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not seen as valid reasons for termination. Last month the UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women said thousands of women and girls in Northern Ireland faced “systematic violations of rights through being compelled to either travel outside Northern Ireland to procure a legal abortion or to carry their pregnancy to term”. Here’s one of those stories, from Rebecca Solnit, columnist and author of Men Explain Things to Me, on the quiet revolution that paved the way for #MeToo and Time’s Up: Something had shifted. What’s often overlooked is that it had shifted beforehand so that this could happen. Something invisible had made it possible for these highly visible upheavals and transformations. People often position revolution and incrementalism as opposites, but if a revolution is something that changes things suddenly, incrementalism often lays the groundwork that makes it possible. Something happens suddenly, and that’s mistaken for something happening out of the blue. But out of the blue usually means out of the things that most people were not paying attention to, out of the slow work done by somebody or many somebodies out of the limelight for months or years or decades. Today’s Guardian newspaper front page is positively bristling with women and their stories: UK Labour will fine employers who do not close their gender pay gaps, the party will pledge today. Under a Labour government, the party said all private and public employers who have 250 workers or more would not only have to audit their pay, but prove they are taking action to close the gap or face a fine from the government. The government has already introduced a legal requirement for all major employers to publish their data on gender pay and bonuses by April 2018. Labour said it would go further and impose sanctions on businesses that had significant gaps in the pay of male and female staff. Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler said the party believed companies needed to be sanctioned if they didn’t act on the data: Auditing is not enough, we need action. Some of the companies are using loopholes to get out of giving the full picture, and then there’s no real enforcement if you are found to have a huge gap. We don’t just want people to identify the pay gap, we want the pay gap to close. Spain wakes to International Women’s Day and a nationwide “feminist strike” that will see the mayors of Madrid and Barcelona, Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau, join women across the country in abandoning work – paid and unpaid – for the day. The 8 March Commission, which is coordinating the action, says in its manifesto: Today we call for a society free of sexist oppression, exploitation and violence. We call for rebellion and a struggle against the alliance of the patriarchy and capitalism that wants us to be obedient, submissive and quiet. We do not accept worse working conditions, nor being paid less than men for the same work. That is why we are calling a work strike. This morning, the all-female New Zealand Manawaora choir sang, in Te Reo Māori, a song called Nei Ra Te Karanga – I Can’t Keep Quiet – at the International Women’s Day breakfast at Wellington’s parliament house. How has the world’s most popular search engine marked International Women’s Day? Google has dedicated its trademark doodle to showcasing the female experience today, tasking 12 female artists with creating a visual narrative of a “moment, person, or event that has impacted their lives as women”. The result is 12 unique visual stories that reflect the diverse backgrounds of the artists, but all deal with fairly universal themes, including self-acceptance, ageing, the struggle for inclusion and love. You can read more about it here. As well as the doodle, Google released a rather punchy video titled Searching for Gender Equality with an accompanying data dashboard, which allows users to explore how people have been searching for topics relating to gender equality over the past year. According to Google, sexual harassment has become a top issue, being searched 99% more in the last 12 months compared with to the year before. You can explore the dashboard here. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has been tweeting a lot today about IWD and the women he says have inspired him. The Indian government’s annual economic survey, published in January, showed more than 63 million women are “missing” statistically across the country, with more than 21 million girls unwanted by their families. The skewed ratio is largely the result of sex-selective abortions, and better nutrition and medical care for boys, according to the report. “The challenge of gender is long-standing, probably going back millennia,” the report’s author, chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian, said at the time, adding that India must “confront the societal preference for boys”. Marches and demonstrations in Asia are kicking off rallies around the world to mark International Women’s Day, Associated Press reports. Hundreds of activists in pink and purple shirts protested in the Philippines against President Rodrigo Duterte, who they said is among the worst violators of women’s rights in Asia. Protest leaders sang and danced in a boisterous rally in downtown Manila’s Plaza Miranda. They handed red and white roses to mothers, sisters and widows of several drug suspects slain under Duterte’s deadly crackdown on illegal drugs. A rally for the rights of female workers was scheduled for later Thursday in central Seoul in South Korea, where a rapidly spreading #Metoo movement is galvanising support for women’s issues. Other events are planned across Asia, the Mideast, Europe and the Americas. Progress for some women can no longer come at the cost of continued exploitation and disempowerment for others, writes Molly Harriss Olson: Hidden Figures star Octavia Spencer recounted a conversation with her friend and The Help co-star Jessica Chastain about pay inequality, in which Spencer pointed out the colour pay gap. For every 77 cents a white woman makes a white man may earn a dollar, but an African American woman will earn 64 cents and a Hispanic woman 56. So for an upcoming movie starring both women, Chastain tied Spencer’s pay to hers, increasing Spencer’s pay fivefold. It was a money-where-her-mouth-is-moment – a profoundly tangible act, where anger and frustration triumphed in action instead of fading away into our common humiliation and impotency … Women who work as farmers or producers in developing countries will not benefit from black couture frocks at the Golden Globes or examinations of the pay gap in developed countries. They will not benefit from social media storms about the role of the feminist movement or definition of consent, no matter how seismic their importance. But we can still make a tangible difference; we can still have our money-where-our-mouths-are moments. Women in Nepal have been marching today to mark International Women’s Day. According to local reports, thousands took part, calling for social, economic and political equality. I’m keen to hear what readers around the world are doing to mark IWD. Do drop me a tweet @Claire_Phipps, comment below or use the Guardian Witness button at the top to share your stories. The island nation of Tonga in the south Pacific is falling far behind the UN benchmark for female representation in parliament, which aims for a minimum of 30%, reports Eleanor Ainge Roy. There are only two female politicians in the Tongan parliament, and Ofa Guttenbeil-Likiliki, director of Tonga’s Women and Children Crisis Centre, said legislative change at a state and municipal level could help address the imbalance. “Certainly Samoa was leading in the forefront,” Guttenbeil-Likiliki told Radio New Zealand. “They’ve made a constitutional amendment allowing for five floating seats to be activated at any time where there are less than five women being elected through the general election process.” According to UN Women, Tonga has no legislation in place against domestic violence, sexual harassment, human trafficking or sex tourism; and no minimum age of sexual consent. A study by the University of the South Pacific found 77% of Tongan women reported being physically or sexually abused. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Fiona Nott, CEO of Hong Kong’s Women’s Foundation, says women in the territory are still being left behind: Nott reels off the figures: in the workplace, women earn on average 22% less than men, a gap that is wider than a decade ago and wider than Singapore, the US, Britain and Australia; women represent only 13.8% of Hang Seng Index company boards – just half of the 26% in the UK; and women represent just 29% of management positions – worse than Malaysia, Canada, the US and Australia. The wage gap increases to 35% for elderly women. Meanwhile, women make up 85% of single parents living in poverty, and 30% of women drop out of the workforce due to caring responsibilities. You can read the full SCMP interview here. New Zealand’s governor general Dame Patsy Reddy has also weighed in on the months of global change under the #MeToo movement, Eleanor Ainge Roy reports from Dunedin. “In the last year we have heard women’s voices raised in the way we haven’t in a long time, and their anger is palpable,” she said. “There are still real problems in workplaces and the way power is exploited by those in positions of responsibility.” “Billboards still work,” said Oscar-winner Frances McDormand earlier this week, after activists took inspiration from her film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri to highlight the deaths in London’s Grenfell tower block fire. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is trying a similar tactic today in its IWD demands: for paid domestic violence leave and an end to gender-based violence in the workplace. It has directed its billboards at Kelly O’Dwyer, minister for women, who at a speech this week said sexual harassment and violence against women “must never be tolerated”. Eighty percent of those displaced by climate change are women, the BBC reports, citing figures from the UN. Women and girls, the UN says, are also disproportionately affected by natural disasters – though not always for “natural” reasons. Horrifyingly, women and girls were more likely to die or be injured in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami because they had not been taught how to swim or to climb trees. Books from small and independent presses dominate a very diverse shortlist for the sixth annual $50,000 Stella Prize for Australian writing by women, announced today. Miles Franklin-award winners Michelle de Kretser and Alexis Wright have both been shortlisted: de Kretser for her book of loosely linked short stories The Life to Come, and Wright for her biography of Indigenous activist Tracker Tillman. Three debut novelists also feature in the shortlist: Claire G Coleman for her novel imagining a recolonised Australia, Terra Nullius; Shokoofeh Azar for her novel The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree, written soon after the refugee author’s own release from Christmas Island; and Mirandi Riwoe’s reworking of a short story by Somerset Maugham fused with Javanese mythology, The Fish Girl. Brisbane-based author Krissy Kneen rounds out the list with An Uncertain Grace, a novel that fuses science fiction and eroticism. Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, says the theme for IWD – press for progress – is the right focus for this year, despite the country enjoying its highest ever rate of female representation in parliament. We have a pay gap in New Zealand for women, that is particularly significant as well for Māori and Pasifika women. We have incredible rates of domestic violence … Let’s remember that true equality is achieved when women are free from violence and when they have financial security. Beer company BrewDog’s attempt at satirical marketing has fallen flatter than a still ale in the tense run-up to International Women’s Day. It has been widely mocked for its attempt at addressing the gender pay gap by releasing a “new” Pink IPA with a pledge to sell it a fifth cheaper in its bars, because “women only like pink and glitter, right? #Sarcasm”. Needless to say, when you have to use a hashtag to clue people in to your “humour”, the cause is probably lost. One thing that could be celebrated though is BrewDog’s principle of discounting beer – alongside the promise to donate 20% of sales to causes that fight gender inequality. With the gender pay gap existing at all tiers of the class system, it’s appreciated when the balance is tipped in our favour, even as a gimmick. It would be nice if, maybe just for one day, 8 March 2018, feminism could trump satire, and women could get some cheap booze to celebrate. Elena del Estal has documented the lives of trafficked women in India, where hundreds of thousands of women and girls are forced into sexual and domestic slavery: Saeeda holds her youngest daughter as she talks about how she was brought to Haryana 20 years ago with her sister. “I only know that I arrived in Haryana when I was 11,” she says. “I was brought here with my sister but I haven’t seen her since we arrived.” She was sold to Azim, a widower 20 years older who already had six children by his first wife. She says she was beaten by her husband and his family. “They wanted me to obey them, and if I objected they always had the same words for me: ‘We own you because we bought you.’” In the Australian outback town of Tennant Creek, Aboriginal women and girls have marched on IWD to call for an end to alcohol-fuelled violence. Tennant Creek has been in trauma in recent weeks following the alleged sexual assault of a two-year-old girl. Family and community members have accused the Northern Territory government of ignoring their long-running pleas for help combatting high rates of alcohol and drug abuse, and of family and sexual violence. Tennant Creek saw a 23.4% increase in alcohol-related violence between December 2016 and December 2017, and a 34.3% increase in domestic assaults, according to the NT police. Across Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are up to 32 times more likely to be hospitalised due to family violence than non-Indigenous women, and children are up to seven times more likely to be the subject of substantiated child abuse or neglect than non-Indigenous children. Barb Shaw, the general manager of the Anyinginyi Health Aboriginal Corporation, told the Guardian the feeling of being a “forgotten town” was real for people in Tennant Creek, and there were major issues in the way governments cared for people in regional and remote Australia, including a lack of community policing models: The majority of our population [in Tennant Creek] is Aboriginal and they are the most vulnerable group of people in the country. It’s tough for people who live out bush and in regional towns. You’ve got to look out for different ways to provide service to look after families than in a centre like Darwin or Sydney … We’ve got families in Tennant Creek where dysfunction is at the point where parents themselves are not in the position to take that first step of taking responsibility. We’ve got to work with parents so we’re helping them get to a place to take that responsibility. In Spain, a strike by women means hundreds of trains have been cancelled on International Women’s Day, AFP reports: More than 300 trains have been cancelled on Thursday throughout Spain as workers go on strike to defend women’s rights on International Women’s Day, the country’s transport ministry announced. Some 200 intercity trains out of 568 won’t be operating, while 105 long-distance trains are cancelled, it said. The underground in Madrid will also be affected. The 24-hour strike has been called by 10 unions. Feminist groups have also asked women not to spend money and to ditch their domestic chores for the day. My colleague Eleanor Ainge Roy reports from Dunedin: Only 18% of New Zealand businesses had women in senior management roles, a global study by Grant Thornton has found, down from 20% in 2017 and 31% in 2004. This means New Zealand has dropped from being one of the top 10 countries in the world for gender equality, to number 33 out of 35 surveyed. Minister for women Julie Anne Genter said the results were surprising and “not good enough”, adding that one of the government’s priorities was closing the gender pay gap, which remained at nearly 10% in New Zealand, and 22%-26% for Māori and Pasifika women. “I believe this government has already taken some concrete action, like extending paid parental leave … but there is of course always more we can do,” Genter – who is expecting her first child in August, two months after prime minister Jacinda Ardern – told Radio New Zealand. We need to focus on Māori and Pasifika women. The lowest paid women need to be prioritised because they are the ones that are suffering the most at the moment and we have a responsibility to elevate them. Genter said raising the minimum wage would help improve women’s lives as 60% of NZ workers on minimum wage are women. While we’re on the subject of prime ministers, the British PM, Theresa May, has written for the Guardian today on violence against women: Thousands of women endure unimaginable violence and other forms of abuse every single day, often at the hands of those to whom they are closest, in the places they should be safest. I have heard many heart-rending stories, and I am determined to stop others suffering. Doing so will require a change across the whole of society in the way we think about and tackle domestic abuse … The government’s new domestic abuse bill will lead the way in bringing about the change we need. I am launching a consultation on our proposals, and we want to hear from experts, charities, frontline professionals and as many people affected by abuse, from as many walks of life, as possible. Many suffering abuse still don’t talk about what is happening to them. Not all abusive behaviour is physical. Controlling, manipulative and verbally abusive behaviour ruins lives and means thousands end up isolated, living in fear. So for the first time, the bill will provide a statutory definition of domestic abuse that includes economic abuse, alongside other non-physical abuse. May’s comments come as activists warn that women’s lives are put at risk by government cuts to funding for refuges. Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull doubly cares about International Women’s Day. Speaking just now, Turnbull conceded that Australia does not have enough women in parliament – or in his own ministry. The country has not achieved gender parity, he says, adding that a minister for women will be needed for a long time yet. On the eve of International Women’s Day, protesters in Seoul grouped outside the Japanese embassy to highlight the plight of so-called “comfort women” – a euphemism for the 200,000 girls and young women who were forced to work in Japanese brothels before and during the second world war. Protesters showed 30 images of what they called “Uncomfort Women” – representing the 30 surviving women who still live in South Korea. This is a campaign to let the world know that these women are here, the women who were called comfort women but were driven to the opposite of comfort themselves. From murderers to mermaids, the “whole wealth of experience” features on the longlist for the 2018 Women’s prize for fiction, according to chair of judges Sarah Sands, giving the lie to “that stereotype of women’s fiction”. The 16-strong longlist for the £30,000 award for “excellence, originality and accessibility in writing by women in English from throughout the world”, was announced on Thursday. The award, previously known as the Baileys prize, places two major names, Pulitzer winner Jennifer Egan and Booker winner Arundhati Roy, up against six debuts. The latter include Gail Honeyman’s Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine, which won the Costa first novel award, and Imogen Hermes Gowar’s The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock, a tale set in Georgian London in which a mermaid is captured. Topics range from Nicola Barker’s H(a)ppy, set in the far future in an apparent utopia, to Meena Kandasamy’s portrait of a violent marriage, When I Hit You: Or, A Portrait of the Writer as a Young Wife, and Sarah Schmidt’s reimagining of the Lizzie Borden murders, See What I Have Done. See the full longlist here: We are spoiling you today with live blogs about women. If you’d like to check progress of a different kind – that of USA v England in the 2018 SheBelieves Cup – take a look over here: In Vanuatu, a new photo gala will celebrate female heroes. Betty Toa, the UN Women country programme coordinator for Vanuatu, said: International Women’s Day is an incredibly important day and we are really thrilled that Vanuatu is having a national photo exhibition … where everyone can come and see our women heroes who work hard to make Vanuatu a better place for us to live in. More from New Zealand, courtesy of Eleanor Ainge Roy: Former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark – a friend and mentor to current PM Jacinda Ardern – has said being a 37-year-old unmarried leader would have been “unthinkable” at the time she entered politics and no one would even have considered having a female PM. (There have now been three in New Zealand.) Clark told the Breakfast show: In 1981, about a month before the election, Peter [Davis] and I did get married because people said ‘this is a liability, you are a de-facto couple’. You did feel that pressure, and you didn’t want to do anything to damage the party’s prospects, or your own prospects, in retaining what was a very safe and loyal Labour constituency. So, social attitudes have moved light years since then, and I think that’s a very, very good thing. As I mentioned earlier, despite the conversational shifts we’ve seen in 2018, in plenty of ways it feels as if little has changed: An Iranian woman who publicly removed her veil in protest against Iran’s compulsory headscarf law has been sentenced to two years in prison, the judiciary said on Wednesday. Tehran’s chief prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, who announced the sentence, did not give the woman’s identity but said she intended to appeal against the verdict, the judiciary’s Mizan Online news agency reported. Dolatabadi said the unidentified woman took off her headscarf in Tehran’s Enghelab Street to “encourage corruption through the removal of the hijab in public”. More than 30 Iranian women have been arrested since the end of December for publicly removing their veils in defiance of the law. For International Women’s Day the Guardian posed three questions to activists and writers who appeared at the Sydney Opera House’s All About Women festival: What’s the most pressing issue for women in 2018? #MeToo has been a huge moment, but what’s the next step? If you could have dinner with any woman, living or dead, real or fictional, past or present, who would it be and why? Read their answers in our gallery here: The 27th prime minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, has given a speech at an IWD event hosted by the Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne. Gillard made international headlines in October 2012 when she called out alleged sexism by the then opposition leader Tony Abbott in parliament. Today, Gillard, who is now chair of mental health organisation beyondblue, spoke to a group of women about mental health, the gender pay gap, and women in leadership. She said more work needed to be done on unconscious bias against women, and those researching this bias needed to be working with people in sectors where women were most poorly represented and treated. Because the reality is, in Australia and across the globe, women are not being given the opportunity to serve in equal measure to their male colleagues. This is true of the public sector and the private sector. It is true of universities, hospitals, boardrooms, courthouses and small businesses … Currently, women make up just 23% of national parliamentarians, 26% of news media leaders, 27% of judges, 15% of corporate board members and 24% of senior managers worldwide. Just over a week ago, in Washington, our prime minister Malcolm Turnbull attended a dinner with president Trump and leaders in the business community. Of the 51 attendees, there were more men named Andrew (five) than the total number of women (four) who attended the event. Gillard said the way things were going, it would take another half-century for the number of women in national parliaments to reach parity with men: And, even worse, when progress is made, it can also be reversed. Women are more under-represented in the American cabinet than at any time since the Reagan administration. Even in Nordic countries, often held up as beacons of progress, there has been a 6.2% drop in the number of female ministers since 2015 to 43.5%. It’s not just in the political world that progress has stalled. The number of women in senior management globally has risen just one percentage point in 10 years, from 24% in 2007 to 25% today. Gillard told attendees that women faced significant barriers to progress at every stage of their careers: In fact, still today, in at least 18 countries husbands can legally prevent their wives from working … How can we expect to get women into leadership positions if we can’t even get them into the workforce? More often though, the barriers are less obvious – informal rules and norms of institutions that seek to exclude women. Gillard cited research that found people were likely to correlate leadership and likability for men while doing the reverse for women. As a result, when a woman breaks through and is seen as a decisive leader, she is likely to be stereotyped an unlikeable … In the US , there is an online tool called Rate My Professor, which students use to critique their lecturers. A huge interactive exploration of 14 million reviews on the site discovered that male professors are disproportionately likely to be described as a ‘star’ or ‘genius’. Female professors are disproportionately described as ‘nasty’, ‘ugly’, ‘bossy’ or ‘disorganised’. Gillard also referred to the results of an experiment conducted at a university in North Carolina, where researchers asked students to rate teachers of an online course. The students never met the teacher in person: This enabled the researchers to present the same teacher to some students as a man and to other students as a woman. Disturbingly, when students were taking the class from someone they believed to be male, they rated the teacher more highly. The very same teacher, when believed to be female, was rated significantly lower. Given this research, the fact that gender influences perceptions seems undeniable. I’m keen to hear what readers around the world are doing to mark IWD. Do drop me a tweet @Claire_Phipps, comment below or use the Guardian Witness button at the top to share your stories. You can read the PEN international women’s manifesto here: “The vitality and beauty of literature is diminished if women’s stories are not told and when women’s voices are not heard.” My colleague Eleanor Ainge Roy reports from Dunedin: Vanisa Dhiru, president of the National Council of Women New Zealand, said the World Economic Forum’s 2017 global gender gap report suggested that gender equality could still be over 200 years away. “This is absolutely unacceptable and it’s worse for some groups of women than others, because of racism, transphobia and other forms of oppression,” said Dhiru, who said it was time for New Zealand to embrace the #MeToo and Time’s Up global movements. Recent exposure of sexual harassment of interns in one of the country’s top legal firms was a sign of progress, she added. “Kristine Bartlett being named the 2018 New Zealander of the Year, for her work on the pay equity campaign for low-paid care workers, is hugely inspirational and it gives me hope that it might not take the 200 years to reach gender equality that has been predicted.” According to Australia’s Human Rights Commission, women make up 50.2% of Australia’s population. That means that women get 50.2% of everything, right? So many women find themselves suspecting – merely on the basis of instinct, observation or just plain lived experience – that even in pretty Australia something seems desperately out of whack in regards to the statistical social, political and economic experience of women to men. So my IWD gift to you, my femme cadre, is something rare and precious you’ll never receive in an argument with a beer-garden misogynist; hard data that proves gender disadvantage is not only intersectional, but true! An artist in residence at London’s Tate gallery has resigned, saying arts institutions are failing women. Liv Wynter timed her resignation for the eve of International Women’s Day to highlight what she called the “invisible inequalities” of the art world. Wynter said she was also angered by recent comments from Maria Balshaw, the Tate director, who told the Times she had not personally experienced sexual harassment: Then, I wouldn’t. I was raised to be a confident woman who, when I encountered harassment, would say: ‘Please don’t’ … or something rather more direct.” Balshaw has since apologised for her comments, saying she had not meant to blame women for their harassment. But Wynter, in a letter to Balshaw, said the words had been a “huge slap in the face” to her: I cannot describe to you the personal shame I feel as a survivor of domestic violence, to work for someone who could think so little of me whilst simultaneously profiting off my ‘survivorness’ and the work I dare to make about it. Read the full story here: Welcome – wherever you are in the world, but particularly to those who’ve already tipped into 8 March – to our live coverage of International Women’s Day 2018. The mood this year feels different. Real change is underway: women in Saudi Arabia can now drive, or go to sports matches. Milestones have been reached: it’s 100 years since (partial) women’s suffrage in the UK. There are loud conversations around harassment, pay inequality and more. Time’s Up and #MeToo have edged beyond hashtags into palpable anger and hunger for action. In other ways, though, it feels as if little has changed. A man who bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy” sits in the Oval Office. A prime minister is asked in a TV interview when she conceived her unborn child. Women still routinely face sexual harassment at work. Reported cases of female genital mutilation continue to rise. We’ll be tracking the day here on our live blog as it rolls across the globe.

Two goals in three second-half minutes have done for Spurs. The Italian champions are through to the quarter finals, while Spurs will have to concentrate on the FA Cup. Tottenham were magnificent in the first half, with Heung-Min Son particularly impressive. They looked in control until Massimiliano Allegri changed Juve’s shape midway through the second, and almost immediately the tie turned in the Old Lady’s favour. Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala were the goalscoring heroes, but Giorgio Chiellini was surely the man of the match, a colossus at the back, thwarting all attempts by Spurs to force extra time. This will hurt Tottenham now, but Juve’s experience in this competition showed in the end ... and should Mauricio Pochettino’s men make the top four of the Premier League again, perhaps this experience will stand them in good stead next year. 90 min +3: Dybala is fouled in the midfield, needlessly by Dembele, and that will probably be that. 90 min +2: Sturaro has a dig. Nope. Spurs go up the other end. Trippier makes good down the right, but his cross is weak and straight at Buffon, who smothers. 90 min +1: There will be three added minutes. Wembley is beyond anxious. 90 min: Kane hists the post! Davies loops in from the left. Kane - who is offside, but the flag doesn’t go up, beats Chiellini in the air and heads down and to the left. The ball bounces up off the turf in slow motion, past the outstretched arm of Buffon. It hits the side of the post and bounces back across the line! Lamela can’t get there first to prod home. Instead, Barzagli hacks clear! So close to salvation! 89 min: Lichtsteiner jogs down the right wing. He’s got no interest in doing anything other than running down time. Tick, tock. 88 min: Eriksen and Llorente take desperate long-distance shots. Both are blocked. Dybala races off upfield, and is brought down by Dembele, who is booked. 87 min: Llorente’s first significant contribution is a foul on Sturaro, one which takes the pressure off Juventus’s defence, and runs some more time off the clock. 86 min: Alli is replaced by Llorente. 85 min: Son keeps a Davies cross from the left alive down the right. That’s brilliant play, because that was surely going harmlessly out for a goal kick. He pulls it back for Eriksen, whose daisycutter flies wide left. Son has been superb tonight. He certainly doesn’t deserve to be on the losing side. 84 min: Higuain, whose goal turned this tie, is replaced by Sturaro. He takes an age to depart, in the professional manner. The crowd holler their critique of this cynical ploy. 83 min: The corner is half cleared by Juve. Son is onto the ball in a flash, and sends a fine low shot inches wide of the bottom left. That wasn’t far away at all, and Buffon is livid with his defence. Son holds his face in his hands in disbelief. So close! 82 min: Davies finds a little space down the left. He curls into the Juve box. Kane is hoping to get on the end of it, but Chiellini clears brilliantly again. Davies has another go from the left. Son chests down on the right. He can’t get a shot away, so lays off for Eriksen, who aims for the top left. The ball clips off Asamoah and out for a corner on the right. Buffon was rooted to the spot there; that ball could have gone anywhere. 80 min: Juve hog the ball awhile. Spurs can’t get a sniff. The seconds whirl by. 78 min: Much better from Spurs! Eriksen sends a ball to the left for Son, who fires it low into the centre. Kane is waiting to sidefoot home from six yards, but Chiellini slides in at the last moment to hack out for a corner. The set piece leads to nothing. What defending by Chiellini! 77 min: Lamela dances his way out of a tight spot near the right-hand corner flag, and whips into the centre. But Chiellini stoops to head powerfully clear. Then there’s a suggestion that Costa handles on the edge of the box while chesting down to control. The referee isn’t interested. Finally Son dribbles purposefully down the left, but his cross doesn’t find a white shirt. Better from Spurs. 76 min: Spurs begin to edge their way into Juve territory, with the visitors happy to sit back and soak things up. Nothing doing right now. This is what Italian sides have excelled at for decades; this is a real test for Tottenham. Wembley is beginning to rediscover its collective voice, urging the home heroes to push on. 74 min: Lamela comes on for Dier. 73 min: One goal for Spurs, of course, will take this tie into extra time. It’s been to and fro pretty much from the first-leg get-go ... so is there another twist? 71 min: All of a sudden it’s Spurs who look ragged. They can’t string two passes together at the moment. Not in the Juve half anyway. They need to clear their heads and quick. Juve have shown them it can be done. 70 min: Higuain should send Costa scooting free into the Spurs box down the inside right, but can’t quite find the pass. Spurs can’t afford to concede again. 69 min: That quick-fire turnaround has sent Wembley into shock. The place was bouncing four minutes ago; now only the Italian fans are making serious noise. On the touchline, Mauricio Pochettino blows his cheeks out. That double whammy has hit him hard. Can his side respond? Wembley is on edge all right. This is so simple. Higuain takes up possession with his back to goal, 40 yards out. He draws three white shirts, spins, and plays a cute reverse pass down the middle to release Dybala! Dybala has an age to think about it, but races to the area and lashes past Lloris and into the top right! Now it’s Spurs who need to respond, or they’re heading out of the Champions League! 66 min: Spurs are still going through on away goals. But Juve’s change of formation has bolstered their midfield, and there’s been an instant dividend. Wembley is suddenly on edge. The mood changes instantly! Lichtsteiner races down the right. He crosses. Khedira, on the penalty spot, heads goalwards. The ball sails a little to the left, but Higuain nips in front of Lloris, sticks out a leg, and guides it back into the right-hand portion of the net. Game on! 62 min: Lichtsteiner comes on for Benatia. Juve revert to their back four. Then the first sign of panic all evening by Spurs. Asamoah crosses from the left. Sanchez heads weakly upfield, when Lloris was well placed to deal with the situation. The ball drops to Dybala on the right-hand corner of the box. Dybala goes for the first-time spectacular shot, but gets it all wrong. 61 min: Asamoah immediately injects some pace down the left. He slips the ball to Sandro, who curls into the Spurs box for Higuain. The striker contorts his body in mid-air, kung-fu style, but can only send the ball sailing miles over the bar. 60 min: The champions of Italy make their first change. Matuidi is replaced by Asamoah. 59 min: Pjanic is really pushing his luck. He slides in on Eriksen, late. A free kick, nothing more. The crowd are desperate for a second yellow to be flashed. Spurs get on with it instead, winning a quick corner down the left. The set piece is hit long. Kane tries to meet it at the far post with a telescopic leg, but can’t get any meaningful contact on the ball. 58 min: Eriksen spreads a lovely ball wide left for Son, who cuts inside and looks to caress a curler into the top right. Son gets too much on it; it’s high and wide. 57 min: Barzagli clips the back of Son’s leg. There’s no real need for it. He’s the only Juve defender still to be booked, and that’s still the case. The ref slightly lenient there. 56 min: See also: Alli. He’s booked for a high-studs prod on Khedira. A fair chance this won’t end with 22 men on the field. 55 min: The official attendance is 84,010. Most of them give Pjanic the bird as he gets involved in a silly tussle with Alli in no man’s land. Juve are in danger of losing their heads here. 53 min: Now there are pantomime boos as Chiellini cynically barges into Alli as the Spurs man looks to make off down the left. That was as cynical as they come, because Juve were light at the back and Eriksen was up with Alli, hoping to cause all sorts of trouble. Taking one for the team, in the old-fashioned Italian style. 52 min: Finally they flow forward, and Costa earns a corner down the left. But Pjanic’s dead-ball delivery is risible, hoicked over the box and out of play on the other side. Wembley gives a hearty ironic cheer. 51 min: Higuain faffs around in midfield and has the ball stolen off his toe by Vertonghen. Alli is sent scampering towards the Juve box. He shoots low, hard and wide left. Juve haven’t got going in this second half yet. They can’t afford much more of this. 49 min: Matuidi comes in late on Davies, as the Spurs man looks to launch one long down the left. There’s not much contact, so he escapes a booking, though that was fairly full on. Benatia goes in the book, though, for scraping his studs on Alli’s arse. That’s a poor challenge and - like Pjanic before him - he’ll miss Juve’s next match in Europe, whenever that is. 48 min: Incidentally, this is the first time Juve have trailed in a match since November. November! 47 min: Spurs load the box. Eriksen pulls it back, though, for Vertonghen who loops into the mixer from a different angle. He’d have probably been better shooting. The teams are back out, and we’re off again! Juve get the ball rolling for the second period, having once again given the ref what for regarding the penalty that never was. Spurs are quickly on the attack, though, Alli brought down to the left of the box by Costa. A free kick in a very dangerous position. Half-time letter. “When I don’t have a dog in the race, as it were, I tend to side with the team whose strip I like best, from a historical perspective,” writes Simon McMahon. “The Juve kit as worn by Míchel Platini takes some beating ... ... though Ricky Villa in 1981 tries hard.” Any old excuse to rifle through the photo album. Thanks Simon. And that’s the end of a first half that’s flown by. Spurs have been the better team; the goalscorer Son has been magnificent. The visitors should have had a penalty kick, mind. Anyway, here we are, and unless Juve score at least two goals in the second half, Spurs will be in the quarter finals of the European Cup / Champions League for only the third time in their history! 45 min: A bit of space for Matuidi down the left. He crosses deep for Higuain but the impressive Sanchez is in the way, and in any case the flag goes up for offside. 44 min: Pjanic picks up a yellow card for a noggin-gone wild lash in the direction of Alli. Not sure there was much contact, but that’s not really the point. Juve look rattled, and need to hear the half-time whistle to regroup. 43 min: A free kick for Juve in the Spurs half. Pjanic hooks it into the Spurs box and towards the left-hand post. Sandro meets it with his head, at close range, but it’s wild and high. 41 min: Juventus now have to score twice if they’re to stay in this year’s Champions League! Pjanic tries to pull one of the goals back immediately, with a shot from the edge of the area that sails just wide left. And now Son gets the luck he deserves! Eriksen plays Alli into the area down the inside-right channel. Alli’s shot is blocked. The ball breaks to Trippier on the right. Trippier hits low into the centre. The ball evades Eriksen, who has kept running, but Son meets it on the left. Son miskicks, but the bobble confuses Buffon and Chiellini and bounces almost apologetically into the net! Son cares not a jot and wheels off with a broad smile! 38 min: Dembele spins out of a tight spot in the centre. He’d get away, too, but Khedira has a handful of his shirt. That should be a booking, but the ref thinks a wag of the finger is enough. Spurs then launch an attack, and the irrepressible Son romps into the box down the left. He lashes a low shot across Buffon and inches wide of the right-hand post. So close! 37 min: Dembele concedes a free kick out on the left for a cheeky handball. A chance for Juve to load the box. The ball’s pumped into the Spurs area, but Sanchez rises highest to clear. 35 min: Sandro is booked for a blatant shove in the back of Trippier. This is heating up nicely in the old-fashioned style. 34 min: Kane tries to flash a spectacular shot into the top right from the left-hand corner of the Juve box. Ambitious, even for him. 33 min: Barzagli and Son tangle in the midfield. Barzagli manages to tread on Son twice, and throw in a cheeky backheel that doesn’t quite connect with his opponent, all the while acting like he’s trying to disengage. The referee didn’t see it, but Son certainly felt it. Ooyah. Now it’s Juve’s turn to get away with one. 32 min: Pjanic launches one long in the hope of releasing Higuain on goal. Sanchez steps up and plays the offside trap perfectly. Spurs go up the other end. Benatia heads clear. Alli meets the dropping ball and fires low from 20 yards. Buffon smothers. 30 min: The first slight lull of the evening. It’s been glorious entertainment so far, the Champions League at its best. 28 min: Dybala turns sharply out on the right wing and makes for the final third. Vertonghen sticks a leg across him and hacks him down. A booking. The Spurs defender looks out of sorts. That lunge on Costa, for the penalty that wasn’t given, was as clear as it gets. They’ve just shown a replay of it, and he had the chutzpah to throw a few you-went-down-easily shapes at Costa after the incident. You’ve got to brazen it out, haven’t you. 26 min: Dier is receiving some treatment after a common-or-garden clatter in the midfield. He looks pained, having fallen awkwardly. He’s up and about again after a while. 24 min: Vertonghen meets the corner with a weak header that sails harmlessly wide right. Benatia had a fistful of his shirt then! On another day, with another referee, etc. This is marvellously eventful and wildly entertaining. 23 min: Dybala has a dig from distance but Sanchez gets in the way. Spurs go up the other end, the super-dangerous Son breezing down the left yet again and shooting the minute he enters the area. The ball’s blocked out for a corner. 21 min: Dier has a whack from 25 yards. His effort dribbles towards the bottom right. Buffon falls on it like a wet blanket. The Juve keeper has been super busy. 20 min: Spurs come at Juve in the wild style. Son very nearly breaks clear into the box down the left. He can’t get a shot away so pulls back for Eriksen, whose shot is blocked. The ball’s worked out right and swung back in. Son meets the cross with a towering header, sending the ball whistling towards the top left. Buffon punches it clear. 17 min: Douglas Costa turns on the jets and burns Vertonghen down the right, and into the area. Vertonghen slides in and takes his man out. It’s a clear penalty, but neither referee nor linesman give it. Juve are beyond livid, and surround the ref, but he’s not for turning. Spurs have dodged a bullet there! 15 min: Spurs are well on top here. Dembele very nearly releases Son down the left with a deft flick, but the ball’s run out for a goal kick. Then Alli slips a pass down the right for Kane, who rounds a rash Buffon on the outside! He’s got a small gap to find the unguarded goal, but the angle’s tight and he finds the side netting. That’s a great chance for a striker of Kane’s quality, though, and so has to go down as a miss. 13 min: Kane has the ball at his feet, just inside the Juve area on the right. Chiellini slides in to block the shot that’s coming. Kane tries to shift the ball and it hits the defender’s hand. There’s a claim for a penalty, but not at great volume. The right decision, as it looked totally accidental, the whole thing happening in a tight space. 12 min: Juve knock it around the back in the old-school Italian style. But Spurs buzz and press, forcing a couple of small mistakes. Nothing comes of them, it’s all a bit scrappy, but that’s some good work by Alli and Eriksen, and it augurs well. 10 min: Son earns the first corner of the evening with a determined bustle down the left. Davies takes. The ball nearly drops to Vertonghen, then Kane, but Chiellini clears. This is fast-paced, open and fun. 9 min: Now Spurs do some final-third probing. Eriksen glides in from the right and loops a pass towards Son, just inside the Juve box on the left. The ball drops, begging to be volleyed goalwards. Son can’t time his whack. 7 min: Spurs betray their nerves for the first time tonight, Lloris putting a simple pass to Son out of play on the left. That allows Juve to probe a little in the Spurs final third. Costa sashays infield from the right and swings a fierce cross towards Higuain at the far post. Too high and too fast, the striker never had a chance. A pinpoint cross would have had Spurs in trouble, though, because Higuain had a little space to work in there. 5 min: Alex Sandro hoicks a long pass down the left with a view to releasing Matuidi into acres of space. Spurs are a bit stretched at the back, but the pass is way too heavy and Matuidi doesn’t have a hope of latching onto it. 3 min: It’s a fast start by Spurs all right. Son makes good down the left but can’t find Kane in the middle. No matter, he’s soon coming at Juve again down the same flank. This time he enters the area and from a tight angle lashes a shot towards the bottom left. Buffon parries with a strong arm, and the ball flies out to the other flank. The danger is over, but Juve are on the back foot here. And we’re off! Spurs kick off, and try to repeat the grift they pulled on Manchester United. Alli is into the Juve box in short order, but Benatia is wise to it and wins a clearing header. The header clanks off the defender’s arm, and there’s a half-hearted penalty shout. But the referee rightly waves play on. “So should I guarantee a Kane hat trick by calling him a donkey before the match starts?” wonders Gareth Beale, who had a rush of blood during half time of the recent Rochdale MBM. “It worked for Llorente, but then Harry doesn’t need my help - COYS!” Before we start, a perfectly observed minute’s silence for Davide Astori of Fiorentina, who tragically passed away last weekend. It melts into warm applause. RIP Davide. The teams are out! A wonderful atmosphere greets the players at Wembley. It’s a big game, with a noise to match. Spurs are in their famous lilywhite shirts, which means the champions of Italy are forced out of their storied zebra stripes and into second-choice yellow. We’ll be off in a minute, once pennants have been swapped, hands shaken, and the memory of poor old Zadok the Priest treated with terrible disrespect. Whispers suggest Juve are going to give their usual 4-3-3 system a good old shoogle. They’ll be playing three at the back: Chiellini, Benatia and Barzagli, with Douglas Costa and Alex Sandro working hard out on the wings. We’ll see soon enough. Pre-match words from Mauricio Pochettino! “We are in a very good moment, with good momentum and very good form. But the reality today is completely a different game. We need to show our quality. It was important to get the 2-2 result, it was fantastic. But at this level, against Juventus, you cannot start a game like we started that game in Turin. I hope we start strong, of course, trying to go forward and trying to win the game. Son has showed good quality and the capacity to score goals in the last games. Lamela is also fantastic, it is a very good problem for a manager to have.” Pre-match admin. If you’re not a subscriber yet - and why not, it’s only been going since 1998 - you could do worse than signing up to The Fiver, our daily email of football chit and soccer chat. Today’s edition will even save you the job of scrolling down the page and reading the preamble to this MBM. Pre-match listening: While we’re killing time before kick off, we could listen to the pundits on the television yammer on about this match, filling time, always filling time. Or we could cock an ear in the direction of Rob Smyth, Lee Calvert and a host of other experts reminiscing about their (and your) salad days. It’s a no-brainer! Spurs make two changes to the team they sent out in Turin three weeks ago. Kieran Trippier replaces the suspended Serge Aurier, while Heung-Min Son relegates Erik Lamela to the bench. Juve make three changes from their first-leg starting XI. Mattia De Sciglio, Mario Mandzukic and Federico Bernardeschi are unavailable; in come Andrea Barzagli, Blaise Matuidi and Paulo Dybala. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Trippier, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Davies, Dier, Dembele, Eriksen, Alli, Son, Kane. Subs: Vorm, Rose, Wanyama, Sissoko, Lamela, Moura, Llorente. Juventus: Buffon, Barzagli, Benatia, Chiellini, Sandro, Khedira, Pjanic, Matuidi, Dybala, Higuain, Costa. Subs: Szczesny, Marchisio, Asamoah, Rugani, Lichtsteiner, Sturaro, Bentancur. Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland). Tottenham Hotspur are a huge club. A famous club. One of England’s grandest institutions. They’ve got a European pedigree to match, having been the first British club to land a trophy on the continent – the 1963 Cup Winners Cup – and the winners of two Uefa Cups since. But their record in the big one constitutes a gap on the honours board: a narrow semi-final defeat to Benfica in 1962 and a quarter-final thumping by Real Madrid in 2011 is all they’ve got to show in the European Cup. So getting through to the quarters this year would be a feat not to be sniffed at. Mauricio Pochettino’s side may be one of the best teams in Europe right now ... but history can be a burden, so one step at a time. The quarters are tantalisingly close, though. Spurs may have already beaten reigning champions Real Madrid and done for much-fancied Borussia Dortmund this season, but Juventus still looked quite the hurdle when these clubs were paired in the Round of 16. The Old Lady has made two of the last three finals, after all. And when Gonzalo Higuain scored twice in the first nine minutes of the first leg ... well. But look at how Spurs fought back through Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen! A draw, two away goals, advantage Tottenham. If Europe didn’t know it before, they certainly know now: Spurs are the real deal. The historical stats are heavily in their favour tonight. They’re unbeaten at home in seven matches against Italian opponents. They’ve won 80 percent of their two-legged against teams from Serie A. And they’ve won all six European ties in which they’ve drawn the away first leg. Meanwhile Juve have lost their last five two-legged knockout ties against English clubs, most recently against Roy Hodgson’s Fulham inthe 2010 Europa League. And their overall record away in England is not great at all: won three, drawn six, lost 12. In this respect, a glory, glory night looks on the cards for Spurs. Thing is, two-time European champions Juventus are a pretty darn big deal as well. And the Bianconeri will grasp at a couple of significant straws: they’ve won all but two of the eight European rubbers in which they’ve drawn the first leg at home. And they’re unbeaten in three in England, having lost the previous seven. Oh, and the fact that they’re a sensational side themselves: they’ve won 14 of their last 15 matches, scoring 30 times and letting in just three ... and despite it all, would have beaten Spurs at home had Higuain’s penalty been just a couple of inches lower. No biggie, then, Tottenham. So it’s fair to say that this one is firmly in the balance. Both teams will go into it with confidence high; both will be trading on expectation more than hope.

Scotland Yard assistant chief commissioner Mark Rowley said the police officer who was first to the spot where Skripal was found in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon was “seriously ill” in hospital. His condition had deteriorated, Rowley said, adding: “Wiltshire police are providing full support to his family.” Describing the poisoning as a major incident, Rowley said scientists had identified the substance used. He refused to reveal what the specific poison was. All three were suffering from “exposure to a nerve agent”. Detectives now believed that Sergei and Yulia Skripal were specifically targeted, he added, in a deliberate act. They remain critically ill in hospital. Although further details are awaited, the suspicion in Downing Street will be that the Kremlin has attempted another brazen assassination operation on British soil. Moscow will furiously deny involvement, but Theresa May will have to consider how the government might respond should the police and other evidence point to Russia and its multiple spy outfits. Unlike in the case of Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned with a slow-acting radioactive cup of tea, detectives got to the scene in Salisbury quickly. Hundreds of officers were now working around the clock, Rowley said. They were examining CCTV footage from the city centre and building a detailed timeline of events, he added. An unidentified man and a woman spotted strolling in the alleyway close to the bench where Skripal was poisoned are likely to be of intense police interest. The woman has blond hair and was holding a large scarlet bag. CCTV captured them around the time Skripal collapsed. The man appears much thinner than Skripal, who was recorded on CCTV on 27 February, buying milk and lottery scratchcards from a local shop, Bargain Stop. Rowley urged anyone who visited Salisbury city centre and who had not spoken to detectives to get in touch. He appealed to the public to send any images or footage from the area to the police website. Scientists at Porton Down have assisted in the investigation, which is being led by Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, SO15, with significant help from the intelligence agencies. The investigation comprises multiple strands. Among them is whether there is any more of the nerve agent in the UK, and where it came from. Intelligence sources said on Wednesday they were so far maintaining an open mind about motives and where responsibility for the attack rested. The medical and chemical evidence and the effects on the victims point to a sophisticated nerve toxin. The best known are VX and sarin. Chemical weapons experts said it was almost impossible to make nerve agents without training and dismissed the theory that an amateur could have assembled the substance using materials obtained from the internet. “This needs expertise and a special place to make it or you will kill yourself. It’s only a small amount, but you don’t make this in your kitchen,” one said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer at the UK’s chemical, biological and nuclear regiment, said nerve agents such as sarin and VX had to be made in a laboratory. He said it was a complicated task: “Not even the so-called Islamic State could do it.” Richard Guthrie, another chemical weapons expert, said: “Nerve agents, such as sarin or VX, require some fairly complicated chemistry using certain highly reactive chemicals. Small quantities could be made in a well-equipped laboratory with an experienced analytical chemist. To carry out the reactions in a domestic kitchen would be essentially impossible. Moreover, sarin is odourless, colourless and tasteless. Any tiny leaks of its vapour would be potentially fatal.” Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said on Wednesday the risk to public health from the incident was low. Decontamination work has been undertaken to make areas feared to have been affected by the poison safe. The cabinet’s most pressing problem is how to formulate a political response if the trail – once again – leads back to Moscow. In previous eras, it might have been possible for rogue elements to lay their hands on toxic substances. But it is now unlikely that any operation to murder a defector could originate in Russia without a degree of official permission. One former senior Foreign Office adviser suggested the Kremlin was taking advantage of the UK’s lack of allies in the US and EU, and its inability to do much about the Skripal case. He said the British government was in a “weaker position” than in 2006 when the two assassins sent by the FSB spy agency poisoned Litvinenko using radioactive polonium. The adviser said the use of a nerve agent suggested a state operation, adding that its deployment in the centre of a sleepy cathedral city on a Sunday afternoon was “brazen”. “It says a lot about how seriously [the Russians] take us that they feel able to do something like this,” the former adviser said. Sources close to British intelligence said further toxicology tests would be key in the days ahead. They warned that other factors or triggers might have been involved. There was renewed activity in Salisbury on Wednesday afternoon as around a dozen police cars, fire engines and ambulances arrived in the city centre. Attention was focused on Sarum House, next door to the Zizzi restaurant, one of the locations sealed off by police. A dark-haired woman was escorted out by police officers and put in an ambulance. Skripal and Yulia, 33, were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. It has emerged that the pair had been in the city centre since 1.30pm, almost three hours before they collapsed. The Metropolitan police said on Tuesday that due to the “unusual circumstances” its counter-terrorism unit would lead the investigation. Officers are keen to speak to anyone who visited Zizzi restaurant on Castle Street and the Bishop’s Mill pub in the Maltings, both premises the Skripals are believed to have visited. Speaking earlier, Rowley said: “Working alongside Wiltshire police and partner agencies, we continue to carry out extensive inquiries. This investigation is at the early stages and any speculation is unhelpful at this time. “The focus at this time is to establish what has caused these people to become critically ill. We would like to reassure members of the public that this incident is being taken extremely seriously and we currently do not believe there is any risk to the wider public.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/mar/09/bombshell-the-hedy-lamarr-story-review-alexandra-dean","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story review – startling life of the film star/inventor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/09/bombshell-the-hedy-lamarr-story-review-alexandra-dean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/mar/09/bombshell-the-hedy-lamarr-story-review-alexandra-dean","fields":{"headline":"Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story review – startling life of the film star/inventor","bodyText":"There can hardly be any more extraordinary story from the Hollywood golden age than that of Hedy Lamarr; a very beautiful star with a moderate acting talent but an untutored brilliance in science and engineering that should by now be getting her compared to Nikola Tesla, or maybe even a neglected female scientist like Rosalind Franklin. Her tragedy was that she was in the wrong business, precisely that business that promotes beauty over brains – the movie business. Alexandra Dean’s excellent and important documentary about her is very instructive – a parable of modern sexual politics and assumptions about science. Even now, many can’t believe in their hearts that movie star Hedy Lamarr really was a scientist, or scientist manqué. The accomplishment simply doesn’t square with the accepted female star biography narrative into which Lamarr otherwise fits: movies, husbands, poignant reclusive decline etc. Many film encyclopedias and reference books simply omit what was important about Hedy Lamarr. As a Jewish refugee from Hitler’s Austria and already a celebrity on account of her nude appearance as a teenager in the steamy German film Ecstasy, Hedy Kiesler (with her new stage name “Lamarr”) was signed up by Louis B Mayer. It was in the 40s that Lamarr pursued inventing in her spare time after a hard day in the studio. And, without any of the official support and funding that was lavished on a battalion of unproductive dunderheads and with some hobbyist equipment given to her by Howard Hughes, she contributed to a discovery that was to change the course of the 20th century. With her friend, composer George Antheil, she submitted a patent for a secure communications “frequency hopping” technology that the US Navy was to use after the patent’s lapse without paying her (or him) and that was to become the basis for Bluetooth and wifi. Lamarr was to die in near poverty, while her invention was worth billions. Finally, due to some gallant investigative reporting from Forbes magazine journalist Fleming Meeks in the 90s, she was given some recognition. But no money. What more might this remarkable woman have achieved if she had only got some support? Well, Dean shows that she had quite a few achievements to her name. She invented the ski resort of Aspen, Colorado, by noticing this place’s resemblance to Austria and the great skiing possibilities – she bought a chalet there and sowed the seeds for what it was to become. Lamarr also, arguably, invented modern cosmetic surgery in her decline by telling the doctors where and how incisions should be made. She always had a certain worldly style and feline sexiness, and a sprightly cosmopolitan elegance that she had brought over from the Freud/Zweig-era Vienna of her girlhood. It entranced a generation of male moviegoers, though was never quite in the Dietrich or Garbo class. Lamarr knew that the movies she was being cast in were mostly pretty forgettable. So she started co-producing her own films – again, an almost unheard-of innovation in that male mogul world – including the madly ambitious but financially ruinous Loves of Three Queens (1954) in which she played Helen of Troy, Empress Josephine and medieval myth-heroine Genevieve of Brabant. She never had any serious prizes to her name, although she was recognised by something called the Golden Apple awards, which, incredibly, were to recognise “good behaviour” in entertainers and which actually ran until 2001. In 1949, Hedy Lamarr won its “Sour Apple” prize for least cooperative actress. And all the time she was pursuing inventions, suggesting aircraft design modifications to Hughes and enduring multiple marriages and divorces, all of which ended badly – especially when, already unbalanced by the “speed” pills the studio had required her to take for the work schedule and a somewhat imperious manner, she bizarrely sent her on-set body double to testify in the divorce court on her behalf. The judge was not impressed. The money and the work dried up. Lucille Ball – to whom she did have a faint facial resemblance – mocked her cruelly on TV. The film shows us a stilted TV appearance on The Merv Griffin Show, with Woody Allen, to promote a ghosted autobiography the very existence of which she appears to disdain. Lamarr was an enigma: a great brain trapped in a silly, spurious image of glamour, while her real talent was allowed to wither. A sad but fascinating story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/07/worsening-life-expectancy-drives-legal-general-profit-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T19:56:32Z","webTitle":"Worsening life expectancy drives Legal & General profit rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/07/worsening-life-expectancy-drives-legal-general-profit-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/07/worsening-life-expectancy-drives-legal-general-profit-rise","fields":{"headline":"Worsening life expectancy drives Legal & General profit rise","bodyText":"A slowdown in improvements in life expectancy in Britain has driven a sharp rise in annual profits at the insurance and pensions firm Legal &amp; General. Worsening life expectancy means insurers need to set aside less cash for pension payments and allowed L&amp;G to release £332m of reserves last year it had previously held back to pay customers. Operating profit at the firm, which manages pensions for 1.1 million people, jumped 32% to £2.1bn in 2017 after the release of the “mortality” reserves, beating City expectations. “People aren’t dying quicker … but [the figures] aren’t improving quite as quickly,” L&amp;G’s chief financial officer Jeff Davies told reporters. “We are factoring in a slightly lower life expectancy.” The century-long rise in UK life expectancy has stalled in recent years, with experts blaming a number of factors such as rising obesity, dementia, stress, a lack of exercise and alcohol intake, as well as the government’s austerity drive that has led to cuts in health and social spending. “The rate of increase in life expectancy in the UK has slowed in recent years,” the Office for National Statistics said in September when it released its latest data for 2014-2016. It showed the average life expectancy for a child born in that period was 79.2 years for males and 82.9 years for females. Improvements in life expectancy for men have more than halved from 13.6 weeks a year between 1980 to 1982 and 2009 to 2011, to six weeks a year between 2010 to 2012 and 2014 to 2016; for women improvements have slowed from 10 weeks to 3.6 weeks a year for the same periods. But L&amp;G’s chief executive Nigel Wilson has pointed out that rising mortality rates also mean it has to pay out on life insurance policies earlier. In August, the company said it had changed its assumption for mortality rates but had not made any changes to the tables it uses – its longevity assumptions for the future. It has now moved to a different mortality table and continues to monitor the situation, a spokesman said. On this basis, its male customers aged 65 are expected to live a further 23.5 years rather than 23.6 as before, while women are now assumed to live a further 24.6 years, rather than 24.8. L&amp;G’s customers have a longer life expectancy than the UK population because they are wealthier than the average. If L&amp;G decides to shift again to a new table called CMI 2017, there would be a further, similar release of mortality reserves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/07/tina-tchen-grammys-diversity-task-force-recording-academy","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T12:00:08Z","webTitle":"Michelle Obama's former chief of staff to run Grammys diversity task force","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/07/tina-tchen-grammys-diversity-task-force-recording-academy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/07/tina-tchen-grammys-diversity-task-force-recording-academy","fields":{"headline":"Michelle Obama's former chief of staff to run Grammys diversity task force","bodyText":"The Recording Academy has appointed Tina Tchen, who served as chief of staff to former first lady Michelle Obama, to establish an independent taskforce to address diversity in the music industry, Billboard reports. Comprising up to 20 members, the group will focus on identifying “the various barriers and unconscious biases faced by underrepresented communities throughout the music industry and, specifically, across Recording Academy operations and policies”, the academy said in a statement. The move follows criticism over the academy’s response to the lack of female representation at the 2018 Grammy awards. Out of 86 categories, only 17 awards were won by female artists, with just one – best new artist Alessia Cara – featured in the television broadcast. Recording Academy president Neil Portnow suggested that women artists needed to “step up” in order to achieve recognition. He later apologised for his remarks and announced the formation of a taskforce. Portnow said of Tchen’s appointment: “The fact that she lacks business ties to the music industry ensures her objectivity as chair. In this moment, the Recording Academy can do more than reflect what currently exists; we can help lead the industry into becoming the inclusive music community we want it to be – a responsibility that the board and I take seriously. Tina Tchen is an accomplished advocate for women and impact-oriented leader versed in convening disparate stakeholders for a common purpose.” Tchen worked as part of the Obama administration for its eight-year duration, serving as an assistant to the president, executive director of the White House Council on Women and Girls, and as chief of staff to the first lady. Currently a partner with the law firm Buckley Sandler LLP in Chicago, Tchen was also instrumental in establishing the Time’s Up Legal Defence Fund, which provides legal support to victims of sexual harassment, assault and abuse in the workplace. She previously worked with the Recording Academy on the White House’s In Performance televised music series. “More than any individual person, the most important thing is that we need to look systemically at these issues and work together on systemic change,” Tchen told Billboard. “It takes everyone in a company, everyone in an institution, everyone in an industry to pull together to make these changes happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/mar/16/star-wars-legion-perfectly-captures-the-sagas-heart-pounding-battles","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T11:54:39Z","webTitle":"Star Wars: Legion perfectly captures the saga's heart-pounding battles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/16/star-wars-legion-perfectly-captures-the-sagas-heart-pounding-battles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/16/star-wars-legion-perfectly-captures-the-sagas-heart-pounding-battles","fields":{"headline":"Star Wars: Legion perfectly captures the saga's heart-pounding battles","bodyText":"Star Wars: Legion 2 players, 60-120 minutes, ages 14+, £79.99 Designer: Alex Davy From the snow-covered wastes of Hoth to the thick forests of Endor, battle scenes have provided some of the most exciting moments in the Star Wars saga. And if you’ve ever wanted to lead forces of stalwart troops into a storm of laser fire, the upcoming Star Wars: Legion offers the chance to become an elite general in a galaxy far, far away. The game hands players command of plastic infantry units and vehicles, which you’ll assemble and paint, Airfix-style, before deploying them to your kitchen table. You’ll maneuver them painstakingly around the battlefield, rolling dice to determine how they perform in combat. Legion lovingly recreates everything fans most fondly recall from the original films: Luke Skywalker’s swashbuckling heroism, Darth Vader’s implacable menace, stormtroopers’ inability to hit Han Solo at close range. As you play, you’ll almost be able to hear the thrum of lightsabers and the crunch of explosions. It all combines to create an incredibly cinematic atmosphere. It’s also a deep and absorbing tactical challenge. You’ll have to play to your strengths and your opponent’s weaknesses, picking off their biggest threats and hitting them where they are least capable of resisting your attacks. This strategic depth inevitably makes for a complex game, and it will take a little while to get your head around its systems for issuing orders and attacking enemies. But if you’re a tactically minded Star Wars fan, this is a tantalising chance to immerse yourself in the series’ pulse-pounding action. And with a line of new troops, leaders and vehicles set for release, it’s a universe that’s only going to expand. Star Wars: Legion will be released on 22 March 2018. Photosynthesis 2 - 4 players, 30 - 60 minutes, ages 10+, £37.99 Designer: Hjalmar Hach If blasting your friends with laser cannons is a little too bloodthirsty for you, Photosynthesis might be more up your street. Players take control of species of trees, all vying to dominate a woodland canopy. You’ll compete to plant seeds in prime spots on the forest floor, growing your tiny saplings into towering giants. It might all sound very sedate and gentle, but this is a game as fiercely competitive as natural selection itself. You’ll need to aggressively seize space on the board, thinking several moves ahead and cutting off opportunities for your rivals. You’ll aim to tower over your opponents’ trees, soaking up life-giving sunlight while casting them into shadow. It’s simple and elegant, but it squeezes some real thought out of its straightforward design. It’s also visually striking. As you play, you’ll place three-dimensional cardboard trees on the board, creating a dense, colourful forest. It’s a pleasing combination of looks and brains, and it will bring you back to the table time and time again. Sakura 2 - 6 players, 20 - 40 minutes, ages 10+, £21.99 Designer: Reiner Knizia Set in feudal Japan, Sakura casts players as artists vying to paint portraits of the emperor as he wanders through his palace garden during the annual cherry blossom festival. You’ll try to shove your way to the front of the pack, getting close enough to capture the ruler’s likeness. But push too hard and there’s a risk that you’ll accidentally barge into him, bringing unbearable dishonour to your name. The game revolves around a simple system of cards. You’ll choose one from your hand to play on each round, moving your painter along a winding path and budging rivals out of your way. But you’ll have to think carefully about how you position yourself. Getting too close too soon makes it easy for an unscrupulous player to nudge you into the emperor’s path, costing you precious points. It’s light, quick and simple, rewarding ruthlessness and sharp elbows, and artist Kevin Hong’s visuals look like something from a luscious Studio Ghibli animation. But with smaller groups of players, its hectic rugby-scrum atmosphere starts to evaporate, and you’ll need four or more for the game to really shine. What have you been playing this month?

Alexie, who has won a National Book Award and a PEN/Faulkner prize for his writing, issued an apology last week in the wake of a series of anonymous and unspecified allegations of harassment. Although at that point no women had spoken on the record to the media, Seattle author Litsa Dremousis alleged on Twitter that a number of women had been in touch with her to recount their stories. Alexie’s statement said: “Over the years, I have done things that have harmed other people, including those I love most deeply. To those whom I have hurt, I genuinely apologise. I am so sorry.” But he rejected what he called “the accusations, insinuations and outright falsehoods” of Dremousis, with whom he once had a romantic relationship. Now three writers have gone on the record to US broadcaster NPR, which said it had spoken to 10 women in total about Alexie, but that the majority wished to remain anonymous. According to NPR, “the women said Alexie had traded on his literary celebrity to lure them into uncomfortable sexual situations”, with his alleged behaviour “ranging from inappropriate comments both in private and in public, to flirting that veered suddenly into sexual territory, unwanted sexual advances and consensual sexual relations that ended abruptly”. Alexie, author of the bestselling young adult novel The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, did not respond to what NPR said were multiple attempts to contact him. Native American writer Erika Wurth told NPR she first met Alexie when she was 22, and that a year later he asked her to one of his readings, before trying to kiss her and inviting her to his room. “He’s kind of taking my clothes off and kissing me,” she told NPR. “And I’m trying to convince myself this is OK. It’s not working, and eventually I say, because I am kind of scared of this situation: ‘I’m a virgin.’ But it got really weird, because then he’s still trying to work me over, and I’m just stock still, and I think at that point, in my opinion, he realised that if he wanted to have sex with me he would have to violate me, he’d have to rape me. And he did stop.” A second sexual encounter years later also ended badly, reported NPR, and she subsequently cut ties with him. Author Elissa Washuta said that Alexie told her that “he could have sex with me if he wanted to” when they were out in a group of people. “But he used a stronger word, beginning with F. You know, he had not said it quietly, he had not whispered it. It seemed that the men we were talking to could have heard it. I couldn’t believe that somebody would say something to me like that. This older man who I didn’t know, who was much more powerful than me.” Poet and teacher Jeanine Walker said that she had become friendly with Alexie after she arranged for him to visit a class and he subsequently asked her to send him a manuscript of her poetry. After they played basketball together, she went to get changed and found him “right behind me, and just like physically very much in my space … He leaned toward me and said, ‘Can I kiss you?’ I said no and backed away, and he kept moving forward and was like, laughing and smiling and sweaty and whatever, and he said, ‘It’s just, we’re playing basketball, you remind me of the girlfriends I had in high school.’ And I just said, ‘Well, we’re not in high school, Sherman.’” Walker said Alexie later apologised. After the allegations about Alexie surfaced last month, the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe announced that it would be renaming its Sherman Alexie scholarship. Alexie is one of a handful of young adult authors recently accused of sexual harassment, with Maze Runner writer James Dashner dropped by his UK and US publishers after accusations surfaced online. Thirteen Reasons Why author Jay Asher was dropped by his literary agency after he was accused, although a spokesperson denied the allegation and said there had been no finding of sexual harassment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/07/google-free-voice-calling-landline-mobile-phone-numbers-uk-wifi","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T10:08:04Z","webTitle":"Google to provide free UK phone calls through Home smart speaker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/07/google-free-voice-calling-landline-mobile-phone-numbers-uk-wifi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/07/google-free-voice-calling-landline-mobile-phone-numbers-uk-wifi","fields":{"headline":"Google to provide free UK phone calls through Home smart speaker","bodyText":"Google has started offering free voice calls through its Home smart speakers to UK landlines and mobile phones, bringing it in line with US offerings.

But at the start of Gemma Bodinetz’s new production – the first in the Everyman company’s 2018 season – the lights come up on flowers, torn out of the fertile earth by chancers hoping to make a killing. One of these restless gold-hunters is Ben Rumson (Patrick Brennan), who strikes a vein in the musical’s first scene. Soon, the prospecting town named after him is a stew of dust, greed and testosterone. It’s 400 men to one woman – Rumson’s young daughter, Jennifer (Emily Hughes), blissfully oblivious to the ogles and leers – and something’s got to give. Paint Your Wagon is of its time, doubly stained by the sexism of both its 1850s setting and the 1950s when it was written. This is a world in which women are property, to be sold off at auctions or in card games. Bodinetz needles at the dodgy gender politics, using cross-casting – a necessity if the company of 14 are to fill all the roles – to subvert traditional expectations of masculinity and femininity. There’s also an implicit critique of the harmful acquisitiveness of men like Rumson, who rip up the earth in search of treasure. The piece is performed by a rep company of all-rounders, not a cast of seasoned musical theatre performers, and it occasionally shows. But Bodinetz’s production plays on its rough-hewn charm, which matches the rustic simplicity of the set. Likewise, Tom Jackson Greaves’ choreography works cleverly with the ordinariness of these bodies, never attempting to stage high-kicking Broadway set pieces. In one startling sequence, simple gestures of reaching and clutching brilliantly capture the itch of loneliness on the prairie. Despite the 1969 film version starring Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood, Paint Your Wagon has become as neglected as post-boom Rumson. It’s an image of a lost world, with many features – misogyny, racism, intolerance – that are best left in the wilderness.

It was the summer of 1992, a few weeks into shooting Super Mario Bros: The Motion Picture and the atmosphere on set was febrile. Endless rewrites and script splices had scrambled the story and dialogue. Producers, writers and investors were all working at cross purposes with the directors, the British couple Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton. On set, there were 300 extras waiting to film the next scene. The lines Hopper was about to deliver had been changed at the last moment, and not for the first time. He was dressed as a humanoid dinosaur, heavily made up in the sweltering North Carolina heat, his hair gelled into a weird row of reptilian spikes. “We’re in the bedroom of King Koopa’s skyscraper; it’s a big set,” recalls actor and co-star Richard Edson. “Dennis comes in and he’s looking pissed off. He’s mumbling to himself, he won’t look at anyone. So the directors ask, ‘What’s up Dennis?’” Something was about to go horribly wrong. The incendiary actor-director, who had unapologetically told everyone he had taken the role for money alone, stood amid the grandeur of his character’s penthouse suite and exploded. “He just starts screaming at Annabel and Rocky,” recalls Edson. “He’s telling them they’re completely unprofessional, that he’s never seen anything like this. Rocky says ‘Dennis, what is it?’ And he yells: ‘You rewrote my lines! You call this writing? This is shit! It’s shit! And the fact you’d do it without asking me?’ He went on and on. He couldn’t control himself. “This went on for 45 minutes. The producers were looking at their watches, Rocky and Annabel were looking at each other, like, what the fuck can we do? The actors were like, oh my God, this is amazing, this is better than the movie. Finally, they say: let’s go to lunch – but lunch turns out to be another two hours of Dennis screaming at the directors and producers about the state of movie making. Meanwhile, there are 300 extras waiting for the next scene. Rocky and Annabel start begging him – they’re like, Dennis, please tell us what you want, we’ll do anything. “But he wasn’t through yelling at them. People were knocking at the door, producers were going out trying to tell people what the fuck was going on. Finally, Rocky and Annabel said, ‘Look, you rewrite the scene, or we’ll go back to the original, whatever you want.’ And finally he goes: ‘OK, we’ll do the scene the way it’s written now.’ Everyone sighs, we go back three and a half hours after it was meant to be done, we do the scene exactly the way it was written when he started.” This anecdote reveals a lot about the making of the Super Mario Bros movie, which has slipped into cinematic legend for all the wrong reasons. But though it was a disaster in several different ways, it was not the creative washout that it could have been. The film’s strange cyberpunk tone, its epic dystopian sets and combination of computer-generated effects and traditional animatronics were groundbreaking and remain visually arresting – but none of it had very much to do with Super Mario. In 1990, the director Roland Joffé, fresh from making the critically acclaimed The Killing Fields and The Mission, wanted to get into film production. Pinpointing the massively successful Super Mario Bros video games as ripe for cinematic translation, he teamed up with Jake Eberts, an executive producer on Chariots of Fire, and flew to Japan to meet Nintendo’s then president, Hiroshi Yamauchi. There were bigger studios sniffing around the licence, and Joffé had only raised a paltry $500,000 for the rights – but he put in a good pitch and, crucially, was offering all the merchandising profits to Nintendo. A deal was struck at $2m. “They looked at the movie as some sort of strange creature, [intrigued] to see if it could walk or not,” said Joffé at the time. Very quickly, the creature started staggering. An experienced director, Greg Beeman, was brought on and then dropped, possibly because his picture Mom and Dad Save the World was picking up negative press in Hollywood. Harold Ramis and Danny DeVito were both approached to take the helm – the latter to direct and star – and both demurred. Arnold Schwarzenegger turned down the role as the turtle-like antagonist, Bowser, while Tom Hanks was briefly attached to play Luigi. But the script was the big problem. Joffé had told Nintendo he wouldn’t do “a sweet little lovey-dovey story” – he wanted a wider audience than kids. “Joffé wanted to do with Super Mario Bros what Burton had done for superheroes with Batman,” says Steven Applebaum of the website Super Mario Bros: The Movie Archive. “He wanted to redefine the characters for young adults.” The first writer to attempt a script was Barry Morrow, who’d won an Oscar for Rain Man. He wrote a kind of existential road trip with Mario as a smart older brother and Luigi as his naive savant sibling. It sounded so familiar that production staff nicknamed it “Drain Man”. Next came Jim Jennewein and Tom S Parker, who’d worked together on The Flintstones and Ri¢hie Ri¢h. Theirs was a bubblegum-bright fantasy flick set squarely in the familiar Nintendo universe. It was at least in the right ball park. Meanwhile, with no directors forthcoming, Joffé turned to Jankel and Morton, who had only made one Hollywood movie: the obscure Dennis Quaid vehicle DOA. Morton and Jankel were pioneers in the use of computer graphics. Emerging from the punk arts scene of the late 70s, they had directed cutting-edge music videos and made big commercials, including the first entirely CGI advert (for Pirelli tyres). Most importantly, they created Max Headroom for Channel 4, the faux-CG personality who fronted a late-night music video show and then became the protagonist in Morton and Jankel’s dark, witty cyberpunk television movie Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future. Joffé felt their cool, inventive and cynical approach to technology would work for Super Mario and signed them up. But the couple rejected the Jennewein/Parker script, wanting to move away from the light tone of Nintendo’s series. Their idea was to depict villainous King Koopa – better known as Bowser – as the corrupt president in an alternative dimension where humans had evolved from dinosaurs. His power base would be Dinohattan, a ravaged dystopia, low on natural resources and falling into anarchy. “I wanted the film to be more sophisticated,” Morton told Game Informer in 2011. “At that time, there was a lot of anti-video-game sentiment. I wanted to make a film that would open it up and get parents interested in video games.” Morton and Jankel put this concept to screenwriters Parker Bennett and Terry Runte, who’d worked together on the early Ethan Hawke movie Mystery Date, and brought in veteran British writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to flesh out the story and characters. They’d worked on Porridge and The Likely Lads, and provided the screenplay for Alan Parker’s hit, The Commitments. It was this script that started bringing actors on board, including Bob Hoskins and Fiona Shaw. With these heavyweights attached, others followed. “My agent said I should take a look, that it was going to be a $50m movie, which for 1992 was an extraordinary sum of money,” says Samantha Mathis, who plays Princess Daisy. “The script had issues, but the casting was so impressive it seemed it would elevate the material.” In 1992, production cranked into gear, and the costs ramped up. The crew began constructing a huge, elaborate set at the Ideal Cement Factory in Castle Hayne, North Carolina, a five-storey mega-complex previously used as a backdrop in Terminator 2 and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Production designer David L Snyder, who’d worked on Blade Runner, planned an intricate multi-level future city, dominated by neon signs and metal walkways. The set designers imagined Dinohattan as a gritty cyberpunk metropolis populated by tattooed bikers, gangsters and strippers. The costume designers dressed the huge cast in leather fetish gear, fishnet tights and trenchcoats. At this point, the film was as far from Nintendo’s Super Mario aesthetic as was possible. Seeking funds, the producers started approaching potential investors and distributors, including Disney. But here the problems really started. The money men balked at the darker tone – this wasn’t the kids’ movie they were expecting. Panicked, Joffé scrambled to arrange another, more humorous rewrite. He called veteran scriptwriter Ed Solomon, who co-wrote Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure. “My agent told me Roland Joffé wanted to meet,” Solomon says. “He’d just made The Mission. I was like, ‘What? He wants to meet me?’ My agent said he was doing a project with the people who made Max Headroom. I thought, this sounds amazing. When I met with him he said, ‘This is going to sound really weird but we have the rights to Super Mario Bros. We have a script, it’s been through several rewrites and it’s not working.’ So they hired me to do a two-week rewrite.” Except that, the directors hadn’t been told. “Right before Rocky and Annabel started on principal photography, they were handed the new script and told to go shoot it; they had already storyboarded the whole movie and planned the sets and everything and the new script blew all that out of the water,” says Ryan Hoss, founder of Super Mario Bros: The Movie Archive. “I think Rocky took the storyboards out on to the lot and set fire to them. They were on the verge of quitting right there.” There were now a variety of forces acting on the film – the producers, the directors, the distributors – and they all had slightly different visions of what it had to be. The screenplay remained in flux. “I don’t know what draft I got, but by the time we started shooting it had completely changed,” says Edson. “And not only that, but they had the writers there, constantly rewriting it. Their basic approached seemed to be: how dumb can we make this? It didn’t make sense to me or any of the other actors – it had no spirit or energy. It was hard to get behind it.” It got to the point where Edson and his co-star Fisher Stevens, who were playing Koopa’s comedy henchmen, decided to take matters into their own hands. “The first scene we shot was from the beginning of the movie,” he says. “We were following Daisy and we were in the car, we had a little bit of dialogue, and it really sucked. So I had this idea, let’s create our own. The writers couldn’t care less; if we could improve the script, they were more than happy. So we did our own [dialogue] and they loved it – from that moment on, they let Fisher and [me] do all our own dialogue. That made it a lot more fun for us.” Two weeks into the shoot, Solomon got another call. “I had done as much as I could do [with the script] and felt like it was at least coherent,” he said. “It had cohesive characters and an interesting story. When I got down there, Rocky had cut it up with a bunch of other stuff he liked from other drafts and a bunch of new stuff – literally chopped it into pieces and taped it together. There was no through line. On set, there was also a sense that nothing was certain. The production designers and special FX people didn’t know what they were building, the actors had arrived and they didn’t know what they were playing. There was just a general sense of ‘What the fuck is going on?’” Mathis felt it, too. “I had a fondness for both Rocky and Annabel, I just felt like the production was so much bigger than anything they’d done before,” she says. She’d made a couple of small movies before, but she still felt quite new to the game. She kept her head down and got on with it. But she saw frustration brewing with other cast members, especially Hopper and Hoskins. “I don’t think it’s any secret that it was a troubled shoot,” she says. “I would say Bob didn’t suffer fools gladly – he was an artist, he could see the chaos swirling around the set, and the lack of clarity. I think it’s a rare thing to have two people directing a movie together well – I certainly haven’t experienced it. The production just took on a life of its own.” A little while into the planned 10-week shoot, the LA Times sent journalist Richard Stayton to write a set report. It was the first indication to the wider industry that things were going awry. He found a cast and crew simmering with resentment over rewrites and production changes. They had nicknamed Jankel and Morton The Hydra, because there were so many heads giving orders, according to Stayton. Hoskins was cruelly dismissive. “All these rewrites get frustrating so I don’t do too much research,” the article said. “My seven-year-old son is quite depressed about my playing Mario. He knows I can’t even program a VCR, let alone play the game. How do I prepare for the role? I’m the right shape. I’ve got a moustache.” With the production deteriorating and endless chaos on set, the actors did what they could to unwind. In his autobiography, John Leguizamo, who played Luigi, admittedly to drinking whisky between takes with Hoskins, a habit that may have contributed to Hoskins breaking a finger during a driving stunt. “It was summer,” says Edson, “it was a beach resort town, they had gotten each of us our own houses – mine had a boat and a basketball court. My family came down and visited. I mean, it wasn’t that demanding – we were getting paid all this money and it was great fun, but in a way it corrupts you as an actor, as an artist – you’re just sucking in the money, doing this bullshit.” Edson struck up friendships with others working on the film during its production. “We would hang out a lot and get stoned. Bob [Hoskins] would never hang out – he had a mansion somewhere down the beach. But then one night, we were talking about getting high and Bob was like, ‘You guys have pot? You’ve been smoking reefer?’ And we were like, ‘Yeah’, and he yelled, ‘Why didn’t you tell me?! I’ve been sitting alone in my mansion!’ We really looked up to him.” Toward the end of the allotted 10-week shoot, it was clear there was still a lot more work required, but money was running out. A planned finale on the Brooklyn Bridge, laden with special effects, would have to be scuppered. “We were supposed to wrap the movie, but our producers determined that we still had two and a half to three weeks of shooting to do,” says Mathis. “The directors were thanked and told: ‘You can leave now, we’re going to make the rest of the movie without you.’ At that point, it was abundantly clear things had gotten out of control.” In interviews since the production, Morton has expressed frustration about the film, and about the changes forced on him and Jankel. “It’s very hard to remake a movie as you’re filming, and that’s what caused a lot of the problems,” he told Nintendo Life. And when asked about his abiding memory of the production he answered with one word: “humiliation”. Super Mario Bros premiered on 28 May 1993, a year dominated by box-office giants Jurassic Park and Mrs Doubtfire. It grossed around $20m, half of what it cost to make. Morton and Jankel never made another Hollywood movie, and returned to commercials and independent projects. Annabel Jankel has just directed upcoming drama Tell It to the Bees, an adaptation of the Fiona Shaw novel. Joffé continued to direct and produce, but never with the same critical impact as his pre-Super Mario Bros projects. Speaking about the movie to Wired in 2014, he was sanguine about the film: “It’s not that I defend the movie, it’s just that, in its own extraordinary way, it was an interesting and rich artefact and has earned its place. It has strange cult status.” In many ways it really was an innovative endeavour. Super Mario Bros was the first movie to employ the soon-to-be pervasive CGI software Autodesk Flame, then still in beta, and helped to shape the direction of computer special effects. “A lot of the crew we’ve spoken to are proud of the work they did,” says Applebaum. “A major advocate is Christopher Woods, who supervised the film’s visual effects. He’s talked about how innovative the work they were doing was” Hoss and Applebaum have helped Second Sight to release a Blu-ray of the movie, producing a making-of documentary for the disc. Now Woods is assisting them with a 4K-resolution transfer. “He’s talked about looking into storage to see if he still has the original visual effects on 35mm, which would allow us to complete scenes they didn’t have the budget to finish,” says Applebaum. “We’re hoping that with his support, we can get out a new release that may include deleted scenes.” Scriptwriter Solomon never ended up seeing the film, but is quaintly protective of it. “I did everything I could to help that movie,” he says. “I don’t think anyone who worked on it felt anything other than ‘this is a giant swirling kaleidoscope and we have no idea if any of these fragments will form a cohesive picture’. I don’t think they did, but there were really interesting elements within that kaleidoscope.” Edson claims not to recall whether he ever saw the movie, but feels he never escaped it. “When you’re involved with such a big disaster, the stench of it sort of stays with everybody,” he says. “There was work I hoped for in Hollywood, but it never really happened for me after that. You have to be careful. If you’re going to sell your soul, you’d better be getting more than just money out of it.” Mathis saw it once – “That was enough,” she laughs. “I will say we had an extraordinary press junket in Japan. They sent John Leguizamo, Bob Hoskins and myself. It must have been hosted partly by Nintendo. We were there for over two weeks. I remember being in an old temple in Tokyo with Bob and John, and there were Buddhist monks praying for the success of the film. We all looked at each other when we realised what was going on; we thought: ‘This is sacrilegious – these priests should not be praying for our crazy movie!’” Roland Joffé, Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel were approached for interviews. Joffé and Morton did not respond. Jankel was too busy to comment. • This article was amended on 22 March 2018. An earlier version said that after Super Mario Bros, Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton never made another movie. This has been corrected to say another Hollywood movie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"the-chain/2018/mar/04/alt-right-big-tech-censorship-lawsuits","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-04T11:00:44Z","webTitle":"A 'political hit job'?

Why the alt-right is accusing big tech of censorship","bodyText":"In January, Charles C “Chuck” Johnson filed a suit contesting his ban from Twitter back in May 2015. Johnson, an American rightwing provocateur, has a long history of smearing and hunting political opponents. He runs a scurrilous news site, GotNews, and another that crowdsources bounties for damaging information on his self-selected foes. He was eighty-sixed from Twitter following outrage from other users after a tweet appealing for crowdsourcing to “take out” Black Lives Matter activist, DeRay McKesson. It was an early example of Twitter appearing to accede to user pressure in scrubbing rightwing accounts. In recent months, social media companies have been more ready to sideline certain views and the users who promote them. Changes to Twitter’s rules in late 2017 saw numerous far right accounts scrubbed. Medium recently banned “alt light” users like Mike Cernovich, Jack Posobiec and Laura Loomer. And this week, Alex Jones’s Infowars YouTube channel, with more than 2 million subscribers, has inched closer to a total ban after making allegations that CNN’s post-Parkland town hall was staged. And as of Thursday, rightwing media was lamenting what they were billing as a “purge” of prominent conservative, alt-right, and “classical liberal” accounts. The lawyer acting for Johnson in California, Robert Barnes, says it was a clear example of Twitter “misusing their monopoly power to punish disfavored speech”, and that Johnson’s tweet was not a threat. Barnes points to reporting on internal Twitter memos about Johnson, claiming that it shows his ban was arbitrary and discriminatory. Barnes’s website promotes him as a tribune for the underdog, and he says that this is part of what drew him to the case – in his view, Johnson is a David to Twitter’s Goliath. But he also says that he is committed to free speech, and he wanted to offer a model for other lawyers to take on social media firms on behalf of banned clients. “The idea was to create a template that others could copycat,” he says. “Fortunately a lot of lawyers have looked at it and decided that it is the best way to proceed. I predict that by the end of the year there will be a dozen such suits against Twitter, Google and Facebook.” Barnes’s suit is not in fact the first of its kind, but he may be right in saying that it won’t be the last. Beginning in late 2017, a number of legal actions have been filed that draw on similar legal principles. They argue, among other things, that companies like Twitter and YouTube are de facto public forums, with a responsibility to guarantee free speech. They are thus challenging the commonsense view that such companies can ban whomever they like. Their lawyers think they can force tech giants to abandon what they describe as arbitrary censorship and liberal bias. The first of these suits was filed last October on behalf of Prager U by a legal team including California’s former Republican governor, Pete Wilson. The defendant is YouTube, and its parent company, Google. Prager U was co-founded by the conservative media star Dennis Prager, and its main product is online videos rehearsing a range of conservative beliefs with engaging, internet age aesthetics. In the words of Prager U CEO, Marissa Streit, “our mission is to reach out to people where they are”. She says that young people, in particular, are a target for Prager U’s introductions to conservative ideas, and YouTube is crucial to that. “We built a whole business model that was designed for YouTube.” In July 2016, Prager U staff noticed that some of their videos had been restricted, and others demonetized. In the first instance, viewers using YouTube’s “restricted mode” – described by the company in a video as being “like a parental control system for YouTube” – would not see those videos. In the second, the videos would not feature advertising, and Prager U would not receive money from them. In filings, Prager U says that restricted videos include some offering conservative points of view on Islam, terrorism, college rape and e-cigarettes. Demonetized videos include many on the same themes, and a number of live chats between Prager and other conservatives like Ben Shapiro, Bret Stephens and Jordan Peterson. Prager U calls this treatment of its videos censorship, and demands remedies for that censorship on the basis that YouTube and its owner Google have a responsibility to uphold free speech. Their argument is that YouTube is not only a large, powerful and near-monopolistic arbiter of political speech, but that it clearly presents itself as a public forum in its own mission statements and publicity materials. The next step is to draw on existing law to argue against the position that as a private company, Google has an unfettered right to host or ban users as it sees fit. The case cites both federal and California laws and rulings. Previous cases include Marsh v Alabama, where the US supreme court held that a Jehovah’s Witness could hand out pamphlets in a privately owned company town, and Fashion Valley Mall v NLRB, where the California supreme court said petitioners could hand out leaflets in a mall urging boycotts of the mall’s stores. They also point to California’s main civil rights legislation, the so-called Unruh Act, which prevents discrimination by businesses. The plaintiffs claim that they are the victims of discrimination as a result of their conservative viewpoint, and make further arguments that YouTube has breached its contracts and injured their business. More recently, similar suits have been filed against Twitter by users farther out on the right. Johnson’s case runs over some of the same points as Prager U’s. Filings say that Twitter is a public forum, in its materials and promotions it says as much, and in this role it has an “almost monopolistic presence”. It also says that Johnson’s ban is a “political hit job”. And in the latest, similar case, filed just last week, white nationalist Jared Taylor and his New Century Foundation commenced action against Twitter for its bans on Taylor’s account and that of American Renaissance, his journal and website. American Renaissance unashamedly campaigns for the establishment of a white ethnostate, and publishes material which asserts connections between race, IQ and crime. They also run the conference where last year, Guardian journalist Gary Younge recorded a heated, widely shared debate with Richard Spencer. Taylor lost his verified status on Twitter last November, and the next month he and American Renaissance was banned in a sweep that excluded a number of far-right accounts. It was part of a series of changes by which Twitter began specifically excluding “violent extremist groups”. But Taylor argues that he did not break Twitter’s terms of service, never advocated violence, and that he was excluded simply on the basis of beliefs that the service deemed unacceptable. “I have constantly repudiated any suggestion of violence”, he says, and maintains that his plans for a separate white homeland “are all about freedom of association”. Certainly, he says, he never advocated violence on Twitter. His legal team includes law professor Adam Candeub from Michigan State University, who says that while he does not share Taylor’s beliefs, he has not advocated violence, and his involvement in the case is guided by his admiration for the thought of John Stuart Mill. “I recognize that some speech is painful,” he says, “but the benefits outweigh any harm may be caused.” On the question of whether Taylor’s ideas – which involve the separation of races into homelands – are inherently hateful, or even imply violence, Candeub, who describes himself as a “pretty observant Jew”, says that Taylor doesn’t advocate violence, and that hate speech is, “as a civil libertarian, a category that I am extremely distrustful of”. Tech companies are, of course, defending their patch. Twitter would not comment on any specific case, but pointed the Guardian to the rules formulated last December on “hateful behavior”. The company has been going through the process of contesting Johnson’s suit in California. For its part, YouTube denies any censorship of Prager U, and calls their allegations “meritless”. A YouTube representative said, “Restricted Mode is an optional feature used by a small subset of users to filter out videos that may include sensitive or mature content. Giving viewers the choice to opt in to a more restricted experience is not censorship. “Prager U’s videos weren’t excluded from Restricted Mode because of politics or ideology,” the representative added. Google’s own filings in response attempt to rebut the claims point by point. They also claim immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which for 22 years has powered the growth of big tech firms by shielding them from the liabilities borne by, say, newspaper publishers, by absolving them from responsibility for what people might post on their platforms. Just as the CDA protects them from liability for what is published by third parties on their servers, Google says, it also protects them from liability for removing or restricting content. Hearings in the case commence in March. Even if the CDA ultimately works, again, to protect the tech companies, the suit has unfolded at a difficult time for the tech industry. In the wake of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 elections, politicians have been scrutinizing the role of big tech platforms as a conduit for propaganda, disruption, and “fake news”. Some are talking tough about beefing up regulation on Silicon Valley firms. David Golumbia, of Virginia Commonwealth University, is a longtime researcher and critic of Silicon Valley, who has written extensively on the rightwing ideas he says freely circulate in tech circles. He sees the cases as pointing to contradictions which politicians, and others, are now urgently considering. “In their own self-interest, these companies have exploited a loophole in Section 230 of the CDA, and have created something which is neither fish nor fowl,” he says. They enjoy all the benefits of private companies, he says, “but they refuse to be regulated, and held responsible for the utterances that come out of their corporate platforms”. In particular, they deny specifically that they are media companies, just platforms. The cases help illustrate big tech’s current dilemma. While politicians and anti-racist campaigners are asking them to act more like publishers, and show some discernment about what they allow to be published, from the right, many are accusing them of censorious liberal bias, and demanding they wind back the few standards they have implemented. These protests have taken many forms, including the launch of alternative, rightwing social media platforms. Despite the confidence of all the plaintiffs in these cases, they may well fail. David Greene, civil liberties coordinator at the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, describes them as “creative”, and worries that they may go too far in infringing on the speech rights of the tech companies. Others have suggested that Johnson’s suit, in particular, is “Dead on Arrival”. But each has generated considerable publicity in rightwing media, where they serve to convince rank-and-file rightists that big tech is against them. New lawsuits are being threatened, and Mike Cernovich says he is planning to sue Medium. “Civil rights cases are hard to win,” he told the Guardian, adding that “someone has to be a pioneer”. Even if social media companies win these battles, they may be in for a longer legal and ideological war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2018/mar/01/michaelia-cash-in-spotlight-over-comments-about-women-in-shorten-office-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T07:32:58Z","webTitle":"Nationals reshuffle: Canavan survives but Hartsuyker, Drum dropped – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/mar/01/michaelia-cash-in-spotlight-over-comments-about-women-in-shorten-office-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2018/mar/01/michaelia-cash-in-spotlight-over-comments-about-women-in-shorten-office-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Nationals reshuffle: Canavan survives but Hartsuyker, Drum dropped – as it happened","bodyText":"Righto that’s me done for the day, and parliament for the next couple of weeks. You ever have one of those days where you feel like you got nothing done? Between the Coalition’s apparent determination to keep the Michaelia Cash imbroglio running for as long as possible, Kim Carr’s ridiculous comments about Hitler youth, and Bill Shorten’s equivocating over Labor’s stance on Adani, it just feels like we didn’t really move the needle. Anyway the good news is we – or they – get to do it all over again in two weeks when the Senate resumes sitting. The next joint sitting week isn’t until the end of March though, on the week of the 26th. By then hopefully your usual driver Amy Remeikis will be in better health. Thanks for hanging out though, it’s been fun! Murph’s just filed an update on the whole ‘what did Bill Shorten tell Geoff Cousins about Adani’ affair. Sounds like they’re trying to water down expectations about what they would or wouldn’t do with the coalmine’s environmental approval if they were elected. He’s echoed Brendan O’Connor’s line from earlier, too, about Labor not ripping up contracts. Hey now the Nationals reshuffle has dropped! No changes to the cabinet – so Matthew Canavan survives – but Darren Chester returns to the outer ministry as minister for veteran affairs and minister assisting for the centenary of Anzac. Keith Pitt returns as assistant minister to the deputy prime minister – remember how furious he was when he was dropped in December? – and Mark Coulton becomes assistant minister for trade, tourism and investment. They’ll be sworn in on Monday. And, of course, whenever there are winners there are also losers. Damian Drum and Luke Hartsuyker both lose their assistant ministry positions.

Greens welfare spokeswoman, Rachel Siewert, said: “With only 66 people coming off income support ... out of 30,000+ recipients reviewed, it seems the eligibility checks have been a monumental waste of time and money. “The government would have likely spent more money carrying out the checks than the money they’ve clawed back from these people, meanwhile 30,000+ recipients have gone through a stressful process that didn’t need to occur in the first place. “In Senate estimates today the Department of Social Services admitted they were reviewing the process, which to me is a concession that the process isn’t working as they hoped. “I urge the government to stop this awful process that is causing stress to vulnerable members of our community. It is obviously not saving money and is just causing harm.” Michael Kroger, the Liberal party state president in Victoria, just said on Sky News that the Greens party have “no empathy with what happened in World War 2”. Which, of course he did. It was in the context of Kim Carr’s comments to James Patterson in estimates earlier, and feels like the inevitable conclusion of today. “The left of the Greens, in fact most of the Greens, they have no empathy with the Jewish community, they have no empathy with what happened in World War 2. “There are elements of anti-semitism in Australian politics, mainly on the left, a fraction of it is on the right but mainly on the left. “I mean these are the fascists in Australian politics.” Yikes. For those of you playing at home (and perusing Parliament House’s media rules) the whiteboard kerfuffle is explained by two seemingly clashing rules. Rule 4.7 (e) says that media activity is permitted in the Mural Hall. But 4.7(d) says it is not permitted “in the corridors outside the committee rooms”. So the issue is that media were stationed in the Mural Hall but filming down the corridor outside the committee rooms. On one view, they are in Mural Hall, so it’s fine; on the other view they are filming the corridors outside the committee rooms, so it’s not. That would explain why both media and Michaelia Cash have complained to the sergeant-at-arms. Paul Karp has managed to confirm that Michaelia Cash’s office has filed a complaint to the sergeant-at-arms about the media filming that embarrassing entrance into estimates earlier. Basically, there are issues of protocol about where the media can and cannot film in the halls of Parliament House. But the complaint raises a few questions. First, if the media wasn’t supposed to be filming, why bother with the ridiculous whiteboard stunt? Second, and more importantly, did they really think I wouldn’t use this as an excuse to post the video again? Oh grow up, all of you. Earlier Murph mentioned the comments from businessman and environmentalist Geoff Cousins, who insists Bill Shorten suggested to him that he wanted to “lead” on reversing approvals for the controversial Adani coalmine. Read about that here. Well, Brendan O’Connor has been on Sky News this afternoon and is insisting that it isn’t Labor’s policy to overturn the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act approval for Adani. “We’ve said that if there are environmental concerns with respect to project then of course [we have] reservations,” he said. But he said Labor was “not going to be tearing up contracts if we’re elected”. “That’s not Bill’s position or Labor’s position,” he said. Hm. Labor’s been playing a dangerous game on Adani, and the government has been honing in. Revenue and financial services minister Kelly O’Dwyer quipped in question time that Shorten is “an eco-warrior in inner-city Melbourne [but] the miner’s mate when he is in north Queensland”. She was just one of a long line-up of ministers keen to whack Shorten on this in question time, and it could be fertile ground if the Coalition can make this an issue of his trustworthiness. Labor’s Jenny McAllister has asked Michaelia Cash whether she has unreservedly withdrawn her remarks about rumours around Bill Shorten’s staff. Cash said that hansard would reflect that she had withdrawn the remark. Well, not quite. Yesterday, Cash said “if anyone has been offended – I withdraw” which is not a total climb down, allowing Labor to kick the outrage into today’s cycle. Today, Cash does the mopping up job: “I’m more than happy to withdraw them unreservedly ... I withdrew them yesterday and I will withdraw them unreservedly.” But Cash also pushed back against Labor’s Doug Cameron, claiming she made her comments in response to his “highly inappropriate comment”. Fact check: all Cameron did was ask if her new chief of staff came from another Liberal office. “Doug Cameron is nothing more or less than a bully – and that was on display yesterday,” she said, before calling on him to “withdraw the insinuations he made about my staff”. McAllister tries to get the bully remark retracted, but Cash refuses. One climb down at a time it seems. OK we’re moving on the Cash saga again. She’s back taking questions in estimates and, per Murph, has “unreservedly” withdrawn her comments while echoing the prime minister’s line from earlier about Doug Cameron being a bully. More on that soon. G’day, G’day. Murph’s walked off and left the keys in Politics Live, so I’m taking my chance and jumping behind the wheel. Or keyboard. Whatever. I’m taking over the blog for the rest of the afternoon, is my point. Michaelia Cash has of course dominated headlines today, and Malcolm Turnbull’s equivocation on the matter in question time just now coupled with her bizarre entry into estimates (see below) suggests we may be headed for day three of ... is there a hashtag for her thing yet? In the meantime, though, a brief contribution to actual policy from none other than One Nation leader Pauline Hanson. Hanson spoke to Samantha Maiden on Sky News this morning, and suggested the government still has a ways to go before winning One Nation’s support for its proposed company tax cuts. There were reports this morning that finance minister Mathias Cormann has been circulating modelling on the proposed cut in a bit to win over the reluctant members of the Senate crossbench. But Hanson said she hadn’t seen the modelling, and that she still “needs to be convinced” on the policy. The Coalition has tried to sell the policy on the basis that it will increase wages – though there remains quite a few questions about how much and over what period of time – and despite saying she had “an open mind” on the policy, Hanson expressed doubt that a tax cut would do anything to spur wage growth. Watch this space, I suppose. With the news piling up, as delightful as this brief reunion has been, I need to move on and tend to my usual patch. Thanks for riding along for the day. I’m handing over now to my colleague, Michael McGowan, who will see you through to stumps. The jobs and innovation minister, Michaelia Cash, has been in Senate estimates since 1:50pm but has not yet faced any questions about the tipoff to the media about the AWU raids. That’s because the first witnesses up were from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. The raids have to be dealt with in the cross portfolio time slot, which isn’t scheduled until 7:15pm. Labor’s Kim Carr eased off when Cash confirmed she intended to stick around for that, but grumbled that cross-portfolio matters were not first up. At 3pm, after questions to Michael Keenan about the AWU raid leak dominated question time, Labor’s Jenny McAllister tried again to ask Cash about “remarks made by the prime minister in the House just now”. Several Liberal senators objected, and the Liberal chair Jane Hume suspended the hearing to ask McAllister what the question was to determine if it was relevant. After the suspension, we’re back with the Anti-Dumping Commission and – you guessed it – there were no questions about the AWU. So that’s kicked the can down the road, possibly for a few hours. The prime minister has called time on question time. Back in the House. The Cairns community has got a spring in its step and confidence is returning. No project embodies the renewed energy and confidence like the refurbishment of the Cairns courthouse .. While these guys narrowcast for three elections, I can share antics elsewhere. Let’s call this one #Accountability #TheSequel A Dorothy referencing the South Australian election, followed by a Labor question about the Tasmanian election. I wonder whether we will touch down in Batman? Oh no, we have, already. The baristas in Brunswick. Meanwhile. Bill Shorten is taking us now to Tasmania, given the looming state election. Q: My question is to the prime minister. Can he confirm he is making over 150,000 Tasmanians pay more income tax each year while providing a $65bn handout to big business? Malcolm Turnbull: Thank you Mr Speaker, it has taken the leader of the opposition now 54 minutes to ask a question about the economy. The prime minister says the increase in the Medicare levy is to pay for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Dorothy’s – for those playing along at home – are Bill Shorten is walking all sides of the street on Adani, and Chris Bowen is a dope on company tax cuts. Scott Morrison, summarising: The Labor party have turned their back on Julia Gillard, Bob Hawke, Paul Keating. When you believe in nothing, nobody will believe in you! The energy minister Josh Frydenberg, summarising: The leader of the opposition says one thing to the miners in Mackay and to another to the baristas in Brunswick. Again, Michael Keenan. Q: My question is to the minister the human services and I refer to his previous answers. A moment ago, the minister said he rejected the allegation. Does he deny his office being the original source of the leak to the media about the AFP raid? Yes or no? Michael Keenan: How much clearer can I be? Yes! Government members urge the Labor questioner, Brendan O’Connor, to write that one down. Labor, persisting with Michael Keenan. Q: My question is to the minister for human services. Did the minister or his office at any time prior to the AFP raid inform anyone other than the prime minister about this raid, including but not limited to the office of minister Cash? Michael Keenan: Mr Speaker, that is exactly the same question as the previous one that I have just addressed. The truth is, an allegation has been made. I have completely rejected that allegation and I am not going to sit here and ... Tony Burke, with the obvious point. Mr Speaker, if the opposition can’t ask questions because that’s cross-examination, should we continue with question time, ever? Surely that’s the point of it. Speaker Tony Smith, full deadpan. I’m going to continue with question time. If the manager of opposition business doesn’t wish to, that’s his business. There was quite a fun quip then by Malcolm Turnbull to the former New Zealand prime minister John Key, who is visiting today. The prime minister detects a look of relief from the retired Key as he surveys “the dignified debates here in the House of Representatives”. Today, we are all John Key. Then Labor returns to Michael Keenan. Q: My question is to the minister for human services and I refer to the member’s previous answers. Did the minister or his office at the time inform anyone other than the office of the prime minister about the raid before the execution of search warrants, including but not limited to the office of minister Cash? Michael Keenan: Mr Speaker, I won’t be cross examined by him ... And in fact, I won’t be cross-examined by any of them because they are not worthy! #Accountability Labor has come back to Michael Keenan. Labor’s Mark Dreyfus says a statement issued by his office said media outlets were not informed of the raids by him or his office. Q: What steps did he take to substantiate the claim that no-one in his office informed the media before the execution of search warrants? Michael Keenan: I am not being cross-examined by someone who is running a protection racket for a corrupt union movement that remains in control of this Labor party. #Accountability Back to the other place, the treasurer Scott Morrison, has fluffed his funny. He was trying to land a line about his opposite number Chris Bowen chugging down left lattes, or left ideology, like Bob Hawke, chugging stuff. The landing point was spewing. It ran off the rails. It wasn’t clear in the end who was chugging, apart from the treasurer, on his funny. Meanwhile, in a galaxy not far away. The member for Kennedy, Bob Katter, is bellowing. Malcolm Turnbull is unmoved by the bellowing. I understand the member for the Kennedy does not approve or agree with free-market economics but we have to say to him, with respect to his views, that we here in the government believe in free markets, in trade, in free enterprise. Michael Keenan gets a second question on the denial his office has issued on the BuzzFeed story. He says he’s already answered that question. Then we get a solid dose of CFMEU alleged wickedness. The next Dorothy is on cyber bulling, and the national day of action in mid-March. Malcolm Turnbull: We all have smart phones, our children have smart phones. This is a recent technology. The first one arrived on the scene at about a decade ago. While there are enormous benefits, what it means is that the bullying that used to end at the school gate follows children home. The consequences can be tragic. Bill Shorten, on indulgence, says the following. I wish to associate the opposition with the remarks of the prime minister. I congratulate the prime minister on writing to school principals. Parents raise the scourge of bullying with me in all forums. It is not just cyber bullying but what can happen to their children at school. It is a parents worst nightmare not to be able to protect their children, so I congratulate him on this initiative. Labor has moved on to Michael Keenan and the BuzzFeed report I referenced a couple of posts ago about an alleged tip off from his office before the police raids on the AWU. Keenan is asked whether the denial issued by his office is accurate. Michael Keenan: The answer to the member’s question is yes, and we will not be distracted by this enormous nonsense that you see from the Labor party. What does Amy say? #DeathToDixers? We are on the first Dorothy, which allows the prime minister to note that Bill Shorten went off on “a secret snorkelling expedition”. This is about Adani, and Shorten’s trip north with Cousins, which I referenced a couple of posts ago. Malcolm Turnbull: He did! He did! With Geoff Cousins! Bill Shorten opens on the Cash incident. Will the prime minister require her to apologise for her comments? Malcolm Turnbull digs a trench and clambers right on in. The prime minister says Cash responded in a “heated” Senate estimates session when she was being “bullied and provoked” by Doug Cameron. The prime minister says she withdrew the comments “unreservedly”. (She didn’t). Michaelia Cash has returned to the economics legislation committee. My colleague Paul Karp will keep an eye on her. Over we go to the House of Representatives for the hour of glower. The Greens leader Richard Di Natale has just been interviewed on Sky News and has been asked about the Alex Bhathal complaint. Richard Di Natale: The party has considered these complaints very carefully ... she has the overwhelming support of the branch and her community. Michaelia Cash is due shortly to be in one of the estimates committees. Will keep an eye out and we are galloping now towards question time. Refresh your beverages and hope for the best. Another thing I haven’t had a chance to reference today – the Australian has reported the Greens candidate in the Batman byelection, Alex Bhathal, was the subject of a 101-page internal complaint by 18 party volunteers. Thanks to AAP for this recount. The party’s leadership has consistently declined to reveal the nature of the complaints against Alex Bhathal because the “issue” had been dealt with internally. But the Australian, citing a copy of the complaint on Thursday, reports the issues ranged from intimidation and bullying through to comments about Greens members. It’s been known for some time Bhathal isn’t universally loved in her local area and there are some local councillors who have been publicly critical of her. Very important contest, the one on 17 March. We’ll continue to watch with interest. I haven’t had time to link you to it yet but Alice Workman at BuzzFeed has reported that a journalist has told her they were tipped off by the then justice minister Michael Keenan’s office in advance of police raids on the Australian Workers Union last year. The journalist is not on the record in the piece. Michaelia Cash ran into trouble last year when it emerged that her office had, in fact, tipped off news outlets in advance of the raid after she had denied being involved five times. The Keenan office has denied the story: “Neither the minister or anyone in his office informed media outlets prior to the execution of search warrants.” Just in case you need to review The Incident™. Do you want to start naming them? Speaking as we were of buckets of merde, Bill Shorten has just issued a statement on The Incident™, ie: the Michaelia Cash estimates performance. Bill Shorten: Of course I’m angry. I’m angry on behalf of the smart, dedicated, hard-working professionals in my office who have been smeared by Michaelia Cash. I’m honestly shocked she hasn’t said sorry. I’ve been waiting for her to ring up my office and organise it. It’s this sort of nonsense that turns people off politics. We should be focusing on the things that matter to Australians, not hurling insults and making up stories about people who can’t defend themselves. The prime minister said a few weeks ago that the parliament needed to be a more respectful workplace for women. I agree with him. Maybe he should try doing something about it. Anyone can tell you, you don’t start a land war with Russia and the first person to mention Hitler always loses the argument – but it appears Liberal senator James Paterson and Labor’s Kim Carr didn’t get the memo. While Murph has been dealing with summaries, the pair have just had a robust exchange in education estimates. When Carr was quizzing witnesses about the study of humanities, Paterson jibed “what about the Russian revolution” – presumably in reference to Carr’s membership of the socialist left faction. Kim Carr then ventured: I can tell you that too – you’d know that, those in the Hitler Youth would know that only too well. Paterson called the slur “outrageous” and “seriously offensive”. After first defending the comment on the basis it was facetious, Carr then offered the Michaelia Cash-style apology: “If you took offence, I withdraw it ... You just threw a bucket of shit at me and you’re going to suddenly say you’re offended.” Paterson summarised his own contribution: “I was joking about revolutions.” Lost in the wash of today (among other things lost in the wash) is Labor and its position on the Adani coalmine. If you’ve been watching events over the past couple of days, you will have seen the businessman and environmentalist Geoff Cousins tell Leigh Sales at the ABC, and then me yesterday, about a bunch of conversations he had with the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, between last December and last weekend about the controversial Queensland coal project. Cousins says Shorten signalled to him that Labor would revoke the licence for the project if they won the next federal election, then signalled to him that things were getting difficult internally but he was still committed to doing that, then signalled he would tell him one way or another last weekend what Labor’s position would be, then Shorten disappeared off the radar entirely. I’ve been trying to give Shorten a right of reply to Cousins for over 24 hours. Thus far, radio silence. In an effort to conform with live blogging best practice, please allow me to produce a lunchtime summary so we can look back with our hearts swelling with optimism at events since about 7am this morning. Summarising events, in no particular order: Labor is continuing with efforts to extract an unqualified apology from Michaelia Cash and from the government more generally, after Cash blew up in a Senate estimates hearing on Wednesday about Bill Shorten and women in his office. Thus far, those efforts have triggered a doubling down among government folk, who have said, variously: “Labor had an undisclosed mucky agenda in pursuing the questions that triggered the Cash blow up, therefore Cash was justified in dialling up to 11”; “Bill Shorten, I mean look at that guy”; and “Michaelia is a great minister who scares the pants off the unions”. Apart from this stirring public interest exchange, we’ve had the Liberal senator Dean Smith winning a prize for actually remembering that representative democracy is about representation and trying to build something rather than tearing things down. We’ve got Nationals, waiting to know what the new McCormack era brings by way of ministerial advancement. I’m still waiting to learn what Labor’s position on Adani is. More of that shortly. In the meantime, top up your almond lattes – on we go. If you’ve been watching political events closely this week, it won’t have escaped your attention that the Turnbull government is back to the “Kill Bill” strategy, which was the strategy it deployed in the absence of the government having anything much coherent to say throughout the chaos of 2017. In this week’s meeting of government MPs, the deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop, told colleagues they needed to keep talking about the inadequacies of Shorten who “does not have the character to lead at home or abroad”. So this week, as the government has rolled out of the Joyce disaster, we are back to talking about Bill Shorten being duplicitous, or two faced, or, (as Dutton has this morning), referencing “the history of problems in Bill Shorten’s personal life”. We are in a period of random mud throwing at the wall. I continue to shake my head in disbelief that these people want to bring on a US-style character debate in Australian politics – that they are willing participants in this shift. What they don’t seem to realise, or do realise but don’t care, is this is a debate that shines lights in dark corners right across the board. Once you open the door on this “let’s throw mud randomly at the wall” conversation, you don’t get to decide who closes it. One of my smart-as-paint colleagues just said to me the word you are looking for is apophasis. If this word is unfamiliar to you. Apophasis: Allusion to something by denying that it will be mentioned, as in I will not bring up my opponent’s questionable financial dealings. Rightio, I’ll exercise my third comment today just to ensure we don’t slide face first into the compost heap here with Peter Dutton. Just a quick fact check. Fact one: The only person who delivered a public morals lecture to Barnaby Joyce over the past couple of weeks was, drum roll please ... Malcolm Turnbull. Nobody else went there. At all. Labor pursued a bunch of questions about the public interest dimensions of the former deputy prime minister’s relationship with his former staffer Vikki Campion. There were no morals lectures, apart from Turnbull, who spoke about the world of woe Joyce had inflicted on the women in his life, and advised him to reflect on his behaviour, and then introduced a ban on sexual relationships between ministers and staff. As morals lectures go, it emptied the magazine, but that was Malcolm Turnbull, not Bill Shorten. Fact two: You also don’t get to say “I’m not the moral police” before launching an ad hominem character assassination of your political opponent explicitly on character grounds. Well, you do, obviously, because politicians closing in at speed on the compost heap say whatever the hell they feel like – but you don’t get to say it and not be called for it. Back over on 2GB, Ray Hadley has really zeroed in on The Incident™. Hadley believes Cash allowed Doug Cameron to bait her. He generously threw to home affairs minister Peter Dutton to see if he agreed. Peter Dutton: I think there’s a frustration on the Coalition side at the moment ... we’ve sat there taking a morals lecture from Bill Shorten in relation to Barnaby Joyce over the last few weeks. People know that there’s a history of problems in Bill Shorten’s personal life, in Tony Burke’s personal life, and to be lectured by the Labor party sticks in the craw. I think Michaelia Cash did the right thing by withdrawing her comments - she’s done that - but there’s a general frustration within the parliament that you’ve got people like Shorten, Burke, and a couple on the other side being virtuous and I’m not sure they’ve got great grounds to be virtuous. Dutton said Cash did not intend offence against women in Shorten’s office and “it was more a reflection on Bill Shorten”. Asked if there was history between Shorten and people in his office, Dutton says “these are questions for Mr Shorten – nothing to do with me”. Peter Dutton: I’m not the moral police, I don’t have any interest in people’s personal lives ... the only point I’d make is it’s a bit rich for Mr Shorten to be up there on higher ground lecturing others on their relationships. Dutton says Shorten is two-faced and a “duplicitous character” citing attempts to endear himself to miners in Queensland then talking tough on the Adani mine in Batman. Labor’s Doug Cameron, the senator who pursued the staff questions about Michaelia Cash yesterday that sparked The Incident™, was buttonholed in the corridor a little while ago by Sky reporter Samantha Maiden. Q: There has been a lot of confusion about why Michaelia Cash made the comments that she did in that hearing. We now understand that she believes you were pursuing a line of questioning around the idea that Coalition staff movements may be linked to relationships with ministers. Is that what you were doing? Doug Cameron: Well certainly not. I have been pursuing these issues for some time and I must say I was a bit shocked and stunned at the response because there had been a whole line of questioning before that didn’t gain that type of reaction and I have never had that type of reaction before. What I am concerned about and what Labor is concerned about is the web of influence from Michaelia Cash’s office into agencies that are pursuing working people and the trade union movement. Q: So you were pursuing that line of questioning over questions over how the AWU raids leaked. Can you categorically rule out that you were in any way trying to bait Michaelia Cash on other issues surrounding Coalition staff? Doug Cameron: Well absolutely. Anyone that knows me knows that I don’t do that type of thing – I mean it’s not of any interest to me. I am not prepared to comment on that stuff; that’s not my business. My business is to make sure the minister is held to account and that’s what I was doing. In happier news, the Liberal senator Dean Smith has been named the inaugural winner of the McKinnon Prize for Political Leadership. Smith won the prize “for tackling vital issues of public policy, overcoming adversity and achieving real change for the public good”. He was commended for his “bipartisan leadership on same-sex marriage and his demonstration of courageous backbench leadership in the face of internal opposition and diversity of public opinion within Australian society”. Remember, that happened, politicians showing some leadership and collaboration to deliver an outcome a majority of the Australian public wanted? We all saw it. Councillor Vonda Malone was also named the McKinnon Emerging Political Leader of the Year, for politicians with less than five years in office, “for her outstanding leadership as Mayor of Torres Shire Council”. Just one little sign of how far through the looking glass we, collectively, are. Meanwhile, in the Trumpocalypse, far far away. If you’ve missed this morning’s collective intake of breath from Washington, followed by the blizzard of hot takes – Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and longtime aide to Donald Trump, has confirmed she is moving on. Back to round the hedge. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has also been out and about defending Michaelia Cash, telling 2GB she is an “outstanding minister”. Cormann: The Labor party doesn’t like Michaelia because Michaelia is a very effective operator. The unions don’t like her because she’s been successful in passing very important reforms like the restoration of the Australian Building and Corruption Commission, the Registered Organisations Commission … the Labor party is an agent of the union movement and some of the worse elements of the union movement clearly don’t like her. To give you a break from doing the rounds of the hedge on Michaelia Cash, just a reminder, the Nationals are in a period of abeyance. When I spoke to the new Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, on Tuesday, I got the impression a reshuffle of their ministerial positions would likely lob today. It’s not clear to me, largely because I haven’t yet had time to check, whether it will lob today or not. If you are wondering why a reshuffle needs to happen, McCormack has taken on the portfolio held most recently by Barnaby Joyce, but is still holding the ministry he had previously: veterans’ affairs. Someone needs to take that portfolio at the very least. That would be the minimalist response. The new leader would also have the option of doing something more wholesale than just replacing himself. But like everything around the place at the moment, adventurism is a bit fraught. The Joyce clique is keeping a close eye on their fortunes – will the new leader promote any of the insurgents who moved against Joyce last week and dump folks close to the previous leader? Politics: the art of walking on eggshells. I think it’s fair to say that if Michaelia Cash had delivered an unqualified apology yesterday we would not still be doing the rounds of the hedge on this issue. That’s my second comment. I mentioned a little earlier that Craig Laundy, the government frontbencher, had attempted to mount a context defence for Michaelia Cash. Here’s a direct quote that might help you understand his point. Craig Laundy: There was implied innuendo the whole way along about staff movements between Liberal staffers’ offices and the unspoken reality was they were attempting to sling mud looking back a couple of weeks linking it to the movement of staffers around the Nationals’ office. That was what was going on here and that is the part that has been broadly missed as part of this discussion. Labor denies there was any innuendo at all in the questions. But this is what happens, of course, when events force the entire building to startle at shadows. People read meanings into comments that may, or may not, be there. This is what happens when the prime minister codifies what kind of relationships can or can’t occur between principals and staff: everyone starts looking over their shoulder. Another piece of context that may be useful to readers is the Cash office is not a happy place. There’s been a lot of turnover since the AWU troubles. Perhaps there might be some sensitivities about that afoot as well. Hopefully Dutton’s new home affairs ministry won’t ever include the moral police. Take that as a comment. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has been chased by reporters down the corridor after his regular interview on 2GB. I didn’t catch all of his remarks but for what it’s worth, he said he did not intend to be “lectured to and moralised upon by people who should check their own situation”. Peter Dutton: I’m not part of the moral police. I don’t pass judgment on anyone. (Except he just did, on someone.) The government frontbencher Craig Laundy has been interviewed this morning and, like everyone, he has been asked about Michaelia Cash’s outburst. He told Sky News this morning that the questions Labor posed to Cash yesterday by Labor senators happened in the context of the controversies of recent weeks. By that he meant the Barnaby Joyce/Vikki Campion imbroglio. Reading between the lines of what Laundy said – he means there’s now some sensitivity around the building about staff movements. Given the debate of the past fortnight, and the prime minister’s ban on sexual relationships between ministers and their staff, you can understand there would be some sensitivity about that. The questions from the Labor senator Doug Cameron yesterday were about staff movements in the Cash office. He’s been pursuing those questions since Cash got into trouble about her staff tipping off the media in relation to a police raid on the AWU. I didn’t detect any edge at all in his questions, but Laundy’s rationale is that everything in this place happens in a context. The Liberal party’s newest recruit, Lucy Gichuhi, was lost for words when asked what she thought of the Cash outburst yesterday. I think this reaction speaks for itself. Just for reader John O’Driscoll, who thinks I have done something terrible to Amy, I promise you I haven’t. I’ve just sent her home to bed. She has been ill for days, but has pressed on serving her loyal audience – bless her. She needs to lie down today. She will be back with you directly, when the flu clears. It’s a shocker, I can attest. Amy mentioned in her opening post today that Michaelia Cash’s bizarre, dial it up to 11, name-and-shame episode in Senate estimates yesterday is dominating the early conversation in the parliamentary precinct. Tanya Plibersek has said this morning she wants Cash to march down to Bill Shorten’s office and apologise personally to all the young women in his employ. That would be quite something. In fact, that is an event that you could likely sell tickets to. I suspect there would be hot demand for the front-row seats. Just in case we missed Plibersek’s suggestion, the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, has fronted the in-house video press release service, Sky News. Burke says the government, rather than demanding Cash deliver an unqualified apology, has doubled down in her defence, and that is unacceptable. Tony Burke: We want a straight-up apology. Well that was actually the shortest live blog shift in living memory. Hello everyone, it’s Katharine Murphy here, taking over from Ms Amy. I took one look at her this morning and ordered that she pack up her desk and go home. Ghosts can’t live blog. It’s a hard rule. So let’s conduct my semi-regular live social experiment: can I still cover politics live? Will the muscle memory kick in? I guess we’ll find out. Buckle up, giddy up, here comes Thursday. It is the last day of the sitting week but Michaelia Cash’s outburst from yesterday is still dominating the agenda. Tanya Plibersek is just one of many, from all sides of politics and beyond, who don’t think the qualified apology Cash offered yesterday, after threatening to name “all the young women” there were rumours about in Bill Shorten’s office, was good enough: Look, I thought Senator Cash’s comments yesterday were highly inappropriate and she should walk down to Bill Shorten’s office and apologise to the women that she’s maligned. I think it is hard enough working in an environment that is pretty male-dominated. I mean, we are a bit better off in the Labor party because almost half of our MPs are women. We have taken a very deliberate steps over many years to improve the gender balance of our party, but, nevertheless, Parliament House is a pretty blokey environment. She’s just made life a whole lot harder for a bunch of young women who are smart, they are dedicated to their jobs, they work really hard. They are away from their families. Why would you do that? This is a minister who used to be the minister for women. She’s the minister for jobs and she’s giving these young women doing their jobs a hard time. I don’t understand her behaviour. I think those meanly-mouthed apologies – “If anyone was offended, I withdraw” – that is just pathetic. She should have the decency to realise she has done the wrong thing, she shouldn’t have said what she said and she should apologise to the young women she’s assaulted. I feel offended on their behalf. Craig Laundy is maintaining the line that the grilling Doug Cameron was putting Cash under on Wednesday, and the “implied innuendo” that went along with the questioning. Again, Cameron was questioning Cash about who her new chief of staff and media adviser was and where they had come from. Labor says it was about staff movements within Liberal organisations. It expected a response along the lines of Labor offices hiring union-aligned staff. But from Laundy’s response, I don’t think Cash is going to be getting any closer to an actual apology. There is a bit of rewriting of history here with Laundy’s response. Tony Abbott remains the only member of the government to call out Cash’s comments for what they are. In other news, Dfat estimates are being held in the Senate, with Penny Wong leading Labor’s questioning. That will start at nine. Mike Bowers is here and walking the hallways. Follow along with him at @mikepbowers and @mpbowers. You can catch me in the comments and at @amyremeikis and @ifyouseeamy.

Owner Arthur Blank threw down the gauntlet to the rest of the league, redefining what’s possible within MLS. Tata Martino’s side played attractive soccer and drew massive crowds to Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The club are not resting on their laurels either: they shelled out a once-unheard-of fee of $15m to land teenage Argentinian playmaker Ezequiel Barco. Whether that’s enough of an improvement to topple Toronto remains to be seen, but it’ll be fun to watch. BD Seeing how the battle for hearts and minds in LA goes down with the addition of LAFC. The dynamic is somewhat different than the New York edition of #soccerwarz, given the Galaxy’s historic success, but after the false start of Chivas USA (RIP), LAFC look likely to finally deliver a rival team worth the name. GP Seeing what Atlanta United will do for an encore. The Five Stripes broke Seattle’s previously untouchable attendance records in their inaugural campaign, all while playing some of the most consistently attractive soccer MLS has ever seen. Can Tata Martino, Miguel Almiron and Co. approach even loftier heights in Year 2? MP Some actual soccer interrupting the toxic discourse that has been building in American soccer. It’s been quite an off-season, with the sport in the country tearing itself apart around the US Soccer presidential election. It got so bad some people even supported Eric Wynalda as a candidate. Of course, there are problems to be addressed, but some soccer to break up the shouting and screaming will be welcome. GR I’m least looking forward to… The perpetual hand-wringing over the lack of USA-eligible players in MLS starting elevens. MLS now has 23 teams, 20 based in the United States. Let’s say, conservatively, 80 potential US national team players are starting and 120 or so get regular playing time. Only a few years ago, the thinking was that American players should bypass MLS to fight for playing time in Europe. Now they’re fighting for playing time here, and they’ll be better off for it. BD Any game played during the World Cup – a reminder not only of US soccer’s general state of exception when it comes to scheduling, but also its state of exception when it comes to the USA qualifying for the World Cup. MLS is not a league that easily absorbs the loss of a potential generation of fans piqued by US performances. GP Having to feign interest in MLS around the World Cup. The US men’s national team had never previously failed to qualify for the tournament since MLS launched in 1996. And though there will be plenty of the league’s players on hand representing various homelands, something is going to be missing for American fans. I don’t think the league brass has fully come to terms with how much they’d taken for granted the World Cup bump every four years. MP More MLS games at Yankee Stadium. NYC FC have replaced the LA Galaxy as the global front for MLS and playing games at a baseball stadium, on such a poor pitch, leaves the league open to derision. GR Does LA need a second team? Probably. LAFC seems to have laid the groundwork for capturing the fan base in the urban core, though we shouldn’t confuse sprawling southern California with congested New York. The failures of Chivas USA are not being repeated. LAFC are an ambitious club with a large group of local owners, not a development squad for a giant of the Mexican league. The only question is whether LAFC will siphon off too much of the Galaxy’s fan base, which is already trending downward. BD It’s more a case of, “Would MLS like one of its two main media markets to have two sustainable teams?” A: Yes. Also, “Can LA sustain a second team?” A: Probably, if both make virtue of their distinct qualities. LAFC have made some shrewd branding moves and are building a beautiful looking stadium. A promising start. GP Sure. The country’s second-largest city certainly has the population size to support it and possesses the diverse demographics MLS should be aggressively targeting. Whether LAFC specifically is that second team LA needs is an open question. MLS’s newest expansion team has hit plenty of the right notes, but it has left a couple of important boxes unchecked, too. MP Yes. Los Angeles has the potential to be a real soccer hotbed. That potential has been obvious for years, but never before has a team been able to capitalise on that. The Galaxy are handicapped by their location out in Carson, so there’s only so much they can do. I have sympathy. LAFC’s new downtown stadium, however, could be a game-changer for soccer in the city. GR MLS promotion/relegation is likely as... ... the sun going supernova. It’s inevitable, but it might not happen for some time to come. Two factors make it inevitable. First, MLS is rapidly splitting between the haves and have-nots, and the have-nots will need some sort of incentive beyond scraping into the playoffs (which will surely be revised if not outright scrapped down the road). Second, pro/rel provides a buffer against lawsuits such as the ones tossed out by the NASL, whose remaining owners seem determined to take the rest of US Soccer down with them. But MLS will have to proceed with caution to keep its current owners happy, or at least unlikely to call in the legal barracudas. BD ... owners declaring single entity is impeding competition. So, not likely. We could see some symbolic movement on the pro/rel front at the next tier down from MLS, as USL continues to grow and NASL continues to be squeezed, but in the top league, trying to argue past the profit motive of sports industrialists is a tough cause to take up. Still, the populist mood of the US Soccer presidential race should encourage the fans who’ve long rallied round pro/rel. GP ... the Colorado Rapids reprising their unlikely 2016 run to the Western Conference finals. Fresh off USMNT staggering World Cup qualification nosedive, American soccer would seem ripe for some kind of drastic change. Outside the social media echo chamber, however, exist powerful administrative forces with little appetite for shaking up the status quo. MP Nope, it’s not happening. Not anytime soon, anyway. The US Soccer presidential election exposed the discussion over promotion/relegation to the mainstream, and there is a feeling that, for the first time, a grown-up debate over the concept can be had. But MLS is still dictated to by its owners, owners who don’t want the threat of relegation. If change is to happen it has to come from the top of the North American game. That opportunity has just been missed. Maybe next time. GR The MVP will be … Miguel Almiron, Atlanta. The Paraguayan midfielder is only going to get better. He’ll be the driving force behind a team that contends for the title. BD I’m intrigued by the rebuild at the Galaxy, and especially by the acquisition of Ola Kamara, who I think could turn out to be one of those players who thrives in LA. He was prolific and overlooked at Columbus, and if LA come back from a disappointing 2017, he’ll finally have the chance to claim some deserved credit. GP Sebastian Giovinco. The crafty little Italian was a step below his ankle-breaking best in 2017, finishing with his lowest goal and assist totals since he arrived in MLS from Juventus in 2015. Yet even at 31, Giovinco is still as gifted and as ruthless as any attacker in the league, and surrounded by capable playmakers, expect him to bounce back in a big way. MP Almiron. This is assuming Arsenal don’t splurge $50m on the Paraguayan playmaker to replace Mesut Ozil when he eventually goes to Manchester United this summer. Almiron and Josef Martinez formed quite the partnership in their first season in MLS, with both players impressing as the stars of an enthralling Atlanta United side. Along with Sebastian Giovinco, there’s a sense that Almiron is a level above. GR One bold prediction The Columbus Crew’s effort to move to Austin falls apart in spectacular fashion. Frustrated owner Anthony Precourt offloads the club as quickly as possible, driving down the much-hyped Forbes valuation for each MLS club (except Atlanta and LAFC) and throwing a wrench in the expansion sweepstakes. Rather than seeing the expansion fee drop, MLS growth stops at 26 clubs, with the final slot going to North Carolina FC. BD Zlatan to MLS is probably rather too in the mould of the believable at this stage of his career, isn’t it? Maybe the long, long saga that ended in David Beckham’s Miami team finally becoming a thing, will mean that the speculation on when and where it will land can now be replaced by speculation on who he’ll attract to one of the more glamorous venues in MLS. Cristiano Ronaldo to sign a pre-agreement to become the team’s first Designated player when they launch? GP Toronto FC will break up Liga MX’s Concacaf Champions League hegemony. Not since 2000 has an MLS team won the continental club title. Not since 2005 has anybody outside Mexico worn the crown. TFC have the talent and playoff experience to finally end both streaks. MP Landon Donovan will return to MLS. Because all this 2018 MLS season is lacking in narrative is a third coming of the prodigal son. He’s already out of retirement (again), playing in Liga MX for Club Leon, so here’s what will happen - Donovan will get to about July when he’ll get a call from Bob Bradley. LAFC will be struggling, in need of players as injuries start to take their toll on their shallow squad. You know it’ll happen. Drama. GR Eastern Conference playoff teams Atlanta, Toronto, NYC FC, Chicago, Columbus, Orlando. BD Toronto, Atlanta, New York Red Bulls, NYC FC, Orlando, Chicago. GP Toronto, Atlanta, NYC FC, Orlando, New York Red Bulls, Columbus. MP Toronto, Atlanta, NYC FC, New York Red Bulls, Orlando, Columbus. GR Western Conference playoff teams Seattle, Kansas City, Portland, Vancouver, Dallas, Real Salt Lake. BD LA Galaxy, Real Salt Lake, Portland, Seattle, Dallas, Vancouver. GP Portland, Seattle, Salt Lake, Kansas City, Dallas, Los Angeles FC. MP Real Salt Lake, Seattle, Kansas City, Dallas, Portland, LA Galaxy. GR MLS Cup champions Atlanta United. Tata Martino doesn’t need more than two years to figure out how to win in this league, particularly when he has the financial resources Arthur Blank and the Atlanta fanbase are handing him. And it won’t just be the South American imports and a couple of US veterans on the field. Watch for Andrew Carleton to lead the way as Atlanta’s strong academy pays dividends sooner rather than later. BD Toronto made the league’s deepest ever roster stronger in the off-season, and have all the tools to be back-to-back champions. If Atlanta improve, or NYC FC learn to concentrate when it matters there could be credible challengers in the East, and the Cascadia teams and a retooled Galaxy will all ask questions. But it’s perverse to look beyond Toronto at this stage of the year, given what they did at the end of the last one. GP Atlanta United. Far from being content with their first-year success, Atlanta have doubled down. United broke the MLS transfer record to sign Barco, and midfielder Darlington Nagbe, arrived in a trade from Portland, should be a natural fit. This team does look a bit unbalanced, and the back line is a concern, but underestimate MLS’s most ambitious club at your own peril. MP Toronto . Greg Vanney’s side were by far and away the best side in MLS last season. They swept to their first ever MLS Cup in style. Since then, not much has changed. They have, largely, kept the same squad together and have started well in the CONCACAF Champions League. So why can’t TFC build the kind of dynasty not seen in MLS since the height of the Bruce Arena days at the LA Galaxy?

The new lineup was announced on Wednesday as a new round of compliance talks between the debt-stricken country and bailout creditors got under way. The government spokesman said the deputy prime minister, Yannis Dragasakis, would assume the key portfolio of economy and development minister, while Dimitris Vitsas would replace Yiannis Mouzalas as migration minister. Both are sensitive posts in a county that has battled bankruptcy and the European refugee crisis. In a surprise move, the Syriza party leader also brought the former leader of the Democratic Left party, Fotis Kouvelis, into government, giving him Vitsas’s post as deputy defence minister. The reshuffle was triggered by the resignation on Monday of the economy minister Dimitris Papadimitriou after his wife, the alternate labour minister, Rania Antonopoulou, had also quit earlier that day. Antonopoulou gave her notice after it was revealed that she had accepted €23,000 in housing benefits at a time of immense hardship for Greeks. The pair, both prominent academics in the US, where they have a permanent home, had been described as one of the wealthiest couples in politics, with combined multimillion-dollar assets. In a contrite statement, Antonopoulou – who had taken leave of absence from the New York-based Levy economics institute to oversee policies of social solidarity – said she would return the stipend to the state. “It was never my intention to insult the Greek people,” said the statement. “I understand that my financial standing, as reflected in my tax declaration, has increased public outrage.” Tsipras has sought to play down the row. He indirectly praised the couple, in a speech late on Tuesday, for the “sensibility” they had exhibited in stepping down. The benefits row paled next to the corruption and criminal wrongdoing of previous administrations that had contributed to Greece’s near-financial collapse, he said, repeating claims that the Greek health system had lost €23bn as a result of inflated contracts in the pharmacy sector. The country has been rocked in recent weeks by allegations of industrial-scale bribery involving the Swiss drug maker, Novartis, and 10 top Greek politicians, including two former prime ministers and the current governor of the bank of Greece. But Papadimitriou’s departure comes at an especially sensitive time. After eight years of international surveillance, debt-stricken Athens hopes to end its bailout era in August when its third, EU-sponsored bailout programme expires. Negotiations on a fourth compliance review of “reforms for rescue funds” officially began this week with bailout inspectors representing the EU and International Monetary Fund. Papadimitriou, in charge of promoting Greece to foreign investors, was to play a pivotal role in the talks. The 72-year-old American academic, who had given up his post as provost of Bard college to join the leftist government, had been widely praised by auditors. Although Antonopoulou had struggled at times to adapt to Greece – preferring to give conference speeches in English, a language she felt more comfortable in – she, too, won plaudits. Legislation introducing rent subsidies for politicians without permanent homes in Athens had been voted in at the height of the crisis as parliament also legislated pension cuts, tax rises and other cutbacks to keep Greece in the eurozone. “Ultimately, this boils down to a cultural misunderstanding,” said one well-placed insider. “Neither were professional politicians and neither recognised the significance of making symbolic moves to attain political legitimacy. It has burnt them and it has burnt the government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/07/the-months-best-music-march-chvrches-riko-dan-machine-head","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-07T10:00:06Z","webTitle":"50 great tracks for March from Chvrches, Riko Dan, Machine Head and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/07/the-months-best-music-march-chvrches-riko-dan-machine-head","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/07/the-months-best-music-march-chvrches-riko-dan-machine-head","fields":{"headline":"50 great tracks for March from Chvrches, Riko Dan, Machine Head and more","bodyText":"Machine Head – Bastards After 27 years, some bands might be tempted to put out crowd-pleasing, laurel-resting material, but the Oakland metal veterans have instead written the divisive and stirring Bastards, one of the most arresting protest songs of the Trump era (taken from their new album, Catharsis). Written the day after the election, its lacerating lyric sheet is worth reading in full, but takes aim at racists, “second amendment thugs” and Wall Street, and champions “the pussy generation, the PC and the brave”, reclaiming the hateful language of the right. Frontman Robb Flynn does this most boldly with a recasting of Lady Liberty’s line “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses”: “So give us all your faggots, all your niggers and your spivs / Give us all your Muslims, the so-called terrorists / We’ll welcome ‘em with open arms and put ‘em in our mix / We’re better off together now, embrace our difference.” Like Bruce Springsteen did with “yellow man” in Born in the USA, Flynn takes the racist rhetoric of the right and ferociously turns it back towards them. Chvrches – My Enemy (feat Matt Berninger) An often deeply satisfying pop trope is to take a glum singer from the glum world of guitar rock and juxtapose them with the fabulousness of dance-pop: think Anohni doing Blind with Hercules &amp; Love Affair, Ian Svenonius ranting in Shit Robot’s Simple Things, or the entire career of New Order. Scottish trio Chvrches, whose new album is out 25 May, repeat the trick by roping in the National’s frontman Matt Berninger – he is transmuted into a moody R&amp;B starlet, his morose croon set against Lauren Mayberry’s perky yet equally sad vocal. Riko Dan – Hard Food Roll Deep member Riko Dan has one of the most instantly recognisable voices of any British MC: a sarky, high-energy timbre that straddles London and Jamaica, with patois flitting in and out. He’s become the go-to guy to give underground producers a bit of ravey toasting – as on Rabit’s Black Dragons or the Bug’s Iceman – and his new EP adds to them: Joker, Pinch, Mumdance, Walton and Ziro create ribcage-bothering, reload-inviting grime and dub backings for him to fire battle-ready bars over. P Adrix – Zelda Shyt In championing a raw, unvarnished take on Angola’s kuduro dance style, where its stumbling beat was paired with the coldness of techno, Lisbon label Principe brought a completely new sound to underground western dancefloors around 2012, and made straightforward 4/4 suddenly seem rather dull. They’re still going strong, and new signing P Adrix is the perfect introduction, making insanely funky, off-kilter ghetto house laced with that kuduro syncopation. Long-time Principe star DJ Nigga Fox is also on this month’s playlist with new track Poder do Vento. Natalie Prass – Short Court Style Following up her self-titled 2015 debut, Natalie Prass releases her most propulsive material yet – which, given that her previous record was a brilliantly realised blend of soft rock and folk, perhaps isn’t saying much. This is disco-funk as fluffy as a pomeranian after a blow-dry – reminiscent of Feist, and, further back, the kind of singer found on the brilliant Ladies of Too Slow to Disco compilation: Carly Simon, Laura Allan and the rest. Will have you clicking your heels amid the bleak midwinter. MGMT – Me and Michael A different kind of disco is channelled here – the camp, overblown 1980s Italian variety – for this strident ballad. It results in the sort of sturdy, vulcanised melancholia that closed out John Hughes movies: all booming drums, big simple melodies, and a singer who sounds like they’re nobly holding back tears while staring down a long straight road. MTv – Smooth Motion Japanese producer Kohei Matsunaga, aka NHK yx Koyxen, is currently in a patch as purple as a Dairy Milk in Prince’s fridge. His new album Parallel Tempo, full of scary ambient techno and peppy acid, has just come out, not long after the friendlier, sparklier Exit Entrance, released on DFA last year (if they whet your interest, head further back to the titanic Dance Classics trio on PAN). He also collaborated with countryman DJ Nobu at MTv, and their track Smooth Motion – essentially a two-bar synth pattern repeated in various tones of light and shade – could prove a magnificent secret weapon in techno sets. US Girls – Rosebud Noone is making pop quite like Meghan Remy: an almost trip-hop-like melange of samples, psychedelia, dusty breakbeats and swooning vocal lines. Her technique reaches its apotheosis on the brilliant Rosebud. She throws you off with a gaping hole where a chorus should be, eventually filled with the kind of soulful, forthright pop top line that Adele is usually fed. Marisa Anderson – Cloud Corner Anderson, from Portland, Oregon, is a rare female adherent to the “American primitive” style of guitar playing (though she may reject the label) – a pretty yet emotionally fraught fingerpicking, shot through with the blues. Hers is often delivered on an electric guitar, adding a gorgeous rough irreverence. She’s stepping up to the Thrill Jockey label after a number of self-released albums, with Cloud Corner the first track – a whimsical wall of echoing melody – to emerge. Ursula K Le Guin &amp; Todd Barton – Heron Dance Always Coming Home was a typically ambitious project from science-fiction writer Ursula K Le Guin. Written in 1985, it’s a story set in a flooded, post-apocalyptic California about a people called the Kesh, with two-thirds of the book given over to documentation about the tribe, including poems, recipes and maps. And even music which, extraordinarily, was performed on fictional instruments that Le Guin designed herself, built by her friend Todd Barton. Released on an accompanying tape, it’s being reissued in March; Heron Dance opens the album, where what sounds like a zither blends with an unidentifiable alien wail, all of it riding a steadily loping groove. Following Le Guin’s death in January, it’s another reminder of the sheer scale of her universe-building."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/01/cuts-childrens-centres-sure-start-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Cuts to children’s centres mean lifelines are disappearing.

Ask Alka","bodyText":"In her front room in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, as her toddler has an afternoon nap, Alka is grabbing a few minutes to herself, like any ordinary mum. But with only her laptop and phone, the 43-year-old is taking on her local council – and with it, starting a domino effect that could challenge one of the cruellest cuts now taking effect throughout the country. The story begins two years ago when Alka’s son was two weeks old. It was a hard time in many ways: she had moved to a new area after her mum died of cancer, and she had a new baby to care for. The local children’s centre was, in her words, “a lifeline”: a place to meet others mums, attend parenting classes and talk to health visitors. Her son could play in the creche while she had counselling for postnatal depression and grief in the room next door. Time at “messy play” – involving trays of coloured spaghetti and flour – allowed him to be assessed for speech problems with no fuss. He then attended a group called Little Talkers at the centre to help with his speech development. Then, in January, Buckinghamshire county council announced it would be closing the bulk of the centres in a bid, in its words, to create “a better, more coordinated service” at a time when there’s “less money in the public purse”. In June, 35 children’s centres across the county are due to shut their doors and be replaced by nine “hubs” (which the council is describing as “community hubs”). The lifeline parents such as Alka rely on will be cut, just like that. “These centres are like a second family. People rely on them on a day-to-day basis,” says Alka. “I bet most politicians haven’t even set foot in one.” Eight years ago, government ministers began dismantling the public services relied on locally by largely low-income families: from reductions in social care for disabled people, to the closure of libraries used by poor teenagers as a quiet place to study. Children’s centres – the cornerstone of local support for young families – are the next vital service on the chopping board. Since 2010, funding for children’s centres in England has been halved from £1.2bn to £0.6bn, as local authorities battle to stay afloat due to unprecedented cuts from central government. In Buckinghamshire, for example, 2018-19 will be the council’s first year without a revenue support grant – a pot of money from central government that can be used for any local need. Just six years ago, the grant was more than £60m. What is happening in Buckinghamshire is being replicated nationwide. Since 2010, more than 500 children’s centres have closed as the Sure Start initiative introduced by a Labour government is decimated by cuts. Look at Bristol, where this week councillors approved cuts to children’s centres that will see the equivalent of 40 full-time members of staff being lost, or Somerset, where last month plans were finalised to close two-thirds of its Sure Start centres, with 24 facilities across the area set be replaced with eight “family centres”. Northamptonshire, whose county council has effectively gone bankrupt, has already had to reduce funding to children’s centre services by 40% in the last two years. Alka is working on a nationwide campaign, coordinating with families in Cambridgeshire, Leicestershire and Kent. In her own area, she is helping build a team of parents from each of Buckinghamshire’s centres to stop the closures: an army of mums and dads launching anything from press releases to the media, to protests with placards and chants. When I ask Buckinghamshire county council about the planned changes, it says it is “crucial that we reach the children and families who need our help as early as possible” and that “by being proactive and going out to where families who need us are, dealing with the whole family and all of their issues, and listening to what families need rather than waiting for them to reach a crisis point”, it is confident it can “make some real positive changes” for local families. It is yet to be decided how the remaining children’s centre buildings will be used, but the council says it is pursuing ideas about how the sites can be “repurposed and still provide value for children, families and communities”. Alka is far from convinced. “With all the cuts to funding, what’s to stop these ‘hubs’ from closing? And how are women meant to get to them [when their local centre is closed]?” On paper, Alka and the other parents are fighting to stop the closure of a couple of dozen buildings. But, really, this is about far more than bricks and mortar, or even children’s centres themselves. It goes to the heart of what the government’s ideologically driven austerity is stripping from local communities – how, bit by bit, any public service can now be removed in the name of short-term cost-cutting. On top of children’s centres, child services generally – from teenage pregnancy support, short breaks for disabled children, and youth centres – are skeletal. Research by Action for Children shows that since 2010, funding for these early intervention services has fallen by £1.7bn across England. The Local Government Association expects £2bn more of council cuts to children’s services by 2020. At the same time, child poverty is expected to soar to record levels. Standing between the government and the obliteration of family services are parents like Alka. It is a damning reflection of how deep austerity is running that, to ministers in Westminster, a toddler’s wellbeing can now be seen as expendable. In an era of cuts, our children’s futures are fair game."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/28/jared-kushner-white-house-security-clearance","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T19:46:59Z","webTitle":"Why can't Jared Kushner get security clearance at the White House?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/28/jared-kushner-white-house-security-clearance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/28/jared-kushner-white-house-security-clearance","fields":{"headline":"Why can't Jared Kushner get security clearance at the White House?","bodyText":"Early this month, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, placed a delicate call to the White House. A hitch had developed that would further delay top security clearances for Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. The call came at a bad time for the West Wing. Two days earlier, the resignation of the staff secretary, Rob Porter, had focused public attention on the fact that an unknown number of White House aides were still working with only interim clearance status. This after Donald Trump had won the presidency while repeatedly demanding that his opponent be thrown in prison for mishandling classified information. But as Rosenstein’s call made clear, the Kushner delay was especially problematic. Kushner was closer to the president than almost anyone else, with more responsibilities than any other aide, and his clearance application had raised more red flags within the intelligence community. Rosenstein did not tell the White House counsel, Donald McGahn, what the apparently new problem with Kushner was, according to the Washington Post, which first reported the call. Which leaves the increasingly urgent question still open: why can’t Kushner gain clearance? The White House has declined to comment on Kushner’s failure to gain security clearance while expressing confidence in his work. It is unclear whether the White House knows or suspects the reason for the Kushner delay; Trump’s aides professed shock when allegations of domestic abuse emerged against Porter. Kushner and others have for now been stripped of top-secret clearance, according to reports on Tuesday – although as president, Trump may continue to share any information he pleases with his relations or anyone else. It is unclear whether the latest hitch in the clearance process for Kushner relates to the regular background checks process conducted by the FBI, or to the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Rosenstein, who made the call to the White House, oversees both. Kushner was interviewed by Mueller’s team last November, in a session that was said to focus on a meeting Kushner held during the presidential transition with the former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in which Kushner reportedly asked about setting up back-channel communications with Russia. Kushner has denied making the request of Kislyak. Also in the meeting, however, was the future national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is now cooperating with Mueller. If the story Kushner told investigators about the Kislyak meeting or a different meeting conflicts with Flynn’s story or other evidence, Kushner may be in criminal legal jeopardy. Kushner has denied all wrongdoing. With a vacuum of reliable public information about Kushner’s security clearance delays, reporting led by the Washington Post has indicated that Kushner’s contacts with foreign officials, and those officials’ regard for him as an easy target, have been a factor. The national security adviser, HR McMaster, was surprised to learn in his daily intelligence briefing, the Post reported, that Kushner had bypassed him in the White House to take meetings with foreign officials who, it turned out, saw Kushner as pliable. “It was a dream come true” for Chinese diplomats to deal with Kushner, a former national security council member told the New Yorker. “They couldn’t believe he was so compliant.” Kushner’s legal team declined to comment on reports that he was seen as an easy target by foreign officials. “We will not respond substantively to unnamed sources peddling secondhand hearsay with rank speculation who continue to leak inaccurate information,” a spokesperson said. Kushner has had trouble in the past with undeclared meetings. In initial filings to gain security clearances, he omitted more than 100 calls or contacts with foreign officials or entities and at least 70 assets, oversights he later blamed on inexperience and overwork. Those omissions included a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Russian operatives, and a meeting during the presidential transition with Sergey Gorkov, the head of the Russian bank Vnesheconombank, which is subject to US sanctions. Gorkov said they discussed potential business deals, which Kushner denied. Kushner’s business dealings are the focus of intensive speculation as to why he cannot gain security clearance. Kushner claimed to have divested from his family real estate firm, Kushner Companies, when he joined the White House, and last July he said: “I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector.” But Kushner Companies appears to need money. Next year, a $1.2bn debt comes due on the company’s flagship property, 666 Fifth Avenue, purchased by Kushner at a record price at the height of the real estate bubble. Kushner pursued but failed to obtain a $500m bailout from the former Qatari prime minister, the Intercept reported last July. Kushner denied the report. Kushner companies also sought financing from China’s Anbang Insurance Group. In the spring of 2017, Kushner’s family firm received about $30m from one of Israel’s largest financial institutions, the New York Times reported. Shortly afterward, Kushner made his first trip with Trump to Israel as the president’s official envoy on Middle East peace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/28/51-rise-sees-unilever-boss-paid-10m-in-2017-and-it-could-get-bigger","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T18:30:30Z","webTitle":"Unilever chief's pay package rises 51% to £10.3m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/28/51-rise-sees-unilever-boss-paid-10m-in-2017-and-it-could-get-bigger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/28/51-rise-sees-unilever-boss-paid-10m-in-2017-and-it-could-get-bigger","fields":{"headline":"Unilever chief's pay package rises 51% to £10.3m","bodyText":"The pay package of Unilever’s chief executive, Paul Polman, grew by 51% to £10.3m in 2017, and he is in line for a further rise in salary and potential bonuses under an overhaul of executive pay. Polman’s 2017 pay deal includes a £1m annual salary, £2m bonus and £6.4m in long-term bonus scheme shares, according to the group’s annual report. Last year’s deal totalled £6.8m. The consumer goods company also revealed plans for a pay review which, for Polman, would raise his total fixed pay, including salary and benefits, by 5% to £1.45m in 2018 and hand him up to £9.9m in bonuses and shares a year. This would be a 23% rise in the potential for bonuses. Unilever said its remuneration committee was “of the view that this increased maximum opportunity is fully justified by higher risk and more stretching performance requirements”. But its position on pay risks stoking controversy during the upcoming annual general meeting season. Unilever said its new pay plans would come with a number of conditions, including the requirement for bosses to invest up to 67% of their annual bonus in Unilever shares, which they must hold for at least four years. The remuneration committee added that to earn the maximum pay under the incentive plan, bosses would have to “deliver truly outstanding performance over the full five years”. Details of its pay plans follow results for the Anglo-Dutch group earlier this month showing a 9% increase in annual profits to £7.1bn. Unilever, which is behind household brands such as Dove, Marmite and Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice-cream, was boosted by a strong performance in emerging markets. The group fended off a £115bn takeover attempt from Kraft Heinz last year, after which it offloaded its spreads business for £6bn to the private equity firm KKR. As part of a rethink after the Kraft approach, Unilever is reviewing its dual-headed legal structure and is expected to consolidate its headquarters in the UK or the Netherlands. A decision is expected in the next fortnight amid reports it could ditch the UK HQ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2021/dec/31/betty-white-a-true-tv-genius-and-a-comedy-black-belt","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-31T21:12:18Z","webTitle":"Betty White: a true TV genius – and a comedy black belt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/31/betty-white-a-true-tv-genius-and-a-comedy-black-belt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/31/betty-white-a-true-tv-genius-and-a-comedy-black-belt","fields":{"headline":"Betty White: a true TV genius – and a comedy black belt","bodyText":"Betty White, who had one of the longest careers in TV history playing ditzy blondes, was actually one of the toughest and most wised-up brunettes in showbiz. Yet such was her skill in shaping her public image – through talkshows, gameshows, sitcoms and multiple autobiographies – that from early on she was seen as something more than a mere TV personality: an actual type. In her later years, she was held up by many as the ultimate example of how to be an older person. Amy Poehler, in her book of essays Yes, Please, recalls the time White appeared on Saturday Night Live in 2010: “I asked her what she was going to do after the show. ‘I’m going to fix myself a vodka on the rocks and eat a cold hotdog,’ she said. It confirmed for me that growing old was awesome,” Poehler writes. By then, White had already spent almost 70 years cannily making herself into a recognisable genus. In 1973, when The Mary Tyler Moore Show was in the ascendant, an episode was written featuring a new character, Sue Ann, whom the script described as “a sickeningly sweet Betty White type”, White recalls in one of her memoirs, Here We Go Again. But, White writes, “They couldn’t find anyone sickening enough.” And so the casting director gave the part of Sue Ann Nivens, the seemingly dopey blonde with a not-very-hidden vicious and nymphomaniac streak, to White herself. White played it to such perfection she became a regular in the show and promptly won her second and third Emmys for the role. White worked for so long that looking back on her career is like taking a Zelig-like tour through the history of American TV, in which she pops up in each of the medium’s most seminal genres through the decades. (Her beloved third, last and late husband, TV gameshow host Allen Ludden, used to introduce her at parties with, “Meet my wife – one of the pioneers in silent television.” “And it was practically true,” she agreed.) White, who was born in Illinois but grew up in Los Angeles, got her first job in TV in 1949 as the sidekick to Al Jarvis on his live variety show, Hollywood on Television, on which she and Jarvis would chat amiably between playing new records. However, TV viewers wrote in to complain that they were more interested in White and Jarvis’s chat than the records, so the music was promptly ditched. Her appealing personality meant she was there in the early days of gameshows and talkshows, then throughout the 1950s and 60s worked with everyone from Jack Paar to Johnny Carson. Fans got to see her deeply in love in her many appearances on her husband gameshow, Password, which Ludden hosted from 1961 to 1967. When the two appeared on the show shortly after their honeymoon they could hardly stop giggling and saying one another’s name in lovestruck delight. Paar, a friend of the couple and another guest on the show, stared at them in wonder: “What kind of a honeymoon did you two have?” he asked, affecting bemusement. They never had children, although White was stepmother to Ludden’s children from an earlier relationship, and she was a noted devoted lover of animals and wrote about her long work with zoos and conservation in yet another memoir, Betty and Friends: My Life at the Zoo. She turned down a role in the hit 1997 film As Good as it Gets because in one scene a character dropped a puppy down a laundry chute. “I said as long as that scene was in the film, I wouldn’t do it,” she said. And she didn’t. White was one of the first and still relatively few women to have creative control in front of and behind the camera, with her 1950s sitcom, Life With Elizabeth. While not an obvious trailblazer like Joan Rivers, White was a quiet revolutionary in her way – a gloved knife rather than a Rivers-like axe smashing down walls, whose onscreen jibes came with a sweet smile instead of a sneer. Her two signature roles played on this contrast – the sweetness overlaying the sting – to brilliant effect. She became prominent in sitcoms in the 70s and 80s – arguably the genre’s two greatest decades. As Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, she satirised her own twinkly eyed appearance, shooting the most cutting of jabs at Moore while she wafted around holding a souffle. A new generation came to know her as Rose Nylund, the seemingly dopey Nordic blonde from St Olaf, Minnesota, on the wildly successful 80s sitcom, The Golden Girls, about a group of older women living in Florida, co-starring Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty. They were all, as one TV critic said, “comedy black belts”, but few shows demonstrated better White’s genius at comedy: her timing, her rhythms and even just her facial expressions turned Rose from a potentially one-joke pony into a three-dimensional character, one especially beloved by children. “It tickled me whenever some very small person, tugging at mother’s sleeve, would point and say, ‘There’s Wose!’ Too young to pronounce it, they still knew the character,” White recalled. Any arguments about how audiences don’t want to watch old people on TV are disproven by a glance at The Golden Girls’ records. The show was in the Top 10 most-watched shows in the US every week for its first five years. During those years, all four stars were nominated for Emmys every single year. While seemingly a generic sitcom with a laugh track, the show was astonishingly bold about everything from geriatric sex to death in a way no show has been since, and it was beloved by the mainstream of all ages. White summed up the show’s appeal by saying, simply and correctly, “I think we were just truly funny.” It could be argued that anyone who hangs around long enough in the entertainment business becomes a legend and beloved treasure. But this simply isn’t true, as a skating glance at the many forgotten legends of TV past proves (when Mary Tyler Moore died in 2016 many were surprised she was even still around). White’s longevity is undoubtedly remarkable – when her last sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, ended she was 93. But she represented a lot more than mere good genes. She was a real trouper in the old showbiz sense, happy to go along with anything for the joke, whether it was tap dancing (brilliantly) in shorts on The Golden Girls in her 60s, or making jokes about her “salty muffin” on Saturday Night Live in her 90s. She was, she often admitted, a workaholic, whose love for work was partly why her second marriage ended in 1949 after two years, and it was how she got herself through the grief when Ludden died in 1981. But she was also an early adopter of the concept of celebrity: she understood before many others the value of making her personality her brand, and how close it was to reality became moot. With talent like hers, reality was by the by."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/28/tottenham-hotspur-rochdale-fa-cup-fifth-round-replay-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T21:54:41Z","webTitle":"Fernando Llorente and VAR grab the attention as Spurs end Rochdale dream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/28/tottenham-hotspur-rochdale-fa-cup-fifth-round-replay-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/28/tottenham-hotspur-rochdale-fa-cup-fifth-round-replay-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Fernando Llorente and VAR grab the attention as Spurs end Rochdale dream","bodyText":"It was a game of two halves, but with a twist. Spurs romped home in the second period with a cocky display on a carpet of snow to set up a quarter-final at Swansea. The first half belonged to VAR. The video assistant disallowed a goal, turned a free-kick into a penalty and provided half a dozen excruciating interruptions in which referee Paul Tierney stood forlornly with his finger in his ear. As far as the football went, a hat-trick for Fernando Llorente was accompanied by two from Son Heung-min and a first goal for Kyle Walker-Peters, while Stephen Humphrys scored a sweet goal for Rochdale to temporarily level the scores at 1-1. Talk among the shivering Wembley crowd of under 25,000, though, was of technology, its effectiveness and why it took so long to reach a decision. After the game Mauricio Pochettino bore the demeanour of a parent disappointed by a child at a school function. “The first half was a bit of an embarrassment for everyone‚“ he said. “In my opinion there is a lot of work to do. Football is a game of emotions and we have to be careful not to kill it. If I can’t shout when we score, because we have to wait two minutes for a decision, will I buy a ticket?” The two minutes Pochettino was referring to began in the sixth minute. Spurs thought they had scored the opening goal, as Son’s driving run into the box ended in a cross-shot Josh Lillis could not hold. There was a scramble in the box, Llorente – who will face his former club in the next round – appeared to win it, and the ball came loose to Érik Lamela who turned home. Celebrations had almost finished by the time Tierney consulted VAR. A hush descended and a wait began. Eventually he pointed for a goalkick and the crowd slowly tried to work out what had gone on. Replays suggested Llorente’s tussle with Harrison McGahey might have resulted in the Spaniard fouling the defender, or the other way around, or both. Certainly it did not instantly appear Tierney had made a “clear and obvious” error, the criteria VAR is supposed to adhere to. Spurs took the lead for real through Son, who cut inside one, two defenders to fire home past Lillis. Normal service appeared to have been resumed and three minutes later Kieran Trippier won a free-kick off Matt Done on the edge of the Rochdale box. But hang on, the finger was at Tierney’s ear again. Another wait ensued, one so long as to get the entire crowd jeering, before the decision was overruled again. The foul was a penalty. Son took it, scored, then had his kick ruled out for pausing in his run-up. Tierney called it right. VAR stayed quiet. Rochdale asserted themselves in the first half and managed to equalise on the half-hour. Andrew Cannon’s cross curled beyond the retreating Spurs defence, Humphrys took one touch out of his feet then scored low past Michel Vorm with his second. In first-half added time, the pair nearly combined again, but this time Cannon put Humphrys’ pass on to a post. The second half began in heavy snow but Spurs were soon running hot. Barely a minute in Lucas Moura played a cute exchange with Lamela then released Llorente to loft a shot over the onrushing Lillis to restore Spurs’ lead. The crowd celebrated, then paused; the finger had gone to the ear once more. This time, after another 30 seconds, the goal stood. Llorente had his third before the hour was out, turning home a Lamela cross then heading in from inches out with Son the provider. In the 65th minute, Son scored again, from another Lamela assist. This attacking quartet may have barely played together but it certainly did not look like it. Walker-Peters, a substitute, completed the rout in added time. Keith Hill gave midfielder Joseph Thompson a substitute appearance on his return from cancer treatment and the Rochdale manager was left excited by his Wembley experience, even the VAR. “The confusion was as exciting as the way we wanted to play football,” he said. “I was totally immersed in it, the first half felt like it was 10 minutes long. It was an education in VAR for me and I understand more the way it works. We do have to let people in the stadium know what’s going on, though.” Most in attendance would surely concur."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/28/england-feared-by-rivals-lucy-bronze","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T22:30:03Z","webTitle":"England are now feared by rivals, says defender Lucy Bronze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/28/england-feared-by-rivals-lucy-bronze","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/28/england-feared-by-rivals-lucy-bronze","fields":{"headline":"England are now feared by rivals, says defender Lucy Bronze","bodyText":"Lucy Bronze believes England’s rise towards the apex of women’s football has served a serious warning to their rivals in the lead-up to the World Cup next summer. Bronze, who will captain England for the first time on Thursday night in the SheBelieves Cup opener against France in place of the injured Steph Houghton, was a key member of the Lioness squads which reached the last four in the most recent World Cup and European Championship tournaments. Even though the sacking of Mark Sampson as manager threatened to fracture and unsettle the squad, the arrival of Phil Neville five weeks ago and the introduction of former captain Casey Stoney as part of his coaching staff have helped to refocus minds with the World Cup in France next summer. England will face the two top ranked teams in the world, Germany and the USA, in their remaining games here, giving Neville the perfect opportunity to test his squad’s credentials. Yet Bronze, who last summer became the first English player to join the four-times Champions League winners Lyon, is in no doubt. “I know from playing in Lyon with all the different nationalities that people are little bit scared of playing England now,” the former Manchester City right-back said. “That’s different. In the past, I wouldn’t say we were a joke as such but people disregarded us a bit. They didn’t have a huge amount of respect for us as a football team. They knew we would be physical, we still are, but they didn’t think we could play football. “Now, they’re aware we have more angles to our game. We aren’t here to make up the numbers. To have reached back-to-back semi-finals is still an amazing achievement. There aren’t many teams who have held that level of consistency, but it still leaves a sour taste in the mouth to have not gone on to reach a final and that has to be the target at the World Cup. We have never entered a tournament not wanting to win, but we are going to be one of the favourites.” Leaving England for France was a huge move for Bronze – and women’s football in this country considering Lyon’s stature and trophy cabinet – though the switch is already paying huge dividends. “I think I’ve got a bit more composure on the ball,” said the 26-year-old, who admitted some of the younger members of the England squad have had to resort to YouTube to learn about Neville’s playing career. “I play with some of the best players in the world every day so I should be getting better. It’s a challenge, I have to push myself every single day just to hold my own technically. “I don’t get kicked as much. I wake up in the morning with less bruises and scratches. The English league, although it’s one of the better leagues, it’s more physical. The French league is more technical. Which is good, because that is what I went there for. I wanted to get better technically.” Neville, meanwhile, has been quick in attempting to make his mark on the squad and instil the kind of discipline and attention to detail which served him well during his playing career with Manchester United, Everton and England. A player leaving a water bottle on the pitch at the end of his first training session may appear trivial yet the 41-year-old distinctly felt otherwise, something with which his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson would certainly concur. “I’ve tried to raise the bar in terms of every facet of performance and so far what I’ve seen is that they have risen to every challenge that I’ve set them apart from leaving a water bottle on the training pitch, which I wasn’t happy about,” said Neville, who hauled the guilty party off the team bus to correct her error. “Doing that is unheard of so we talked about the standards that I want from them as a team, the kind of thing which was instilled into me from my parents, from the managers that I played for. “The little things matter. They are on top of timekeeping but I’m a stickler for standards. We’re going to be all in it together from the kit man to the security to the media. Then we all share it together. They get it. They know full well. And do you know what? They want me to pull them on things like that. “Leaving the kit man to pick up a bottle of water is, for me, as big a crime as giving the ball away. That said, I have been really surprised by the standards they have set themselves and how they have policed themselves – which is even more important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/28/yemen-saudi-arabia-war-us-support-senator-push-to-end","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T21:31:51Z","webTitle":"Yemen war: senators push to end US support of Saudi Arabia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/28/yemen-saudi-arabia-war-us-support-senator-push-to-end","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/28/yemen-saudi-arabia-war-us-support-senator-push-to-end","fields":{"headline":"Yemen war: senators push to end US support of Saudi Arabia","bodyText":"Three US senators have introduced a resolution that will force the chamber to vote for the first time on whether the US should continue to support Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen, a conflict that has led to the deaths of at least 10,000 civilians there and driven the Middle East’s poorest country to the brink of famine. The joint resolution, sponsored by two senators from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, independent Bernie Sanders, Republican Mike Lee, and Democrat Chris Murphy, is a rare effort by Congress to claw back its war powers from the executive branch. Aides to senators say the resolution, which would trigger a vote over whether to end US participation in the conflict, is unprecedented in the Senate. The intent of the resolution is to revive the decades-long debate over defining – and in their view, reclaiming – Congress’s constitutional role in declaring war, according to aides to both senators. “This is about the process,” said an aide to Lee. “What decisions do we make for a country that has been at war constantly for almost 20 years? When do we say that something is worthy of intervening in and when do we make that determination? It’s about the how. “And it’s about who is involved in that decision. It’s not about who is in the White House but it’s about Congress reasserting its power and having it’s true control to make those authorizations.” Yemen’s conflict began in 2014, when the Houthis, Shia rebels from the country’s north, seized the nation’s capital and ousted the Saudi-backed ruler, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who lives in exile in Riyadh. In response, a Saudi-led Arab coalition began a bombing campaign in 2015, to restore the exiled government to power. While the US has not formally backed the Saudi coalition, it has provided targeted intelligence to the bombing campaign and has assisted with refueling coalition bombers. The United Nations has said the nearly three-year civil war has created one of the worst manmade humanitarian disasters, as millions of Yemenis have been displaced and the population faces famine with aid agencies struggling to supply assistance. As the humanitarian crisis deepens, lawmakers are increasingly questioning support for the Saudis, even as the Trump administration refuses to criticize the kingdom. The House voted overwhelmingly last year to adopt a resolution that declared the US military had not been authorized to assist Saudi Arabia in its war in Yemen. The resolution, however, did not stop America from providing support to Saudi Arabia in its war. Sanders and Lee are working to win support from colleagues as well as the Senate leadership, aides said, and the White House has been made aware of the forthcoming resolution. If the Senate passed the resolution, the chances of which are very unclear, it would go to the president’s desk. According to material provided by the Senate offices, the legislation would remove “US armed forces from hostilities between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis in Yemen pursuant to the War Powers Resolution”, a law passed in 1973 as a check on the president’s war-making powers. The War Powers Resolution, passed in reaction to US involvement in Vietnam, requires the commander-in-chief to consult Congress when sending US combat troops into an armed conflict. But it also enables the president to act unilaterally in the event of “a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces”, a provision successive administrations have expanded – well beyond its limits, critics argue – to confront new international threats. “Support for this intervention began under a Democratic president and has continued under a Republican president. This is not meant to be a specific critique of either president,” said an aide to Sanders. “It’s about the left and right coming together about very basic questions of Congress’s responsibility in terms of oversight when the United States chooses to make war.” For decades, members of Congress have wrangled with how to restore its war-making powers from a succession of assertive administrations. Under the US constitution, the president cannot declare war without the approval of Congress. But recent administrations, through the use of drone strikes and so-called special operators, have expanded the interpretation of when a commander-in-chief can send US troops abroad. Congress approved an Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) days after 9/11 to justify the war in Afghanistan. Since then, the executive branch has continued to use the 17-year-old authorization to justify new threats in the Middle East and around the globe, although a separate AUMF was passed for Iraq in 2002. Critics have argued that the powers of the post-9/11 AUMF have been stretched beyond their limits and have long demanded a serious debate over the authorization of US force, especially as it relates to the fight against the Islamic State. Aides to the senators said the debate over AUMF reauthorization, while important, is separate from the one they want to have over US involvement in the conflict in Yemen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/mar/02/nintendo-switch-and-vr-drive-uk-games-sales-to-record-5bn","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T12:08:32Z","webTitle":"UK games sales hit record £5bn thanks to Nintendo Switch and VR","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/02/nintendo-switch-and-vr-drive-uk-games-sales-to-record-5bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/mar/02/nintendo-switch-and-vr-drive-uk-games-sales-to-record-5bn","fields":{"headline":"UK games sales hit record £5bn thanks to Nintendo Switch and VR","bodyText":"The UK games market broke the £5bn sales mark for the first-time last year as Nintendo’s new hybrid Switch console boomed and virtual reality headsets flew off the shelves. Gaming fans forked out £5.11bn on consoles, games, hardware such as headsets and attending events – a 12.4% year-on-year rise – as the sector defied a wider downturn in consumer spending. Trade body Ukie said that there has been a “renaissance” in games consoles as Nintendo’s hybrid home console-meets-handheld device proved as popular in the UK as it has globally. Console sales, including the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, grew 30% to £659m, reversing a sales decline since 2014. “It is clear that the console gaming market is now enjoying a renaissance,” said Dorian Bloch, director, entertainment at GfK. “Nintendo’s Switch has enjoyed the best [sales] start for a Nintendo home console since the mighty Wii back in 2006.” The virtual reality craze continues to make its way into the mainstream with fans spending more than £100m on headsets for the first time, a 23.5% year-on-year rise. This went hand-in-hand with a surge in demand for greater graphics processing power to create VR experiences and worlds, sending PC game hardware sales soaring 51% to £376m. “Gamers are serious when it comes to acquiring state of the art equipment to fuel a premium gaming experience,” said Bloch. Games software remains the largest part of the market, with overall sales rising 8.3% to a new high of £3.56bn. The shift from traditional boxed games to digital continues to gather pace, as the games industry shows the same signs of the transition that has impacted other entertainment sectors such as music. Digital and online PC and console revenues rose 13.4% year-on-year to £1.6bn. The mobile market also rose significantly, up 7.8% to £1.07bn. However, UK gamers’ addiction to blockbuster titles such as Call of Duty helped sales of new boxed software buck the downward trend, rising 3.1% to £790m. “While the rise of free-to-play business models has broadened the gaming audience, players in the UK are especially willing to pay upfront for major titles like Call of Duty: WWII and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds,” said Carter Rogers, senior analyst at SuperData Research. Rogers said major console games and premium PC titles were the drivers of 42% of digital games revenue. This is greater than gamers in Europe (34%) or worldwide (14%). Sales of new physical and digital games helped drive down the second-hand market 15% to £101m. The report shows that gamers seek to take their passion beyond screen into the real world. They attended events in record numbers. Major expos such as EGX and Insomnia, as well as eSports fuelled a 13.4% rise in ticket sales to £8.4m. Spending on game-related toys and merchandising rose 6.8% to £72.9m. This has defied decline in the general toys market, which has recently claimed Toys R US. The Ukie said this was because there was “stronger game representation in cinema” in 2016, which included Angry Birds and Warcraft films, compared with last year which saw Michael Fassbender’s Assassin’s Creed and the latest Resident Evil released. “It’s been another year of growth for the games industry,” said Jo Twist, chief executive of Ukie. “New hardware such as the Switch have driven retail sales, VR hardware looks healthy and digital games across all platforms continue to grow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/28/ta-nehisi-coates-to-write-marvels-new-captain-america-comics","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T19:31:41Z","webTitle":"Ta-Nehisi Coates to write Marvel's new Captain America comics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/28/ta-nehisi-coates-to-write-marvels-new-captain-america-comics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/28/ta-nehisi-coates-to-write-marvels-new-captain-america-comics","fields":{"headline":"Ta-Nehisi Coates to write Marvel's new Captain America comics","bodyText":"Ta-Nehisi Coates will be taking over Marvel Comics’ Captain America, helming a new series of the comics set to drop on the Fourth of July. In an essay for the Atlantic, where Coates serves as a national correspondent, the author of Between the World and Me explained his decision to write Captain America, the Marvel hero first conceived by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby in 1941. “Two years ago I began taking up the childhood dream of writing comics,” Coates, 42, writes. “To say it is more difficult than it looks is to commit oneself to criminal understatement. Writers don’t write comics so much as they draw them with words. Everything has to be shown, a fact I knew going into the work, but could not truly know until I had actually done it. For two years I’ve lived in the world of Wakanda, writing the title Black Panther. I’ll continue working in that world. This summer, I’m entering a new one – the world of Captain America.” The MacCarthur fellow and 2015 National Book Award winner also wrote the latest Black Panther series, released in 2016, and co-wrote spinoffs such as Black Panther: World of Wakanda, Black Panther and the Crew, and Rise of the Black Panther. In the essay, Coates, who will continue his work on the Black Panther series, explained his gravitation toward the story of Captain America, a beacon of patriotism and symbol of the “American dream”. “Writing is about questions for me – not answers,” writes Coates, whose most recent book was a collection of essays on the Obama presidency called We Were Eight Years in Power. “And Captain America, the embodiment of a kind of Lincolnesque optimism, poses a direct question for me: Why would anyone believe in The Dream? What is exciting here is not some didactic act of putting my words in Captain America’s head, but attempting to put Captain America’s words in my head. What is exciting is the possibility of exploration, of avoiding the repetition of a voice I’ve tired of.” Teaming up with Coates will be Leinil Francis Yu, who’ll design the interior panels, and Alex Ross (Kingdom Come, Marvels), who will provide cover art. On Black Panther, Coates’s first venture into comic book writing, the author worked with artist Brian Stelfreeze, and the first issue sold 253,259 copies in its first month, making it the best-selling comic in the month of April 2016. The film Black Panther, released on 16 February, has been on a tear at the box office, having earned over $700m worldwide in less than two weeks. At a talk with the cast of Black Panther held at Harlem’s Apollo Theatre on Tuesday, Coates described the film as “Star Wars for black people”, calling the Ryan Coogler-directed hit “an incredible achievement”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/mar/01/dyson-hoovers-up-801m-profit-in-asian-spending-boom","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T00:01:56Z","webTitle":"Dyson hoovers up £801m profit in Asian spending boom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/01/dyson-hoovers-up-801m-profit-in-asian-spending-boom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/mar/01/dyson-hoovers-up-801m-profit-in-asian-spending-boom","fields":{"headline":"Dyson hoovers up £801m profit in Asian spending boom","bodyText":"Growing demand for battery-powered vacuum cleaners, hairdryers and air purifiers in flourishing Asian markets has helped Dyson, the British technology company, to a year of bumper profits. Sir James Dyson, the British inventor who revolutionised the vacuum cleaner, said the company he founded had benefited from “extraordinary enthusiasm for technology” in Asia to help boost annual sales by 40% last year to reach £3.5bn. Dyson’s profits for 2017 rose by almost a third since 2016 to reach £801m, with almost three-quarters of the company’s growth coming from Asia at a time of growing demand for technology and consumer products from the region’s burgeoning middle classes. Sales in continental Europe and the Americas both increased by about a fifth, in a year when the British company sold its 100 millionth machine and total manufacturing volumes increased to a record 80,000 units a day. A prominent supporter of Brexit before the referendum, Dyson said the UK was “having a tough time at the moment” but “I hope it will bounce back.” He blamed the retail sector’s slump on the fall in the value of the pound, which he said could happen as a result of currencies fluctuating on international exchanges. “It’s tough trading for retailers and people are switching to online sales,” he added. Despite the difficult conditions for many firms after the Brexit vote, the billionaire said he had not changed his view that leaving the EU would be best for the country – even as other business leaders grow increasingly concerned over the potential damage from the UK leaving the single market and customs union. He said Dyson already pays World Trade Organization tariffs – of key concern to business leaders should Britain crash out of the EU without reaching a deal with Brussels – because his company manufactures products in Singapore and then exports them around the world, including to Europe. “We pay the WTO treaty [tariffs] going into both Europe and Britain and yet we grew 21% in Europe last year,” he said. “Most of it goes straight to Brussels, and Brussels would be a lot worse off without a treaty with Britain.” Dyson announced late last year that he was developing an electric car at a former second world war airfield at Hullavington, close to his company’s headquarters in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. He said the firm was hiring 300 workers in the UK to work on the car, which is due to be ready for road testing in 2020, with the first deliveries coming a year later. Development of a driverless vehicle would be part of his company’s plans in the future, he said, but it was still too early for the widespread launch of autonomous vehicles. Asked whether he would mass-produce the car in the UK, he said: “We’re still having discussions, but we’ll have to make a decision fairly soon.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/feb/28/max-mosley-half-forgotten-far-right-past-catches-up-with-him","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T20:19:07Z","webTitle":"Max Mosley’s half-forgotten far-right past catches up with him","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/28/max-mosley-half-forgotten-far-right-past-catches-up-with-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/feb/28/max-mosley-half-forgotten-far-right-past-catches-up-with-him","fields":{"headline":"Max Mosley’s half-forgotten far-right past catches up with him","bodyText":"In the summer of 1962, Sir Oswald Mosley decided to make a return visit to the East End of London. At his side was his 22-year-old son, Max. Oswald must have known there would be trouble. When the notorious Blackshirts of his pre-war political party, the British Union of Fascists, attempted to march through the East End in 1936, there were pitched battles with Jewish residents. Scores of people were injured. This time he was back with his new far-right outfit, the Union Movement, and again threatening to march through an area, Dalston, which at that time had a large Jewish population. The chant of the marchers, according to Time magazine, was “Jews out”. In the violence that followed Oswald Mosley was knocked to the ground and his son was filmed lashing out. Max was among those arrested, but was acquitted in court after arguing that he had been attempting only to defend his father. Fast-forward 56 years, and Max Mosley’s half-forgotten past as a supporter of his father’s far-right movement, and allegations about his “racist and thuggish past”, have been paraded over 11 pages of the Daily Mail and led to a bruising interview on Channel 4 News. Infamously, the Mail also flirted briefly with support for fascism in the 1930s. But Mosley has found himself on the receiving end of the newspaper’s attentions not because he is his father’s son, nor because of anything he did or did not do during his long years as president of the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile, the governing body of Formula One motor racing. He is in the line of fire because he is a leading combatant in the battle over the future of press regulation after the Leveson inquiry. He may well have taken no interest in such matters, had the defunct News of the World not exposed his involvement in a sadomasochistic orgy in 2008. Mosley sued the newspaper for breach of privacy, and won. Since then he has financially supported victims of phone hacking, and a charity backed by a Mosley family trust is the principal backer of Impress, the controversial state-approved regulator of the press shunned by the Mail and every other national newspaper. Mosley and the Mail have been at daggers drawn for years, but the final straw appears to have been Mosley’s threat to use the Data Protection Act to sue news organisations that continue to refer to the orgy, even though it was at the heart of the court case that is itself central to the battle for the future of press regulation. Under the headline “Man with a genius for forgetting”, the Mail has now taken the battle to Mosley. The newspaper’s most damning discovery was a leaflet that the Union Movement produced during a byelection in Manchester Moss Side in 1961, when Max Mosley was the party’s local election agent. The leaflet suggested that “coloured immigrants” were spreading tuberculosis, venereal disease and leprosy, and threatening children’s health – and it also bore the words “published by Max Mosley”. Questioned by Channel 4, Mosley conceded that the leaflet “probably is racist”, but insisted he had no cause to apologise. Both the Mail and Channel 4 have asked Mosley whether he perjured himself when he sued the News of the World. During the case, he told the newspaper’s lawyers that he had no recollection of any such leaflet, adding: “If there was such a leaflet you would be able to produce it.” Mosley told Channel 4 that he “would not dream” of lying under oath. He also said: “You are entitled as you get older to change your view.” In his 2015 memoir, Mosley says his father’s politics “had been largely peripheral to my life” until 1959, when Oswald Mosley returned from self-imposed exile in France to stand in Kensington North at that year’s general election. The previous year this area had been the scene of the Notting Hill disturbances and Oswald Mosley appeared to believe the time was ripe to rebuild the British fascist movement. According to Oswald’s most recent biographer, Stephen Dorril, Max had set up a Union Movement office in the Notting Hill area. In one photograph taken at the time, Max can be seen with what appears to be a cut on one knuckle of his right hand and a plaster on his left. Max was disappointed that his father failed to win the seat. “He would have livened up the House of Commons,” he wrote in his memoir. “I can only describe my father as I saw him,” he added. “He was an excellent if rather distant parent who was always interesting, as well as interested, and I enjoyed his company. “My political instincts from an early age can crudely be described as liberal and slightly left. But in my youth I nevertheless agreed with my father’s ideas. If this appears contradictory it might perhaps seem less so to anyone who reads his books.” Max Mosley says he left the Union Movement in 1963, the year after the disturbances in Dalston. He says it was in part a response to the introduction of immigration controls. Dorril says the party had failed to make the breakthrough it had hoped for, and he appears to have become disillusioned. “It seems Max decided to go off and make some money,” he said. “He had party political ambitions but realised that he would be forever tainted with his father’s name. He was a motor racing enthusiast and felt safer in that sport where his name wasn’t a problem.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/28/red-alert-as-extreme-weather-claims-life-of-man-in-freezing-water","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T05:39:06Z","webTitle":"Heavy snow traps hundreds overnight on M80 in Scotland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/28/red-alert-as-extreme-weather-claims-life-of-man-in-freezing-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/28/red-alert-as-extreme-weather-claims-life-of-man-in-freezing-water","fields":{"headline":"Heavy snow traps hundreds overnight on M80 in Scotland","bodyText":"Hundreds of people stranded on a motorway in Scotland on Wednesday were stuck in their cars overnight as severe snow caused widespread disruption in the UK. Parts of the UK are on red alert as the snow continued to fall across much of the country, closing schools, delaying medical operations and causing widespread travel disruption. The red warning means extreme weather is expected, with the potential for risk to life. Fuel and water supplies were being delivered by emergency services to those stuck on the M80 near Glasgow, as rescue workers struggled to clear the tailbacks. The motorway, which was covered by the red weather warning, became gridlocked during the afternoon when it was hit by heavy snow. Forecasters said some communities could be cut off overnight on Wednesday as up to 40cm (15.7in) of snow was expected to fall by the morning. Roads in eastern England were among the worst hit, though the snowfall was forecast to worsen in Scotland later. A man believed to be in his 60s died in hospital after being pulled from the water at Danson Park in Welling, south-east London, police said. And firefighters rescued a young boy who tried to run to the middle of a frozen lake near Basildon, Essex, and got trapped on an island of ice when it broke up around him. Rail travellers were warned to avoid going to or from Scotland during the worsening conditions. In the west, no trains were running north of Carlisle, and in the east services were heavily disrupted, with no trains running north of Edinburgh. Glasgow airport cancelled all flights on Wednesday, while more than 100 planes were grounded at Heathrow. At least 98 more flights were cancelled at London City airport, as were flights from Leeds Bradford and Glasgow airports. NHS England said the cold weather – along with an outbreak of norovirus and high rates of flu – could leave the service facing the “most challenging circumstances for several years”. The National Emergency Pressures Panel, which met on Wednesday, said the NHS should prepare for continued pressure. The Met Office put in place a red warning of snow for central Scotland on Wednesday and Thursday. It is the first time a red alert for snow has been issued in Scotland, and only the second time anywhere in the UK. Much of the rest of the country was covered by the less severe amber and yellow warnings, with Wales, western England and the rest of Scotland likely to be badly hit. Wales and south-west England are forecast to expect blizzards on Thursday and Friday as Storm Emma, which on Wednesday night was over the Bay of Biscay, collides with the cold air already over the UK. Heavy rain from the storm is expected to turn to snow when it reaches the south coast and will combine with strong wind to produce the blizzards. “Heavy snow showers will become more widespread across the area … through the evening and overnight into Thursday,” the Met Office said. “Strong easterly winds will lead to significant drifting of lying snow.” Forecasters predicted blocked roads and further delays and cancellations on transport networks. They said some communities could be cut off for several days and that there would be long interruptions to power supplies. In the worst-hit places, 5cm of snow was forecast to fall within an hour and, where it lies, to reach 20-40cm. Rail services were not expected to start running again on the west coast mainline between Carlisle and Scotland before Thursday afternoon. Southbound trains that were running were significantly delayed. All Caledonian Sleeper services between London and Scotland due to depart on Wednesday night were cancelled and ScotRail reduced its services in the red warning area. Virgin Trains East Coast lifted its ticket restrictions for services on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, while dozens of Southeastern services – serving London, Kent and East Sussex – were unable to run because of problems in several locations. Delays and cancellations on the c2c line from south Essex into London Fenchurch Street station were worsened when freezing doors prevented some passengers getting on and off trains. Many roads across the country were closed or blocked after vehicles became stuck. The RAC said it had had its busiest day for 10 years on Tuesday, with 9,500 callouts, but believed this figure was likely to be topped on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/mar/01/lost-music-of-nazis-prisoners-to-be-heard-at-concert-in-jerusalem","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"Lost music of Nazis’ prisoners to be heard at concert in Jerusalem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/01/lost-music-of-nazis-prisoners-to-be-heard-at-concert-in-jerusalem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/mar/01/lost-music-of-nazis-prisoners-to-be-heard-at-concert-in-jerusalem","fields":{"headline":"Lost music of Nazis’ prisoners to be heard at concert in Jerusalem","bodyText":"A quest over nearly 30 years by an Italian musician to track down music composed by Nazi concentration camp victims will reach fruition in April with the first orchestral performance of many of the unearthed works. Francesco Lotoro, a music teacher, composer and pianist, tracked down thousands of songs, symphonies and even operas composed in Nazi concentration, forced labour and prisoner of war camps in Germany and elsewhere before and during the second world war. Lotoro’s search for the lost music involved scouring bookshops and archives as well as interviewing Holocaust survivors. He accumulated about 8,000 pieces of music including scores written on scraps of scavenged paper, toilet paper and newspaper, composed in allied as well as axis camps. Some of the music will be performed for the first time. It will be heard at a concert by Israel’s Ashdod symphony orchestra in Jerusalem among events marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel. Among the pieces to be performed for the first time in public is a song written by the Jewish musician, author and poet Ilse Weber, who worked as a nurse in the hospital at Theresienstadt concentration camp and taught some of her compositions to the children in the camp. When Weber’s husband, Willi, was deported to Auschwitz in 1944, she also voluntarily transferred with their young son, Tommy. The family were all gassed. While none of the songs that Weber wrote in the camp were ever written down, one was memorised by Aviva Bar-On, a child whom she had treated in Theresienstadt – and Bar-On will sing it for the first time since the war. Other pieces to be performed include Tatata by Willy Rosen and Max Ehrlich, who, before their deportation from Westerbork to Auschwitz, managed to smuggle a folder of their manuscripts out of the camp. Rosen was a German-Jewish composer, songwriter and noted cabaret performer, who was murdered in Auschwitz in September 1944. Ehrlich was a noted film actor, screenwriter and director who, like Rosen, was a prominent figure on the German cabaret scene in the 1930s. The folder containing their music was discovered decades later in an attic in the Netherlands, about to be thrown away. The aim for the concert in April is to emphasise the importance of music and composition as a form of self-expression, which continued despite the conditions of the wartime ghettos and camps – a phenomenon that has been noted by researchers at the Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance museum. Describing the project, Lotoro said: “The compositions from the concentration camps are a world heritage, a legacy to those artists who despite losing their freedom in the most unimaginable circumstances persevered through their music. Through the concert we are striving to both restore life and dignity to these artists.” He described how he had heard about Bar-On’s recollection of Weber’s music. “I heard there was a survivor from Theresienstadt who said she remembered a song by Weber. When I went to see her I discovered that she could remember not only one but three of Weber’s melodies, and scored them.” That was not the only example of a survivor recalling melodies over the decades. “Some of the melodies were never written down. They were conserved in a memory that is disappearing as survivors die. Every month or so I hear of a friend dying.” Michael Sinclair, of the Jewish National Fund UK, which is supporting the performance, said: “With global antisemitism on the rise the concert is a timely and powerful reminder of both the need to counter hatred and discrimination in all its forms, and the enduring defiance and hope of the Jewish people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/live/2018/mar/04/oscars-2018-live-winners-latest-updates-nominations-kimmel-red-carpet","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T06:45:19Z","webTitle":"Oscars 2018: The Shape of Water and Frances McDormand steal the night – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/live/2018/mar/04/oscars-2018-live-winners-latest-updates-nominations-kimmel-red-carpet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/live/2018/mar/04/oscars-2018-live-winners-latest-updates-nominations-kimmel-red-carpet","fields":{"headline":"Oscars 2018: The Shape of Water and Frances McDormand steal the night – as it happened","bodyText":"So there we go! It all seemed so staid this year given the fact that just 12 months ago we were still gasping over envelope-gate and the fact that a tiny-budgeted film about the life of a black gay man won the Oscar for best picture. But still, despite some seeing it as the “safe” option, The Shape of Water is hardly Oscarbait. It’s a film about a mute woman, an older gay man and a black woman working together to help save an aquatic creature in the 60s. Oh and it features an interspecies sex scene. Not exactly a Lasse Hallström joint huh? The acting categories were a lot more predictable but as many have already said, all four actors are great, just maybe not in those roles? The ceremony itself was mixed. There were less desperate attempts to go viral but Kimmel was nothing more then reliable. It was also, despite what they might want you to think, a poor year for female winners with just six women taking home Oscars. There’ll be more post-show analysis coming soon but for now, this is your lot. Happy Oscars! Here’s a news wrap of the evening from Rory Carroll, our man on the scene in Los Angeles: Take a look at one of the night’s best moments as Miguel et al sang best original song winner Remember Me Here are the best quotes and jokes of the night in case you want to re-enact any of the key moments. You might need to get changed first though. Well of course he’s good at whistling too ... Here are some backstage quotes from the big winners: “I am so proud to be a part of a time that’s the beginning of a movement, where I feel like the best films of every genre are being brought to me by black directors” – Jordan Peele “I have to be at a table read for Mom at 10am tomorrow, so I’m going back to work” – Allison Janney “I can’t say what it would be like to win an Oscar in any other year, but to win it for playing Winston makes it doubly special. It’s been an unforgettable experience” – Gary Oldman “I think every time we (Mexico) can demonstrate in any form, sports, science, art or culture, what we bring to the world discourse is extremely important. When we do it, it’s important to remember where we’re from, and honoring your roots and your country” – Guillermo del Toro There were a number of regrettable snubs in tonight’s In Memoriam section including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre director Tobe Hooper and Batman star Adam West: So the folks at the Hollywood Reporter did the math and The Shape of Water is the highest-grossing best picture winner for five years, despite having made less than $60m domestically. Here’s how the last few years stack up: 2018 - The Shape of Water: $57.4m 2017 - Moonlight: $22.1m 2016 - Spotlight: $45m 2015 - Birdman: $37.8m 2014 - 12 Years a Slave: $50.3m Not everyone was quite so taken with McDormand’s speech given the film she was winning her award for: Probably the speech that will be shared the most over the next 24 hours: So this is pretty big, yet buried, news. Tonight, Robert Lopez won an Oscar for co-writing best original song Remember Me from Coco which means he is now a double EGOT. An EGOT is someone who has won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. According to Entertainment Weekly, he is the first person to ever manage it twice. There are only 12 people who have managed it once. Guillermo del Toro is being interviewed by E! right now, before he heads to the afterparties. “It took so much effort not to think about this moment for weeks and months and then, in that moment, you go blank,” he says. Kimmel was solid but, given the fact that every major US awards show has been hosted by a white man in the past 12 months, next year, the Academy needs to shake it up. Twitter has decided who they should pick: Apparently Frances McDormand just found out about what an inclusion rider is last week, which means we’re all forgiven for not knowing what it meant: Here’s that video of stars talking about the importance of diversity and inclusion in the industry: Frances McDormand’s speech ended with the term “inclusion rider”, leading most people to quickly type the words “inclusion rider” into Google. Here’s an explainer: Remember all that talk of the Tiffany Haddish/Paul Thomas Anderson collaboration? Well he’s keen to work with her and they’ve been talking together about what it could be. Tonight, she revealed a tad more to Yahoo: “It could be several things, we’re trying to figure it out. Either it’ll take place in South Central LA back when it was poppin’ off of South Central Boulevard — I don’t know if you know, Central Boulevard was like Sunset back in the day, back in the 30s and 40s. Or maybe it’ll be like a wayback period piece that takes place in the 1600s. I bet you didn’t know black people was in England then, did you? We was!” For anyone like me who wondered who the activists were in the back of the Common/Andra Day performance, this will prove handy: Disney-owned ABC used the night to tease the first trailer for Mary Poppins Returns, and the full preview is now up online: This is pretty nuts: Here’s a look back at the evening and proof that we didn’t all collectively dream Helen Mirren riding a jet ski: Can you blame him? So despite the ceremony coming in a year filled with talk of equality in Hollywood, apparently there were the least amount of female winners for six years. Only six women took home awards compared to 33 men – and that’s including the two female acting winners. Not great is it? One of the better speeches of the night here, from Coco director Lee Unkrich, in case you missed it: Oh and there’s a new Meryl screaming meme to use, which is exciting news for anyone sick of that last Meryl screaming meme: Oh and finally there’s a gif of Mark Bridges living his best life: Here’s a lovely piece from November by Guy Lodge on best picture winner The Shape of Water, explaining why, despite its period setting, there’s something topical about its story: Oh so costume designer Mark Bridges won that jet ski! He was last seen riding it off stage with Helen Mirren at the end of the 11th hour of the ceremony Here’s that bit when celebrities fired hot dogs at civilians, by the way: Spare a thought for poor Lady Bird though. Greta Gerwig’s much-loved autobiographical comedy came away with precisely zero awards. Justice for Gerwig! Anyone else have a bit of PTSD watching Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty return to the stage to present best picture? The pair returned and everyone held their breath but, yes, it looks like The Shape of Water has actually won! Given that it had the most nominations tonight, it’s hardly a shock but Three Billboards had won so many precursors that it was still up in the air. Guillermo del Toro is back on stage and he’s talking about his influences and he wants to dedicate it to every young film-maker around the world. It’s a great speech, his second great speech of the night. The music cut off one of the producers which led to boos. Great way to end the evening! Oh wait! Okay so it looks like it was rider but yeah: After the Academy wisely decided not to have Casey Affleck up on stage, we instead have Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence presenting the penultimate award of the night. As with the other acting awards of the night, this one was a given. McDormand has managed a string of speeches about how much she seems to despise winning awards this season but this one was slightly different. She has asked for all of the female nominees in the audience to stand up together, which they did, and then wants to leave them all with two words: inclusion writer? Inclusion writer? Inclusion rider? Inclusion water? More soon. It’s rare to see a non-plummy British actor win an Oscar though. Here’s a whole thing on that: Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren are up to present best actor and Fonda compares the stage to something seen in Barbarella. This one was never really in question, and although it would have been nice to see newcomers Chalamet or Kaluuya or veteran Day-Lewis win (all of whom were far more deserving), Oldman is another performer tonight who has been deserving of recognition for so long. The controversy swirling around both an accusation of domestic violence from the 90s (which he denies) and a nutso Playboy interview where he expressed sympathy for Mel Gibson, hasn’t stopped him from claiming victory tonight. It’s an earnest speech and he appears genuinely choked up on stage. Will the best actress win be as predictable? I think so! You can do it too! Probably the strongest set of nominees in this category we’ve seen for a long time. Del Toro is a deserving winner for his gorgeous and grisly romance. “I am an immigrant,” he says, kicking off an emotive and eloquent speech. He’s arguing for a lack of division in the US and thanking those around him for his success. The big three are coming next and while Oldman and McDormand are locks for the acting prizes, we still have no clue who will win best picture ... In case you’re just joining us, the ceremony kicked off about five days ago and here’s a chance to see Kimmel’s okay-ish monologue: Sam Rockwell was asked about the criticisms of Three Billboards and race backstage: Now for the In Memoriam segment and Eddie Vedder is on stage singing Tom Petty’s Room at the Top of the World. Harry Dean Stanton, Jonathan Demme, Martin Landau, Roger Moore, Sam Shepard, Jeanne Moreau and Jerry Lewis are just some of the names mentioned. That tough old category I’ve been blathering on about all night finally has a winner and it’s the right choice! It might be the less cool option but for anyone who has seen the film, its hard to complain about this decision. Coco now has two Oscars if you’re counting. Slightly awkward moment as the music started playing the winners off just as a tribute was made to a dead parent. Nice! While Jonny Greenwood’s Phantom Thread score would have been the more unusual and interesting option, it’s hard to get mad at Alexandre Desplat. His score is an incredibly lovely element of an incredibly lovely film. It’s his second Oscar and the second award for Del Toro’s film tonight so far. This guy knew! Another live performance and this time, it’s the anthemic This is Me from The Greatest Showman. The film was once seen as a bit of a joke with negative buzz and middling reviews but it’s become a phenomenon, making $345m worldwide and the soundtrack becoming a number one hit. It’s a tearful turn from Keala Settle and she’s received a standing ovation, even from her begrudging competitor Mary J Blige. It’s Roger Deakins’ first Oscar! How has it taken this long? Arguably the most talented cinematographer in the industry, it’s fantastic to finally see him get the reward he so richly deserves. He’s been nominated 13 times before – first for The Shawshank Redemption, through Fargo, True Grit and Sicario – and lost every time. I’m surprised there hasn’t been a Poor Roger meme. That’s now two awards for Blade Runner 2049. It’s montage time! Again! The ceremony is for sure going to run over since we still have seven awards left but hey, here’s another collection of clips. It’s focused on films that pay tribute to the military from Saving Private Ryan to The Thin Red Line to Platoon to Zero Dark Thirty. Oh and here’s a look at that screening bit. It’s hardly the Ellen selfie but hey: Getting a bit foggy over who won what? No need. We got you: Wahey! As deserved as this is, it was far from a given. Peele’s satirical horror boasts one of the smartest scripts of the last 12 months but is still a genre film in many ways, something the Academy doesn’t always reward. “I stopped writing this movie about 20 times because I thought it was impossible,” he says. Could Get Out go on to win best picture? It’s seeming more likely. A record here, given that James Ivory is the only screenwriter to ever win an Oscar while wearing a shirt with the face of an actor in the film they have written. It’s also Ivory’s first Oscar after a handful of nominations, including for Remains of the Day. At 89, he’s the oldest winner ever of the award, which is the real record of course. Ashley Judd, Salma Hayek and Annabella Sciorra are on stage to talk about the women who have spoken out against predators in Hollywood. All of them accused Harvey Weinstein of misconduct. They are introducing a short piece about diversity, inclusion and inequality. Voices include Ava DuVernay, Greta Gerwig, Kumail Nunjiani, Barry Jenkins, Geena Davis and Mira Sorvino. It’s a rare montage that actually feels worthwhile tonight. This is a fair point Backstage Kobe Bryant is greeted with cheers and a few boos, then receives solely softball questions about his transition from athlete to writer, with no questions about the rape accusation, #MeToo or Time’s Up. “This sense of validation, it’s crazy man,” he smiled. “The hardest thing for athletes when starting over is you have to quiet the ego.. learn the basics of things. My advice to athletes is find something you want to do then everything else tends to make sense.” Underscoring the blurred lines in Hollywood’s sexual misconduct backlash, Bryant lauded two figureheads of the female empowerment – Oprah Winfrey and Shonda Rhimes – as mentors. “When you have mentors like that in your life.. everything tends to work itself out.” Bryant gets a high-five as he walks out to applause and grimaces from some journalists who didn’t get to ask questions. Another musical performance now from the film Marshall, starring Chadwick Boseman as the first African American supreme court judge, Thurgood Marshall. Common and Andra Day are performing and they are joined by a group of important activists on stage. It’s a cracking, politically charged duet – although without enough explanation, it’s difficult to understand exactly who is standing behind them and what they are standing for. This is a tough category to call. A film about a deaf child has been named the winner and the speech is also being signed which is refreshing to see on the Oscars stage. Also, one of the winners is an actor from Hollyoaks! Plus Oscar winner Marlee Matlin has already shared her enthused reaction to the news: Tiffany Haddish is presenting with Maya Rudolph which is a rare funny duo and they are joking about how they are treated by white people. The Oscars needs to do what the Globes does so much: get comedians to present. Simple. A moving account of an artist struggling with depression and anxiety has been named the winner here. You can watch the entire thing right here. Only four hours left! And here we are with the slightly patronizing spectacle of well-dressed well-paid actors going in to surprise “the little people” who are busy enjoying their movie. There are screams of surprise as Gal Gadot arrives with a basket full of snacks. It’s an odd sight. Especially now that Meryl Streep is waving back to them via the big screen. Kimmel is ridiculing the smell of the cinema because ya know, real people stink, right? Ansel Elgort is now firing hot dogs into the audience. There is so much screaming that nothing discernible can be heard. Is this happening or am I just really tired? Want to relive tonight’s red carpet? Can you believe it took place only 18 hours ago? I mean ... So just as I was about to say that tonight has been refreshingly short of attempts at viral moments, well here we are. Kimmel wants to thank the people who buy tickets to go see movies and so he’s taking a group of actors over the road to the cinema to thank them. Stars include Emily Blunt, Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer and Margot Robbie. The “hilarious” results coming after the break. Another tech win here for Christopher Nolan’s second world war epic. “This is the most awesome thing that can happen to me,” says winner Lee Smith at the start of a charming speech. Another speech where the music started to creep in at the end. How long will it overrun tonight? Who will win that jet-ski? For those peeved at both the box office and the lack of bigger nominations for the ambitious fan-favorite sequel, here’s something of a reward. Plus it’s the first speech cut short by music tonight. There are still 12 awards. How is that possible? The reaction to Kobe Bryant winning an Oscar is, well, not great: Another musical performance and another reminder of what a strong year it is for the original song category. Sufjan Stevens is on stage to perform Mystery of Love from Call Me by Your Name. A sweet, melancholic interlude. Groans and angry murmurs in the press room as Kobe Bryant, who was accused of rape, collects his award. The scorn briefly eclipses the Q&amp;A from The Shape of Water team, which lauds Guillermo del Toro’s aesthetic vision. Absolutely no one is surprised by this one, given what a weak year it was for animation and also given the fact that Coco is Pixar’s best film for years. There’s a nice speech about inclusion and diversity and it’s refreshing to see two of the winners pay tribute to their same-sex partners. Director Lee Unkrich also paid tribute to the people of Mexico. “With Coco we tried to take a step forward,” he said. “Representation matters.” Kobe Bryant’s animation about basketball has been named the winner, a slight surprise given the negative publicity that surrounded the nomination. Bryant was accused of sexual assault in 2003. The case was dropped when his accuser refused to testify and was settled out of court. Interesting choice this year. Here’s more on the story. The sentiment on Twitter is similarly pleased for Janney but less pleased for I, Tonya Ah, not a surprise here given how many awards she has already won for her role as Tonya Harding’s abusive mother, but it’s a tad disappointing given how excellent Laurie Metcalf and Lesley Manville were in their nominated performances. Still, like Rockwell, Janney is a performer who has been working for so long and her career before this performance was worthy of recognition. “I did it all by myself,” she jokes as she gets on stage. It’s a heartfelt speech but, man, Metcalf was robbed. This was a tightly contested category but the Chilean drama A Fantastic Woman was the deserving winner and it’s unusual for a film with a trans actor in the lead to gain any form of Oscar recognition. Director Sebastián Lelio gave a short speech thanking those around him and it’s yet another highpoint on a resume that already has quite a few. Big one next... Okay so this short speech joke is turning into a long-running thing. As predicted costume design winner Mark Bridges is currently in the lead. Now the shortest speech giver will also win a trip to Lake Havasu! You go Mark Bridges! You should all be aware that Lakeith Stanfield is live-tweeting the Oscars The second nominee for best original song and, as someone who ugly cried through the final 15 minutes, a personal favorite. Gael Garcia Bernal, Miguel and Natalia LaFourcade are performing Remember Me from Coco, a film that’s set to pick up best animated feature later tonight. Miguel is one heck of a live singer and the staging is a wonderful reminder of what a charming film it is. One of the best Oscars musical performances in recent memory. Lupita Nyong’o and Kumail Nunjiani are presenting and they are talking about the fact that their names are hard to pronounce and that they are both immigrants. They’re talking about standing with the dreamers out there and how they stand with them. It’s interesting to see a political bit written into the script as usually these are improvised. Aaaaaand phew, The Shape of Water isn’t going to go home empty-handed tonight as the most-nominated film sometimes does. Given how ravishing the film looked, this feels like a smart choice although I think Blade Runner stans will disagree ... Applause emoji And another! Damn they really liked that sound. There’s a theory that Dunkirk could win best picture due to it being the second or third favourite for many voters. This year, who the hell knows. Richard King and Alex Gibson winning the Oscars here for their impressive technical achievement, working yet again with Christopher Nolan. It feels like Dunkirk’s best chances tonight will be in the tech categories and if nothing else, it’s a technically impressive drama. It might also continue to steal a number of these awards from The Shape of Water. First snafu of the night, but a mini one no one will care about. Backstage the media receive a transcript of the best supporting actor’s press conference comments while Sam Rockwell is still talking, and the transcript turns out to be of Casey Affleck from last year. Rockwell says he had several months to prepare for the role. “I did some ridealongs with some cops. I met with a skin graft doctor who introduced me to some burn victims. I had two or three months so got to indulge in all this research.” The night already feels a bit too montage heavy for me, especially given that the montages are all really dreadfully long. GIVE THE WINNERS THAT TIME INSTEAD. But yeah we’re already on our 67th (?) of the night running through a seemingly random selection of films from Moonlight to Forrest Gump to It to Precious toWest Side Story to Inception. It’s self-indulgent and long and please Academy, do less. It’s like film has died and they are paying tribute to the whole medium. I’m also totally okay with this The first of the original song performances tonight and it’s this year’s double nominee Mary J Blige singing her track from Mudbound. She’s also up for best supporting actress and is the first person to ever be up for both awards in the same year. It’s a grand performance, accompanied with a choir and imagery from the film. Miguel singing his Coco song up soon. Presented by Greta Gerwig and Laura Dern, who should be mother and daughter in an upcoming film from Noah Baumbach already, many thought this would go to Agnès Varda’s Faces Places – but instead it’s gone to the superb Netflix documentary Icarus, about doping in Russia. It’s a timely, fascinating film and a deserving winner. It’s dedicated to the whistleblower who is still in hiding after taking part in the film. Given the film’s understandably negative view of corruption in Russia, it might not be a favorite with our Putin-loving president. Kimmel has made his second joke about Black Panther’s phenomenal box office which makes sense since the show is on ABC owned by Disney who own Marvel who made Black Panther. Funny and true and also smug! This is essentially true: A much-deserved win here for three-time nominee Mark Bridges who designed the incredible dresses in Paul Thomas Anderson’s pitch-black romantic comedy. It’s also a very short speech which suggests that Mr Bridges wants himself that jet-ski. Could Phantom Thread go on to win more tonight? It’s unlikely to get the big ones, but Jonny Greenwood is in with a shot for his score so we’ll see. Remember this time last year when Suicide Squad won and then became Oscar-winning film Suicide Squad? Nothing quite as upsetting this year, as Darkest Hour deservedly wins for the incredible prosthetic work required to turn Gary Oldman into Winston Churchill. Back to the short speech thing! Man, they are really serious with this. If your speech goes on too long this year, Lakeith Stanfield will jump out screaming “Get out!” which was followed by actual Lakeith Stanfield dressed in his costume from the film. Not a bad joke! We interviewed Rockwell back in October and so yeah he should have thanked us but hey. You can check it out here: So it’s the first award of the night and it looks like each major category is getting a montage of previous winners which feels like it’s going to add more time to an overlong ceremony but sure, okay! No big surprise here since Rockwell had won every precursor up until tonight. Most critics wanted to see Dafoe win but there’s something deserving about the work Rockwell has done in the industry, even if this might not be his finest role. “Run that clock Jimmy, I want to get that ski jet or whatever that was,” he jokes. He has a pre-written story about his youth and his love of movies which gets major laughs. He also thanks everyone who has ever looked at a billboard. It’s a charming speech, his best on the awards circuit so far. Could this be the first of many awards tonight for Three Billboards? I think so. Kimmel is asking winners to keep their speeches short and whoever gives the shortest speech will, ermmm, win a jet-ski! It’s not a joke, he has a stopwatch! Red carpet over, we can finally stop cringing through Ryan Seacrest getting snubbed by everyone apart from Christopher Plummer. It’s kicking off quite shoddily with a vintage-y look at the night’s big stars with Jimmy Kimmel putting on a silly voice. It’s at least better than last year because it features 100% less of Justin Timberlake singing that song from Trolls. Kimmel’s a slick host though and he’s immediately launched into the envelope drama from last year. He’s telling his story “for the first time” and ensuring us that it will not happen again. “Oscar is 90 years old this year which means he’s probably at home watching Fox News,” he jokes before praising the statuette’s lack of penis. He’s gone on to talk about Harvey Weinstein being expelled from the Academy (applause) and is now talking about the importance of setting an example about how Hollywood needs to crack down on sexual harassment. Kimmel has also confirmed that advocates from various causes will speak throughout the night which should make for an interesting ceremony and will piss off the right which is always fun to watch. The emphasis is definitely on the Academy as a cause for change, talking about this year’s diverse set of nominees. Mark Wahlberg just got some applause for donating the money he demanded for the All the Money in the World reshoots. Yay? He’s doing the standard picking out random nominees and making jokes about them but he’s doing it with finesse. “We don’t make films like Call Me by Your Name to make money, we do films like Call Me by Your Name to piss off Mike Pence,” was one of his better lines. And that’s it from the Guardian fashion team. So what did we learn? A whiteout could have been the new blackout. Gold is what to wear if you haven’t been nominated. Wear your cause on your pin, be it Black Lives Matter or Time’s Up. But when it came to a potential Time’s Up dress code, the party line was there was no party line. The conversation, it seems, has moved off-carpet and into the ether. Or, tonight, more likely the podium. With the Queen wearing duck egg blue front row at London Fashion Week, it’s a colour on its way up. Emily Blunt, who has of course played royals in the past, is lending her support to it with this tulle number. A light-as-a-feather macaroon of a dress. Will JLaw fall over again tonight? Probably: Who’s your money on? If you want to place some last minute bets with those around you then here’s a final set of predictions from our expert Peter Bradshaw: Anyone with half an eye on Viola Davis’s red carpet game will know she likes to wear head-to-toe colour. For the Oscars, she gave her support to the pink dress camp. This fuchsia dress brightens things up from the ballet slipper territory. We’re into it. Bow’d and bejewelled, it’s Nicole Kidman in an architectual feat of a dress: a royal blue strapless gown with a giant bow and central slit. It looks like this year’s theme is expensive Meryl Streep is well known for saying she “couldn’t care less” about fashion, so pity the presenter that asked where her dress is from. Still, it’s a triumphant look for the actor, who is nominated for The Post, with a classic Streep neckline, finely belted and, notably, no Time’s Up pin. More than ever before, this year has seen some pretty intense backlashes to the nominated films. It’s an obvious escalation, given the outrage culture we’re all screaming our way through, and it’s often entirely, and refreshingly valid. But will it affect who voters actually pick? Do they care about resurfaced allegations of domestic violence against Gary Oldman? Do they believe the claims of plagiarism being leveled at The Shape of Water? Do they agree that Martin McDonagh’s take on race in America is tone-deaf in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri? My guess = probably not. The second actress to wear gold, possibly nodding to the actual Oscar statuette, Lupita Nyong’o’s dress is as glitzy as they come. The sash adds a tough detail that tells everyone Nyong’o, like her character in Black Panther, is anything but a pushover. Presenter and Wonder Woman actor Gal Gadot is also banging the drum for statuette chic in a metallic tasselled hem dress, which judging by the pictures, she appears to be swishing all the time. Look at that movement. The Academy isn’t always swayed by box office but there’s something to be said about voters gravitating towards the buzzier, more seen films. Taking a look at this year’s crop, here’s how they stand in terms of global gross. Could Get Out’s phenomenal conversion of $5m budget to $255m gross help push it to the top? 9. Call Me by Your Name – $29m 8. Phantom Thread – $33m 7. Lady Bird – $53m 6. The Shape of Water – $113m 5. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Misouri – $123m 4. Darkest Hour – $136m 3. The Post – $146m 2. Get Out – $255m 1. Dunkirk – $525m Playing mother and daughter in Lady Bird, Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf arrived together and effectively gave two thumbs up to the pink dress trend. Ronan’s sugarpink dress with big bow has a mid-century fun feel to it, while Metcalf’s column dress is sleek and chic. Matchy-matchy dressing taken to the next level. Last night, there was a special Oscars skit during Saturday Night Live, taking aim at the many men being accused of sexual harassment this year. You can take a look here at who won a “grabby” Here’s Emma Stone and the First Pair Of Trousers of the red carpet – black, naturally – and worn with a red burgundy jacket and pink sash. The clashing colours were a flip to last year’s gold gown. Which makes you wonder if she and Jennifer Lawrence shared notes. The list of stars presenting awards tonight is both impressive and impresssively diverse. We’ll be seeing Margot Robbie, Tiffany Haddish, Chadwick Boseman, Emily Blunt, Jodie Foster, Zendaya, Kumail Nunjiani, Helen Mirren, Dave Chappelle, Lupita Nyong’o, Taraji P Henson and many others. But will there be any viral hosting skits? The Oscars is usually light on these (the Globes is usually the home for these) but they have invited three key Weinstein accusers to present (Salma Hayek, Ashley Judd and Annabella Sciorra) which suggests an emotive tribute to the women who have spoken up. “Something that weights a ton of bricks” and “smoke and mirrors” was Sally Hawkins’s spirited if telling response to what she is wearing on the red carpet. What we do know about the 1940s shouldered dress, which pooled into black beads on the carpet, is that it is in keeping with the whiteout trend. As to the Oscars’ post-Times’ Up? “Still battling with equal pay,” she said, before walking away. Tonight’s most nominated film The Shape of Water has been nabbing headlines in recent weeks for all of the wrong reasons. Guillermo del Toro’s woozily romantic fantasy has been likened to a play from Paul Zindel and his family have taken legal action for perceived plagiarism. Will this affect its chances? You can read more here: In recognition, perhaps, of the Oscar’s statuette, Jennifer Lawrence has come in gold rippled Christian Dior and matching rippled hair. Lawrence’s red carpet hair routinely launches a thousand trends so it’s worth noting. Following a recent photo call and a Versace dress, Lawrence shut down critics who accused her of not advocating feminism as “loud”. Much like her glorious dress. In 1962 Puerto Rican actor Rita Moreno was awarded best supporting actress for her role as Anita in West Side Story. Here’s Rita Moreno in that dress, back in 1962, and 2018. Compare and contrast. It’s a good detail to note that after 56 years, she chose to go strapless and pair the dress with glasses and Cleopatra-style necklace. “This has been hanging in my closet all this time, not even in a bag,” she said. “What is amazing is this gold thread didn’t tarnish. I’m 86 now, it’s 56, there are big changes, good changes, I’m thrilled to be here.” She’s an example to us all. For the Independent Spirit awards, Timothée Chalamet wore a white shirt with name tag that looked like it came from a thrift store. He’s smartened up for the Oscars but kept the slightly esoteric point of view, with the short trousers and pointy boots. More please. Zoë Brock, a model and writer who accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, said she wished the Academy Awards would do more to honor the women who have spoken up about the disgraced producer. “Put us on a stage. Let us wear black! Look us in the eyes and tell us you’re proud of us,” Brock wrote to the Guardian in an email. Brock, who accused Weinstein of making an unwanted sexual advance when she was 23 years old, is part of a class-action lawsuit against the producer and has organized activist efforts with other accusers. Several high-profile Weinstein accusers are expected to present an award at the ceremony, but Brock said she wished the Academy would do more to recognize the movement that grew out of the Weinstein scandal. Two of the most high-profile accusers, Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino, promoted the Time’s Up movement on the red carpet and spoke about Weinstein. “People got rich because of Weinstein. And they won a lot of Academy awards. The Oscars is the ONLY stage I personally want to hear a freaking apology from, and a cut and dry promise that Harvey will never, ever be in that room again,” Brock wrote in her email. “We are standing up to these powerful people no matter how scared we are because we have to. It is the right thing to do.” She added: “The only reason this issue hasn’t faded already is because we are collectively yelling so loudly. America and the news cycle is back to talking about Trump and the latest school shooting. Hollywood wants to get back to business and so does the public – but we can’t let it.” Helen Mirren is going to have more fun tonight than any of us Greta Gerwig is nominated for best director for Lady Bird...... Yellow is on the cusp of being a trend – worn by Baby Driver’s Eiza Gonzalez and now Greta Gerwig. The floor-length, mustard-coloured sequin almost has the feel of a slipdress, and as such could almost fit into the wardrobe of Lady Bird. In a lengthy interview, Gerwig recently told the Guardian that ahead of the Oscars, she was already doing just fine. Taraji P Henson has won the Oscar for best way of taking down Ryan Seacrest on live television OK, two themes emerging here on the red carpet: white gowns and the micro handbag carried louchely, at calf height. As yet, there is no confirmation of a whiteout memo having gone round before the ceremony, but it’s certainly happening. Oh Margot Robbie’s gown is Chanel. Black Panther’s Chadwick Boseman arrived on the red carpet with the cross-armed salute and shout-out to “Wakanda forever”. Add to that his silver-lapelled suit and Twitter is bowing down. Never knowingly seen without a pair of sunglasses, even indoors, Whoopi Goldberg has triumphed in the colour stakes, here in a full-skirted yellow and purple print gown and what appears to be a red ribbon to raise awareness for people living with HIV. Tenner she keeps her specs on throughout the ceremony. It feels like Taraji P Henson wears black because she likes the drama of the colour, rather than for any overtly political reasons. She makes a statement all of her own in this sheer-panelled Vera Wang dress which is just asking for a proper pose. So it looks like all the major stars did choose to shun Ryan Seacrest, as many had predicted. The host has been accused of sexual harassment, something he denies, and despite this, E! still chose to place him on the red carpet tonight. As a result, his interviewees were mostly male (Mary J Blige and Allison Janney were the rare exceptions) and instead, ABC has nabbed all of the major pre-ceremony exclusives. And yeah this was interesting ... Save James Ivory, the menswear has been a bit one-note, so it’s cheering to see Daniel Kaluuya in a tobacco and black leather lapelled tux jacket, paired with some patent brogues, a colour pairing which is redolent of Michael Strahan’s 2015 look. Except way, way better. Here’s what the British star of Get Out had to say to the Guardian (including what his mother thinks of his US accent) in a big recent interview. As the first person ever to be nominated for an acting award and for an original song, Mary J Blige is already a star of the Oscars 2018. Her white dress with asymmetric bodice is an exercise in alpha glamour, while the teeny-tiny bag is a touching addition that proves even Blige needs somewhere to put her phone and lipstick. She’ll need those later when she heads to the afterparty in her honour to be staged by Jay-Z and Beyoncé. Winning. Could tonight see any records broken? Taking a look at the nominations, the following winners would prove to be notable hall-of-famers: At 88, Christopher Plummer would be the oldest acting winner ever, beating the record he already has after winning for Beginners in 2012. Mudbound’s Rachel Morrison is already the first female nominee in the category of best cinematography so if she wins, she will, you’ve guessed it, be the first female winner. If Jordan Peele manages to beat favourite Guillermo del Toro for best director, he’ll be the first black winner in this category. At 22, Call Me by Your Name’s Timothée Chalamet would be the youngest best actor winner, beating out Adrien Brody who won when he was 29 for The Pianist. The most likely of all tonight’s record-breakers is Agnès Varda, who at 89 is already the oldest nominee ever so if her acclaimed film Faces Places wins best documentary (and it really could) then she’d, yep, be the oldest winner too. In black velvet and a giant, custom-made Black Lives Matters badge on her strap, here is Patrisse Khan-Cullors, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter, and one of the most prominent activists of the movement. The best song category is unusually competitive this year and also, even more unusually, it actually contains some songs worth listening to. Here’s a look at who might come out on top: St Vincent wins for bringing the most theatricality to the red carpet. While not quite at the peerless level of Björk in the swan dress in 2001, this is the most experimental look we have seen so far, and it is therefore to be applauded. The resemblance to the emoji dancing girls should also be noted. Elisabeth Moss is here, wearing an off-shoulder, crystal-embedded pink gown with a soft Hollywood wave and, of course, a Time’s Up pin on her belt. It seems the Oscar’s red carpet is becoming something of a “whiteout” – in comparison to the Golden Globes’ blackout protest. Laura Dern has arrived, in a white slit-shouldered asymmetric gown. More white, then – we smell a trend, although Dern is noticeably not wearing a Time’s Up pin. Given she is one of the campaign’s original cadre, that she has avoided the black-and-Time’s-Up-pin combo of red carpets late, this looks set to be the direction the nascent organisation is hoping to take. Salma Hayek is obviously on the Pantone intel – purple is the colour of 2018. Her custom-made Gucci dress goes way beyond fashionable colours, with sparkle, tiers of fabric and a cage of diamonds. Its merits are already being debated on Twitter, which means meme status is only a click away. Jane Fonda is here to present the award for best actress with Jennifer Lawrence, both actors drafted in to replace Casey Affleck. Naturally Fonda is wearing a Time’s Up pin on her hourglass-shaped white gown by 44 Francois Premier, the couture arm of Balmain’s Olivier Rousteing. Given the circumstances, it will be interesting to see if Fonda talks to Ryan Seacrest... The Duchess of Cambridge is known for repeat wearing clothes but Rita Moreno, presenting an award here, showed us how it’s really done. She is wearing a dress that she originally wore to the Oscars in 1962 when she won best supporting actress for West Side Story, made from Japanese Obi fabric. No wonder she looks so triumphant. Last night was the Film Independent Spirit awards and Get Out came out on top scooping up best feature, beating out Three Billboards and Call Me by Your Name. Jordan Peele also won best director while Frances McDormand and Timothée Chalamet picked up lead acting awards. Sidebar: the best picture winner at the Spirits has been the same as the Oscars for the last four years. You can read all about it here: Rachel Morrison is the first woman nominated in the cinematographer category, for her work on Mudbound. She is also one of the few women to wear black. James Ivory, screenwriter and co-producer of the drama Call Me by Your Name is, at 89, the oldest male Oscar nominee. More to the point though – the shirt. A custom-made monochrome homage to the film’s heartbreaking final scene: Timothée Chalamet’s character, Elio, weeping into the open fire over the dulcet tones of Sufjan Stevens. Special mention, too, to the hand-painted shoes from the Van Gogh Museum. The National Hispanic Media Coalition has staged a protest of the Oscars to draw attention to the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood. “We have underrepresentation that is so severe that we cannot continue to let it go year after year,” Alex Nogales, president of the coalition, told the Guardian before the weekend’s protests. “This is a situation that has been intolerable for years.” Although Latinos comprise 18% of the US population and 23% of moviegoers, only 3% of speaking characters in 2016’s top 100 films were Latinos, according to a University of Southern California study. Disney’s nominated film Coco, which tells the story of a Mexican boy stuck in the Land of the Dead, had a Latino cast, and Oscar Isaac, who was born in Guatemala, starred in the latest Star Wars trilogy. Guillermo del Toro’s film The Shape of Water is also leading the Oscar’s race with 13 nominations. But no Latinos were nominated for acting Oscars this year. Advocates plan to escalate the campaigns and pressure film executives to meet with the organizations pushing for better Latino representation, Nogales said. “If leadership of the studios don’t come and say let’s talk, we’ll call them out by name and see how they like to be called racists and bigots.” Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd, both women who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein’s behaviour, arrived together on the red carpet, as a very glamorous united front. They might not be wearing the black of the Golden Globes but their presence is a protest in and of itself. Here is Andy Serkis with his wife, the actor Lorraine Ashbourne. Serkis is repping for his role as Caesar in War for the Planet of the Apes which is up for best visual effects, although he is currently playing a human being in Black Panther, albeit a terrible one who has stolen Wakandan mining technology. Both parties are, poignantly, in black. This is the third time Christopher Plummer has been nominated for an Oscar since 2010, this year for playing J Paul Getty in All the Money in the World. Plummer of course replaced Kevin Spacey following sexual harassment and assault allegations against Spacey in November. Quite the turnaround. Plummer wasn’t thrilled about being named “the oldest actor to be nominated for an Oscar”. Still, if he wins, he’ll probably forget about the ageism. Appearing on the cover of supremely stylish Gentlewoman this month means that Allison Janney now has serious fashion cred. While her Reem Acra red gown is a pretty safe choice for her first time at the Oscars, she has already won best sleeves. Trailing on the ground, they only up her fashion cred and almost overshadow her decision to talk to Ryan Seacrest. The Academy in 2017: we will do everything in our power to ensure that no one reads out the wrong best picture winner ever again The Academy in 2018: okay, hear us out though Singer Miguel wore a black tux, with a coat shoulder-robed, with his girlfriend, model Nazanin Mandi. He is up for best song for Remember Me in Pixar’s Coco, and had a chat to the controversial E host Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet, who other celebrities are said to be boycotting after he has been accused of sexual harassment. Miguel, who has also been accused of – and denies – questionable behaviour, signed off his interview with the line “always a pleasure”. Patrick Stewart is here showing his true colours, or lack thereof, in a classic black tux with the usual red carpet accoutrements. Is he making a protest? The Time’s Up pin would suggest yes... What can we learn from the top nine’s splashy “for your consideration” campaigns? According to Stuart Heritage, Get Out has it in the bag while any attempts by the team behind Call Me by Your Name might prove fruitless: Beanie Feldstein, who plays Julie in Lady Bird, is one of the first stars we’ve seen wearing the Time’s Up pin seen at the Golden Globes. Her black and white gown is also a subtle show of support for the black dress code without going all the way. A careful, clever choice for an Oscars newbie. Fresh from the ice in PyeongChang, figure skater Adam Rippon has arrived in a custom-made cropped black Jeremy Scott tuxedo jacket with shoulder cut-outs, and curious black leather studded criss-cross chest harness. Is Armie Hammer going to be well enough to attend tonight? Last night things didn’t look too, well, peachy after the Call Me By Your Name actor skipped the Independent Spirit awards due to illness, and he posted this rather dramatic Oscars prep pic yesterday ... Pink dresses have a history at the Oscars - think Gwyneth Paltrow’s emotional speech in 1999. Allison Williams, who stars in nominated Get Out continues that tradition. Her embroidered gown and waved hair is a millennial’s take on old Hollywood glamour. Welcome to the Oscars red carpet, the grande dame of all carpets, and of course award season’s finale. In an unexpected twist, the Time’s Up movement have announced there will be no formal dress code, although attendees are being encouraged to wear Time’s Up pins and orange American flag pins in support of Everytown For Gun Safety, a non-profit against gun violence. Making the point is Disney star Sofia Carson, in red Giambattista Valli. An early look at the stage here thanks to Nicole Kidman. It looks, ermmm, Oscar-y? As with other post-Weinstein ceremonies, there will be a strong #MeToo theme running through tonight, from the speeches down to rumors of a special segment in the ceremony. It’s also likely to affect the red carpet but in a way that could prove a major problem. E!’s coverage is co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest as per usual but the host has recently been accused of sexual harassment by a former stylist (he denies them) and reports suggest that stars might avoid speaking to him on their way inside the Dolby Theatre. Jennifer Lawrence spoke about the issue earlier this week: “I am not a judge. I am not a jury, you know. I don’t know … That is where this stuff gets tricky. I can’t imagine him being sexual.” Latest reports suggest that there will be a slight delay between what happens on the red carpet and what E! shows on TV. You can read more about the allegations here: After another awards season filled with wins, losses, politics, dresses and, you know, films, we’re reaching the dramatic conclusion with this year’s Academy Awards. While most of the early indicators have implied that it would take another envelope switcheroo for an upset in the four acting categories (can anything stop Oldman, McDormand, Janney and Rockwell?), the best picture race is far from wrapped up. Guillermo del Toro’s stylish romance The Shape of Water is out in front with 13 nominatons and is predicted to win a good chunk of them but quite often the most lauded film going in doesn’t always come out on top (La La Land, The Revenant, Gravity, Lincoln and Hugo all went in with the most yet all failed to win the big prize). Could divisive drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri continue its winning streak? Could Get Out be the first horror film to win since The Silence of the Lambs? Could Dunkirk prove the safe choice for voters? We’ll find out in a few hours. It’s also set to be another politically charged ceremony with rumours of gun control badges being won on the red carpet and a #TimesUp moment in the telecast. We’ll be here until late with our fashion experts taking over very soon. Get some snacks. Happy 90th Oscars!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/28/teenage-refugees-high-court-challenge-could-give-hope-to-thousands","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T18:36:51Z","webTitle":"Afghan boy launches UK legal challenge against refugee policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/28/teenage-refugees-high-court-challenge-could-give-hope-to-thousands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/28/teenage-refugees-high-court-challenge-could-give-hope-to-thousands","fields":{"headline":"Afghan boy launches UK legal challenge against refugee policy","bodyText":"A 16-year-old Afghan boy is challenging the government’s refusal to allow him to seek sanctuary in the UK in a case that could give hope to thousands of other child asylum seekers across Europe. The boy, known as ZS, was living in the Calais refugee camp when the French authorities cleared it in October 2016 and he applied unsuccessfully to be brought to the UK under section 67 of the immigration act, known as the Dubs amendment. It is the first time an lone child asylum seeker has issued a challenge of this kind against the home secretary. The boy, who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and attempted suicide three times, has been trying to reach the UK since he fled Afghanistan three years ago. His father assisted western interests and as a result he was abducted and his son was shot. The boy is arguing in the high court challenge that guidance about children in Calais issued by the home secretary applied unlawful criteria, and that unfair procedures were adopted when the Home Office was deciding which children could come to the UK. If the case succeeds it could have implications for thousands of other child asylum seekers hoping to reach the UK under the Dubs amendment. The Home Office is arguing that it acted lawfully and difficult decisions had to be made about which children to accept. Nine teams, each consisting of 10-12 Home Office staff, interviewed 1,872 children in 73 different areas of France after the Calais camp was closed. Representing the boy, Sonali Naik QC said: “What we are concerned with is the lawfulness of the secretary of state’s implementation of section 67 [of the immigration act].” The boy’s solicitor, Krisha Prathepan, of Duncan Lewis, said: “ZS remains deeply anxious and unsettled over a year since this case was issued. He is clear that his only hope is to come to the UK so that he can begin to rebuild his shattered life. “By ignoring her statutory obligations under the Dubs amendment, the home secretary has not only failed ZS, but thousands of other unaccompanied refugee children who remain on mainland Europe, many living without shelter in these freezing conditions and at risk of exploitation. “We hope this challenge will force the UK government to carry out its moral and legal duties towards these children.” Last month Home Office officials agreed to extend an eligibility deadline so that refugee children arriving in Europe before 18 January 2018 could be considered under the Dubs amendment. Under the scheme, launched in 2016, the government agreed to offer a safe and legal route to refugee children travelling alone. Previously, children had to have arrived in Europe before March 2016 to be considered. This made large numbers of young people who had arrived more recently ineligible. A Home Office spokesman declined to comment on whether any vulnerable child asylum seekers had been brought to the UK from France, Italy or Greece since the guidance was updated last month. “We cannot provide a running commentary on how many new children have arrived since January,” the spokesman said. The charity Help Refugees has been granted permission by the court of appeal to challenge the government’s decision to limit the number of spaces available under the scheme to 480, arguing that this number does not represent the UK’s share of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Europe. The hearing is scheduled to last two days and judgment is likely to be reserved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/02/america-nation-immigrants-uscis-deleted","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T14:51:26Z","webTitle":"Why a US government agency deleted the words 'nation of immigrants'  | Linda R Tropp and Dina G Okamoto","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/america-nation-immigrants-uscis-deleted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/america-nation-immigrants-uscis-deleted","fields":{"headline":"Why a US government agency deleted the words 'nation of immigrants'","bodyText":"For more than a century, the identity of the United States has been grounded in the notion that we are a “nation of immigrants.” Immigrants have made innumerable contributions to our economy, infrastructure, and culture – building our railroads and bridges, bringing innovation and new ideas, and settling in communities that thrive throughout our country today. But now, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a federal agency charged with immigrant affairs, has turned its back on this rich legacy. As of last week, the mission statement of the USCIS has changed. No longer does its mission speak to “America’s promise as a nation of immigrants” that promotes “an awareness and understanding of citizenship” along with “ensuring the integrity of our immigration system.” Now, the new version focuses on “adjudicating requests for immigrant benefits” while “protecting Americans” and “securing the homeland”. Why do changes to the USCIS’s mission statement matter? It may seem like just a few words, but this new language is happening within the context of other alarming changes to our national immigration policies and practices. Refugee admissions have been curbed to a historic low, and people with “temporary protected status” who fled their homelands due to natural disasters or civil wars are being sent back. Several crucial programs are at risk of being terminated, including programs that allow 50,000 people from countries underrepresented in current immigration streams to come to the US, pathways for those who arrived in the US as children without legal documents to remain in the US to work and attend school, and the family-based system of immigration – a cornerstone of US immigration policy - which allows US citizens to reunite with family members by sponsoring their migration to the US. All of these changes have been presented under the guise of protecting against threats to our national security. But these policies stand in stark contrast to the will of the American people. Despite increased attention on anti-immigrant sentiments, Americans across the country largely embrace immigrants of all faiths and cultures and want our government to do the same. Most Americans believe the numbers of immigrants coming to the United States should be kept at its present level or increased. And 60% percent of Americans oppose building a wall on our border with Mexico. Nearly three-quarters of Americans now support granting legal status to immigrants originally brought to the US without papers as children, driven by the same moral imperative that has guided family reunification efforts over the last 50 years. These levels of endorsement in national polls are bolstered by the actions of US citizens from many walks of life who have taken to the streets in protest, boldly stating that “immigrants are welcome here”. Indeed, across the country, people and communities have been sending the clear message that immigrants are not only welcomed, but valued. Hundreds of local governments have advocated for their cities and towns to be recognized as “welcoming cities” for immigrants. Spanning from the industrial rust-belt of the midwest to our nation’s borders, civic leaders have gone to great lengths to welcome immigrants, because they open up new businesses, populate local schools, revitalize housing markets, and infuse new life into local communities. And while the majority of immigrants in the US are here legally, nearly 500 US cities have chosen to become “sanctuary cities” to protect immigrants without legal status from deportation, even at the risk of losing federal funding. These actions by everyday Americans uphold our nation’s values and reflect the best of who we are as a country, while our federal immigration policies are seeking to close doors and build walls. One of the best ways to honor our values as a nation is not to close opportunities to immigrants, but to successfully integrate them into the fabric of our society. As researchers who have been studying immigration and race relations for 20 years, our research shows that one of the best ways to integrate immigrants into the fabric of society is to interact with and welcome them. Such encouraging effects of contact between US citizens and immigrants are not limited to big cities or liberal-leaning areas. Recent immigrants have established themselves both in diverse urban areas and new destinations across the United States. According to recent poll data, more than 75% of US adults report that there are immigrants living in their community, with about a quarter (27%) reporting many recent immigrants in the community where they live. Our surveys of US citizens, including both white and black Americans, show that the more they encounter and interact with immigrants, the more inclined they are to welcome them into their communities. This significance of welcoming does not simply serve to express our national values or concern about immigrants and their wellbeing. Welcoming immigrants is also important for creating a shared sense of identity and community within our nation. Parallel surveys we have conducted with immigrants show that the more they feel welcome by Americans, the more they come to identify as American themselves and to seek to become US citizens – factors that can fuel greater civic participation and contributions to our society. The recent barrage of exclusionary immigration policy proposals are attempts to sow the seeds of fear, anxiety, and distrust. Rather than pursue policies that set immigrants apart, we should seek to integrate immigrants and highlight the assets they bring to communities across our nation.

Damnation is so fun, it’s hard to prioritise. So when the Commissioner for Public Appointments looked into the selection criteria for the board of the Office for Students, all the fireworks focused on Toby Young. Pugnacious in the noughties but curiously sensitive this decade, upset by mere mention of the anal sex jokes that only a short time ago were his stock in trade, Young was the beneficiary of a process that we could have all hazarded a guess at, but now have on paper: Jo Johnson, the universities minister, told him to apply. Justine Greening’s objections were overruled. The other candidates were discounted by a process with “serious shortcomings in fairness and transparency”. As if by magic, the least-suited person was suddenly the best imaginable, like Ivanka Trump in South Korea, or Tom Hanks in Big. Less was said about the panel’s decision on its choice of a student representative: in the selection process, it explicitly excluded anyone who had been involved with the National Union of Students. Nothing about this blacklist appeared in the advert for candidates, of course, because it would have made them look crazy; what kind of Office for Students discounts anyone who has shown an interest in the collective lot of students? Yet secret criteria aren’t a great look, either, signifying something in the region of bottomless distrust of the student body. The government made a choice in 2010 to re-imagine higher education as a commodity: a degree became a career-investment, lecturers became mind-wealth delivery systems, and students became customers. Brandon Lewis, minister without portfolio, told Question Time last week that he had advised his son to “act as a consumer and see exactly what he’s going to be getting”. The media chased the story of student debt, like dogs after a stick, which was fair enough, since it is life-changing for an entire generation and has, I believe, changed the political outlook, the concept of what’s fair, what’s reasonable, and what’s necessary, in ways that will echo through elections for at least the next decade. But the fees also altered the relationship – or tried to – between teachers and learners, introducing concepts such as value-for-money into a dyad that often can’t be measured or monetised. That new story relies on quite a lot of buy-in: lecturers, in theory, should be thinking of their students’ yield, and students should be always evaluating what they have gained. It reckons on a lot of self-interest, and a void of solidarity. The UCU pension strikes have exposed this as fallacy: students are standing with their lecturers, demanding compensation not because they oppose the strikes, but in order that the financial pain hits the administration. Politicised students are a nightmare for this government: they don’t just occupy common rooms and observe picket lines; they don’t even confine their activities to costing a bit of money in compensation. They insist upon some basic ideas about learning – that it’s a cooperative and intimate endeavour, founded on mutual respect and shared passion – in which thinking of yourself as a consumer is as strange and distant as going into the Olympics asking what it’s going to look like on your CV. No wonder Johnson didn’t want any politics in his Office for Students; but to be backed into a corner where the people who actively care must by definition be excluded, makes his project look rather doomed. Popular credulity? Don’t be daft, it’s elite stupidity “Large parts of central London,” Nigel Farage tweeted, “have no salt on the roads. Perhaps they are all so convinced by global warming they never thought any would be needed.” Obviously feeling the pinch at having his territory swallowed up by the government of the day, he has had to find a new front for a skirmish. And he’s got us now, fellow liberal elitists! We were totally had, convinced by that stupid yet unprecedented thing – a phenomenon on which the world’s scientific authorities speak as one – and thought we didn’t need salt any more. The fact that average daily temperatures in the Arctic have been up 20C this year – an “anomaly among anomalies”, according to Michael Mann, director of the Earth Systems Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, which is meteorologist speak for “Holy shit” – is something that only the urban, chattering classes would ever worry about. And look at the egg on our faces now, with our saltless streets and our panicky 4x4s going into auto-brake. The conundrum of populism is almost always posed as a question about why ordinary, reasonable people will suddenly believe anything. We’re looking through the wrong end of the telescope: it’s not a surge of popular credulity, it’s an outbreak of elite stupidity. It’s not so much that people on the Clapham Omnibus will believe anything; rather, that the omnibus conductor will now say anything, vent any old nonsense, untethered from reality, unchecked by evidence, unconcerned by consistency, decency, responsibility. Sorry, that was unfair: Farage himself has consistently been the person who can be relied upon to say the most scornful and uninformed thing in any scenario. But test them all, our ministers of state, against recent, very easily recalled standards of veracity and decency, and the source of our new political waters is plain. It’s not coming from the bottom, but the top. Without Toys R Us, where can kids now work out their tantrums? Toys R Us is going into administration. Ideally, I’d concentrate on the loss of jobs. Instead, I’m lost in a parade of tantrums, starting on Christmas Eve in 1988 when my sister wanted a brunette doll and there were only blondes; my daughter, fighting to the death for a dog in a basket; finally, me, arguing about whether or not I should pay for a swim woggle (if you leave them by the till at pram height, you have to expect a baby to chew them). If this is a story about the internet taking over the world, I would ask Amazon to have a serious conversation with itself about where the children of the future are going to build their low-stakes trauma resilience."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/28/irish-pm-shows-frustration-with-uk-over-brexit-border-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T17:43:47Z","webTitle":"Irish PM shows frustration with UK over Brexit border deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/28/irish-pm-shows-frustration-with-uk-over-brexit-border-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/28/irish-pm-shows-frustration-with-uk-over-brexit-border-deal","fields":{"headline":"Irish PM shows frustration with UK over Brexit border deal","bodyText":"The Irish prime minister has said it is “not OK” for Theresa May to renege on a deal involving a “backstop” solution to the Irish border question that could mean Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union. Dublin showed growing signs of frustration with the British government on Wednesday after the UK prime minister appeared to retreat from the agreement she made in December. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the 119-page draft Brexit treaty unveiled in Brussels was merely putting into legal effect the joint report sealed just before Christmas. “It’s not OK for people, whether pro-Brexit politicians in Britain or parties in Northern Ireland, to just say ‘no’ now. It’s incumbent on them, if they can’t accept the backstop, well then they must detail how option A or B would work,” Varadkar told Newstalk radio. “And actually write them down; they can’t be theoretical stuff about congestion charges and tolling in another country,” he said, referring to the British foreign secretary Boris Johnson’s suggestion that technology similar to that used for travelling between two London boroughs could apply to the Irish border. Varadkar’s deputy, Simon Coveney, warned it would be “hard to see” how May could deliver on her promise of an invisible border if the UK left the customs union and the single market. An audibly exasperated Coveney pointed out that Ireland had supported Britain’s desire to move to phase-two talks in December because of the very guarantees it had agreed on the Irish border. “Nobody is looking to pick a fight, nobody’s looking to have a go at the British government,” he said on RTÉ’s News at One. “The problem here is the British government’s stated position [in December], and still now, is they want to make sure there is no border infrastructure between Northern Ireland and Ireland, they don’t want trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the UK, and that the UK is leaving the customs union and the single market – and those things are simply not compatible. “It’s hard to see that being done if the British government continues to pursue leaving the customs union and the single market; it’s hard to see how you avoid border structures in that kind of context,” he said. The December deal signed by May included three options for dealing with the movement of trade and people over the 310-mile border. The first option is that the overall final deal between the UK and Britain obviates the need for border checks by retaining the status quo. The second option is a “bespoke” solution. Article 3 of the draft withdrawal agreement states that if the first two options from the December deal for the Irish border are not met then a backstop, option C, comes into play. Coveney and Varadkar said the onus was on Britain to come up with an alternative, something Ireland has been requesting for more than 12 months. “Our response is, look, this [option C] doesn’t have to be the solution, but come up with something better that we can agree and we’d be delighted to agree,” said Coveney. “We are trying to protect the status quo which is also protecting the Good Friday agreement in terms of north-south co-operation.” “We have to see an approach coming from the British government that allows for trade between the EU and UK that’s doesn’t allow borders and that solves the problem for Northern Ireland which was agreed in December,” he said. Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, which is propping up the Westminster government, said the deal was an attack on the constitutional links between Northern Ireland and Britain. She tweeted: Coveney said Ireland was not “hardening” its position but was “simply holding” it. “This isn’t trying to provoke, it’s not trying to reinterpret … We are simply translating what was agreed, albeit after a difficult negotiation, in December into a legal text. So nobody should be surprised. “The Irish government has made it very clear – we’re not hardening our position, we’re simply holding our position. Yes, we want to move on to a proper and detailed discussion about what a future relationship is going to look like. We want that future relationship to be as close to the status quo as possible. We want the closest possible relationship with the UK, from a trade perspective, a political perspective, from a society perspective,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/01/carillion-chair-planned-upbeat-message-before-845m-writedown","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T07:49:52Z","webTitle":"Carillion chair planned ‘upbeat’ message before £845m writedown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/01/carillion-chair-planned-upbeat-message-before-845m-writedown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/01/carillion-chair-planned-upbeat-message-before-845m-writedown","fields":{"headline":"Carillion chair planned ‘upbeat’ message before £845m writedown","bodyText":"Carillion’s former chairman Philip Green had only a “tenuous grasp” on the crisis in the construction firm’s finances, and was working towards an “upbeat announcement” to the City just five days before unveiling a £845m writedown, board minutes of the collapsed group reveal. The board also rejected advice from its brokers that the company would be unable to raise emergency funds, describing their pessimistic view as “not credible” and then hiring alternative advisers. The details are contained within the company’s board minutes, which were released on Wednesday by a joint select committee investigating the construction group’s collapse in January. The business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee, along with the work and pensions committee, have been publishing extracts of the official Carillion corporate record each day this week. Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee, said: “Carillion’s chair appeared to lack even a tenuous grasp on the reality of the company’s situation. Five days before the profit warning that heralded the firm’s public spiral into insolvency, Philip Green stands like the mayor of Pompeii – smoke billowing from the volcano behind him, lava cascading down the slopes – trumpeting the forthcoming revelries of the village fete. It is difficult to believe the chairman of the company was unaware of its position, but equally difficult to comprehend his assessment if he was.” Rachel Reeves MP, the chair of the BEIS committee, added: “Philip Green’s assessment of Carillion as ‘a compelling and attractive proposition’ shows either a woeful lack of leadership or no grip on reality.” The minutes of the board meeting of 5 July 2017 record Green, who had been chairman since 2014, stating that the company should continue to work “toward a positive and upbeat announcement for Monday [10 July], focusing on the strength of the business as a compelling and attractive proposition, and mentioning the self-help and disposal position”. Five days later, Carillion announced the £845m profit warning that marked the beginning of the company’s death spiral. The meeting was also partly attended by Peter Moorhouse of the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which was an adviser to Carillion. He told the meeting that the bank was “not able to underwrite the proposed equity issue” and had withdrawn as sponsors. The Carillion directors rejected his view, the minutes show, concluding that it had “discussed the rationale given by Mr Moorhouse, reflecting that it was not credible”. Green did not return phone calls."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/shortcuts/2018/feb/28/wanted-pagan-chaplains-for-britains-prisons","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T16:07:14Z","webTitle":"Wanted: pagan chaplains for Britain’s prisons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2018/feb/28/wanted-pagan-chaplains-for-britains-prisons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/shortcuts/2018/feb/28/wanted-pagan-chaplains-for-britains-prisons","fields":{"headline":"Wanted: pagan chaplains for Britain’s prisons","bodyText":"Seven pagan chaplains are being sought to minister to inmates at prisons around the country. The vacancies, listed on the civil service jobs website, come with a pro rata salary of up to £29,176. While the six most popular faiths (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Judaism) account for most people in prison, there has been a steady increase in the number of prisoners who identify as pagan and to whose specific spiritual needs these vacancies will cater. It is easy to overlook the importance of a chaplain, but prison can be notoriously isolating – and not only in the physical sense. Prisoners often become estranged from their families and see their relationships break down. “Prisoners go through all kinds of emotions,” says the Rev Michael Binstock, a Jewish faith adviser to the prison service. “There are those who self-harm, there are those who are suicidal. I got a letter from a prisoner who I visited for a number of years. When he was released, he wrote to say that he regularly thought about taking his own life and that, if it wasn’t for my visits, he would have attempted it. Most chaplains have those stories.” Each inmate is allowed an hour a week with a chaplain, whether they are religious or not. “They are going through some terrible emotions; sadly, their crimes often lead to the breakdown of every significant relationship in their life.” As well as offering spiritual guidance, Binstock says a chaplain might help a prisoner in practical ways. “One gentleman I visited had no family or friends who could bring his hearing aid, so I went and got it for him.” For prisoners who observe pagan religions – such as Wicca, Druidry and Odinism – communing with nature and taking part in outdoor rituals are often an important part of their spiritual life, something that is problematic in a prison setting. The pagan chaplains will be required to lead open rituals and officiate rites of passage. As with all chaplains, they will also be expected to offer support to inmates of other faiths. “You cannot overestimate how much of a test on the psyche and the soul prison can be,” says Binstock. “When we talk about crime, we often talk about the victims. But prisoners and their families are victims, too. All chaplains are trained to know that a warm handshake and a kind word can offer a huge degree of hope.” In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

Her first book, Forbidden Art, written with Anton Nikolaev, won Russia’s prestigious Kandinsky prize, but she has only really become known abroad since the publication last year of Other Russias. It’s a brutal, darkly funny collection of drawings of sex workers in Nizhny Novgorod, slaves in Moscow, schoolchildren in desolate villages, as well as LGBT activists and ultra-nationalists. When she toured the US last year, the New Yorker described her as “listening to ordinary Russians by drawing them one by one”, from God-fearing old ladies to young skinheads and striking truckers. Lomasko has just flown in from Moscow for a series of events at London’s Pushkin House, including the installation of an exhibition called On the Eve, a reference to what she calls “massive changes to come” and a nod to Ivan Turgenev’s novel of the same name (she also jokes about the country being “on the eve of Putin’s re-election”). It will feature drawings from Other Russias and a new purpose-built mural, as well as work never before seen outside Russia – and some never seen inside Russia either. Her work is not officially censored at home, she explains, although it might as well be. “It’s the same as in the Soviet period,” she says. “You don’t get arrested or interrogated. Just no curators or gallery owners want to work with you. It is like a little death of sorts, for any artist. My work does come out in Russia, but only on alternative websites that have a liberal audience in St Petersburg or Moscow. Anything more serious or more mainstream, it’s not possible.” Before the elections in 2012, things were easier, she adds. Since then, she feels the difference. While Lomasko likes to look at the big picture, she is equally interested in everyday concerns, one current obsession being the housing situation in Moscow, in particular the 4,500 apartment buildings (including hers) that are earmarked for demolition, with plans to relocate up to 1.6 million residents. “They want to move people to worse areas, places with no infrastructure,” she sighs. “It’s internal deportation. And the residents are supposed to argue it out among themselves. Who’s for, who’s against. It’s a miniature civil war.” Although she now lives in Moscow, she identifies strongly with Russians from outside the capital. “I was born in Serpukhov, a town 100km south of Moscow. I didn’t know anything about modern art or cinema. Everything just passed us by. The most important thing was who was getting married and when.” It’s clear from her expression that this was unimportant to her. Now 39, she enjoys the freedom of being single and child-free, taking long trips across the former Soviet Union. Her latest took her to the predominantly Islamic parts of Dagestan, to document women’s attitudes towards religion. The drawings from this trip are striking, simple and, unusually for Lomasko, occasionally in colour. A young girl in a blue flowered headscarf stands in a cafe, in front of a man in a tracksuit emblazoned with the word Russia. “They try to marry girls off in a hurry,” she says, “while they still have no opinions of their own.” Another woman, who has turned her back on her faith, wears her hair uncovered. “I put on a headscarf,” she says, “and felt as if I had died.” Lomasko also recounts conversations with women who want their daughters circumcised, as they themselves were. “Now is a difficult time,” says one. “There are many women and few men. A girl should be circumcised so that in the event she can live alone.” Lomasko sees her work as a continuation of a family tradition. Her father, Valentin, was the official artist in a secret military installation. His job was to design posters depicting the greatness of the Soviet Union. “The most boring thing in the world: serving power. He did hundreds of portraits of Lenin. He would say that he did not believe in it all, and that he did his job to earn money because there was no other way to live. He dreamed of being a real artist. So instead he put all his ambition into me. He’s very proud of how things have turned out.” She calls her style “graphic reportage” and sketches with pencils and felt tips. “I have to do it when I’m sitting with someone, otherwise the drawings lose all their energy.” She fills them in later with paint or ink. Most are cartoon-like with soundbites in speech bubbles, but she also writes some accompanying text. “I am not a journalist,” she says, though. “I’m an artist. This can be strange for people because artists are supposed to be silent. But I wanted to talk to people and find out what they had to say.” Although she is frequently described as an artist-activist, Lomasko’s drawings are not intentionally about protest. “My work is not political. But if you draw from life then of course it’s about society. People ask me, ‘Why do you choose controversial themes? Slavery, sex workers, LGBT activists, people in detention camps – where are the normal people?’ I always say, ‘These are normal people. That’s the whole point.’” One friend insisted she depict “ordinary Russia”, asking her to document the “happy life” at a school in a picturesque rural community east of Moscow. When she arrived, things were so bad that a class was being taught in the school kitchen because there was no other space. “There’s no work in these places. No one wants to have children. Look at this drawing.” She picks one up from the dozens on the floor, ready to be hung for the exhibition. “This is a boy being taught by his teacher. He’s the only boy in his class. The teacher is asking him: ‘Moscow – is that a noun or a proper noun?’ And he says, ‘It’s a street.’ He doesn’t even know Moscow is a city. The word means nothing to him. The teacher said to me, ‘And why should he know what Moscow is? It’s not as if he’s ever going to go there. No one there cares about us.’” Lomasko says her work isn’t negative, it’s merely accurate. “When I was on tour in the US, audiences knew nothing about ordinary life in Russia. They just wanted to ask me, ‘Did Putin interfere in our elections? Will there be a war? Is Trump Putin’s puppet?’ It was amusing to me. On American radio they asked me, ‘Why did Russians vote for Trump?’ I said: ‘Guys, you voted for Trump. I didn’t even vote for Putin.’” She sees many parallels between Russia and the US, however: “Nationalism in Russia is racism in the US.” She did a series of drawings in Pittsburgh depicting the “border” between poor and wealthy areas. “People would be asking me, ‘How can you live in such a terrible country as Russia?’ But my drawings showed that there are a lot of similarities, particularly when it comes to poverty. In European countries there is a safety net for people. In the US and in Russia, there isn’t.” Victoria Lomasko is in conversation with Elena Zaytseva at Pushkin House, London, Friday 2 March at 7.30pm. On the Eve runs from 9 March to 26 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/01/centrist-party-british-politics-plot-corbyn","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-01T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"A new ‘centrist’ party is doomed – but it could keep Corbyn out of No 10 | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/01/centrist-party-british-politics-plot-corbyn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/01/centrist-party-british-politics-plot-corbyn","fields":{"headline":"A new ‘centrist’ party is doomed – but could still keep Corbyn out of No 10","bodyText":"Is a spectre haunting British politics, the spectre of a new “centrist” party? A note on terms, first, if I may: centrism is a deeply misleading term, conferring an image of moderation on a party that would combine social liberalism and anti-Brexitism with support for cuts, privatisation and a pro-corporate agenda. A Labour breakaway party has been mooted since Jeremy Corbyn became odds-on favourite to become leader, two and a half years ago, and was revived as a nuclear option after a disastrous general election showing. After Labour at the last election achieved the greatest vote surge since Clement Attlee in 1945, this rumour seemed to die a death. But flames flicker in the embers. Rumblings of discontent in Tory Remainia have revived chatter about a new political force linking together certain Labour rightwingers, the hapless Liberal Democrats and liberal Tories. It would sacrifice political careers on the altar of delusion and vanity, and it’s unclear whether a split would damage Labour or the Tories more. But it could still prove the greatest single obstacle to a Corbyn government. Let’s take the Labour side. It is a mistake in politics to reduce the differing opinions of your opponents to ulterior motives.There are Labour MPs who sincerely, as a matter of principle, believe Brexit is a national calamity that must be stopped. The vast majority desire no split. There is also, undoubtedly, a small faction of MPs who are seeking to weaponise the issue to undermine a Labour leadership they absolutely do not wish to form a government. A formal split, for a minority, remains a temptation. One Labour figure – not an ideological Corbynite, incidentally – tells me a parliamentary vote on a Brexit final deal could provide a useful pretext for such a split. Look out for a phrase in the coming months – “Country before party”. You’ll hear it repeated a lot by both disillusioned Labour and Tory MPs, and it provides a convenient founding raison d’etre. Would they do it? If Labour politics were an American high-school drama, some on the right of the party must have felt as though they were once the jocks and the prom queens, but have been suddenly usurped in the pecking order by the emo kids and goths they used to pity or mock. They will now never have ministerial office, let alone become party leader. That’s not what many of them signed up for: they believed they would always be members of the party’s ruling caste, even if there would be inevitable career ups and downs. Unlike David Miliband – who was foreign secretary, after all – they are not lucrative enough to be rescued by a prestigious international institution. They lack even the hinterland of the eloquent historian Tristram Hunt, who could become head of a museum. They are flattered by a centrist commentariat, many of whom have been close associates of the New Labour contingent since the 1990s. Ideologically repelled by some Labour pledges, fearful of the wider Corbynite movement, why not simply dash for an attractive-looking exit? There are reasons, of course. A raw emotional loyalty to Labour as a brand does exist, even among some of the staunchest recalcitrants. There has been no mandatory reselection of MPs: many Corbynite figures think that it’s more hassle than it’s worth, that only a handful would be deselected anyway, that preventing aggressively hostile briefings by backbenchers to the press has to be weighed up against the inevitable media storm over supposed attempted “purges” of the party. Recent Labour selections for marginal Tory-held seats seem to confirm this thesis: most candidates who stood in the last election have been reselected. Many also believe the left lacks a candidate after Corbyn. New Labour, after all, successfully prevented many leftwing candidates being selected, meaning that there is a missing generation. The newly elected, charismatic rising star Laura Pidcock is an obvious successor, but she is only 30 years old. Some Corbynites fear Corbyn will eventually be replaced by a Neil Kinnock figure who will swerve the party to the right (making transformations to party structures all the more urgent). That’s the hope, too, of some Labour rightwingers. What could change the dynamic? There are about 15 Tory pro-remain MPs who feel increasingly detached from their party. One extremely well-connected source tells me that the Tory press will launch an all-out onslaught against them, accusing them of backing Corbyn’s “customs union” and bringing a radical Labour government closer. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act rather blunts this attack in their opinion: a significant legislative defeat does not automatically mean a vote of no confidence. The name to look for, I’m told, is Stephen Hammond: if his name remains on an amendment in favour of a customs union, 15 Tory MPs will rebel, and the government will face defeat. There is a 40% chance of this happening, I’m told, and a 30% chance of voting against a final deal. With Tory discipline breaking down, they could either conceivably spin out of the party or bring Theresa May down, almost by accident. If Boris Johnson – let alone Jacob Rees-Mogg – becomes Tory leader, some (such as Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan and Justine Greening) will inevitably look for life rafts outside the party. There is a candidate, I’m told, who could stop such an eventuality: Michael Gove. He has become the May successor with the path of least resistance. He has the required impeccable Brexit credentials, as former Vote Leave spokesperson, but is seen as a liberal Tory otherwise. Tory MPs bemoan May’s lack of direction above all else. in Gove’s current environment role (just as when he assaulted comprehensive education as education secretary), he has shown it is possible to set the agenda and be full of energy, verve and political direction. He could attract the support of MPs ranging from Morgan (who backed his abortive 2016 leadership bid) to Rees-Mogg. There is one hiccup: he is, electorally speaking, a cup of cold sick. But he could at least prevent a Tory rupture. If not, a parliamentary faction claiming “Country before party” could emerge between certain Labour and Tory MPs, in a pact with the Lib Dems. Yes, it would be doomed to failure. They have nothing like the big beasts of the 1980s Social Democratic party, and that failed. The electoral system would destroy them. Labour right-wingers look obsessively to a so-called third way formula, which at least, on its own terms, made sense in the post-cold war 1990s but which is irrelevant to the post-crash 2010s and an angry electorate looking for radical change, and which has taken social-democratic parties to oblivion across continental Europe. Now, some Labour figures believe it may damage the Tories more. I’m not so sure: many Tory remain voters are “meh” when it comes to Brexit, and fear Corbynism more. Yet even taking a tiny handful of percentage points away from Labour could gift the Tories a majority. Indeed, the Times columnist and Tony Blair’s former speechwriter Philip Collins believes that preventing a Corbyn victory could be a centrist party’s most important function. Perversely, it would therefore strengthen the hardcore rightwing Tory Brexiteers. So yes, a new centrist party is doomed. But it may well be the last great hope of the Tory right – and the biggest single threat to a socialist government assuming office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
