Roger Federer will be easing back into shape at Halle, having again chosen to skip the clay to save his 36-year-old legs for the grass of the All England Club he finds so suited to his game. Novak Djokovic – despite an uncharacteristically short-tempered exit from Roland Garros, mumbling about uncertainty over his future – will be desperate to get his career back on track where he has won three of his 12 majors. And Rafael Nadal will arrive on the grass – perhaps at Queen’s Club – celebrated as the finest clay-courter of all but with reduced prospects at Wimbledon, where he has not got out of the fourth round since he lost against Djokovic in the 2011 final. As for Murray, the word is he is hitting the ball with purpose and moving freely in practice, easing fears the grass season may pass him by. His team expect him to decide towards the end of the week if he is ready. Although he has put his name down for Washington in August and Shenzhen in September, it is inconceivable he will choose either of those hard courts on which to make his comeback. A more sensible scenario – if he is fit and ready – would be to play Queen’s Club, where he feels comfortable and has won five times, to see how his mind and body hold up under the stress of match conditions. It is a small, high-quality field and, even if he lost, he would have a far better idea of how he may fare at Wimbledon, the scene of his last competitive match. If he got back to winning, he would be in a much better frame of mind. It would be folly to walk straight on to the main stage at Wimbledon without rehearsing his lines at Queen’s. He will not be seeded, for a start – and ranked outside the top 150 – so could draw any of the major contenders in the first round. To lose in a five-set match against Federer, say, in front of his home audience on Centre Court or Court No 1 would not be a pleasant experience for anyone – except, maybe, Federer. For now, the man of the moment is Nadal. His 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 win against Dominic Thiem on Court Philippe Chatrier on a stifling Sunday afternoon was a dogged rather than outstanding performance but he did what he needed to do. He dropped one set in the whole fortnight – in the quarter-finals against Diego Schwartzman – and had a couple of other tough moments but, generally, he ruled Roland Garros with the same imperious strut he showed in his first final, 13 years ago. Now he has La Undecima. If nothing else, he is improving everyone’s Spanish. It is easy to take Nadal for granted. He has been at or near the top of the game for so long he is expected to deliver excellence and victories every time he steps on to a court, especially with clay underfoot. And, while he always reminds us there are no certainties in sport, over five sets on his favourite surface, the Spaniard is invincible if he wins the first set – he has prevailed 95 times in those circumstances. On grass, however, he has become increasingly vulnerable. Four players on or outside the top 100 have beaten him at Wimbledon in the past seven years. Last year the 34‑year‑old left-hander Gilles Müller ground him down in five sets in the fourth round. Yet his uncle, Toni, who is still a considerable presence in the Nadal camp now run by Carlos Moyá, thinks he can win a third Wimbledon title – which is touching. But unrealistic. Federer, though, is a different beast. His body’s mechanics could not be more different to the muscular intensity of Nadal, and the Swiss husbands his resources like a miser. He has picked up injuries, also, but made the most remarkable comeback from knee surgery in 2016 to win the Australian Open last year – and do it again this year. He also squeezed in an eighth Wimbledon title, of course, with Nadal, Murray and Djokovic all cut down way before the final weekend. This may be the last time the Big Four contest the championship together. It cannot be guaranteed any will still be playing a year from now, although Nadal gave no indication in Paris that he has any retirement plans. We should enjoy them while we can, while they are still willing and able to put the hours in on and off the court, striving as they have done for more than a decade to outdo each other. It is a four-cornered rivalry that has made them the great champions they are. It does not matter, really, if Federer is viewed as better than Nadal, or vice versa, when they eventually walk away – although the notion of parity is anathema to their fiercely loyal fans. But one fact is close to incontestable: neither would have reached the heights he has done without being pushed by the other."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/11/nine-british-teenagers-hurt-in-germany-bus-crash","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T17:38:48Z","webTitle":"Nine British teenagers hurt in Germany bus crash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/11/nine-british-teenagers-hurt-in-germany-bus-crash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/11/nine-british-teenagers-hurt-in-germany-bus-crash","fields":{"headline":"Nine British teenagers hurt in Germany bus crash","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nine British teenagers have been hurt in a head-on crash between a bus and a car in south-west Germany that also left the two drivers with serious injuries, local emergency services have said. A 90-year-old man lost control of his car and hit the double-decker bus, which was carrying 73 students aged 13-15, six adult supervisors and two drivers, a spokeswoman for the Tuttlingen police force said. The teenagers had minor injuries. The Vöhrenbach volunteer fire service said it helped free the driver of the car and he was airlifted to hospital. The service said: “A large contingent of rescue workers took care of the occupants of the two vehicles hand in hand.” Police said those students who were not physically hurt in the crash, which happened at 9.15am local time, were in shock and had been taken to a hall in the nearby town of Vöhrenbach for supervision. The injured were taken to a local hospital. Images of the collision released by the service showed damage to the front left side of the bus and extensive damage to the front of the car. The group was on a trip to the Black Forest and was on its way from Titisee to Triberg, according to police. The incident is under investigation and police said it was not immediately clear what caused the man to veer into oncoming traffic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-raspberry-cardamom-and-almond-cake","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T13:00:29Z","webTitle":"Thomasina Miers' recipe for raspberry, cardamom and almond cake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-raspberry-cardamom-and-almond-cake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-raspberry-cardamom-and-almond-cake","fields":{"headline":"Thomasina Miers' recipe for raspberry, cardamom and almond cake","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hot sun, sweet berries. This is the time of year to feast on summer fruit with cold cream or ice-cream, in Eton messes and pavlovas, in crisp tarts and pastries. Mostly I love berries as they come, but there is something about a raspberry that sweetens and intensifies with a spell in the oven. In this sticky, nutty almond cake, the raspberry juices seep into the batter, giving the cake a sultry, tangy edge. Raspberry, cardamom and almond cake The subtle scent of cardamom and rosewater gives this teacake an exotic eastern streak. You can use ready ground almonds, but the cake tastes far better if you grind them yourself. Prep 5 min Cook 1 hr 20 min Makes 1 cake 125g butter, softened, plus more for greasing 350g blanched almonds 225g soft brown sugar 1 tsp flaky sea salt 2 eggs 250g Greek-style yoghurt 6 cardamom pods, shells discarded and seeds finely ground 1 tsp baking powder ¾ tsp rosewater 225g raspberries 25g flaked almonds 1 tbsp caster sugar Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Butter a 23cm loose-bottom tin and line it with a double sheet of greaseproof paper to prevent the sugars darkening too much. Warm the almonds in the oven for five minutes, then blitz into fine crumbs in a food processor. Be careful not to whizz them too long or the nut oils will start to separate. Beat the butter until light and pale, then stir in the sugar, almonds and salt. Spread half this mixture over the bottom of the tin. Lightly whisk the eggs and beat them into the rest of the cake batter. Stir in the yoghurt, cardamom, baking powder and rosewater, and mix well. Pour into the tin and scatter over the raspberries, allowing them to sink into the batter. Sprinkle over the flaked almonds and caster sugar, and bake for 60-70 minutes until an inserted skewer comes out clean. The mix will still be a little soft, but it will firm up as it cools. Serve at room temperature with creme fraiche or softly whipped cream – all the more delicious if you can find farmhouse cream. And for the rest of the week Roast any leftover nuts in the oven with a tablespoon of olive oil and a few scrunches of sea salt for a delicious pre-dinner snack. Try making ice-cream with raspberries and rosewater, too – it is a lovely combination made even more delicious with a teaspoon of dark sherry vinegar. Fry leftover flaked almonds in butter, add fresh lemon and pour over grilled fish for a great, very quick dinner.

Voters will now be allowed to scribble a candidate’s nickname, initials or campaign slogan anywhere on the ballot – rather than mark an X over their names – and have it count as valid. The National Electoral Institute (INE) – which organises the election and referees all partisan political activities in Mexico – changed the rules barely three weeks ahead of the vote that will also renew congress, elect nine governors and hundreds of mayors. Nicknames abound in Mexican politics: the current front-runner Andrés Manuel López Obrador is often referred to by his initials: “Amlo”. But he is equally well-known as “El Peje” for pejelegarto, a fish from his native Tabasco state, whose name translates literally as Alligatorfish. His closest rival – Ricardo Anaya Cortés of the rightwing National Action Party – is sometimes referred to as “RAC” in print, but on social media he is increasingly called Ricky Riquín Canallín – the Spanish equivalent of “Richie Rich”, which was coined by López Obrador in a recent candidates’ debate. The lone independent candidate on the ballot, cowboy-turned-governor Jaime Rodríguez, is better known as “El Bronco” – or the Untamed One. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate José Antonio Meade, whose sedate speaking style and lacklustre campaign has failed to capture the public imagination, lacks a nickname, beyond the perfunctory “Pepe” or “Pepe Toño” – the diminutive form of his first names. Dissenters on the INE board warned that allowing voters to use nicknames could cause confusion during the vote count. A blank box on the ballot already allows for write-in candidates. López Obrador has a history of tagging his critics with unflattering nicknames. As Mexico City mayor, he called anti-crime protesters pirruris (spoiled rich kids) and dismissed civil society organisations which disagreed with him as fifis (posh). López Obrador labelled Anaya with the “Ricky Riquín Canallín” during the second presidential debate. The name stuck and remained the debate’s most memorable moment. “It shows how good López Obrador is at branding people,” said Federico Estévez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “He’s almost as good as Trump.” All polls show López Obrador ahead of his rivals by around 20 percentage points, amid a broad desire for change in a country beset by drug cartel violence and political corruption scandals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/12/fake-meat-plant-based-burgers-vegetarians-vegans","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T07:00:44Z","webTitle":"Calm down, carnivores: fake meat with real flavour is good for all of us | Aine Carlin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/fake-meat-plant-based-burgers-vegetarians-vegans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/fake-meat-plant-based-burgers-vegetarians-vegans","fields":{"headline":"Calm down, carnivores: fake meat with real flavour is good for all of us","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fake meat. It’s a divisive topic, and one that frequently pits vegans against carnivores – pretty needless given it’s just a way of increasing options for the dinner table. It’s not just for vegetarians but anyone wishing to reduce their meat intake given the colossal environmental crisis we find ourselves in. But regardless of which camp you belong to, it’s going to take a collective effort to undo even some of the damage already done. At this stage of the 21st century we should all be aware of the strain livestock production puts on the planet. So it’s a head-scratcher that people are up in arms after Sainsbury’s announced it would be stocking a new range of faux meats alongside the real thing. Are people worried they will mistakenly purchase a plant-based burger instead of minced beef? And if so (and it tastes just as good), is that really such a travesty? Or is it a marketing strategy that has already been wildly successful in the US (with Beyond Meat’s pea protein product of the moment) absolutely worth trying here in the UK? After all, what have we got to lose? Well, a lot: according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, cattle-breeding is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, as well as being a huge exploiter of land and water resources. Ethan Brown, the chief executive of Beyond Meat, has urged retailers to stock its products in the burger section; sometimes they have even outsold their meaty counterparts, opening up quality plant-based burgers to consumers who normally wouldn’t set foot in the veggie aisle. And with an estimated 22 million flexitarians in the UK, what supermarket wouldn’t want to capture a growing market? Not only is fake meat good for commerce, it’s vital for the planet too. As Brown says: “Protein is protein.” Some vegans actually like the taste of meat, and can now get it without consuming animal flesh. There seems to be a strain of thought that says: if you’re veggie or vegan, you should stick to vegetables that look and taste like vegetables, not ones that have been reconfigured to look like meat products. For these carnivores, it’s particularly troublesome when the texture and appearance is convincing – leading to petitions in the US, and a law in France to prevent fake meat being labelled as meat. I would suggest that such alternatives are merely a sign of the times, and instead of battling against them, people should simply accept that our food options are diversifying, in the same way as our lifestyles are. Many of us no longer want to be burdened by labels but simply desire to tread as lightly as we can upon this planet, and regard these products as beneficial to that journey. Whether brands or industries feel threatened is something they will have to address themselves because – as Tesco’s sell-out vegan-steak scenario demonstrates – the public are speaking with their wallets, sending a clear message that plant-based products are here to stay. Instead of seeking ways to undermine them, we should be embracing them for our health, the environment and animal welfare. • Aine Carlin is a vegan food writer and blogger"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/23/roger-federer-more-we-love-him-nicer-he-becomes-geoff-dyer","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"Roger Federer: the more we love him, the nicer he becomes | Geoff Dyer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/23/roger-federer-more-we-love-him-nicer-he-becomes-geoff-dyer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/23/roger-federer-more-we-love-him-nicer-he-becomes-geoff-dyer","fields":{"headline":"Roger Federer: the more we love him, the nicer he becomes","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"You still meet people, in their 70s or 80s now, who recall the night they saw Jimi Hendrix as a defining moment in their lives, one of the things that made their lives worthwhile. That’s how I feel about Roger Federer. Last year, having watched him play just once before – sweeping aside a now forgotten opponent in an early round of Wimbledon in 2012 – I was courtside for every one of Roger’s matches on his way to winning the titles at Indian Wells and Wimbledon. It was a great achievement – my being there to see him, I mean. At Indian Wells, a friend and I attended the press conference after Roger had walloped Jack Sock in the semi-final. When he entered the room and we saw him up close for the first time, both of us – I was at the tail end of my 50s, my friend was 52 – gasped like adolescent girls catching a glimpse of Justin Bieber, or whoever the new Justin Bieber might be. Compared to some of the other hunks on the tour, and especially next to his long-time rival Rafael Nadal, Federer’s arms seem almost feeble. Up close, though, he looks like a Greek god – it’s just that his signature ease of movement on court distracts us from the physical strength that has powered that fluency and delicacy for all these years. Like a dancer, part of his talent lies in concealing the effort needed to make grace appear effortless. It was also at Indian Wells, seeing the huge crowds gather around the practice court an hour before Federer was due to appear for his session, that I started seriously to wonder what it must be like to be Roger. Not just to be widely considered the greatest tennis player of all time, but to be so loved, so adored. Like many people, I’d loved Roger for years and then, about five years ago, realised I loved him even more than I had before. This had to with his vulnerability. Back when he was winning everything and beating everyone – except Nadal at Roland Garros – we took his greatness for granted. Then the cracks began to appear. There was the difficulty of dealing with Nadal’s high, topspin balls to his backhand, at first on clay, eventually on all surfaces; there was the sheer relentlessness of Novak Djokovic; there were the occasional niggling injuries. There was also – and I mention this after all the tennis-related issues, even though it predates them – his dismaying decision to take to the court at Wimbledon in 2006 wearing a cream blazer, as though arriving not for tennis but a party on Gatsby’s lawns. (The monogrammed cardigan of 2008 at least had the virtue of looking sporty – in a croquet at Brideshead sort of way.) It was after all this, but long before the knee problem and surgery that led to his 2016/17 sabbatical and eventual resurgence, that my – our – adoration reached its properly mature phase. We were glad that he kept playing, giving us a chance to see him, even if only on TV, even though a pattern seemed set whereby he sailed through the early rounds before coming up against either the swirling menace of Nadal’s left hand or the Balkan wall of Djokovic’s implacable defence. One wonders, also, if Nietzsche’s observation might have played a part in this post-omnipotent phase of his life, especially if we alter “victory” to “victories”: “What is best about a great victory is that it rids the victor of fear of defeat. ‘Why not also lose for once?’ he says to himself; ‘now that I am rich enough for that.’” As those losses mounted, something else became manifest. Roger had always been generous in victory – that came easily, of course – but defeat often left him floundering. Losing to Nadal in Australia in 2009 reduced him to tears (“God, it’s killing me”), testing his graciousness to the limit. Thereafter, losing became something Roger accepted with a grace commensurate with his game. It needs emphasising that he is not alone in such displays of sportsmanship. Rafa was even more generous than Roger in Melbourne, muting his celebrations because of his affection for the king he had just deposed. So while Roger may not be uniquely magnanimous in defeat, he is a defining part of a golden age of tennis manners. We have become sufficiently accustomed to this that we are now struck by a lack of good sportsmanship, as happened when Marin Cilic, a player of monstrous power and still more monstrous tedium, failed even to mention Roger in his speech after being whupped by him in last year’s Wimbledon final. Not that we really cared. All that mattered was that Roger had won his second major of the year, bringing his tally to 19, to be followed, this year, by his 20th and a return to the No 1 spot where he is currently perched, precariously, ahead of Nadal. He has again demonstrated that the most efficient way to play tennis is also the most beautiful, that aesthetics and winning can go hand in hand. Last year’s Australian Open was the victory he had craved after all those years of falling short. Everything after that was going to be gravy. And so he has become still more relaxed, more gracious, funnier, more charming. It would be unfair to say that Kyle Edmund, in his post-match interviews, seems rather charmless compared with Roger. Federer has been wooing audiences, in multiple languages, for more than a decade and is as comfortable appearing on TV as he is watching it on his couch. (John Isner, after winning his first Masters 1,000 title, at Miami this year, joked that he now knew what Roger felt like every other week.) In Melbourne in January, Roger’s post-match interviews with Jim Courier got longer and more enjoyable with every round. He’s funny, he’s cool, the one thing he’s not is… With the possible exception of “respect”, no word in the English language is presently misused more than “humble”. When a male writer or actor says he has been humbled by the receipt of some prize or other, it translates roughly as: “I’ve got the biggest hard-on you’ve ever seen.” People routinely described Usain Bolt as humble, even though he spent most of his time bragging about being a legend. They may not be pompous or grand, but there’s nothing humble about either Bolt or Federer. What they both are is relaxed and nice. I’ve never met him – never met the man I instinctively call Roger – but everyone who has says the same thing: how incredibly nice he is. At Wimbledon last year, one of the journalists sitting near me told a story about sharing a car with Ilie Nastase and what a complete pig he was. Then another told a story about sharing a car with Roger. What was he like? We knew what the answer was going to be: he was so nice. Several years ago, George Saunders published an essay recalling his time at Syracuse University, where the writer Tobias Wolff served as a mentor and teacher. One day, after Wolff had published a story in the Atlantic, Saunders spotted him in the English department: “There he is: both writer and citizen. I don’t know why this makes such an impression on me – maybe because I somehow have the idea that a writer walks around in a trance, being rude, moved to misbehaviour by the power of his own words. But here is the author of this great story, walking around, being nice.” Later, after Toby and his family leave Syracuse for California, Saunders and his wife move in to the house where the Wolffs used to live. As George sits out on the porch, unseen in the dark, a couple pass by. “‘Oh, Toby,’” the woman says. ‘Such a wonderful man.’” Saunders makes a note to himself: “Live in such a way that, when neighbours walk by your house months after you’re gone, they can’t help but blurt out something affectionate.” Niceness, in other words, is something to be aspired to. True to his resolution, the now famous Saunders is also famously nice. His students will, in turn, be beneficiaries of this legacy and genealogy. Roger, it seems, is not much of a reader, but early on he adopted as his motto the line: “It’s nice to be important, but it’s more important to be nice.” After Federer beat Andy Roddick in the Wimbledon final of 2005, Roddick told him: “I’d really like to hate you but you’re just too nice.” Now, this celebration of niceness is, I hasten to add, not a plea for blandness. There’s something intoxicating about the way that a victorious fist-pump from Fabio Fognini can transform the red clay of the Italian Open into the gore-streaked red of the Colosseum in the reign of Commodus. Speaking of gladiators, the world would be a far duller place without the kind of post-fight interview in which Mike Tyson, deranged by his own badness, said he wanted not only to rip Lennox Lewis’s heart out but to “eat his children”. Boxing, this reminds us, is a world apart from other sports. For Joyce Carol Oates, in fact, it’s not a sport at all, let alone a game: one plays football or tennis, she wrote, “one doesn’t play boxing”. Tyson’s mentor and trainer, Cus D’Amato, made sure that there was no relief, in any situation, from the dread inspired by his fearsome charge. While an aura of invincibility is a valuable asset for a tennis player – a constantly unsettling reminder that he can come back from two sets and a break down – this is entirely compatible with WH Auden’s claim that it’s better to be “liked than dreaded”. So when Stephen Tignor, in his book High Strung, writes that encounters between Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe “were knife fights”, one must politely demur: “No, they were tennis matches. Even when things turn ugly, the amount of physical contact between tennis players is minimal, as when Lukas Rosol shoulder-barged Andy Murray during a changeover in Munich in 2015. “No one likes you on the tour,” came Murray’s hardly Tysonian response once they were back at opposite ends of the playground. “Everyone hates you.” Relatively speaking, then, the man everyone loves really blew his lid in the course of losing to Juan Martín del Potro at Indian Wells in March when, in the words of an academic colleague of mine: “Roger started acting like a little bitch.” That’s true, but, given the intensity of competition, the surprising thing is that there have not been more on-court eruptions of the kind that punctuated Federer’s teenage years and which came almost to shape the tennis personality in the heyday of McEnroe and Connors. It could be said that it’s easy to keep your cool when you are the best in the world, but it’s equally true that the vast world beyond the tennis court – or film set, recording studio or concert hall – offers the eminent unfettered opportunities to reveal their true colours. Hence the plea of celebrities caught behaving horribly: “That wasn’t me” – ie, it may have been me, but it wasn’t the real me. Susan Sontag and VS Naipaul, to give them credit, gave free rein to their manifest awfulness. Both believed that the seriousness of their literary vocation demanded immunity from any of the normal claims of decent behaviour routinely exemplified by Wolff, universally ranked more highly than Sontag as a writer of fiction, and Federer. Alongside his tennis skills, the latter’s marketable niceness has turned into a nice little earner. Just as Roger was contractually obliged to be clean-shaven when sponsored by Gillette, so his brand depends on his being seen to be nice. In the privacy of his home or hotel, does he hurl his eggs across the room if they are not poached quite to his liking? Does he plunge into a day-long sulk if his wife, Mirka, even mentions Rafa’s biceps or tucks into his stash of Lindt chocolates? We don’t know, but it seems that being nice – which must have been part of his basic disposition – has also become a habit by virtue of behaving nice. (I put it like that because, in tennis-speak, there are no adverbs; one does not serve well or powerfully, only “big” or “great”.) Putting added spin on John Updike’s line about celebrity – “a mask that eats into the face” – the image has imprinted itself on the psyche. This is a love letter, obviously, but it could be from almost anyone. Roger has become one of the most beloved people on the planet. He’s not an intellectual but he is the tennis player adored by artists and intellectuals. He’s not especially good-looking – that nose of his would probably not look much worse if he’d been in the ring with Tyson – but the beauty of his game both envelops him in gorgeousness and tempts us into assuming that he must have a great appreciation of beauty in everything. This is not the case. He’s just a tennis player, after all. What certainly seems true is that the more we love him, the nicer he becomes. It’s like the concept of darshan in Hinduism, whereby we are blessed by being able to see the gods who, as a result of our seeing them, become more god-like. On a personal level, I feel sure we’d hit it off if we could hang out together. I’ve got a great sense of humour, too, Roger. I was only joking about that nose. It’s a great nose, it suits you: as Jack Nicholson says in Chinatown, I’m sure you like breathing through it. More to the point, if you’re as nice as everyone says, surely you can get me into your box for this year’s Wimbledon final. Actually, just in case you don’t make it that far, could we say the quarters? Geoff Dyer’s latest book, The Street Philosophy of Garry Winogrand, is published by the University of Texas Press.

His exploration of the development of things such as the dessert course, or the mechanics of plumbing, in his groundbreaking Life in the English Country House (1978) underpins a lot of the information you’ll come across if you visit a historical house. Of course, since it was first published, historians’ interests have broadened out from the stately pile to a whole range of dwellings, from workers’ houses to the streetscapes you might find in living history museums. But do you have a lingering feeling that constitutional or diplomatic history is more serious, more worthy? Well the personal is the political, a point made, at the same time as Girouard was writing, in the wildly popular and highly influential novel by Marilyn French, The Women’s Room (1977). I cannot erase from my mind French’s astonishingly realistic re-creation of the heroine Mira’s terrible, turgid housework routine. Many a feminist-in-waiting had their eyes opened by both the trials of Mira’s life and what she eventually did with it. She decided she’d had enough of housework and went off to study literature at university instead. I can imagine the decisions of 1970s women like her forming the case studies in a future version of Amanda Vickery’s landmark study of women’s lives in the 18th century, The Gentleman’s Daughter (1998). It delicately and movingly unpicks the ways in which the daughters of gentlemen had a bit more power – despite the restrictive Georgian clothing – than you might think to make decisions of their own. The Gentleman’s Daughter was based on the archival discoveries of a historian with an interest in material things. Meanwhile books in its wake, such as Eleri Lynn’s Tudor Fashion (2017), turn round the telescope to work outwards from the surviving objects of the past. The book gathers and analyses some amazing survivals of 16th-century textiles, and then goes on to use replicas to illustrate exactly how each garment should be worn and accessorised, and what it signified. It’s a book that’s in daily use here at Tudor Towers. Finally, fancy reading a published primary source full of detail about eating pease pudding, doing the laundry, having piles and a literate pig? After you have devoured the obvious starting point of the journals of Samuel Pepys, graduate to the less well known record of James Woodforde’s country rectory life in Norfolk. In his The Diary of a Country Parson, 1758-1802, first published in the 1920s and reissued many times throughout the 20th century, literally almost nothing happens. But in Woodforde’s hands daily life is magically made fascinating. Jane Austen at Home by Lucy Worsley is available in paperback (Hodder &amp; Stoughton)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/shortcuts/2018/jun/11/jobbymoon-honeymoons-babymoons-career-move-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T16:44:38Z","webTitle":"Would you like a jobbymoon?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/shortcuts/2018/jun/11/jobbymoon-honeymoons-babymoons-career-move-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/shortcuts/2018/jun/11/jobbymoon-honeymoons-babymoons-career-move-holiday","fields":{"headline":"Would you like a jobbymoon?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Name: Jobbymoon. Age: The coinage is new, if the thing is not. Appearance: To the untrained eye, a holiday. Is it not a holiday? It’s like a holiday, but different. What is it then? To be honest, it’s an allegedly emerging trend with an ill-advised name. I was going to say: whatever it is, it sounds disgusting. Sounds disgusting – feels great! Well, I remain unconvinced ... Actually, it just means taking a vacation after leaving a job, and before starting a new one, according to the New York Times. Why would you call that a jobbymoon? Because it is a relaxing break on the cusp of a life-changing event, like a honeymoon. Or a babymoon. Babymoon? What is a babymoon? It’s a a vacation you take before you become a parent. I’m sorry, but isn’t this just people going away and giving it a weird name? Not at all. In a busy world where employees are so overworked they routinely fail to take the holiday time they are entitled to, a jobbymoon presents a unique opportunity to review achievements and reassess priorities. That sounds like work to me. The jobbymoon is not to be confused with the bizcation, where one mixes business and pleasure in a way that is potentially not relaxing at all. So it’s more about being unemployed somewhere else. The downtime is important, but you have got to set goals or it is not a proper jobbymoon. One jobbymooner, who was interviewed, said she focused on four objectives: “Chill out, get rid of my eye twitch, eat as much local cuisine as possible and define what I want next in life.” What did she want next in life? To be the director of experience at a toothbrush startup. I really don’t know what that means, but I’ve got a potential sacking on my horizon. Where should I go? It doesn’t matter where you go, or how long you go for, as long as you’re marking the point between leaving one path and starting down another. If I only do a long weekend, can I call it a half-moon? You certainly may. If I also use the time to indulge in my passion in trainspotting, can I call it a hobbymoon? That’s the spirit. Make up any stupid name you want. There’s no governing body. Do say: “I went to Bali for a fortnight, and I realised that my only goals in life were a load of big jobs.” Don’t say: “When I first came back from jobbymooning I had decided to retrain as a lion tamer, but then I got the credit card bill from my trip and now I will literally work for food.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2018/jun/13/students-10-top-tips-for-picking-a-law-school","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T10:24:46Z","webTitle":"Students’ 10 top tips for picking a law school","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jun/13/students-10-top-tips-for-picking-a-law-school","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/jun/13/students-10-top-tips-for-picking-a-law-school","fields":{"headline":"Students’ 10 top tips for picking a law school","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1 Always go to the open day Lauren Marisa Howard, 20, is studying law at Northumbria University “Although every university’s prospectus makes the place sound fantastic, they may differ in real life. A campus described as a “stone’s throw away from town” could in fact be a 20-minute walk along a busy road. You won’t know unless you see for yourself.” 2 Consider employability opportunities Kristin Klungtveit, 21, is studying law at University of East Anglia “Law schools across the country prioritise employability differently. My advice is to check out the opportunities the law society at each offers – including any volunteering like Streetlaw or the Innocence Project. Law is becoming an extremely competitive field and any practical experience will distinguish you from the other candidates.” 3 Choose a course that offers ‘something extra’ Ali Chaudhry, 19, is studying law at Royal Holloway, University of London “Whether it combines law with your love of the French language, or allows you to use a year to work in industry, consider somewhere that offers you that little bit more than a standard law degree. There are qualifying degrees that combine a language, the humanities or a year gaining work experience.” 4 Ask current law students Sarah Wilkinson, 21, is studying law at University of Brighton “Current students give the best advice. They’ll be the most honest about the course and what your social life might look like. You might find you can also join the university’s Facebook page and ask some questions on there.” 5 Optional modules can make or break a good law school David Mant, 24, is completing the graduate diploma in law at the University of Law “To pass the LLB, there are a number of modules you have to pass. However, there is also scope outside of these to pick a module of interest. Optional modules can improve your grades and your wider understanding of the law. But sometimes they can be time-consuming and difficult. So choose wisely.” 6 What facilities do they have? Ina France Monponbanua, 19, is studying law at the University of Sheffield “Being an aspiring barrister, my university’s moot court in the heart of the law school was a game changer. It showed me that the department wasn’t solely focused on academia, but also practical skills, which mooting definitely helps with.” 7 Focus on your weaknesses Cameron Haden, 24, is a law and politics graduate from the University of Essex, with a place to study the LLM at City, University of London “University is about developing new skills. When deciding where is best for you, know that success depends not on the institution but on you, so pick somewhere which can cultivate the skills you know you need to work on. I picked City because it’s well regarded in its approach to conventional legal reasoning, a topic I myself struggle with.” 8 Location, location, location Adelle Yii, 21, is studying law at University College London “Know what kind of environment you like to study or live in. Having grown up in Singapore and later in Wales, I realised I wanted to study in a bustling city. If you like having all your amenities around you in one area, then a campus suit you better.” 9 Look closely at how you’ll be assessed Samantha Phey, 22, is studying law (jurisprudence) at the University of Oxford “Look at examination schedules – for example, completing 100% of your exams in your final year at Oxford, which leaves second year free for finding work experience and employment after university. Or you might prefer a focus on coursework. Some universities teach more theory while others are more practical..” 10 Think about your next move Alicia Gibson, 21, is studying law at Newcastle University “As an aspiring lawyer, you can start to think about your career before you pick a law school.

A patent application from the company, revealed this week, outlines a system that would be able to identify if someone is displaying uncharacteristic behaviour by looking at small changes in their behaviour as they use the Uber app. The patent includes a list of potential data Uber could use to determine an app user’s level of inebriation. This includes walking speed, unusual typos made while inputting a ride request, the angle at which a user holds the phone and whether the phone is swaying. While the patent application doesn’t spell out that the proposed tool would be used to identify if someone is drunk or on drugs – it refers instead to “‘predicting user state using machine learning” and “uncharacteristic user states” – that would be the most likely interpretation. If the theoretical AI system does detect that someone is acting in an unusual way it will tailor Uber’s services accordingly. The patent application suggests ways Uber might tailor its services, such as directing users to a better-lit pickup point, for example, or matching users with a driver who has been trained to deal with drunk passengers. Uber says it may also use the technology to prevent users from pooling with other passengers. While working on special safety measures for intoxicated passengers sounds helpful, the patent application shines a light on the scope of Uber’s current data collection methods, and poses questions about the potential for data like this to be abused. The startup very publicly turned over a new leaf with the resignation of the scandal-ridden co-founder Travis Kalanick and the appointment of Dara Khosrowshahi as CEO last year, but it has a murky history when it comes to its customer data. Uber’s notorious “God View” tool, for example, which showed the location of users who had requested a car, was abused by employees to track the location of their exes as well as monitor celebrities and politicians, according to an October 2016 court declaration by Uber’s former forensic investigator, Samuel Ward Spangenberg. There’s also the worry that the system might put drunk users in danger. According to a recent CNN investigation, at least 103 Uber drivers in the US have been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers in the past four years, and many of these victims were drunk. And a tool like this could be misused when it comes to charging customers. Uber’s pricing strategy is something of a black box; nobody knows exactly how their algorithm works, but the company does seem to have a lot of insights about when its customers are likely to pay more. In 2016, for example, a behavioral scientist at Uber said that the company knew that people were more willing to pay a higher fare when their phone batteries were low, but was careful to say that they “absolutely don’t use that” information. One imagines that drunk passengers are also likely to be less cautious about how much money they’re spending. There is no evidence that Uber’s patent application is anything other than theoretical at the moment. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But there’s nothing to say they’re not already analysing this data. Uber has not said whether it are collecting this kind of data already, but the company has not been adverse to building user profiles in the past. In 2014 Uber used passenger data to demonstrate which US city had the highest incidence of one-night stands"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/11/patrick-vieira-new-york-city-fc-nice-mls","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T15:52:31Z","webTitle":"Patrick Vieira leaves NYC FC with his – and MLS's – reputation enhanced","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/11/patrick-vieira-new-york-city-fc-nice-mls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/11/patrick-vieira-new-york-city-fc-nice-mls","fields":{"headline":"Patrick Vieira leaves NYC FC with his – and MLS's – reputation enhanced","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The tributes started long before Patrick Vieira had officially departed as head coach of New York City FC. In the wake of Saturday’s 1-1 draw against Atlanta United, David Villa, a man whose endorsement carries weight, talked about the “identity” that Vieira had cultivated during his two-and-a-half-years at the club, before discussing the need to maintain that course. Talk of Vieira’s impact continued late on Sunday night when news broke accidentally via Manchester City’s website that he had chosen to continue his career back in Europe with OGC Nice, following weeks of speculation. The begrudging acceptance from NYC FC supporters shows just how well Vieira has done during his spell in the Bronx. There was a large dose of skepticism when NYC FC – who had just finished their debut season by missing the playoffs – appointed Vieira as their head coach in November 2015. Traditionally, European coaches have not flourished in MLS, especially those who arrive without experience of the league and its unique mechanisms. Terms such as allocation money and the SuperDraft are befuddling to those coaches not used to a salary cap. When addressing such concerns in January 2016, Vieira displayed his usual blend of calm assertiveness. “This is the reason why I need to have [director of football operations] Claudio [Reyna] next to me to get me more into details of the rules in this country,” Vieira said. He also pushed back against his doubters by building a clear tactical identity for the team. Initially, the World Cup winner wanted his players to be comfortable on the ball, to play through teams, and ultimately to entertain. That style drove NYC FC to second in the Eastern Conference in both of Vieira’s first two seasons, but that success was cast alongside disappointing playoff defeats to Toronto FC, in 2016, and to the Columbus Crew SC, in 2017. Vieira accepted the need for further change and began to impose his will. During his second season, he phased Andrea Pirlo out of the starting XI as he sought a younger, more dynamic, team. He continued towards that goal this season and worked with City Football Group’s global scouting network to recruit a string of players under the age of 25. Just as the starting line-up began to change so too did the team’s tactics. This season NYC FC have pressed opponents high up the field, and while they still prefer to play possession football, they are now also able to be direct and transition the ball quickly from defence to attack. That evolution is why they once again sit second in the Eastern Conference, a long way from where Vieira inherited them. The Frenchman’s reign had its faults though. Vieira could be tactically stubborn. This presented itself most notably against the New York Red Bulls, whose style is reminiscent of Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool side, and troubled NYC FC and Vieira consistently. Vieira won three and drew one of the nine matches he contested against NYC FC’s cross-city rivals. While on the surface that appears an acceptable record, he lost his first meeting 7-0 at Yankee Stadium, and suffered a 4-1 defeat later that same season. He followed that up with three more defeats, two of which were by a scoreline of 4-0, including the most recent fixture last week. It would, however, be unfair to claim a poor derby record as the legacy of Vieira’s New York tenure. He inherited a team that had endured a poor first season in MLS. Not only had they finished down the league, but Frank Lampard’s decision to skip the first few months of the season to stay with Manchester City drained the enthusiasm of supporters. From there Vieira built the club an ethos, improved individuals, and ushered in the first handful of academy players. Vieira dispelled the notion that European coaches cannot thrive in MLS, and now he must go against convention again. MLS boasts a handful of promising young coaches, mostly American, and although Jesse Marsch has been linked with a move to RB Leipzig this summer, Vieira is the first of this new generation with an MLS foundation to coach in a top European league. And if he can bring that same blend of leadership and identity to the French Riviera it may change the way people view MLS. Nice represent a tough proposition, however. The club finished third in Ligue 1 in 2016-17 and qualified for the Champions League. Their form dipped last season as they finished eighth, with both leading scorer Mario Balotelli and midfielder Jean Michaël Seri expected to leave this summer. That gives Vieira the chance to build something new and exciting, as his mentor Arsène Wenger did when he arrived from a less-heralded competition, the J-League, to take over Arsenal in 1996. Comparisons between the two may seem a stretch, but what is certain, is that Vieira leaves New York having changed both his reputation and that of the league he left behind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/jun/11/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T20:00:29Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/11/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jun/11/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• The picture accompanying our review of Doug Stanhope at London’s Brixton Academy was of his fellow comedian Glenn Wool, who was on stage before Stanhope (11 June, page 13, G2). • We referred to “a brace of Tory MPs” who liked a model that would keep the UK in the single market.

But the overlooked clause in his property’s deeds has led to the Bury midfielder facing large legal bills and threatened with eviction. Ismail’s story is rare – but terrifying. He bought his home outright, and settled down to family life with his partner and young daughter. The first time the 24-year-old saw the word “rentcharge” was when he received a solicitor’s letter in December 2017 incorrectly describing him as “a tenant”. After a call, an amended letter arrived in January this year entitled “Outstanding rentcharges and fees” and included an invoice for backdated charges of £112.51, £3.61 interest, £240 for two letters, and solicitor’s fees of £480. The letter stated that if the total bill of £836.12 wasn’t settled within 21 days, the client “intends to either re-enter the property or grant a lease in respect of the property”. It went on to say that either would have “a detrimental impact on the value of your property and may result in our client applying for a possession order, and, ultimately, obtaining an eviction in respect of the property”. The “client” concerned was the managing agent responsible for maintaining the communal parts of Ismail’s estate: the charge related to cutting the grass verges. The letter added that if Ismail didn’t pay, he would also be liable for the managing agent’s costs of between £3,000 and £5,000. The letter referred to “a lease”, despite the footballer owning the freehold. Ismail assumed the letter was a mistake. It wasn’t. “Rentcharges” (or “chief rents”) are a relic from the past. Despite the similar terminology, they are nothing to do with renting, or leasehold ground rents. Most originated in the 19th and early 20th century, and were a popular way for owners to sell land to developers at a reduced fee. The subsequent freehold owners would pay an annual fee, typically £2 to £10, for ever. The Rentcharges Act 1977 meant that, with some exceptions, no new charges could be created after 22 August 1977, and existing ones were capped so they would expire in 2037. Unfortunately for the buyers of new-build freehold properties, “estate rentcharges” are one of the permitted exceptions. By using a “deed of transfer”, developers can oblige freeholders to pay a “rentcharge” or “estate charge” for the maintenance of communal areas of a private estate. With both, it’s not the money that is of the most concern, but the powerful legal rights the “rentowner” – the person who receives the payments – has to recover sums due. In some cases, these include taking possession of the property and using the income to clear the arrears. Or granting a lease of the property to trustees to raise any money due. These rights arise if the charge remains unpaid for more than 40 days, even if payment has not been demanded. Ismail’s partner’s mother, Tracey Atkinson, agreed to act as an advocate for him. She says: “The first communication he had about the charge was a threat of eviction from the solicitors. This had a huge detrimental effect. They were threatening eviction over a bill that was never received and the charges were all added on prior to the invoice dated 17 December 2017. “I told him to pay the outstanding charges and said I would deal with the legal fees. The solicitors refused to accept a part payment and the rest, as they say, is history.” In Ismail’s case, Bellway, which built his estate, maintains control over its management company. SDL Property Management collects the “rentcharge”. It then instructs another firm of solicitors to pursue unpaid charges. Ismail’s charges were £37.50 every six months but it emerged the bills were addressed to the previous owners and it remains unclear whose responsibility it was to update the managing agent’s records. SDL says: “When Mr Ismail bought this property in 2015 we were not made aware by him, his solicitors, the seller’s solicitors or the seller, that the property had been sold. For this reason, the request for payment of the estate charge was sent and addressed to the previous owner. “After receiving no response, a Land Registry search was obtained and we discovered the property had been sold. We then sent the invoice to Mr Ismail but received no response. “After sending two further reminders with no response, we followed standard procedure and instructed our solicitors to collect the debt on our behalf. “Eviction was only mentioned as an absolute last resort and this was made clear in the letter. There was no ‘threat to evict’ – it is our responsibility to tell debtors the consequences of them failing to pay.” Ismail has paid the charge and, after pressure from Atkinson, SDL has quashed the solicitor’s fees “as a gesture of goodwill” and rescinded the court action letter. How to tell if there is a charge The charge would usually be on a property’s “register of title” held at the Land Registry. This will tell you how much it is and details of the document that created it, but not always who it is payable to. “It will specify what happens if it is not paid. Typically, that the owner of the charge is entitled to interest on outstanding rent and, at worst, take possession of the property for non-payment. “However, in reality, that is unlikely, as a court order would be required,” says Anna Sparrow, solicitor at Slater and Gordon. “Unscrupulous owners could, in theory, not demand rent and then charge late-payment fees and solicitors’ costs. So it is imperative to ensure it is paid.” “Variable rentcharges” are more commonly found on newer developments to cover maintaining communal areas. Typically, this would have to be obtained from either the original transfer deed imposing it or the seller and company collecting the charges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/29/revealed-how-us-sex-traffickers-recruit-jailed-women-for-prostitution-the-trap","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-29T06:00:29Z","webTitle":"Revealed: how US sex traffickers recruit jailed women for prostitution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/29/revealed-how-us-sex-traffickers-recruit-jailed-women-for-prostitution-the-trap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/29/revealed-how-us-sex-traffickers-recruit-jailed-women-for-prostitution-the-trap","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: how US sex traffickers recruit jailed women for prostitution","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Women in prisons across the US are being recruited by sex traffickers who force them into prostitution on their release. A Guardian investigation has found that traffickers are using government websites to obtain personal information including mugshots, release dates and charge sheets to identify potential victims while they are still behind bars. Pimps also use inmates in prisons and jails countrywide to befriend incarcerated women who, on their release, are trafficked into the $9.5bn (£7.2bn) US commercial sex industry. The investigation also found cases of the bail bond system being used in sex trafficking operations in at least five different states. Pimps and sex buyers are locating incarcerated women awaiting a court date by using personal data such as mugshots and bail bonds posted online, or through corrupt bondsmen. Traffickers are then bailing women out of detention. Once released, the women are told they must work as prostitutes or have their bond rescinded and be sent back to jail. Over the course of the investigation, The Guardian found cases of the bail bond system being used by pimps and sex buyers in Florida, Texas, Ohio, North Carolina and Mississippi. “The pimps would use bail as a way to control us and keep us in debt bondage,” said one trafficking survivor from Tampa, Florida. She claimed she was forced to work as a prostitute to pay off her bail debt and locked inside a house and beaten if she didn’t bring home enough money. “Once when I tried to escape, the pimp revoked my bond. He found me, threw me in a car and got me sent back to jail,” she said. Diane Checchio, a former prosecutor for the district attorney’s office in Orlando, Florida, said the bail bond system was routinely exploited by traffickers. Up to 80% of the trafficking cases she worked on in 2016 involved bondsmen found to be illegally passing on information about women arrested on prostitution charges to suspected traffickers. “Sometimes women are released not knowing who bonded them out or why, or what they’ve gotten into, and now they’re being coerced,” Checchio said. “They come out of jail and there’s someone waiting saying: ‘I posted your bond – now you owe me’ … [They will] threaten to rescind that bond if the girls don’t do what they’re asked or told to do. It’s still happening now.” Checchio said traffickers were likely to be targeting women involved in the criminal justice system across the country. “I would find it very likely that this is happening in every state that has women’s records online,” she said. Once they have identified a potential target inside a prison or jail, traffickers will try to establish a relationship by using letters, phone calls and promises of money and housing when the victim is released. Prison bank accounts are also used to send money to women, establishing a debt that is used to coerce them into prostitution on their release. “When I was in prison [in Ohio] I had pimps I knew from the streets, and men I had never met, writing to me to try and convince me to go home with them,” said Amy Williams*, who was incarcerated in state prisons and county jails in Ohio over a 15-year period. “Some of us knew what we were going back into but didn’t feel we had any other choice, as they’d be waiting for us anyway. Other girls I knew had no idea that they would be put on the streets by this person.” Pimp-controlled prostitution is now recognised as one of the most brutal and pervasive forms of human trafficking in the US. Trafficking is defined under US federal and international law as when a person is induced to perform labour or a commercial sex act through force, fraud or coercion. Over the course of the investigation, the Guardian gathered testimony from more than 20 trafficking survivors in 11 states across the country, as well as correctional officers, convicted sex traffickers, law enforcement officials, lawyers, prosecutors and frontline workers. All corroborated that prisons and jails were being used as recruiting grounds for human traffickers. There are currently 1.2 million women under the supervision of the criminal justice system in the US. Women now comprise a larger proportion of the prison population than ever before, with the number incarcerated eight times higher than in 1980. Many women are jailed for non-violent offences, with 25% incarcerated on drug-related charges. Many of the women interviewed had been jailed multiple times and had fallen in and out of the control of pimps over a period of years. A 2017 survey of 130 trafficking survivors by the National Survivor Network, an advocacy and campaigning group, found that 91% of respondents said they had been arrested not only for prostitution but also for the sale and possession of drugs and a range of other crimes. “Predators thrive off isolation and trauma, so prisons and jails are perfect hunting grounds because there you have a captive population of women who often have nowhere to go, and no support when they’re released,” said Nicole Bell, a trafficking survivor and founder of Living in Freedom Together, an anti-trafficking organisation in Massachusetts. “Now they have figured out how to work the system, these institutions have become like big fish bowls for traffickers. Incarceration takes vulnerable women and makes them more vulnerable,” she said. Anti-trafficking campaigners said correctional facilities must do more to prioritise the safety and protection of inmates and ensure staff understand the vulnerability of their institutions to human trafficking. “Our correctional facilities have a legal responsibility to protect the women who are under their charge,” said Marian Hatcher, a national anti-trafficking advocate and human trafficking coordinator at the Cook County sheriff’s office of public policy in Chicago. “If inmates are being targeted while inside our prisons and jails by predators, instead of being offered the chance of an alternative when they are released, then this is a systemic failing of our duty of care to some of our country’s most vulnerable women.” The US Department of Justice declined to comment. *Name changed to protect identity"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/12/drug-use-less-prevalent-among-students-than-thought-poll-suggests","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T23:01:34Z","webTitle":"Drug use less prevalent among students than thought, poll suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/12/drug-use-less-prevalent-among-students-than-thought-poll-suggests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/12/drug-use-less-prevalent-among-students-than-thought-poll-suggests","fields":{"headline":"Drug use less prevalent among students than thought, poll suggests","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A survey of illegal drug use among students has suggested it may not be as prevalent as indicated by earlier research, with almost three-quarters of those who took part claiming not to have used drugs at university. The small-scale survey conducted on behalf of the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi), a thinktank, raised the possibility that students may be more disapproving of drugs than previously thought. Of the 1,000 undergraduates who took part in the poll, 71% said they had not taken drugs, 88% thought drugs caused mental health problems, and 68% believed they led to problems for society and contributed to criminality. More than 60% said they would like their university to take a tougher stance on students who repeatedly use drugs, and the same proportion said they would like to see tougher action taken against drug dealers in higher education. In April, a study by the National Union of Students and the drugs information charity Release involving 3,000 students painted a somewhat different picture of student drug use, with 56% having used drugs at some point, while 39% said they were currently using substances. The latest survey, sponsored by Hepi and the University of Buckingham, and conducted by the research company YouthSight, found one-quarter of those who took part in the survey had taken drugs in the past year. Male students were more likely to have used drugs, with 68% of male respondents saying they had not used drugs, compared with 74% of female students. Of those who had used drugs, 6% said it was to cope with exam difficulties. About 40% said there was a problem with drugs at their university, but marginally more, 44%, said there was not. Hepi claimed the NUS/Release survey was targeted at specific groups such as Students for Sensible Drug Policy UK, which may have influenced its findings. Nick Hillman, the Hepi director, said the latest survey was “an important corrective to some of the wilder ideas about today’s students. They are more hardworking and less hedonistic than is often supposed”. Jess Bradley, the NUS trans officer, defended the union’s research. “While we do not claim our survey in April was a prevalence study or aimed to represent the views of all students, it is important to recognise almost three times more students participated in ours than in the survey released today by Hepi,” Bradley said. “The survey by Hepi is purely opinion-based, whereas we also sought to understand students’ experiences of drug use and the impact that has on their lives. Our survey was made available to all students, through all of our channels. Not just specific groups that hold a particular view on student drug use.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/11/trump-canada-relationship-us","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T16:32:06Z","webTitle":"Canada and America are cousins.

We don't stab each other in the back","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What has just happened to Canada? Bewilderment. Fear. Anger. Hurt. Canadians today are struggling to understand what Donald Trump has just done to us. We know the United States can be a bit strange at times and we have had our tricky moments. In the 19th century we didn’t much like the loud annexationist voices south of the border, or American support for Sinn Féin adventurers who thought by seizing the Canadian colonies they could force Britain out of Ireland. More recently our relations during the Vietnam war were strained because many Canadians opposed it, and said so, and Canada sheltered draft dodgers. President Lyndon Johnson once took our much smaller prime minister Lester Pearson by the lapels and shook him after the Canadian made a mildly critical speech at Temple University. President Nixon famously did not like Pierre Trudeau, whom he saw as a quiche-eating, sandal-wearing liberal. But, until now, we have got on pretty well. There was a temporary coolness when our government declined the invitation to join the coalition that invaded and occupied Iraq, but we did send troops to Afghanistan. Trudeau the elder, who had to deal with a bruised and truculent US during the 1970s, once said that Canada slept next to an elephant. Managing the relationship with a giant neighbour has been central to our foreign policy for more than a century. Trade and investment as well as people have flowed back and forth across the border, and the US is by far our biggest trading partner. And we are the Americans’, although most of them don’t know it. We welcomed the free trade agreement of the 1990s and its successor, Nafta. During the second world war, and then the cold war, the two countries worked closely together. Canada was a founding member of Nato and a strong supporter of the new international institutions such as the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank the Americans were setting up. Canadians fought in Korea alongside Americans. The early warning line for Soviet bombers and rockets was in the Canadian Arctic, and Norad, for the air and maritime defence of North America, is a completely integrated operation. There is much more to the relationship than security and trade. Canadians see the Americans as cousins. We love the same sports: Canadians are crazy about baseball and basketball, and our beloved game of hockey is played all over the US. For generations, Canadians have moved south in search of jobs, education and fame. A large part of Canada heads for Florida, California and Hawaii in the winter to get away from the snow. When the US endures disasters we sympathize. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11 Canadians opened their airfields and homes to the thousands of American planes and travellers who were stranded here. (In what seems to have been a vain attempt to win over the Trumps, Justin Trudeau took Ivanka and Jared to a cheery, feelgood musical about what happened when a plane bound for New York found itself in a remote Newfoundland village.) Our values, or so we used to think, are much the same. Yet over the past few decades a gap has been slowly opening. If we could vote in American presidential elections we would be around 80% Democrat. A recent poll showed that 70% of us disapproved of Donald Trump’s performance as president. Canadians by and large have no problem with same-sex marriage or abortion. We are legalizing marijuana. We have a comprehensive welfare system and what Americans, particularly on the right, call socialized medicine. We don’t get their reverence for guns. Our founding principle was not life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness but peace, order and good government. We have nevertheless worked hard to nurture the relationship with the US. Canadians have always known far more about the Americans than vice versa – which is why, among other things, we have tended to do well in trade negotiations and disputes. Americans tend to think we are just like them and so don’t bother to learn much about us. We have tended to prefer it that way until now. When Donald Trump was elected, our government, as its predecessors have always done, set out to establish friendly links with the new administration. As it became clear that it was difficult to find whom to talk to in the constantly churning cast of characters around Trump, we redoubled our efforts and made them bipartisan. The Trudeau government brought in the former Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney to advise them. Trudeau himself and his foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, made a point of getting alongside the new president and his advisers. The first Trump-Trudeau meeting seemed to go well enough but Trudeau held his ground in the famous Trump handshake. The Canadian prime minister is younger and much more handsome. Ageing alpha males don’t usually like that. And this one clearly didn’t. In the past few months increasingly testy growls have been emanating from the White House. Canada has a huge trade surplus with the US. (No matter that it doesn’t.) Canada cheats. Canada is a security threat which is why the US has to put tariffs in Canadian steel and aluminium. The Canadian government has politely disagreed. And Trudeau, in his now notorious press conference as Air Force One was heading to Singapore, repeated what he had already said: it is insulting to impose what are probably illegal tariffs on specious grounds. It is Trump’s reaction that should have us all extremely worried – Americans included. Their country is very powerful but power does not last for ever and the US is facing challenges, from China in particular. The US needs friends and partners. So when Trump calls the chief minister of one of his country’s most reliable friends “very dishonest and weak” he is clearly not putting the interests of the United States first. His sorry advisers have piled in, so eager to please the boss that they don’t care what further damage they do. Peter Navarro, the self-proclaimed expert on China who doesn’t speak much Chinese, talks about a stab in the back. (Where have we heard that one before?) Larry Kudlow – the economist with the record of wrong predictions and the one who used to oppose Trump’s tariffs – exclaims that disagreeing with Trump on the eve of the summit with Kim Jong-un is undermining. “Kim must not see American weakness.” So that is now the role of American allies – to shower praise on the Great Leader just as his cabinet did in that shameful televised meeting last June. The Trump administration is throwing away with both hands the soft power, the moral authority and the network of relationships that have served the US well. Trump himself seems far more comfortable with authoritarian regimes such as Russia, the Philippines or Saudi Arabia than he does with older friends such as Britain, France or Germany. The G7 was a useful meeting place for like-minded nations. It is probably done for. What next? Nato? The IMF? World Bank? World Trade Organization? The United States is shattering an international order – economic but also political – that has served the world and the US itself well. Poor Canada and poor world too.

I was fat and borderline repulsive, but these traits had forced me to try and become funny. (I wasn’t witty or talented; I was merely willing to abandon all dignity in order to gain approval.) After one break time, during which I felt I had been on top comedic form, I plucked up the courage to approach Sarah and ask her if she’d want to hang out. She laughed and said, “Very funny, Rom.” Our relative aesthetics meant that the very idea she might want to go out with me had to be a punchline. My only solace was to hope that Sarah’s life might progress as a series of awful failures, escalating to the point where she ended up destitute in the gutter, crying and wondering where it had all gone wrong, before wiping the tears from her eyes, looking to the sky and thinking, “I wish I had gone out with that fat Asian kid at school.” My school days have been very much back at the forefront of my mind while watching Love Island, the hit TV show full of Sarah Campbells. The extreme popularity of this programme is being hailed by many as the greatest ongoing threat to modern civilisation, as if we weren’t simultaneously dealing with the very real possibility of nuclear war. I haven’t seen too much of it, but what I have gathered is this: some incredibly attractive people are dropped off on an island and then have to pair up, drink lukewarm prosecco and have sex until, one by one, they are asked to leave. Essentially, this show is what happens when a TV producer is off their tits on a night out in Faliraki and suddenly thinks, “I reckon this might be a TV format.” It is a voyeur’s dream. But social commentators have become very upset, claiming that Love Island heralds a dumbing down of society, and that the record viewing figures suggest the imminent arrival of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. People have fixated on the fact that, last year, more people applied to Love Island than to Oxford and Cambridge, completely ignoring the fact that Love Island has much lower grade requirements and all you have to say in your personal statement is, “I very much enjoy the sex.” It is always interesting to see what the cultural elite deem appropriate for consumption by the masses, while simultaneously dismissing the masses as savages. Why do they find Love Island, in particular, so offensive? There are many shows that partner people up (First Dates, Love In The Countryside) and are not labelled the end of humanity. Even shows such as Big Brother, while divisive, don’t tend to make it on to Question Time, where the panel last week debated whether the Oxbridge stat was “a fair reflection on our society”. The answer seems fairly obvious to me: we don’t want Love Island to be popular because all the contestants are hot. They have gorgeous, sculpted bodies with single-digit body fat percentages and hair that moves only in strict adherence to a preordained choreography. They look like every person who ignored you at school – the kind of people you see at the beach and then feel forced to keep your T-shirt on when you go into the sea. The beautiful people. The problem is that nobody ever admits this. Instead, they dress up their resentment as an anxiety about the demise of British culture and the state of the country’s youth. This is a lie: it is intellectual elitism. What I want to see is a think piece on Love Island in which the columnist simply admits, “I hate Love Island because it reminds me I have a dad bod.” Also, why is Oxbridge heralded as the yardstick by which young people should be measured? In order to get into those universities, you take your gifts and you work incredibly hard to maximise the potential of those gifts, until you achieve the hard-earned results that are not accessible to everybody. And that sounds a lot like the process required to attain a set of visible abs. We all seem blind to the fact that the type of people who get into Oxbridge benefit from fantastic genes every bit as much as somebody whose face demonstrates perfect mathematical symmetry. (This is all, of course, before we even get into discussing the inequities of the Oxbridge application system.) Love Island is not for me, nor would I ever want to be at a swimming pool near any of the contestants without having on three layers of clothing. But it’s a great thing that the show exists, and that people enjoy it: they should not be judged for doing so. Gogglebox, however, is still absolute crap. *Name left unchanged so that people can know she rejected me. Hadley Freeman is away.

The prime minister faces a knife-edge result on an amendment to give parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal as Tory remainers threatened to support the change, brought in by peers, and Labour rallied all but its most pro-Brexit MPs behind it. Several leading Tory rebels told the Guardian they were not yet satisfied with the changes proposed by ministers on the meaningful vote, despite senior government figures saying they were confident of getting them through. However, a damaging potential government defeat over the customs union was averted after Downing Street sources said they would back an alternative amendment on the proposal for “a” customs union, tabled by backbenchers Nicky Morgan, a remainer, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, a leading Brexiter. The controversial issue, which has threatened to divide the Tory party, has now been kicked down the road until two trade bills, which contain amendments that would keep the UK’s current customs arrangements with the EU, return to the Commons in July. One Tory MP warned that the “big battle” was yet to come. The prime minister told Tory MPs at a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee, attended by ministers including chancellor Philip Hammond and Brexit secretary David Davis, that defeats over the Brexit bill would undermine her negotiating position with Brussels. “We must think about the message parliament will send to the European Union this week. I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain,” she told the packed room. “I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible. But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.” After the meeting, solicitor general Robert Buckland appealed for party unity. “There’s ongoing work happening and I think it’s emblematic, actually, of a real sense of common purpose in the party that we all hang together or we all hang separately,” he said. The House of Lords sent 15 amendments to the EU withdrawal bill back to MPs, one of which the government has accepted while offering compromises on three others. Downing Street insiders believe they can see off defeats on the rest, although they hinted that talks were ongoing on the meaningful vote. The meaningful vote amendment would put the decision on what to do if the government’s final divorce deal was rejected by MPs into the hands of the Commons. It aims to avoid MPs facing a choice between the government’s deal or no deal, but Brexiters fear it could lead to a second referendum. Ministers have offered a promise to make a statement to the Commons, rather than an actual vote. Labour whips believe they have convinced all but the most hardline of their Brexit-backing MPs to support the amendment, increasing the chances that the government will be defeated. In December, Jeremy Corbyn intervened personally to persuade Brexiters including Dennis Skinner to back the original Dominic Grieve amendment, which the Lords has sought to strengthen. Grieve, who led the charge on the meaningful vote last December, confirmed that he had tabled a compromise amendment ahead of today’s debate. He told BBC Newsnight that the meaningful vote remained “an issue of difficulty” but that his proposal had the capacity to “bridge the gap” between different wings of the party and may even be acceptable to the government. However, he warned that if ministers failed to accept his amendment, which included more detail on what the government should do in the event of no deal, he would vote against the prime minister on the issue. Several of the leading Tory remainers who helped inflict May’s only Commons defeat on Brexit, when they backed a legal guarantee of a vote on the final deal in December, insisted their support should not be taken for granted. Former chancellor Ken Clarke told the Guardian he remained determined to back the meaningful vote amendment. “It will mean that parliament will have a decisive say on the broad nature of the final deal, and without it, parliament will be marginalised,” he said. He pointed to last week’s standoff between May and her pro-leave Brexit secretary, David Davis, as evidence that Downing Street risks being pushed around by the Brexiters. “Without our involvement, the government will face the same situation it faced last week, when the final agreement comes round, because the Brexiters will give threats and briefings against any deal unless they’re satisfied with it. They will have a veto, and parliament will have no effective control.” Jonathan Djanogly, the Conservative MP for Huntingdon, said: “There remain serious issues to be debated and the government line that the rebels have been silenced or placated is simply not true.” Sarah Wollaston, MP for Totnes and chair of the Commons health select committee, said she was “minded” to support the Lords amendment on giving parliament a meaningful vote on the exit deal, and called for “further concessions” on the customs union. “We would like to see further concessions on the amendment on the customs union because it is just a very sensible amendment that says keep it on the table, don’t completely rule it out,” she told the BBC. At least two more Tory remainers told the Guardian they were planning to rebel against the government again, despite whips warning that it could be counterproductive ahead of the key Brussels summit later this month. One said that the updated amendment tabled by ministers on the meaningful vote went some long way towards addressing concerns but warned the issue was still “exercising a lot of people”, in particular over what might follow if the government failed to get a deal at all. The Tory MP added: “If there are no more changes I think the rebellion will be quite big. Most people are very firm. Any defeat suffered by a government is never helpful and clearly there is a European council but I think there is a heavy element of normal whips’ tactics there, which I don’t think people will be that susceptible to.” Another potential rebel said it would be “pathetic” if parliament was bought off with the promise of a statement after 28 days. “The statement may say we’re leaving without a deal, and it might say: ‘get lost.’” The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, urged Tory rebels to stay the course, saying the next few days would be the most important week for Brexit since the triggering of article 50. “After months of dithering, delay and government splits, there is a chance for parliament decisively to shape the course of the negotiations,” he wrote in the Guardian. “A chance for parliament to have its voice heard. We must get it right.” Starmer dismissed government concession on the issue, saying it would, “turn the meaningful vote into a meaningless vote”, and was “not good enough.” Meanwhile, the EU said that May’s customs plan would create a hard border in Ireland, carrying “serious risks of fraud”, lack of governance and controls of standards. In 11 pages of slides comparing the May and EU proposals for the Irish border, the European commission said “key questions [are] unanswered”; and that May’s plan “does not cover regulatory controls, leading to a hard border”. On tariffs, the EU said there would be issues with collection and allocation of revenue and the definition of the origin of products under strict rules of origin protocols. On VAT it said the UK plan would lead to “piecemeal application” of the rules and post “serious risks of fraud” on a significant source of revenue for member states."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/27/supreme-court-unions-fair-share-ruling","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-27T14:53:46Z","webTitle":"Supreme court strikes blow against unions with 'fair share' ruling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/27/supreme-court-unions-fair-share-ruling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/27/supreme-court-unions-fair-share-ruling","fields":{"headline":"Supreme court strikes blow against unions with 'fair share' ruling","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The supreme court dealt a huge blow to organized labor on Wednesday, ruling that non-union members no longer have to pay their “fair share” for union representation in collective bargaining negotiations. The closely watched case – Janus v AFSCME – could permanently weaken public unions, according to some experts, and will impact public sector employees in 22 states. In a 5-4 decision the court overturned a previous decision that had protected the right of public sector unions to collect administrative fees from non-members, ruling it was inconsistent with the first amendment right to free speech. Without that protection, unions may not only lose fees from non-members but also lose members who are happy with the union’s work but do not want to pay for it. Rightwing activists, who have long campaigned for the decision, are already preparing a nationwide drive to persuade public sector trade unions to stop paying dues following the decision. Donald Trump celebrated the decision on Twitter, writing: “Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!” Unions are major donors to the Democratic party. Lee Saunders, AFSCME president, called the ruling a “unprecedented and nefarious political attack – designed to further rig the rules against working people”. The decision fell along political lines and is a major win for conservatives who had campaigned to elect right wing justice Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court, one of Donald Trump’s first acts in office. In a dissenting opinion justice Elena Kagan warned the decision “will have large-scale consequences. Public employee unions will lose a secure source of financial support”. She said the decision was the culmination of a six-year campaign to overturn legal precedent. “Rarely if ever has the court overruled a decision – let alone one of this import – with so little regard for the usual principles of stare decisis [the legal principle of determining points in litigation according to precedent],” she wrote. The case was brought by Mark Janus, a child support specialist at the Illinois department of healthcare and family services. Janus is represented by the AFSCME union. Although he is not a union member, 78% of full union dues are deducted from his paycheck. Non-union public sector workers in more than 20 states pay unions for collective bargaining and unions in those states will lose fees from hundreds of thousands of nonmembers as a result. The ruling overturns a 1977 supreme court decision, Abood v Detroit board of education, which ruled that public sector unions could charge non-members fees for “collective bargaining, contract administration and grievance adjustment purposes”. That decision – which conservative groups have made several attempts to overturn – argued the fees were necessary for union stability but also ruled unions could not compel non-members to pay for union expenditures relating to “political and ideological purposes unrelated to collective bargaining”. But Janus argued Abood violates his right to free speech as unions enter into collective bargaining agreements with the government, and all of their activity should be seen as political. A similar case, Friedrichs v California Teachers Association, went resulted in a 4-4 split decision following the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/05/dietland-fat-women-plum-tv-series-sarai-walker-novel","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"The fat and the furious: will Dietland change the world for fat women?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/05/dietland-fat-women-plum-tv-series-sarai-walker-novel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/05/dietland-fat-women-plum-tv-series-sarai-walker-novel","fields":{"headline":"The fat and the furious: will Dietland change the world for fat women?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sarai Walker has been fielding a lot of questions about body image recently, and there are some for which she still doesn’t have an answer. The author of the feminist instant classic, Dietland, now adapted into a 10-part TV series, was asked at a Q&amp;A which movie characters she has seen herself in. “My answer,” she says, “was: ‘I’ve never seen that’ … I’ve never had that connection, a character that reflected me as a fat person. It was always the opposite for me; cringing, you know? Like with Fat Monica from Friends. There would be this dread while watching – ‘Oh, God, there’s not going to be a fat person in this, is there? I know I’ll be humiliated.’” Dietland centres on Plum, a 135kg (21st)-plus woman working in the glossy-magazine industry. Plum isn’t overweight in the usual Hollywood sense – think Jan from Grease (a regular-sized woman wearing a thick jumper) or Amy Schumer in the recently released film I Feel Pretty. Plum is fat, and the story centres on the diet industry, objectification, fat shaming, terrorism and feminist rage. Neither the character nor the subject matter is something the entertainment industry has a particularly good record of depicting. If you are fat, the dread that Walker mentioned becomes the Pavlovian response to a larger person walking on to the screen. Watching TV and film from a fat perspective – and particularly a fat woman’s perspective – can be like gazing through a looking glass into a world where you and those who look like you don’t exist (male characters are allowed more leeway with their weight, although fat men on screen are certainly stigmatised, too). When a fat female character does squeeze into the narrow frame the entertainment industry has created, reasons for their uncomfortable presence swiftly follow, because no fat woman in mainstream cinema and television is just fat – that extra flesh has to serve a purpose. The first time I noticed this was while watching a US crime drama years ago, one of those that features a death on the beach or at a fashion show every week, so the skinny, sexy corpse can wear a bikini. My vague memory is that the victim was a teenage girl who had died in a poisoned prom dress. The killer had been a fat girl, jealous of her victim. The evidence that solved the case was Cheetos dust on the seams of the dress. Watching these shows, you soon figure out that if a fat person shows up, they have probably killed someone because of their own self-hatred. In the case of the cheese-puffs-dust killer, she hadn’t even stopped eating to do it. There are a few other reasons for fat people to show up on screen, beyond murder. We are usually in comedy and the jokes often relate to our weight: Pitch Perfect character Fat Amy (played by Rebel Wilson), and Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids and Spy. Matt Lucas and David Walliams found great success in Little Britain by wearing rolls of foam and plastic to look like naked fat women – that being the extent of the joke, and one they returned to a lot. If it is a drama, the weight will be there for pathos. Kate battling with the scales in This Is Us. Willamena at her weight loss camp in Huge. Martha “Dumptruck” Dunnstock’s suicide attempt in 1988’s Heathers. Heather in EastEnders was pretty piteous, too – when she wasn’t ruminating about her love of eating cheese. Heather Trott, both comedy and tragedy. Fat characters can also be a handy tool to help the central (always slim) characters grow. Not grow bigger, obviously. Grow as people. In the 90s, if a new girl showed up on the teen shows California Dreams or Saved by the Bell who didn’t fit the standard template for a love interest for protagonists Sly and Zack, it was a safe bet she was there for Very Special Episode reasons. For Sly, Allison was blind. For Zack, Wendy was fat. When Walker was growing up, fat women on screen embodied tragedy, particularly when they were female celebrities. “I came of age in the 90s,” she says, “when every fat person in the media was trying to lose weight, always portrayed as miserable and desperate to be thin.” It’s easy to remember famous female faces who have sold that message of misery, so perpetually is it played out through magazines, talkshows and diet ads.

Fat celebrities who have filled up our screens with their tragedy, then their triumph when they lose the weight. This narrative of sadness and pity has an effect on the reception to a fat body. Walker has noticed the impact in reactions to Dietland. “In the first two-thirds of the book, Plum is the kind of fat person we usually see, right? Like: oh, poor Plum, she’s miserable. Then she switches to a more angry person. There were a lot of readers who said: ‘I don’t like Plum at the end of Dietland, I liked her at the beginning. The tone of the book changed and I don’t like that.’ A lot of people were responding to – and were comfortable with – the fact that she’s the ‘miserable fatty’. But when she becomes a badass and fights back, they’re uncomfortable – because she’s not miserable, it’s very disorientating. I think a lot of people are going to find it threatening in the show. They might like to think about why that makes them uncomfortable.” Plum goes from being scared and sad to angry, an emotional journey visibly fat women have to navigate. We are not supposed to be angry; that is not what the messages we all receive tell us. Extreme weight loss shows continue to do well. Programmes such as My 600lb Life and The Biggest Loser (shows that Roxane Gay, in her memoir Hunger, deemed “anti-obesity propaganda” – as well as “wish fulfilment”) are a message to fat people that they can change, but more importantly, that they should. Fat is wrong, fat is shameful, fat people are miserable and shouldn’t exist – unless it is for entertainment purposes. Yet, we do. For Walker, it was vital that Plum shouldn’t be a weak and watery Hollywood-accepted version of fat; this wasn’t a role for a skinny actor in a chunky jumper, and there wouldn’t be a makeover and reveal at the end. This was a serious consideration when she was fielding offers from TV companies. “I kept thinking, is this going to be a Gwyneth-Paltrow-in-a-fat-suit type thing, like in Shallow Hal? Or an Amy Schumer-sized person? That was my main fear. I was like: “You’re going to have a real fat person playing this role, right? Like, a real fat person?” That was probably the most important thing to me.” Plum is played by Joy Nash in the series and she looks right. To see Plum on screen finding her anger, and finally starting to live, feels revolutionary. She doesn’t serve as a lesson for other characters before disappearing in time for the next episode, and we are not invited to look at her with pity or cruel laughter – she just exists, as herself, as Plum. Writers and directors haven’t really known what to do with fat characters through the years. The nicknames yelled at fat people are a reminder of the times they have tried: Jabba the Hutt; Ursula (The Little Mermaid); The Penguin; the dancer in Return of the Jedi with six tits; Big Bertha the Bouncer at the Boom Boom Bar (Super Mario Bros); Sherman Klump (The Nutty Professor); Tracy Turnblad (Hairspray); Precious; the fat vampire from Blade. When putting her own list together, the writer Lindy West searched hard for a positive fat role model and finally came up with Mrs Potts from Beauty and the Beast. A teapot. “I’m hoping [for] a change in the culture,” says Walker, of Dietland’s debut, “that we’re going to see more fat people and smarter portrayals of fat people.” Considering what has gone before, I hope so, too. • Dietland is now available on Amazon Prime Video."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/04/trump-calling-out-samantha-bee-now-thats-double-standards","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T17:09:05Z","webTitle":"Trump calling out Samantha Bee?

Now that’s double standards","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What happens when extremely clever and – perhaps more challenging – funny women dare to speak truth to power? To answer the question, which is so much messier than the one about what happens when a powerful man is openly sexist, racist, homophobic and ableist (answer: he becomes US president), let’s consider the backlash against the comedian Samantha Bee. She called Ivanka Trump a “feckless cunt” and this was not in the midst of a sexist rant on Twitter enabled by sleeping pills with morality-loosening side-effects. No, it was on her own show while condemning the president’s daughter’s decision to post an image of herself cuddling her son amid reports detailing the hundreds of children taken from their parents by US border agents. The response? A carbon copy of the backlash after Michelle Wolf’s routine at the White House correspondents’ dinner; a particularly zesty form of moral outrage reserved for women who don’t give a damn. The kind that, on closer inspection, is whataboutery dressed up as indignity. So Bee was called on to apologise and, disappointingly, she did, saying she had “crossed a line”. (Note that last year she called Woodrow Wilson a “cunt” and no one batted an eyelid.) Donald Trump tweeted that Bee should be fired for “horrible language” and referred to the response from the US TV channel TBS, which has also apologised, as “a total double standard”. Which appears to equate Bee’s expletive with Roseanne Barr calling Valerie Jarrett a product of the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes. But before we get to that, can we take a moment to name the real double standard here: that a man who bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy” and who has used “cunt” to describe women himself is chastising a woman for “horrible language”. Words mean different things depending on the mouths that form them and the contexts into which they are delivered. This isn’t a question of double standards: it’s an uncontroversial recognition that we don’t all start from a place of historical and present equality. And whatever you think of the word “cunt” – and Wide Awoke is more interested in how a descriptor for vagina came to be the ultimate bad word – swearing is not the same as racism. Once again, it is the castigated woman who has to point out what is really going on. “We spent the day wrestling with the repercussions of one bad word,” Bee said as she accepted an award for Full Frontal’s #MeToo coverage, “when we all should have spent [it] incensed that … we are wrenching children from their parents.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/05/pioneering-liquid-air-project-can-help-store-excess-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"Pioneering 'liquid air' project can help store excess electricity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/05/pioneering-liquid-air-project-can-help-store-excess-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/05/pioneering-liquid-air-project-can-help-store-excess-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Pioneering 'liquid air' project can help store excess electricity","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A pioneering project in north-west England will turn air into liquid for energy storage to help electricity grids cope with a growing amount of wind and solar power. The world’s first full-scale “liquid air” plant is based on a technology that advocates say is cheaper and able to provide power for longer periods than lithium-ion batteries. The demonstration scheme next to a landfill site in Bury, Greater Manchester, uses excess or off-peak electricity to chill air to -196C, transforming it to a liquid state to be stored inside large metal tanks. Pumping and heating is used later to turn it back to a gas, which is released to turn a turbine, generating electricity at times of need – but without burning the gas and releasing emissions. While relatively small at 5 megawatts (MW) compared to 50MW lithium-ion battery facilities being built by firms such as EDF Energy, Highview Power said the technology could be scaled up to hundreds of megawatts. Gareth Brett, the company’s chief executive, said the technology could timeshift energy across the day, with the firm buying electricity when cheap and releasing it when prices are higher. “If you only want to store energy for an hour, lithium-ion is fine but the reality is what people are looking to do is store excess renewable power and release it at peak times, which is usually four hours or more,” he said. Brett admitted the liquid air process is less efficient than storing electricity in batteries but pointed out that the storage does not degrade over time, as lithium-ion cells do. Highview Power is already exploring sites for a much larger, 50MW storage facility and pitches the fact it can be located anywhere as one of its selling points. The firm has opened a US office and is also eyeing export opportunities in mainland Europe and Australia. The 690-square metre Bury facility officially opens on Tuesday, funded with £8m of government money. However, Brett said the technology was ready for commercialisation and could succeed with subsidy, and the firm has raised £25m of private investment for more projects. Large-scale energy storage is seen as increasingly vital to help the National Grid and local energy networks cope with the fast-growing levels of renewables, whose output varies depending on the amount of wind and sunshine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/04/chicken-safety-scandal-2-sisters-released-from-emergency-measures","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T16:44:47Z","webTitle":"Chicken safety scandal: 2 Sisters released from emergency measures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/04/chicken-safety-scandal-2-sisters-released-from-emergency-measures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/04/chicken-safety-scandal-2-sisters-released-from-emergency-measures","fields":{"headline":"Chicken safety scandal: 2 Sisters released from emergency measures","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Food Standards Agency has withdrawn the emergency measures imposed on 2 Sisters Food Group after six months of the regulator’s inspectors working full time inside the poultry cutting plants of the UK’s largest supplier of supermarket chicken. The move was announced in a second update by the FSA to parliament’s environment, food and rural affairs select committee, which launched an inquiry into the company last year following a food standards scandal at the firm. The parliamentary inquiry was called as a direct result of an undercover investigation by the Guardian and ITV, which filmed an instance of workers at a 2 Sisters cutting plant in West Bromwich changing the slaughter dates of batches of chickens. The footage also showed workers dropping chickens on the floor of the processing plant and returning them to the production line. In a letter to the committee, the FSA’s chief executive, Jason Feeney, said: “We are confident the emergency measures of full-time presence in all 2SFG standalone poultry cutting plants is no longer required. On this basis cutting plant supervision stopped at the end of April and we have moved to unannounced inspections in all the cutting plants on a regular basis.” The report added that 2 Sisters’ upgrading of CCTV cameras inside its cutting plants would be completed this month and that the “FSA will have remote access to the system so the agency can monitor activity remotely”. FSA inspectors moved into the West Bromwich plant in September, days before production at the facility was temporarily suspended as supermarkets boycotted the site. The regulator subsequently widened its investigation to include all of 2 Sisters cutting plants. In its first report to the select committee in March, the FSA concluded that 2 Sisters was guilty of regulatory failures and poor hygiene at its poultry plants. It also said: “No justification for this incident of label changes could be established.” The food group, which produces a third of all poultry products eaten in the UK, had previously claimed that there had been no regulatory breaches at the plant and that there was an innocent explanation for changing the date labels. On Monday 2 Sisters said it welcomed the committee’s second report and that it was pleased it highlighted “areas of progress”, including the company publishing audits conducted at its sites, enhanced training of staff and the upgrading of its CCTV system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/04/romance-writers-cocky-faleena-hopkins","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T16:31:37Z","webTitle":"Romance writer's bid to stop authors from using word 'cocky' fails in court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/04/romance-writers-cocky-faleena-hopkins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/04/romance-writers-cocky-faleena-hopkins","fields":{"headline":"Romance writer's bid to stop authors from using word 'cocky' fails in court","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Romance writers around the world can breathe a sigh of relief after a US court ruled that they can continue to use the adjective “cocky” in their book titles, after one author attempted to stop other writers from using the word. In September 2017, self-published author Faleena Hopkins filed a trademark claim for the word “cocky” in relation to a romance novel series, which was registered by the US Patent and Trademark Office in April 2018. Only series can be registered as trademarks, not individual titles, and common words can’t be registered at all, unless the public associates it with a particular use. In May, several romance authors reported receiving letters from Hopkins asking them to stop using the word in their titles and requesting that they change them. Hopkins, according to the Authors Guild, later “tried to block the sale of books by other romance writers that included the word”. She then applied for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order to prevent the publication of a collection of stories by various authors, Cocktales: The Cocky Collective, which was written as an act of protest against Hopkins’s trademark. Her lawsuit was filed against Tara Crescent, author of another book series that used the word “cocky”, the lawyer Kevin Kneupper, who had filed a legal challenge to have Hopkins’s trademark in “cocky” cancelled, and Cocktales’s publicist Jennifer Watson. The Authors Guild and Romance Writers of America joined forces to provide Crescent with legal assistance and “defend the principle that no one should be able to own exclusive rights to use a common word” in book titles. They argued that “countless romance novels employed ‘cocky’” in their titles well before Hopkins laid claim to it, that “no one should hold a monopoly on cocky”, and that “cockiness (in all its permutations) remains as prevalent in romance novels as the use of stunning, scantily clad models on their covers”. It would be, they wrote, “like an author claiming trademark rights in the word death as a series title for murder mysteries and suing anyone who used that word in the title of their crime stories”. “Any order that restricts creative expression in favour of promoting the tenuous (at best) purported rights of a single author is simply contrary to the public interest in freedom of expression,” wrote the guild, adding that it “seldom” litigates for individual authors, but felt in this case that it was “an important issue for authors generally”. In the case, heard in a New York court on Friday, judge Alvin Hellerstein described romance readers as “sophisticated purchasers” unlikely to be confused between different authors’ books, found that cocky was a “weak trademark”, and denied Hopkins’s motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order to stop the publication of books with the word “cocky” in the title. Kneupper, who was removed from the case, will be allowed to continue his legal challenge to Hopkin’s trademark in relation to the word’s use in series titles. “Authors should be able to express themselves in their choice of titles,” said the Authors Guild in a statement after the hearing. “A single word commonly used in book titles cannot be “owned” by one author. This is especially true when, as here, the word has already been in use by other authors in titles for years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/04/jordan-prime-minister-hani-mulki-resigns-protests-reports","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T12:13:58Z","webTitle":"Jordan's prime minister steps down after large anti-austerity protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/04/jordan-prime-minister-hani-mulki-resigns-protests-reports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/04/jordan-prime-minister-hani-mulki-resigns-protests-reports","fields":{"headline":"Jordan's prime minister steps down after large anti-austerity protests","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jordan’s King Abdullah II has accepted the resignation of the country’s embattled prime minister, the palace said in a statement, amid the largest anti-government protests in Jordan since 2011. Hani Mulki’s departure came after thousands joined countrywide anti-austerity demonstrations in the past few days demanding their leaders scrap a planned tax increase. After accepting Mulki’s letter of resignation at a meeting on Monday, King Abdullah asked Omar al-Razzaz, a former World Bank economist and minister of education, to form a new administration, according to government-linked daily, Al-Rai. In the last few days, rallies have spread across the streets of the pro-western kingdom, with protesters marching to the prime minister’s office and demanding that Mulki step down. Having served for two years, Mulki, a long-time diplomat and minister, presided over an unpopular government that attempted to implement economic reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund to control rising public debt. Protesters have demanded the tax bill that was sent to parliament last month be rescinded, claiming it will worsen living standards. The government, however, says it needs the extra funds for public services and argues the tax reform will be focused on high earners rather than poorer sections of society. Jordan’s economy has suffered a downturn in recent years, and unemployment has risen, primarily as a result of conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq. The country has taken in more than 660,000 Syrian refugees and has the second highest share of refugees compared to its population in the world. The nation’s monarch is the ultimate decision-maker on policy but also positions himself as a unifying force above domestic politics. Over the years, he has frequently reshuffled or disbanded governments as a way of defusing public anger and al-Razzaz’s premiership would be the 13th in Jordan this century. The resignation had been widely anticipated and Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, said the move was likely to provide at least a temporary break to the protests. “Demonstrations will likely recede if not stop outright. Jordanians will want to give the new prime minister and government a chance to see what they will bring to the table; particularly this prime minister who is highly respected and quite popular amongst Jordanians of different walks of life,” she said. Educated at Harvard, Al-Razzaz is seen as a leading reformer. Yahya said the task his new government will have is to set an agenda that addresses slow economic growth and growing public debt without causing further deterioration in Jordanians’ quality of life. “Rather than scrap it, I think that they will postpone and probably revise the proposed tax reform,” she said. Workers unions representing tens of thousands of employees in both the public and private sector had called for a general strike on Wednesday after the former prime minister refused to scrap the tax reform bill this weekend. Protest organisers said the one-day strike set for Wednesday would still take place. “We want to change the path, not the individuals,” said Ali Abous, who heads an umbrella group for 15 unions and professional associations. Jordan has been struggling to reduce billions of dollars of national debt, equivalent to 95% of gross domestic product. The tax hikes were aimed at bringing that figure down to 77% of GDP in 2021. Fears of a public outcry were raised in January when Jordan said it would end subsidies on pitta bread, lifting prices on the national staple by between 60 and 100%, the first significant increase since 1996. The Arab country also increased a general sales tax and the official unemployment rate has risen above 18%. The current wave of rallies is the largest since 2011 when demonstrators inspired by the Arab spring movement took to the streets to protest unemployment, corruption and political reform. The king responded by sacking three prime ministers in 18 months. Protests also broke out in 2012 after the government cut fuel subsidies in an attempt to secure an IMF loan and gradually lower public debt.

When that happens the series can start. Indeed, you would be mistaken if you think the finals are over just because of JR Smith’s blunder in Game 1 or because a blizzard of Stephen Curry three-pointers buried the Cavaliers in Game 2. Yes, the first two games were bad for the Cavaliers but a couple of losses on the road do not end any hope of winning a title. Not yet. The Warriors are a great offensive machine but the Cavs are the more rugged defensive team. They can knock the Warriors around below the rim, frustrating shooters and making the pretty look ugly. “They’re a team that’s great at home,” Golden State’s Klay Thompson said on Sunday night. And the Cavs will be on home turf for the next two games. Lost in the Smith debacle and Curry’s shooting is the fact that Cleveland actually won half of the eight regulation quarters that have been played so far in Golden State’s arena. They terrified the Warriors for much of the first game behind LeBron James’s 51 points, turning their misses into second shots with 19 offensive rebounds, compared to the Warriors’ four. Had the charge call made against Kevin Durant late in the game not been reversed, the Cavaliers probably would have won Game 1. When you look past the flash of Golden State’s fourth quarter on Sunday, the one in which Curry seemed unable to miss, this has been a very close series. It may be about to get a lot closer. Just two years ago, Golden State were in the same position: up 2-0 in the finals after crushing victories over the Cavs. That year, the Cavaliers came back, winning Game 3 and eventually overcoming a 3-1 deficit to take the championship. And while beating the Warriors in seven games may be too much against a team loaded with some of the best players in the league, Cleveland are capable of winning the next two and making this a great finals series; probably the last between these two teams. After Sunday’s loss, LeBron James talked about “being uncomfortable,” this next week, that the Cavs can’t simply expect to win just because they are playing at home. But there was also something revealing in his words, something that cuts to the heart of Cleveland’s ability to get this far in the playoffs, despite facing elimination against Milwaukee and Boston. The Cavs are better when they are uncomfortable. They play best when they are doubted. Smith, who was taunted with chants of “MVP” by the Golden State fans for his error at the end of Game 1, had just five points and one rebound on Sunday, but seemed unfazed as he spoke afterward, knowing this is still a long series. He pointed out that Cleveland’s players did a poor job of switching on screens to defend Curry and the Warriors’ other shooters. Such lapses probably won’t happen on their home court. In 2016, the Cavaliers blasted Golden State in Game 3, winning by 30 points. And while the Warriors came back to win Game 4, a tone had been set – one that carried through the rest of the series. Yes, that was a better Cavs team – they had Kyrie Irving – and Durant had yet to join Golden State, but many of the same players remain on both teams. The thought of what happened then lingers. And while the brilliant Irving has left the Cavs, they are stronger in some areas compared to 2016. Incredible as it is to say, James is playing at a higher level this season while Kevin Love, who looked lost for much of the 2016 series, has been quietly efficient with 43 points and 23 rebounds over the first two games. His dominance has been missed in the Smith and Curry storylines but it will probably play bigger now that the series moves to Cleveland. “We feel like we feed off our crowd,” Love said on Sunday night. “We really get up to play at home ... we know that come Wednesday we have to be better.” Usually the Cavs are in such situations. After the differing disasters for them in the first two games, Game 3 may just be the start of these finals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/04/as-victims-of-spycops-we-stand-with-lush-in-campaign-for-full-disclosure","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T12:32:14Z","webTitle":"As victims of spycops, we stand with Lush in campaign for full disclosure | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/as-victims-of-spycops-we-stand-with-lush-in-campaign-for-full-disclosure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/as-victims-of-spycops-we-stand-with-lush-in-campaign-for-full-disclosure","fields":{"headline":"As victims of spycops, we stand with Lush in campaign for full disclosure","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We are victims of what has become known as the “spycops” operation, and their legal representatives and supporters.

Such artists as Eileen Agar and Paul Nash beachcombed for strangely shaped driftwood, and Picasso created dream pictures from sand. Seaside surrealism is back on a sunny day on Whitstable beach. The writer Deborah Levy leans nonchalantly against a sea wall reading her poem Watery Things, newly composed for the Whitstable Biennale. She riffs on a line from TS Eliot’s The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock (“I have measured out my life with coffee spoons...”) to sensually hymn the sea’s succulent life: “I have measured out my life with whelks mussels clams oysters winkles and crab but not the scallop which is like eating the human earlobe of a swimmer.” Not a vegan, then. And she’s come to the right place: Levy is talking next to one of the oyster bars that line this Kent fishing town’s seafront. In the harbour nearby, the pissy smells of fresh and less-than-fresh crustaceans mingle. There’s a video screening in a cargo container at one end of this nautical cove. In the film, by Kris Lock and Josephine Sweeney, the gargantuan Kolyvan Vase escapes St Petersburg’s Hermitage Museum and sails the world in a cargo container just like the one we’re in. Surrealer and surrealer, said Alice. This year’s edition of the Whitstable art festival is a homage to Levy, named after her novel Swimming Home. At the start of the book, a tense black comedy set on the Riviera, Levy quotes the founder of the surrealist movement, André Breton: “We are all at the mercy of the dream...” After following this seaside trail to find artworks along the shore and in nooks and crannies of the weathered town, I found myself in a dream of crabs with cameras and performance artists stroking goldfish. The maritime setting gives video art a fish-and-chips flavour. A film by Salma Ashraf about an isolated British Muslim family is screening at the back of the tiny Whitstable Museum, a wondrous place that mixes everything from fisherman’s tackle to memorabilia of the local celebrity Peter Cushing. Once you get past the sea-shanty clutter, Ashraf’s images of curtained windows and a dark inner space create the sense of being beleaguered by a hostile environment beyond those fluttering drapes. For the Whitstable Biennale is not just surreal whimsy. It takes from Levy’s book the idea that home is hard to find, that we’re swimming to a place that may not exist. In very different ways, the vase travelling the seas and Ashraf’s film about everyday Islamophobia are challenges to insularity. Levy reads a poem against Brexit by the Kent shore: “Harry from Halifax loves Matteo from Rome / Astrid from Berlin loves Ed from St Ives...” The most ambitious meditation on the way people, birds and words live in perpetual migration is a performance by Norway’s Caroline Bergvall staged in the Sea Cadets’ Hall among ensigns and pennants and walls painted navy blue. At first it seems Bergvall is not so much a performance artist as an academic who has brought together a panel of experts to discuss the medieval Persian poem The Conference of the Birds, composed by Attar of Nishapur in the 12th century. It turns out that poems, like birds, move freely around our planet. Chaucer produced his own version of Attar’s work, Parlement of Foules, in the 14th century: but that’s nothing, says poetic ecologist David Wallace, who has charted the constant migrations of medieval verses and tales from Canterbury to Muscovy and beyond. Ornithologist Geoff Sample tells of similar exchanges in the songs of European birds. Fascinating stuff, but how is this art, exactly? Then it gets a bit weird as the speakers, who include subversive artist Adam Chodzko, start to chat among themselves, forgetting there’s an audience, while electronic music composed by Gavin Bryars fills the air with sublime sounds mutated from medieval chants. Bergvall herself turns from compere to shaman as she chants lines by Attar. Reality melts, dreams take over, birds chatter as they feast on crabs. This is a biennale with a brain. Even if you don’t chance on its rarest wonders you can always eat oysters and read Levy, or Attar, or Chaucer by the shore. • The Whitstable Biennale 2018 runs until 10 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/06/wednesdays-best-tv-who-do-you-think-you-are-the-truth-about-carbs","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Wednesday’s best TV: Who Do You Think You Are?; The Truth About Carbs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/06/wednesdays-best-tv-who-do-you-think-you-are-the-truth-about-carbs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/06/wednesdays-best-tv-who-do-you-think-you-are-the-truth-about-carbs","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday’s best TV: Who Do You Think You Are?; The Truth About Carbs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Who Do You Think You Are? 9pm, BBC One As the star of squaddie drama Our Girl, Michelle Keegan is no stranger to being parachuted in.

This is what I learned","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In August 2017, during the last month of my maternity leave, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Initially, I was plagued by memories of the young patients I had discharged home or to the hospice for end-of-life care. Thankfully they are few – but they are the ones you remember. My experience of being on the other side of the consultation desk will shape my future career and it has helped me to understand what goes on for patients. It has been an education in patience, humility and gratitude. First, there were the well-meaning stock phrases which I had so often used: “You’re so brave; you can fight this”. Really? Yesterday I was a 34-year-old clinical oncology trainee and mum of two, and today I’m a professional cancer warrior? Cancer didn’t feel like a fight to me and I won’t be asking my patients to go into battle in future. I have prescribed countless cycles of chemotherapy throughout my career, but still there were some surprises. For example, intravenous dexamethasone given for nausea makes your bottom tingle when administered. Subcutaneous filgrastim to boost white cell production stings if you give it straight from the fridge. The biggest ego-bruising revelation was learning who makes the difference. As the doctor prescribing the treatment I always felt my role was the most crucial. For the patient, however, it’s the healthcare assistant who smiles when you walk in and gets you seen on time; the volunteer who brings you a cup of tea; the complementary therapist who offers reflexology and a chat during treatment; and the nurse who gets the cannula in at the first attempt. I had never visited Maggie’s centres as a doctor, but discovered they offered a welcome haven for myself, my friends and family away from the bustle of the hospital. I had no idea about the varied and far-reaching support they offer. I will certainly be directing my patients to some of their sessions.Hair loss is something we often gloss over in busy clinics. I have been guilty of simply handing over a wig leaflet as the patient walks out of the door. It matters. It changes a person’s whole identity. I worried what my children would think and that it made me look like a victim. In the end, my daughter said: “Mummy, you’ve got no hair like Grandad Pete” and carried on making her Disney princess puzzle. For me a recommendation from a colleague for a local hijab stylist was a game-changer. Embracing the new world of turban tying and styling helped me to feel confident with my radically different appearance, look less like Grandad Pete and keep that victim behind closed doors. It was no surprise that chemotherapy was gruelling. The first part of the treatment was predictable, but it was tough trying to fit housework, spending time with family and friends and exercising into the three days I felt well. The second half of the process was a treatment affectionately known as the “red devil” among cancer bloggers. Four hours after the infusion I felt an overwhelming need to lie down and sleep. Such extreme tiredness that brings you to tears is something I hadn’t experienced before. Giving patients permission to be kind to themselves in the first few days after treatment and not expecting to function anywhere near normally is something I will take back to the clinic. There was just time after the final cycle to recover and begin preparing for surgery. Finding that post-surgery bras are VAT exempt felt like a considerate concession from the government and high street retailers – and another tip to pass on to patients. After surgery, I was very pleased to receive a physiotherapy leaflet in my pre-operative assessment and an invitation to a group session to ensure that arm movement was maintained. With scarring, the arm can become stiff. There was no way I was going to be that patient who couldn’t get their arm above their head and into the treatment position for radiotherapy. Thankfully the militant physiotherapy paid off and my radiotherapy planning scan went without a hitch. I have heard the end of treatment bells ringing out in the department over the last three years and I have sometimes offered a clap or cheer if I was passing. Now, as I ring the end of treatment bell for myself, I can appreciate what it is to do so. The concept is another fantastic innovation by a family affected by cancer and through charitable donations they help patients mark the end of gruelling cancer treatment with a symbolic bell placed in chemotherapy and radiotherapy departments across the UK. For me, the bell marks the start of my transition from patient back to doctor. As I plan my return to work I hope I can appreciate more what patients go through on their journey – and understand what a difference all the dedicated and caring members of the NHS machine make to the patient experience, despite all the pressures they face.

The emphasis of the prosperity fund on promoting British trade was a “step towards” tied aid, a concept discredited after Britain’s “aid for arms” scandal 25 years ago, according to a report on aid spending across Whitehall by the international development committee (IDC). The Pergau Dam affair, in which hundreds of millions of pounds in UK aid were linked to a major arms deal, was uncovered by a National Audit Office report in 1993. Projects supported by the prosperity fund – which is administered by the Foreign Office and paid out £46m in 2017 – included development of the Chinese film industry, improving the Chinese museum infrastructure and improving the credit bond rating system in China, MPs found. “It is unclear to us how these types of interventions will benefit the world’s poorest people; both those living in the countryside and the urban poor,” they said. The report, which also raised concerns over transparency of aid spending outside the Department for International Development, called for the department, given its expertise, to sign off all overseas aid. Last month, the committee urged Penny Mordaunt to “get a real grip” on aid spending by departments other than DfID, after it emerged aid money spent via the prosperity fund had “very tenuous links” to poverty reduction. Romilly Greenhill, UK director of the One campaign, welcomed the IDC’s findings. “The IDC is right to call out aid that doesn’t meet its core purpose of fighting poverty,” she said. “Their recommendation that DfID – with its world-leading expertise in using aid effectively – be given final sign-off of UK aid spent anywhere in Whitehall is spot on.” Greenhill also welcomed the IDC’s recommendation that the government should make systematic improvements to coherence, transparency and the poverty focus of cross-government funds before increasing their share of overseas aid cash. The prosperity fund and the conflict, security and stability fund (CSSF), both cross-government aid pots, spent a total of £603m overseas aid in 2016-17. The report said that cross-government projects should focus on the world’s poor. It said: “The increasingly prominent role played by the cross-government funds raises particular concern given their shortcomings in focus upon poverty reduction and transparency. We found, in practice, many prosperity fund projects showed very weak targeting at their primary objective, with negligible targeting towards helping the poorest and most vulnerable.” In written evidence to the committee, Oxfam said that 20% of the prosperity fund’s projects in China involved explicitly promoting the capabilities of UK entities alone, and that half of all projects in China involved showcasing UK companies and promoting UK-China collaborations. MPs said this raised “concerns about the potential to lead to tied aid, with the recipient of aid dependent upon granting the UK trade partnerships”. Stephen Twigg, the IDC chair, said “serious questions” needed to be asked of the prosperity fund. “There’s a serious risk that we could go backwards,” he said. “We’ve seen this drive to increasing the amount of spend in departments other than DfID. We have had an effective doubling of the proportion of ODA spent in departments other than DfiD. “We’re not saying it’s wrong [that] that money is spent in other departments, but that DfID need to oversee all of it.” In 2017, DfID accounted for 72% of ODA spend, compared to 88% five years ago. MPs also expressed concern over the transparency of the CSSF. They received “contradictory reports” in evidence of the CSSF’s approach to redacting information, with suggestions that information was routinely redacted. “This lack of clarity risks undermining faith in the UK aid brand,” the report said. The committee said overseas development assistance should not be used as a “slush fund” to pay for the UK’s diplomatic, trade or national security interests, but should be used to reduce poverty, to help the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people. The MPs called for a review of all existing programmes under the prosperity fund and said that the CSSF should also be reviewed in its current form. They also called for the aid watchdog, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, to scrutinise the totality of cross-government funds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/04/trump-pardon-russia-mueller-investigation-tweet","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T21:27:11Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump claims he has 'absolute right to pardon myself'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/04/trump-pardon-russia-mueller-investigation-tweet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/04/trump-pardon-russia-mueller-investigation-tweet","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump claims he has 'absolute right to pardon myself'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In his latest broadside against the Russia investigation, Donald Trump claimed on Monday to have an “absolute right to pardon myself”. The president added: “But why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, however, later told reporters “no one is above the law”. The president’s remarks came in tweets in which he said his right to pardon had been “stated by numerous legal scholars”. Last year, he had said he had the “complete power to pardon”. The question has never been decided by the courts but, in a non-binding opinion written in 1974, the justice department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that a president cannot pardon himself, under the principle that “no one may be a judge in his own case”. At Monday’s White House briefing, Sanders dodged questions about whether Trump had the right to pardon himself. “Thankfully the president hasn’t done anything wrong and wouldn’t have any need for a pardon,” she said. Asked if Trump believed the founding fathers envisioned the president having the power to pardon himself and thus being “above the law”, Sanders said: “Certainly the constitution very clearly lays out the law and the president hasn’t done anything wrong, so we feel very comfortable on the front.” She added, after a follow up question: “Certainly no one is above the law.” Trump was renewing attacks on the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and allegations of collusion with the Trump campaign. The president’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, suggested in television interviews on Sunday that Trump might have the authority to pardon himself but would be unwise to use it. Giuliani told NBC’s Meet the Press: “Pardoning himself would be unthinkable and probably lead to immediate impeachment.” He added: “He has no need to do it, he’s done nothing wrong.” Giuliani said he would be “willing to sit down with Mueller and argue it out if he has an open mind to it”. The former New York mayor and mob prosecutor has taken a leading role in defending Trump, sometimes making conflicting statements. Last Thursday, Trump said he was considering pardoning Martha Stewart, the home decorating mogul who served five months in prison for obstructing justice and similar charges as part of a 2004 insider trading investigation, and the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/05/qa-mark-dreyfus-warns-pushback-marriage-equality","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T21:38:02Z","webTitle":"Q&A: Mark Dreyfus fears 'pushback' against marriage equality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/qa-mark-dreyfus-warns-pushback-marriage-equality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/qa-mark-dreyfus-warns-pushback-marriage-equality","fields":{"headline":"Q&A: Mark Dreyfus fears 'pushback' against marriage equality","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian government must stand ready to fight a US-style “pushback” aiming to delegitimise same-sex marriage, Labor’s Mark Dreyfus has told the ABC’s Q&amp;A program. The US experienced a groundswell of opposition – including from Alabama state officials, churches and anti-gay rights groups – after the supreme court ruled that marriage equality was a constitutional right in mid-2015. “What I’m worrying about … is pushback that we’ve seen that did occur in the United States, that did occur in the United Kingdom,” the shadow attorney general said on Q&amp;A on Monday night. “We’re going to see a pushback here in Australia against the achievement of marriage equality. “That’s the role for government, to make sure that that delegitimisation does not happen and to hang on to the achievement that we did make with marriage equality.” The social services minister, Dan Tehan, said he had seen no such reaction in Australia. Marriage equality had been accepted,” he said. “Well, I’ve seen no sign of a kickback, in fact what I saw was acceptance and ability to move on.” The program heard examples of persisting homophobia in some rural communities across Australia. One man, originally from Hamilton in Victoria, said he had left the bush owing to homophobia, an experience he described as “pretty horrible” and one that took him years to get over. He asked Tehan what he was doing to “challenge homophobia in [the electorate of] Wannon and in your own party”. “We know that farmers generally are under tremendous pressure leading to mental health issues,” the questioner said. “Some of my friends, their sexuality and their gender issues on top of that, can push them over the edge. Plenty of more conservative forces are still working to thwart equality in the bush.” Tehan said he would “continue to engage” and work with groups who raised issues of homophobia in the bush. But he said he wasn’t aware of people leaving the regions to escape it. “I wouldn’t say I’m aware of people fleeing the bush because of it. But I’ve had groups come and see me to talk about this issue and to talk about the problems they’ve had.” Tehan was then invited by the questioner to an upcoming pride match. He replied that he would need to check his diary but that if he was home he would look forward to it. The former Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie said homophobia continued in some areas of her home state. “Outside of Hobart, in the regional areas, it’s very conservative,” she said. “That’s just really unfortunate, they are getting better. You don’t see a lot of the gay community out there on show either, so that’s making it a little bit more difficult.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/04/chemo-breast-cancer-oncotype-dx-test","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T13:31:20Z","webTitle":"No chemo: the test that made me a lucky breast cancer patient | Joanna Moorhead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/04/chemo-breast-cancer-oncotype-dx-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/04/chemo-breast-cancer-oncotype-dx-test","fields":{"headline":"No chemo: the test that made me a lucky breast cancer patient","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Having cancer involves getting a lot of news from a lot of doctors, and for a while the news is bad. First you have cancer; then they’re not sure whether it’s spread. You’re given worst-case scenarios because the medics have to do that – even if they suspect that you’re going to be one of the lucky ones. But then, if you are one of the lucky ones, the tide turns. The news starts to be good – and good news has never seemed so sweet, so welcome, so joyous, as this good news. Four years ago this week I was in that situation, and about to receive some wonderful information: I didn’t, after all, need chemotherapy after surgery for breast cancer. I was one of the early beneficiaries of a test that, it was reported yesterday, is revolutionising treatment for thousands of women. The test, called oncotype DX, pinpoints those women who will benefit from chemotherapy because they have a higher risk of recurrent breast cancer, while identifying those whose lower risk means that they will do just as well without chemotherapy. The new procedure involves a complex biopsy of a woman’s tumour, during which 21 tumour genes are mapped. The result is a score of between zero and 100: the higher the number, the more likely cancer is to return within 10 years, and the greater the potential benefit of chemotherapy. Not all women with breast cancer are eligible for the test: to qualify, your disease must be hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, and axillary-node-negative. But about half of all breast cancers, mine included, do fit into this category; and for us, the test can be a game-changer, especially if – again, like me – you’re one of the approximately 60% of women with the disease whose surgery is a lumpectomy, as opposed to the more radical mastectomy. In these cases, the existence of the oncotype DX test can transform the experience of breast cancer. In my own case, it meant that treatment hardly seemed a physical event at all: I had to cope with only three minor operations, which were all done as day-case surgery – and I didn’t need to take even an aspirin after any of them. Chemotherapy would have made things very different: there would have been months of feeling dreadful, and long periods off work – the very things, in other words, that give illness the power to upend our lives– not to mention hair loss, which many women who have had chemotherapy for breast cancer say is the single worst thing about the whole experience. So not only women who have already benefited from it, but also women who will benefit from it in the future, have good reason to be grateful to this test, and to all the research that is being done to make cancer treatment more targeted. The days of chemotherapy being used as a sledgehammer are coming to an end. The difference, in real lives such as my own, is immeasurable. I’ll never forget the day I got my oncotype DX results. I’d arrived at my appointment feeling very scared. The moment I saw the smile on my doctor’s face I knew I had a low score. (It turned out to be 15; anything below 25 means no need for chemotherapy in a woman aged 50-plus). “I feel lucky,” I said. “Well, you were unlucky to get cancer in the first place,” she pointed out. “But you’re definitely lucky not to need chemotherapy.” It felt like the turning of the tide; like luck was on my side again. I have gone on feeling lucky ever since. • Joanna Moorhead is a regular Guardian contributor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/04/parkland-students-bus-tour-gun-control-midterms","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T17:36:41Z","webTitle":"Parkland students target midterms with summer gun control road trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/04/parkland-students-bus-tour-gun-control-midterms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/04/parkland-students-bus-tour-gun-control-midterms","fields":{"headline":"Parkland students target midterms with summer gun control road trip","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Student survivors of the Parkland school shooting will take their March for Our Lives movement on the road this summer, for a barnstorming US tour. The teenagers from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school plan to make 75 stops in a 60-day, 20-state bus tour that is set to include meetings with victims and survivors of other school shootings, including the one in Sante Fe, Texas, last month, in which 10 people were killed. The aim is to promote gun law reform and unseat politicians tied to the gun lobby through a massive drive to register young people to vote. A simultaneous bus tour in Florida will make a further 25 stops, in each of the state’s congressional districts. The students announced their “Road to Change” tour at a press conference at the Pine Trails Park amphitheatre in Parkland, a venue that three months ago served as the memorial site for the 14 classmates and three teachers who were murdered on 14 February. “This generation is the generation of students you will be reading about next in the textbooks,” said Cameron Kasky, 17, a leader of the Never Again movement that aims to build on the momentum gained by March for Our Lives rallies held in the aftermath of the shooting. “Four million people turn 18 this year and if every single one votes, encourages their friends to vote and their families, we can bring real change in this country. “A lot of politicians do not want a lot of young people voting; they want marginalised communities staying out of the polls because they know they’ll be voted out. Our generation can change the game, we do not have to surrender to dirty, awful politics.” The student group has made no secret of targeting November’s midterm elections and elected officials supported financially by the National Rifle Association. The bus tour will begin on Friday 15 June at a peace march in Chicago led by students from St Sabina Academy, several of whom teamed up with Parkland survivors in south Florida in March to discuss the drive for gun law reform. From there, students will traverse the nation, including stops in California, Iowa, South Carolina and Connecticut. The Florida tour aims to put pressure on state politicians seen as weak on gun reform, despite the Republican legislature and governor passing into law in March the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. That law raised the age for firearms purchases to 21, banned the sale of bump stocks, which increase the rate of fire in semi-automatic weapons, and provided $400m for mental health treatment. “So many state laws have been passed in order to make us safe around the country, but it is not enough,” Kasky said. About 25 Stoneman Douglas students joined Kasky at the announcement, among them Emma González and David Hogg, both 18, two of the most prominent figures in the Never Again campaign. Both were among Stoneman Douglas seniors who attended a graduation ceremony on Sunday at which the late-night comedian Jimmy Fallon made a surprise appearance and speech. Hogg’s book #NeverAgain, co-authored with his sister Lauren, 14, tells their story of the shooting and the setting up of the students’ protest movement. It will be published later this month. Hogg has been a frequent target of the gun lobby as he has travelled around the US calling for improved background checks for firearms owners and bans on high-capacity magazines and semi-automatic assault rifles. He said he was encouraged by the support he has seen, which he hopes to turn into positive action. “A successful summer would be any boost in youth and American voter turnout,” he said. “The amount of apathy we have right now is unacceptable. In the last midterm, 18 to 24-year-olds voted about 18%. That doesn’t sound American to me, and as a result you’ve seen people elected who, for example, don’t support net neutrality. “Even if you’re not concerned with gun policy, and I think you should be, there’s a parallel between people that take money from the NRA and people that don’t support net neutrality.” The Santa Fe shooting, Hogg said, had added fuel to the students’ push for change. “It’s motivated us even more, so that hopefully next year this doesn’t have to happen again,” he said. “Everybody needs to vote.” González said each tour stop was likely to be different. “We’re going from place to place,” she said, “to round tables, to rallies, we’re going to go to people’s churches, their communities, we’re going to talk to people and try to get everybody registered to vote. “We’ll just talk about whatever. A group of kids I met last week, we were talking gun violence and got sidetracked and started talking about the Backyardigans. Those are the kind of connections that we want to make. “We’re aiming for places that have experienced a lot of gun violence, or some places where we aren’t necessarily loved. We want to communicate with people, if they have a problem with us we want to address that problem and have a communication and see if there’s any common ground.” Among those offering support to the students on Monday was Manuel Oliver, whose son Joaquim was among the Parkland victims. He who has set up the advocacy group Change the Ref, aimed at diminishing the power of the NRA. “The price we’ve paid for this is too high but being with them means a lot,” he said of the Stoneman Douglas students."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/04/john-oliver-donald-trump-last-week-tonight","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T13:35:26Z","webTitle":"John Oliver: 'As infuriating a president as Trump is, he'd be an even worse Moses'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/04/john-oliver-donald-trump-last-week-tonight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/04/john-oliver-donald-trump-last-week-tonight","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver: 'As infuriating a president as Trump is, he'd be an even worse Moses'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed the prospects for the highly anticipated summit between Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un. “We begin with North Korea, voted ‘Top Korea’ by ‘We Meant It Geographically Magazine’,” the host said. “This week, the June 12 summit between the US and North Korea was suddenly back on after Trump met with a North Korean envoy who brought him this gigantic, comically oversized letter from Kim Jong-un.” Showing a photo of the president grinning widely with the letter in hand, Oliver continued: “As if smiling while holding a letter from a dictator were not enough of a propaganda coup for North Korea, the president then raved about the letter to the press.” In a clip shown from a gaggle between Trump and reporters, the president was asked about the contents of the letter, which was sent just weeks after the 12 June summit was cancelled due to what Trump called the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by Pyongyang and the North Korean government’s objection to joint US-South Korean military exercises. “It was a very interesting letter,” Trump said, “and at some point it may be appropriate, I’ll be able to give it to you.” “As infuriating a president as Trump is, he would be an even worse Moses,” Oliver joked. “Oh, wouldn’t you like to see what’s on these tablets?” “And if that wasn’t weird enough,” the host went on, “just eight minutes after calling the contents of the letter interesting, this happened.” Oliver proceeded to play a segment from the same clip, where Trump tells reporters: “I haven’t seen the letter yet ...

Following a nod from Donald Trump, powerful lobbying in Europe and a lot of political arm-twisting on several continents, the path has been cleared for Monsanto, the world’s largest seed company, to be taken over by Bayer, the second-largest pesticide group, for an estimated $66bn (£50bn). The merger has been called both a “marriage made in hell” and “an important development for food security”. Through its many subsidiary companies and research arms, Bayer-Monsanto will have an indirect impact on every consumer and a direct one on most farmers in Britain, the EU and the US. It will effectively control nearly 60% of the world’s supply of proprietary seeds, 70% of the chemicals and pesticides used to grow food, and most of the world’s GM crop genetic traits, as well as much of the data about what farmers grow where, and the yields they get. It will be able to influence what and how most of the world’s food is grown, affecting the price and the method it is grown by. But the takeover is just the last of a trio of huge seed and pesticide company mergers. Backed by governments, and enabled by world trade rules and intellectual property laws, Bayer-Monsanto, Dow-DuPont and ChemChina-Syngenta have been allowed to control much of the world’s supply of seeds. You might think that these mergers would alert the government, but because political parties in Britain are so inward-looking, and because most farmers in rich countries already buy their seeds from the multinationals, opposition has barely been heard. Instead, it is coming from the likes of Debal Deb, an Indian plant researcher who grows forgotten crops and is the antithesis of Bayer and Monsanto. While they concentrate on developing a small number of blockbuster staple crops, Deb grows as many crops as he can and gives the seeds away. This year he is cultivating an astonishing 1,340 traditional varieties of Indian “folk” rice on land donated to him in West Bengal. More than 7,000 farmers in six states will be given the seeds, on the condition that they also grow them and give some away. This seed-sharing of “landraces”, or local varieties, is not philanthropy but the extension of an age-old system of mutualised farming that has provided social stability and dietary diversity for millions of people. By continually selecting, crossbreeding and then exchanging their seeds, farmers have developed varieties for their aroma, taste, colour, medicinal properties and resistance to pests, drought and flood. Deb’s community seed bank is one of the last living repositories of hundreds of Indian rice varieties. It is also an act of ecological and political defiance against the immense reach and concentration of the likes of Monsanto and Bayer. The corporates argue that only consolidation can bring the development of better seed varieties and the innovations needed to avert global hunger and malnutrition, as the world population climbs to around 10 billion people in a few decades’ time. By innovation, they mean new, “advanced” plant engineering technologies such as GM, Crispr, gene editing and bio-fortification. History, however, suggests strongly that the reality will be the opposite. It is far more likely, say environmentalists and farm groups in developing countries, that competition will be limited and that the legal and biological grip of seed corporates on global farming will tighten. The small farmer, who has traditionally fed the world and given societies their rich food cultures, will only be threatened further. Forty years ago, farmers and consumer groups might have welcomed potential opportunities offered by agri-science and large corporate mergers. But today, there is no sense of agri-optimism. Yields of most staple crops have barely increased in years, seeds and herbicides are becoming more expensive, and the promised health, safety and nutritional benefits of new industrial crops have failed to materialise. Instead, farm pollution increases, agricultural biodiversity continues to be lost and nearly 30 years and many billions of dollars of R&amp;D after Monsanto breezed into Europe pledging to feed the world, there are still around 800 million people who are malnourished, no public enthusiasm for industrial farming, and open cynicism about corporate motives. The UK and US governments, together with a few major agri-philanthropists such as the Gates Foundation, still plough billions of dollars a year into hi-tech, high-input farming, but the tide may be turning as simpler, grassroots solutions are being developed. Nearly 10 million of the poorest farmers now use the system of rice intensification (SRI), which has been proven to increase rice, wheat, potato and other yields dramatically by stimulating the roots of crops. Agro-forestry techniques that grow trees and shrubs among crops is proving more productive, as is land restoration. Farmers’ groups in India and across Latin America are developing their own seed companies in order to avoid the new corporate monopolies. If they fail, the future of food appears to be in the hands of three giant companies that are wedded to genetic modification of one sort or another. The corporates might say that isn’t a problem. Bayer’s chairman, Werner Baumann, has recently promised to “strengthen its commitment in the area of sustainability,” adding: “Agriculture is too important to allow ideological differences to bring progress to a standstill.” But still, blinded by the prospect of new technologies, governments and research organisations have paid little attention to farmers’ traditional knowledge. They are missing out on this vast storehouse, which will be needed if the world is to adapt to climate change and population growth. Debal Deb, who lives on a shoestring and relies on friends for minimal funding to conduct his own research, has published research into rice varieties capable of growing in 12ft of water, others that can grow in 4-5ft of water, and dozens that are drought-tolerant, as well as many varieties that can grow in brackish water. Some are said to be far richer in nutrients such as iron, zinc, magnesium, omega 3 and riboflavin than anything that the giant seed companies have developed. But such is the lack of trust and funds, Deb keeps the exact location of his farm secret and only gives his seeds to people he respects. He claims that spies have been sent to steal his seeds and companies want to patent, suppress or claim them as their own. Instead of working in a well-funded research institute, as might be expected of a Fulbright biotech scholar, Deb is now part of the worldwide farmers’ movement to limit corporate control and to redefine what knowledge is, and who owns it. Like many others, he has found that the best way to save traditional agricultural knowledge is to grow seeds and give them away. He believes that’s the future. Pray that he’s right. • John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/04/the-railway-arch-sell-off-and-timetable-chaos","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T17:02:35Z","webTitle":"The railway arch sell-off and timetable chaos | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/04/the-railway-arch-sell-off-and-timetable-chaos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/04/the-railway-arch-sell-off-and-timetable-chaos","fields":{"headline":"The railway arch sell-off and timetable chaos","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thank you for highlighting our plight (Rail sell-off puts firms under the arches at risk, 2 June). This sale must be stopped. These arches are a national asset and should be managed with care so that rental money can be ploughed back into maintaining the rail system, not sold off – with what will probably be disastrous consequences – like so much of the UK family silver. But something must be done about Network Rail’s managerial incompetence. Rubbish is rarely collected. We were being billed for window cleaning for several months. I dream of having a window to clean. On the parade of arches where I work why have six of the 18 arches been empty – generating zero money for the system – for five years or more? If Network Fail can’t let the arches in some of the less “happening” locations, market forces say it should be reducing rents, not trying to kill us with a 100% increase. Mark Gould e3made.com, London • When railway arches have been priced out of reach of ordinary, local businesses so that their apparent value “on the books” looks attractive to investors, then Network Rail/Railtrack will apparently try to raise £1.2bn from their sale. And very soon. The fact that an effective local MOT test garage in a dingy side street has suddenly been valued as if it were a Shoreditch cafe or vegan restaurant should give private equity firms such as Blackstone or Terra Firma second thoughts. Perhaps even more pertinent is the question of future maintenance of the arches. Most must be at least 100 years old. Where, precisely, does the top of an arch become a railway? Does Railtrack just own the rails and their timbers? If the arches are sold in batches to private investors (“200 prime railway arches in east London – a snip!”) without stringent maintenance contracts, then when the first high-speed train plunges through a failing arch, no doubt Chris Grayling will have moved on. Like George Osborne. David Harding London • Friday: rail meltdown in the northwest where Northern’s ability to wreak havoc with people’s travel plans reached unprecedented levels of chaos. Wholesale cancellations, the remaining trains dangerously overcrowded, and now the Lakes line between Oxenholme and Windermere closed completely for a fortnight (not that this will make matters greatly worse for those who use it, as it has been completely unreliable since Northern took over the service two years ago – 14 cancellations in one day some weeks ago, long before the new timetable made matters worse). Commuters, schoolchildren, visitors all affected on a daily basis. Barrow-in-Furness, one of the most isolated towns in England, cut off on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile the nightmare journey between Liverpool and Leeds via Manchester gets even worse. Saturday’s Guardian: a tiny report on page 13 (Timetable changes spell two weeks of chaos for rail users, 2 June). Come on, Guardian. What happened to your northern roots? Elizabeth Jones Ulverston, Cumbria • Perhaps if we refer to Northern by its parent company name, Deutsche Bahn, the German company will be shamed into getting the trains run on time. Dr Michael Paraskos London • Re your report (Railcards could be axed under radical plan to simplify fares, 4 June), East Midlands Trains, the only operator on the Wellingborough to London St Pancras journey, has a monopoly. Consequently it can get away with charging £105 for a peak-time return ticket including tube. But split the journey into two parts – Wellingborough to Bedford £10.20, and Bedford to London including tube £50 – and get an immediate saving of £44.80. Are we really to believe that the “simplification” will mean that the £105 ticket will be reduced permanently to £60.20? More likely the option to split journeys into cheaper parts will “simply” be removed.

The first object is a large bronze of an abject, crawling man by Wilhelm Lehmbruck. The German artist intended it as a war memorial for his town, Duisburg, but such an image of defeat and despair was heavily criticised and rejected. Lehmbruck, who never recovered from his wartime experiences, fled to Switzerland and killed himself in 1919. Alex Farquharson, the director of Tate Britain, said: “There are injuries, physical and mental, first experienced in the first modern war which are still common on battlefields today, particularly Afghanistan.” The curator, Emma Chambers, said most of the German, British and French artists represented had been soldiers and their experiences had a profound impact on their art. Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson served at the front before returning as an official war artist. His ironically titled Paths of Glory, showing bloated rotting corpses sprawled among tangles of barbed wire, was banned. He exhibited it after the war with a brown paper banner marked “censored” masking the corpses. Long shadows hang over the pastoral landscapes, which became comfortingly popular after the war in all three countries – literally in the case of a John Nash view of a cornfield half golden, half in dark shade. Nash said he and his brother Paul worked on their paintings after 6pm when they considered their work as war artists finished for the day. Chambers points out that a beautiful small painting by Pablo Picasso of a family on a beach, initially a summer shimmer of blue sea and gold light, becomes more sinister the longer you look at it, causing the viewer to wonder if the nude man stretched out on the sand is asleep or dead. One of the most striking pieces, by the German artist George Grosz, is a tailor’s dummy with artificial legs, a revolver for an arm and a chest full of decorations including a German black eagle medal and a knife and fork, with a working lightbulb for a head – representing experiments in electric shock treatment for the shell-shocked. Grosz’s savage etching, Toads of Property, representing the industrialists who made a fortune from the carnage of the war, has been hung with a gentler British painting on the same theme. Nevinson’s sad man is expensively dressed, but there is a photograph of a soldier in uniform on the mantelpiece, titled He Gained a Fortune – but he Lost a Son. The exhibition closes with a 1920 New York painting, also by Nevinson, which hints that fault lines were appearing in the ideal of building a postwar world of peace and progress. It shows the El, the high-line train, snaking between skyscrapers. He called it New York – an Abstraction, but later renamed it The Soul of the Soulless City. Aftermath: Art in the wake of World War One will be at Tate Britain in London from 5 June until 23 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/shortcuts/2018/jun/04/peak-climbing-everest-awful-chris-bonington","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T14:22:07Z","webTitle":"Is climbing Everest today as ‘awful’ as Chris Bonington says?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jun/04/peak-climbing-everest-awful-chris-bonington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2018/jun/04/peak-climbing-everest-awful-chris-bonington","fields":{"headline":"Is climbing Everest today as ‘awful’ as Chris Bonington says?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fancy a crack at climbing Everest? Don’t bother. As far as the highest mountain on Earth is concerned, we have reached peak peak. That at least was the opinion of Chris Bonington, 83, speaking at the Hay literary festival about his new autobiography, Ascent. The book details his four expeditions to the mountain: two on the fearsome south-west face, the second successful; a tragic attempt on the north-east ridge, when his friends Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker disappeared; and a final, triumphant trip to the summit in 1985 with the Norwegian businessman, Arne Naess Jr. Back in the day, Everest gave Bonington the kind of profile that could sell Bovril and more besides. But now? “It’s awful,” he said. “Thank God I don’t have to go back there.” And if you still insist on following in the footsteps of celebrity bucket-listers Ben Fogle and Victoria Pendleton, “be prepared to stand in a long queue, as you’ll be doing it with about 600 other people”. He is not exaggerating. This spring, more than 700 climbers and their Sherpas reached the summit, smashing the 2013 record. It’s not cheap, either: according to Alan Arnette’s trusted Everest blog, the median price for a shot at the summit is a whopping $41,500 (£31,000) from the more popular Nepal side. According to Arnette, this is the price of a car, which says a lot about his driving. My car wouldn’t get me a ticket to Kathmandu. “It’s all bullshit on Everest these days,” Edmund Hillary said not long before he died in 2008. If only. What with all those climbers and trekkers visiting base camp, 12 tonnes of faeces each year gets shovelled into an enormous pit. The good news is there’s a plan to turn this particular mountain into biogas. The bad news is that the management of the mountain is rarely so enlightened. The Nepalese ministry of tourism, which charges each climber $11,000 plus a raft of other taxes, has been criticised frequently for putting revenue ahead of sustainable management. The Everest industry has lifted living standards for many who live nearby.

Sajid Javid, outlining the approach, called Contest, in a speech in London, said it would be “wrong and reckless” for either side to seek a reduction in security and terror cooperation after Brexit. After the speech, Javid said the European commission was seeking to treat the UK as a third country, and that interior ministers he was meeting took a very different view. Security links have been one of the more contested areas of Brexit talks, with Theresa May facing resistance from some in the EU over her desire for a new treaty on cooperation. Officials have also said the UK should play no future part in the joint Galileo global satellite positioning project. After a speech that focused on what he said was a growing threat from both Islamist and far-right terrorists, Javid said the UK had made it very clear it wanted to replicate current security ties after Brexit. But he said of the European commission: “I don’t think they’ve really focused on it yet.” “Actually the European Union is not speaking with one voice on this - [though] there’s nothing unusual about that. The commission’s got its own hard line at the moment on so many things, and it’s negotiating – we’d expect that. “But one thing that is absolutely clear is that, although this is only my fifth week in the role, I’ve met with a number of European interior ministers, who are my equivalents … and every single one that I’ve met, they absolutely agree – they not only want the cooperation to continue as it is, but they are also open to how we can make it even deeper.” Saying he would see more of his peers at a meeting in Luxembourg later on Monday, Javid said they were all clear about the value of UK intelligence in cross-Europe security. “There is not a single European interior minister that would want to explain, if we weren’t cooperating as we are today, after an attack, how it could have been stopped if the British were still involved with intelligence,” he said. If a better deal was not reached, the UK and EU nations would “all lose out”, he said. Javid also sought to calm concerns about civil liberties stemming from a key element of the updated anti-terror strategy, which would see intelligence details of people considered a risk shared with agencies in areas such as education. “There’s nothing in there that suggests that someone is guilty of some kind of offence or they’ve done something wrong,” he said. “They’re not going to be on any criminal records, or police records. That’s a very clear safeguard.” Asked after the speech who could do more to help prevent terrorism and radicalisation, Javid identified tech firms, saying he was about to meet some in Silicon Valley. “They are doing a lot more, but that said, they can also still really push what they’re doing further,” he said, singling out smaller social media sites such as the messaging app Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/05/water-companies-pay-national-scandal-gmb-union-says","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T23:01:29Z","webTitle":"Water bosses' £58m pay over last five years a 'national scandal'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/05/water-companies-pay-national-scandal-gmb-union-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/05/water-companies-pay-national-scandal-gmb-union-says","fields":{"headline":"Water bosses' £58m pay over last five years a 'national scandal'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The bosses of England’s privatised water companies have been criticised for banking £58m in pay and benefits over the last five years while customers have been faced with above-inflation rises in their water bills. The GMB union said the chief executives of England’s nine water and sewage companies were “fat cats” earning “staggering sums” from the management of a natural resource. Tim Roache, GMB’s general secretary, said the pay awarded to water bosses was a national scandal and launched a campaign to return the industry to public ownership. Household water bills have risen by 40% above inflation since the industry was privatised in 1989, according to a National Audit Office report. The average bill this year will be £405, a 2% increase on last year, according to Water UK, the trade body that represents water and sewerage companies. “It’s a national scandal that over the last five years England’s hard-pressed water customers have been forced to splash out £58m through their bills to go into the pockets of just nine individuals,” Roache said. “Privatisation of the water industry has been a costly mistake and these eye-watering sums are further proof the water industry must be returned to public hands. “The GMB is urging people and politicians to Take Back the Tap and make our water services work for the many and not the few.” Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “Clearly the only people privatised water companies work for are the big bosses who are cleaning up at the expense of bill payers. It’s scandalous that the government is sitting idly by while households continue to face skyrocketing water costs. “Labour will end their failed ideological experiment and bring water companies back into public ownership, saving households £100 per year on their bills.’’ Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has also attacked water companies for paying their bosses large salaries and huge dividends to shareholders while contributing little or no tax. “One might hope that companies making such massive profits, paying out such big dividends and supporting such generous executive salaries, would be big contributors to the exchequer through their tax bill,” Gove said in a speech to industry executives earlier this year. “[But instead we have had] 10 years of shareholders getting millions, the chief executive getting hundreds of thousands, and the public purse getting nothing.” He said Anglian Water and Southern Water paid no corporation tax last year, while Thames Water “has paid no corporation tax for a decade”. Ofwat, the industry regulator, said that it had repeatedly told water companies that they must do more to make sure executive pay better reflects customer service. “We have been very clear that we want to see water company executives rewarded for delivering for customers – not just shareholders,” an Ofwat spokesman said. Liv Garfield, the chief executive of Severn Trent, was paid £2.45m last year, making her the UK’s best-paid water company boss. Garfield took home a salary of £674,000, a £615,000 bonus, and long-term incentive shares worth £975,000, a pension contribution of £168,000 and other benefits worth £18,000. Garfield’s total pay was down slightly from £2.49m in 2016, as her bonus decreased by £86,000. Following public and political pressure Severn Trent included “customer experience” in its bonus calculations last year. But the new metric only accounts for 8% of the total bonus compared to 47% for meeting profit targets. Over the past five years, Severn Trent has paid Garfield and her predecessor, Tony Wray, £10.5m. The company, which serves 4.5m across the Midlands, said: “Our priority is to perform for our customers, and our performance on those measures that matter most to our customers, such as preventing sewer flooding, has been strong. Executive pay is based on a range of challenging performance targets and is in line with pay at companies of a similar size.” The second-highest paid water company boss, according to GMB’s research, is the United Utilities chief executive Steve Mogford, who collected £2.3m. His pay has increased by 49% since 2013. A company spokesperson said: “The vast majority of Steve Mogford’s remuneration is linked to the delivery of stretching targets aimed at further improving customer service, operation delivery and environmental performance. In 2017, his total remuneration was approximately half the average for a FTSE 100 CEO.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/jun/04/how-was-your-weekend-running","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T10:50:52Z","webTitle":"How was your weekend running?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/jun/04/how-was-your-weekend-running","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2018/jun/04/how-was-your-weekend-running","fields":{"headline":"How was your weekend running?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s certainly been a year of extreme marathon running: I don’t think many people entering Stockholm marathon will have expected temperatures in the high 20s (the average for June is 16, after all).

It can’t be my alarm, because my phone says it’s 5am. And the sound is coming from outside. I close my eyes, but the noise – a weird, honking klaxon – doesn’t stop. I get up and go to the open window, where I immediately spot the source: a crow bothering a fox. The fox is walking along the top of a back garden wall. The crow follows closely, emitting its grating distress call. The fox is progressing as nonchalantly as possible – as if to make it clear that he and the crow aren’t together – but every few metres he turns and makes a desultory lunge at the bird, enough to send it briefly skyward. As soon as the fox turns back, the crow lands and starts up again. From where I’m standing, it looks like two animals performing a fable and I want to see how it ends. Eventually, the fox gets fed up and jumps down off the wall and the crow flies away in the other direction. It’s unclear what lesson is to be drawn from this outcome, other than Crows Don’t Care What Time It Is. My wife, who has slept through the whole business, wakes up as soon as I sit back down on the bed. “What are you doing?” she asks. “It’s 6am!” “It’s five, actually,” I say. “I’ve just seen a…” “Go to sleep,” she says. A few hours later, I am sat in the garden, listening to my wife shout into her phone in the kitchen. “Such a lovely day!” she says. She’s right, I think – it is a nice day. “That’s a good idea!” my wife says. “Why don’t you all come here?” I think: uh-oh. “It’s not too far!” she shouts. “It’s only Acton!” I think: who is she talking to? “Well, if you insist,” my wife says. “Thank you very much.” I think: phew! “Do I have to bring him?” my wife says. “I could just leave him here.” I think: uh-oh. The phone call is followed by another. Eventually, my wife comes to the back door. “We’ve been invited to lunch,” she says. “I know,” I say. “I said I wasn’t going to bring you, but they’ve insisted,” she says. “I heard,” I reply. “Everyone in the whole street heard.” “We’ll take a taxi,” she says. “Be ready in an hour.” An hour later, the taxi has not arrived. My wife is standing in the street, sunglasses on, looking at her phone. “There was a problem,” she says. “But a new car has been ordered.” Still looking down at her phone, she starts off in an easterly direction. “Where are you going?” I ask. “What?” she says. “Are you planning to meet the cab halfway?” I say “I can’t hear you from over there,” my wife says. I catch up to her, but she keeps walking, three doors down, then four doors. “It’s just that, if the pick-up address is our house, then we should probably be standing outside our…” “I still can’t hear you,” she says, heading for the corner. “One cab has gone missing already,” I say, catching up. “If we’re not where we’re supposed to be, then…” “What are you on about?” she says, suddenly lunging at me and sending me briefly skyward. Up until this point, I’d been imagining myself as the fox in this situation. In the taxi, I take out my phone. My wife, meanwhile, decides she’s in the mood for conversation. She lifts her sunglasses and contemplates the back of her hands. “Christ, I’m old,” she says. “Hmm,” I say. “I’ve got lovely arms, though, haven’t I?” she says, holding them out for me. I stare at them, thinking like a crow. “You’ve got one thin arm,” I say. “What do you mean?” she says. “The near one is much thinner,” I say, pointing. “I can’t tell the difference,” she says. “Are you kidding?” I say. “I don’t believe you,” she says. “Take a picture of my arms!” Later that night, I scroll through my now extensive collection of photos of my wife’s arms, marvelling at how similar they look."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/04/talking-horses-monday-leicester-windsor-ayr-royal-ascot","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T10:26:07Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Beringer the pick at Leicester as Ascot run-up begins | Greg Wood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/04/talking-horses-monday-leicester-windsor-ayr-royal-ascot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/04/talking-horses-monday-leicester-windsor-ayr-royal-ascot","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Beringer the pick at Leicester as Ascot run-up begins","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The fortnight or so between Epsom’s Derby meeting and Royal Ascot – which opens on 19 June – inevitably sees a dip in the quality of the horses on the track, but the programme is full to bursting point with fixtures and there seem to be more than enough horses to fill the races. Leicester’s card this afternoon has two 17-runner handicaps and a 16-strong maiden, while Windsor this evening has double-figure fields throughout the card and the average field is more than 10 at Ayr as well. There is even a Classic winner on the card at Leicester in the shape of Unforgetable Filly, who took the German equivalent of the 1,000 Guineas last year. She has yet to race this season, however, and seems unlikely to cope with Roger Varian’s progressive Sheikha Reika (3.10), one of only two runners on today’s Flat cards that seems likely to set off at odds-on. Beringer (3.40) offers a better rate of return in the subsequent handicap. Alan King has a solid record with his relatively small number of runners on the Flat, and does particularly well with three-year-old handicappers at middle distances, where he has an 18% strike rate over the past five years. Beringer fits the profile well and looks ready to register a first win since last July now having finished a good second in a fair time at Newmarket last month despite looking ill at ease on the track. Silent Echo (7.15) will be hard to beat in the sprint handicap at Windsor this evening, while Nazzaa (7.45) could prove to be an interesting each-way chance on the same card. Few horses can have depreciated as thoroughly as Steve Flook’s gelding, who cost 550,000 Guineas as a yearling but had lost 99.9% of his value by the time he was sold for just £600 as a three-year-old. The original price was due to Nazzaa’s pedigree, as he is a half-brother by Shamardal to Elusive Wave, a French Guineas winner in 2009. Flook’s £600 investment has already been rewarded with a win at Nottingham last August, and since Nazzaa’s pedigree also includes stayers, it is just possible that he will find a little more improvement as he steps up in trip today. Luis Vas De Torres (7.30) beat two subsequent winners last time and should go well at Ayr, while Muscika (8.00) was successful in the card’s sprint handicap last year and is 4lb lower in the weights now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/04/monsanto-to-ditch-its-infamous-name-after-sale-to-bayer","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T12:42:59Z","webTitle":"Monsanto to ditch its infamous name after sale to Bayer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/04/monsanto-to-ditch-its-infamous-name-after-sale-to-bayer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/04/monsanto-to-ditch-its-infamous-name-after-sale-to-bayer","fields":{"headline":"Monsanto to ditch its infamous name after sale to Bayer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Monsanto company name, which has become synonymous with genetically modified food and as a longstanding target of environmental activists, will disappear after the completion of its $63bn (£47bn) sale to the German company Bayer on Thursday. Bayer, a pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant, said on Monday it would immediately retire the 117-year-old Monsanto brand name. “Bayer will remain the company name. Monsanto will no longer be a company name,” it said in a statement. “The acquired products will retain their brand names and become part of the Bayer portfolio.” Monsanto has long been targeted by environmental activists for its pioneering role in creating GM crops and the deadly herbicide Agent Orange, used by the US in the Vietnam war. The company, which was founded in St Louis, Missouri, in 1901, has been described as an “example of American corporate evil”. Bayer’s chairman, Werner Baumann, promised the company would engage with campaigners, who have described the takeover as a “marriage made in hell”. “We aim to deepen our dialogue with society. We will listen to our critics and work together where we find common ground,” Baumann said. “Agriculture is too important to allow ideological differences to bring progress to a standstill. We have to talk to each other. We need to listen to each other. It’s the only way to build bridges.” Adrian Bebb, a food and farming campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, said Bayer’s decision to ditch the Monsanto name would not alter the company’s legacy. “Bayer will become Monsanto in all but name unless it takes drastic measures to distance itself from the US chemical giant’s controversial past,” he said. “If it continues to peddle dangerous pesticides and unwanted GMOs then it will quickly find itself dealing with the same global resistance that Monsanto did.” Friends of the Earth has run a long campaign to try to prevent the takeover, which it warned would “increase control over farmers and cut out competitors, and allow it to become the dominant ‘Facebook of farming’.” In May, dozens of people demonstrated against the takeover outside Bayer’s AGM in Bonn. “This merger will create the world’s biggest and most powerful agribusiness corporation, which will try to force its genetically modified seeds and toxic pesticides into our food and countryside,” Bebb said. “The coming together of these two is a marriage made in hell – bad for farmers, bad for consumers and bad for our countryside.” Bayer won approval for the takeover from US and European regulators after agreeing to sell $9bn worth of assets to reduce the combined companies’ dominance of the global seeds market. “The acquisition of Monsanto is a strategic milestone in strengthening our portfolio of leading businesses in health and nutrition,” Baumann said. “We will double the size of our agriculture business and create a leading innovation engine in agriculture, positioning us to better serve our customers and unlock the long-term growth potential in the sector.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/04/manchester-drug-gang-jailed-over-largest-seizure-of-heroin-in-city","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T11:29:41Z","webTitle":"Manchester drug gang jailed over largest seizure of heroin in city","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/04/manchester-drug-gang-jailed-over-largest-seizure-of-heroin-in-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/04/manchester-drug-gang-jailed-over-largest-seizure-of-heroin-in-city","fields":{"headline":"Manchester drug gang jailed over largest seizure of heroin in city","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The leader of a drug ring has been jailed along with six associates after 210kg of high purity heroin was found hidden in tables in Greater Manchester last year. Fikri Yarasir, known as Mario because of his resemblance to the Nintendo videogame character, given a 25-year sentence for smuggling the largest haul of heroin Greater Manchester police has intercepted. Forensic tests proved the drugs were of such high purity that they would yield a street value of about £63m. Yarasir, 53, of Glossop on the edge of the Peak District, was under surveillance in August when he met a lorry with Turkish number plates and led it to an industrial unit in Salford. Undercover officers watched as he met Ahmet Taskin, 45, also from Glossop, who helped him move the cargo of furniture into the unit. While it was unattended, officers entered the unit and found 42 tables, inside which were hidden bags containing heroin. On the same day, officers entered a lockup in Rhyl, Wales, where they discovered equipment set up for a “bash house” – where drugs can be diluted with other substances to increase value – including a hydraulic press for compressing drugs. Detectives worked out that proceeds from the deal had been directed through a company run by Brian Kennedy, 37, from Fife. The firm, Freight Forward, had only one customer: Fikri “Mario” Yarasir. Kennedy was jailed for 18 years on Monday. A number of other gang members were also jailed, including Kathryn Fearon, 34, and her partner, Paul Livesey, 46, from Openshaw in Manchester. They were given sentences of nine and 15 years respectively on Monday. The couple were used as mules to transport money to Turkey, taking large amounts of cash with them and returning to the UK with significantly lighter luggage. Officers worked out that the missing weight was the cash they were spending, which totalled aabout £372,500, all on behalf of Yarasir. Taskin was the only person to plead guilty at the earliest possible time, and was sentenced to 13 and a half years for importing class A drugs. The rest of the group denied the charges, which led to a seven-week trial. Steven Hindley, 28, from Kinmel Bay in Rhyl, who hired the lockup, was sentenced to 15 years for conspiracy to supply class A drugs, along with David Mulligan, 27. During the trial, Yarasir claimed he was only involved with his fellow defendants to gain intelligence and become a police informant. The jury did not believe him, having heard Yarasir had served 10 years in prison in Germany in 1997 for importing heroin from Turkey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/04/germany-leroy-sane-world-cup-squad","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T10:35:54Z","webTitle":"Leroy Sané left out of Germany’s World Cup squad by Joachim Löw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/04/germany-leroy-sane-world-cup-squad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/04/germany-leroy-sane-world-cup-squad","fields":{"headline":"Leroy Sané left out of Germany’s World Cup squad by Joachim Löw","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Manchester City winger Leroy Sané has been omitted from Germany’s final 23-man World Cup squad. Sané, who won the PFA young player of year award after helping City to secure the Premier League title, missed out to Julian Brandt of Bayer Leverkusen while the manager, Joachim Löw, also opted to cut Bernd Leno, Jonathan Tah and Nils Petersen from his squad. “There are certainly better days in the life of a national coach than when you must send four great players home who would have deserved to be at a World Cup,” Löw said at the team’s training camp in South Tyrol, Italy. “You have to look at the big picture so we have a variable and well-balanced team prepared for all eventualities. We have good players on the wing in Thomas Müller and Marco Reus. Julian Draxler played a good Confed Cup and made progress there. “It was a tight race between Leroy Sané and Julian Brandt. Both have big qualities, both are good in the one-on-one duels. Julian Brandt was at the Confed Cup, had some strong games there, and put in good shifts in the training camp too. Leroy Sané is a huge talent, no doubt, and he will be back with the team in September.” Sané has so far won 12 caps for Germany but he has yet to find the back of the net for his national team. He has also only set up one goal. “Maybe he has not fully arrived in the national team games. Maybe that tipped the balance,” Löw said. “He did a good job against Austria, tried to work in defence, went into the transition play. No blame here. And his behaviour off the pitch was good as well.” There were places for Sané’s City team-mate Ilkay Gündogan, Arsenal’s Mesut Özil and Chelsea’s Antonio Rüdiger, as well as the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who has been appointed team captain despite his long recovery from injury.

But Sunday night’s final threw another into the mix: disability. This series has been notable for how many contestants have identified as having a disability, including a child singer with autism and a dancer who became a wheelchair user after the Manchester arena bombing. In the end, the top two spots went to disabled comedians: Robert White, who has Asperger’s, and the winner, Lost Voice Guy, who has cerebral palsy. It feels particularly subversive that White and LVG, whose real name is Lee Ridley, did not shy away from disability as part of their acts. LVG, who performed using an electronic voice box, relentlessly skewered perceptions of disability and the awkwardness that often surrounds non-disabled people’s interaction with it. Comedy and disability in Britain have a dire track record – see jokes by everyone from Jimmy Carr to Frankie Boyle. There are few more unappealing sights than a non-disabled comedian encouraging a crowd to laugh at disabled people. As LVG joked: “People often ask me why I want to put myself in the position where everyone can stare and laugh at me. The truth is, it happens every day anyway. At least this time there’s a time and a place for it.” BGT was not without its faults. “So many people are going to be inspired by you. And, for that, you’ve already won,” Alesha Dixon said at one point as the inspiration trope reared its head. There was also the pity factor. At times, I worried the general population’s expectations of disabled people were so low that they would vote for one of us simply for managing to get out of bed in the morning. Yet, with the audience in hysterics at LVG’s final performance, it felt as though his act was embraced on equal terms. Talent show wins seems a trite measure of success for minorities, but the impact of popular culture and representation should not be underestimated. Such acts go further in normalising disability and challenging society than any charity campaigns. In the words of LVG: “I hope you’ve had fun laughing at a disabled man. Goodbye.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/05/confusing-search-warrant-rules-need-overhaul-finds-review","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T23:01:29Z","webTitle":"'Confusing' search warrant rules need overhaul, finds review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/confusing-search-warrant-rules-need-overhaul-finds-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/confusing-search-warrant-rules-need-overhaul-finds-review","fields":{"headline":"'Confusing' search warrant rules need overhaul, finds review","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Law Commission has called for the public to be given greater protections from search warrants and said the complexity of current regulations has led to frequent errors and the risk of challenges. The commission said the current system for granting warrants is too complicated and there is a risk applications are not prepared properly or given sufficient scrutiny. It added that investigations may be significantly hindered as search warrants do not reflect a modern world in which the internet and digital sources play a significant role. A search warrant is a written order authorising a police officer to enter a building to search and seize material of a kind specified in the warrant. The most common type is issued under section eight of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, also known as PACE. The justice, or judge, must be satisfied there is reason to believe that an indictable offence has been committed and that relevant evidence can be found on the premises. However, with more than 175 different issuing statutory powers available to investigators when applying for a warrant, it can be difficult to know which one is most appropriate since they often overlap. Drafting errors may also occur which can make the warrant itself and any search unlawful. The current system, the commission said, left the public unsure of the extent of the state’s power, what rights they have, and how to challenge a warrant. In a well-received report, the independent body has recommended a streamlined system that would both clarify and rationalise the often-overlapping regulation. The complicated current procedural nature means judges and magistrates can perceive issuing a search warrant as a rubber-stamping exercise to be swiftly dealt with before the “real” judging work of the day can begin. In one case, an SFO probe was forced to end after the Tchenguiz brothers, a pair of property tycoons, successfully challenged the manner that the agency had obtained its search warrants. It emerged that the issuing judge, in a 20-minute hearing, asked just one question – about the street name. The resulting case is understood to have cost taxpayers £7.5m. There have been more than 50 reported judicial reviews relating to search warrants, or the conduct of a search. “Search warrants serve an important purpose and are vital to successful criminal investigations,” said the Law Commissioner professor David Ormerod QC. “But the law has to strike a balance between the powers of the state and the rights of individuals. “Our proposals would simplify the law and modernise the powers needed by law enforcement to investigate serious crime. “But, crucially, alongside that, they would extend protections so that people know that a search under a warrant is limited to what is necessary and proportionate.” The review, which was commissioned by the Home Office in December 2016, was welcomed by both law enforcement figures and campaigners. “I welcome this review as there can be no doubt that the current legislative landscape can, at times, create confusion and inconsistency in approaches,” said the director-general of the National Crime Agency, Lynne Owens. “This becomes ever more complex as electronic evidence becomes a staple of almost every investigation.” Privacy International welcomed the “timely” recommendations, specifically its proposals in relation to police powers to search or copy data from smartphones and computers. “The lawful basis for the use of ‘mobile phone extraction’ is confused and unclear,” said Millie Graham Wood, a solicitor at the human rights charity, which called for a full investigation into the use of technology which allows police to raid mobile phones without a warrant. “It is deeply concerning that some police forces are relying on the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, a law introduced before the existence of the most rudimentary mobile phones, to justify searching modern and sophisticated smartphones that hold vast amounts of personal information about us.” Proposed measures will also exempt confidential journalistic material and medical records from searches under warrant. This will bring together various current laws into one uniform set of rules. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We recognise the need to reform the law governing search warrants and that is why we invited the Law Commission to conduct this review. “We welcome the work done so far which underpins this consultation exercise, and look forward to considering conclusions and recommendations of the Commission’s final report when it is published.” The consultation on the proposals will run until 5 September.

However, through May, the season kicked into life and, over the past week, further tornadic thunderstorms have produced severe weather. One tornado damaged several homes in Gillette, Wyoming, last Friday as well as injuring a number of people. Meanwhile, in Maryland in the eastern US, 20cm (8in) of rain fell in just one day in the historic Ellicott City, resulting in flooding that devastated the centre of the city and claimed the life of one citizen. The torrential rain and flash flooding came just two years after a similar flood tore through the city. Following extreme heat recently across parts of India and Pakistan, the monsoon season has begun over the past 10 days in south-western India, creating new rainfall records. In Mangaluru, 334mm (13in) of rain fell in just in 24 hours during Tuesday of last week.

Before he begins talking animatedly for two hours about sex workers, mental health, skeletons, transgender issues, Theresa May, the agony of Loris Karius, the hounding of Raheem Sterling, why Piers Morgan is “a massive cock”, how to annoy Vladimir Putin, the World Cup and his dream of uniting disenfranchised people, Southall is on the brink of cancelling this interview. This should be a stress-free day back on Merseyside for the former Everton and Wales footballer, who was arguably the world’s best goalkeeper for a while in the 1980s, as he takes a break from his consuming job at a special needs school in Ebbw Vale. Before he became a celebrated footballer, Southall had been a hod-carrier, a binman and a cleaner. So it is not surprising that, aged 59, he should now work at a pupil referral unit – offering education for children excluded from mainstream schools. Southall is also an extraordinary presence on Twitter. He has 134,000 followers but, rather than plugging a product or spreading bile, Southall gives up his Twitter page regularly to people who would not normally have such a platform to address the challenges and inequities they face. On any given night Southall’s Twitter feed might contain intelligent explanations from people in the LGBT community, a drugs helpline, a suicide bereavement charity or a sex workers’ collective. Such generosity is on the verge of scuppering my plans. Southall, hearing of my hope for a detailed interview, is uncomfortable. He would prefer I speak first to some of the groups he is trying to help rather than have attention focused on him. Southall listens while it is explained that my primary interest is his collaborative work on Twitter. Typically, he says, “OK, then,” as we settle down for one of the most exhaustive and unusual conversations I’ve had under the modest banner of a sports interview. “I like Twitter because it brings me into contact with people I’d never meet,” Southall says. “I like what makes people tick. So I’m thinking: ‘How mentally strong have these women got to be in the sex industry?’ Even if you like it, at some stage you’re going to get hurt.” If many people become parochial and dogmatic as they grow older then Southall is on a quest to open himself up and learn. Before he allowed his Twitter page to become an occasional platform for sex workers, Southall admits his preconceptions. “I thought it was just people stuck on street corners. But when you talk to them they become real. If you cut them they bleed. If you tell them a joke they laugh sometimes. They hurt, they cry. Eventually they die the same as you and me. We think of them as statistics or problems but they can come from your family or friends. “When they first came on my Twitter I wasn’t sure how they’d be taken. But people listened because they are genuinely interested. How often do you get a chance to listen to a sex worker or ask them questions? People engaged positively and sensibly. I’ve got a bit of flak because if I stick up for sex workers some people think I’m supporting the trafficking of women. That’s stupid. It could be your mum, your daughter, your sister, your brother. You don’t know who is doing sex work. I’m trying to get across what they actually do and the barriers they face.” Southall adopts a similarly inclusive approach when working with people in drug awareness, the LGBT community and, “this week we have a big mental health push, a BAME evening, the police are coming on and people who address knife crime”. Which subject had the biggest impact? “The LGBT one. I got 30,000 new followers within a week. More importantly, I’m learning new stuff. I started with the LGBT stuff because if the kids at school ask a question I wouldn’t have a clue. But I spoke to a few Trans people about operations. They were really nice and explained stuff I knew nothing about.” Southall is driven by a grander idea. “It’s all about uniting people. If we could unite all sex workers that would change their lives for ever. The government would have to listen to them. If you unite all LGBT people there are millions. If you do the same with the mental health people and all the charities came together it would be powerful. Do you think Theresa May could ignore them then?” Does he get followed by many politicians? “Yeah, but I’ve blocked a few. I’ve also blocked people from the Sun.” What did Southall make of the furore last week over Raheem Sterling and calls for England to drop him because of a still-incomplete tattoo of a gun on his leg – which the Manchester City forward chose to have done in memory of his father who was shot dead when he was two years old? “That was brought up by some prick,” Southall snorts. “Piers Morgan is a prick. What gives him the right to say what can be on your body? If Sterling had tattooed a massive cock on his leg I would say: ‘It reminds me of Piers Morgan.’” There appears to be a racial undertow in the tabloids’ hounding of Sterling but Southall believes “he gets abused because he’s got lots of cash”. He says: “Anybody successful in this country gets tons of abuse. Harry Kane? Best thing since sliced bread. I bet at the World Cup he gets called a hopeless wanker. The Sun will be following all of them footballers around, hoping they fuck up. Why do we love Frank Bruno? We love people who allow us to say: ‘Oh, he’s a great loser.’ Fuck off. I was glad Kane said: ‘We should talk about winning it’ – because they can.” Is Southall looking forward to the World Cup? “I am – but it’s in the wrong country. Why would you go to a country where human rights are shit? Where homophobia is horrendous. England should have sent the LGBT team to represent them. Fuck Putin. ‘Here’s our gay team. What are you going to do now?’ Or they should send an all black team, just to annoy Putin.” Southall shows empathy for a fellow goalkeeper in Karius – who endured a nightmarish Champions League final. “You can’t change it,” he says when asked how he would console Karius. “But you can’t let two mistakes define your career. You either keep swimming or you drown. Of course I empathise with his pain. I know exactly what he’s going through. If I made a mistake, and it was my fault we lost, I wanted to kill somebody. I wanted to physically hurt somebody. Not because they’d done anything wrong but because that’s how I felt. “I think of the goal I let in from [Gheorghe] Hagi when we played Romania [in a vital 1993 World Cup qualifier which Wales lost]. I think of Norman Whiteside scoring for Man United in the [1985] FA Cup final [which Everton lost 1-0]. But I felt the same after making a mistake against Coventry or Leicester. You’ve still let everybody down. That’s why I liked my position. I was either fucking good or I wasn’t. When I made a mistake I couldn’t blame anybody else. As a keeper, it’s all down to belief. Karius has got to believe he’s a good keeper.” He has a special interest in England’s World Cup keepers because Jordan Pickford plays for Everton. “Pickford has a fair bit of talent but he could vary his service. Maybe he’s been under instructions to boot it as far as he can. I’d like to see him spend another year working on crosses and stand up more on one-on-ones. But he’s been the best English goalkeeper this season because I don’t think Jack Butland has played enough. I like him because he’s calm but I’d go with Pickford. My only concern is that Pickford’s always been busy because he’s played in teams with shit defences. If he spends 80-odd minutes doing nothing has he the concentration to suddenly make a good save?” Southall is even more animated when discussing homophobia in football. “I did a thing for the Rainbow Toffees [Everton’s LGBT supporters’ group] last month. It was great and it made me think the FA take the piss with their LGBT relations day. You wear some rainbow laces one day? “Is there anybody in the commentary team that’s within the LGBT community? No. Have you talked to any players? No. Do you have any LGBT people on the pitch? No. I said to them Rainbow Toffees I’d like Everton to be the first club to get their LGBT people on at half-time and play a five-a-side. Arsenal want to play us. We might get some stick. But I’m hoping Everton fans are sensible and people get used to it.” Will a gay Premier League footballer come out soon? “Yes, because the press will out him. The other day the Sun said they wouldn’t name that bisexual footballer because they didn’t think it was right. Fuck off. He probably got an injunction. But the first gay footballer will be a multimillionaire. The problem is that the FA are not proactive. I spoke to a gay referee and he said if you use the N-word you get sent off. If a fan says it he’s thrown out of the ground. But you don’t get sent off or chucked out for using a derogatory homophobic term.” Away from football, Southall’s disdain for the Conservative government is plain. “The day May killed me was when she spoke about ‘JAMs’ – people who are Just About Managing. I used to think she’d be a bit more compassionate but she’s colder than all the others.” Southall supports Labour, even if they frustrate him, and he says: “Jeremy Corbyn’s done all right. Whether you like him or hate him, he sticks to what he says. When he got made leader, people took the piss because he didn’t wear a suit. Well, he’s not Clark Kent. I thought: ‘If he don’t look like a politician, great. I don’t want a politician.’” One of Southall’s trademark Twitter witticisms has centred on bizarre jokes about skeletons which mock the Tories’ austerity cuts. “That started because I was asked to talk at some function for funeral directors in Croydon. I thought: ‘What the fuck do I say?’ I started talking about skeletons and it was a funny night. I said maybe we could replace lampstands with skeletons. It would be nice to have your uncle sat there in the lounge as a coffee table.” After a few engaging and surreal hours, Southall stays on to talk even when the tape is off. He tells me, movingly, about the two foster children he and his wife look after and he finds new energy when compiling a list of people he wants me to contact. I feel even more uplifted when, in the following days, quotes pour in from some of those to whom he has offered a Twitter platform. Appreciation of Southall’s generosity and openness illuminate their messages. But Jessa Jones, a sex worker, makes a telling point. “I was surprised that the first thing Neville asked upon learning what I do for a living is: ‘What do sex workers want to make their lives better?’” Jones reveals. “I can’t speak for all sex workers but, personally, I welcome input from Neville and like-minded people. However, when sex workers are listened to, without a high‑profile figure piquing public interest first, we may finally have made some progress.” In the face of such fierce eloquence I can imagine Southall nodding and smiling, happy that the final words of this interview are not his own."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business-to-business/2018/jun/12/whats-fuelling-athens-burgeoning-startup-scene","type":"article","sectionId":"business-to-business","sectionName":"Business to business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T13:06:20Z","webTitle":"What's fuelling Athens' burgeoning startup scene?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2018/jun/12/whats-fuelling-athens-burgeoning-startup-scene","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business-to-business/2018/jun/12/whats-fuelling-athens-burgeoning-startup-scene","fields":{"headline":"What's fuelling Athens' burgeoning startup scene?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On the surface, Athens doesn’t seem like the best place to start a business. Since the country’s financial crisis almost a decade ago, about one in five small businesses have folded and unemployment levels still hover around 20%. However, the local startup scene is enjoying some surprising successes, fuelled by a talented and ambitious young workforce who have found themselves unable to rely on traditional employment routes. These include recruitment software company Workable, which has raised more than €29m (£25.5m) in local and international funding, and ride-hailing app Taxibeat, which was sold to automotive company Daimler for an undisclosed amount last year. And 2018 may be the best year yet for those with similar goals. The Equifund fund-of-funds programme, which launched this year and is backed by the Greek government, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, is offering a total of €300m to Greek-founded startups and is aiming to back around 200 early-stage companies over the next five years. “Before the crisis, if you asked students what they wanted to do, they would have said they wanted to freelance or work in the public sector,” says Giorgos Gatos, sales development director at Workable. “Now, most of them want to start or join a tech company.” This trend is not unique to Greece – startups have become a fashionable career choice for graduates all over the world. But many in Athens see this as the only option. “There’s no fallback – we don’t have the option of getting a job in the city first,” says Panos Papadopoulos, a former startup founder who now runs Equifund-backed Marathon VC. “Large Greek companies don’t offer progress in skills, salary or prospects. Joining a startup is the best career here.” The country’s economic woes have been well documented, but a significant milestone is within reach with less than three months until its third bailout programme expires. Greece has long been plagued by notoriously unfriendly business policies, namely impenetrable red tape. However, according to Stavros Messinis, who co-founded Athens’ first co-working space, The Cube, in 2013, “things are getting easier. You can, for example, register a business online now. “Traditionally, Greek society has been quite risk-averse. But the generation that is graduating now is changing that.” Projects such as Mindspace, which aims to help students and young graduates transfer their skills and knowledge to the entrepreneurial space, are working to increase this cultural shift – in 2017 its Challenge project resulted in five new companies and 30 jobs. Messinis also explains that some aspects of Greek culture – such as the fact people often stay living with parents throughout their 20s – are conducive to founding a company. “It gives you the space to play around with different options,” he says. One of Greece’s much-publicised struggles has been its youth “brain drain”, with about 180,000 graduates leaving the country in the past eight years. But Gatos, who co-founded his first startup, Incrediblue, in 2007 before joining Workable, says the Greek startup ecosystem is benefitting from the skills these talented workers learn overseas – and subsequently bring home. “We’re seeing a lot of Greek founders who have started something abroad setting up subsidiaries or operations here,” he explains. Papadopoulos is actively working to drive this “brain gain” phenomenon by offering investment to Greek founders living overseas, on the condition they open a subsidiary in the country. According to the European Startup Monitor, 75% of Greek company founders are residents of other countries. Given the impact that both the financial and refugee crises have had on the country, it’s no surprise that one unique aspect of the Athens startup scene is how much it overlaps with the humanitarian space. For example, as well as servicing startups, The Cube also runs a coding school and computer exchange programme for refugees, and Impact Hub Athens is home to a large number of socially-focused enterprises. Campfire Innovation, which is based at The Cube, is dedicated to helping social enterprises and non-profits communicate, scale and think in a more entrepreneurial way. “We’ve seen so many social projects started not just by Greeks but by international volunteers who have come to help out,” says founder Ioanna Theodorou. “What we’re trying to avoid is Greece simply becoming a crisis tourism destination, and instead becoming a centre for innovation in the humanitarian space.” What she’d like to see is “some kind of impact funding model [funding based on both economic return and social impact], as that doesn’t exist right now in Greece.” While there is excitement about the rapid changes taking place in the startup scene, people are cautious about making claims as to how much they will help the overall economy. “Unemployment in the 18-25 age range is still more than 40% – you would need thousands of new companies to make a dent in those metrics,” says Gatos. “There are opportunities being created for good people to advance, but it’s not something Greek society can rely on to solve its issues.” Another problem is the lack of startup-specific policies, which have worked to turn other European cities into tech hubs. “My biggest complaint [with our system] is that corporate taxes are too high,” Papadopoulos explains. “I would like to see the government offer incentives to those returning to the country.” However, he is optimistic about the overall outlook for the next few years. “Not everything is going to become high growth, but I think we will see a lot of interesting small companies started by younger people,” he says. “There’s a lot of muscle and a lot of opportunity to make things happen right now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/04/world-cup-belgium-squad-vincent-kompany","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T08:52:19Z","webTitle":"Vincent Kompany included in Belgium’s World Cup squad despite injury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/04/world-cup-belgium-squad-vincent-kompany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/04/world-cup-belgium-squad-vincent-kompany","fields":{"headline":"Vincent Kompany included in Belgium’s World Cup squad despite injury","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vincent Kompany has been included in Belgium’s 23-man World Cup squad despite picking up a groin injury during a friendly on Saturday. The veteran defender walked off the field early in the second half of Belgium’s 0-0 draw with Portugal without waiting to be substituted. The Belgium coach Roberto Martínez said Kompany felt discomfort in his groin after overstretching in a challenge. Martínez also named the Los Angeles FC defender Laurent Ciman as a reserve in case Kompany’s injury proves too serious for him to play in Russia. Martínez said he will wait until the eve of Belgium’s opening World Cup match, against Panama on 18 June, before making a final decision on Kompany’s fitness. “Until 24 hours before we can still make a replacement,” he said. “We need to wait a period of seven, eight days with Vincent Kompany. Then we will get a good opportunity to make a diagnosis. “Vincent Kompany is a true leader. He performed in a fantastic manner when he was on the pitch. His leadership is essential for us.” The former Manchester United forward Adnan Januzaj was a surprise inclusion, while the Crystal Palace striker Christian Benteke was one of five players to miss out, as well as the goalkeeper Matz Sels, Watford’s Christian Kabasele and Jordan Lukaku. Belgium are in Group G in the World Cup where they will also face England and Tunisia. Salah named in Egypt squad Mohamed Salah has been named in Egypt’s World Cup squad despite the Liverpool forward being injured in the Champions League final. Salah, 25, will not join his team-mates until 9 June as he continues his recovery from a shoulder injury, his national team said. Egypt’s opening World Cup fixture is against Uruguay on 15 June. Jordan Pickford appears to have won the race to be England’s first-choice goalkeeper at the World Cup after being handed the No1 jersey. The confirmation of England’s 23-man squad was listed on the Fifa website and contained no last-minute changes to the names originally selected by manager Gareth Southgate last month. Elsewhere, captain Harry Kane will sport the number 9 while Tottenham team-mate Dele Alli will wear 20 - in keeping with their Spurs squad numbers. Uncapped Liverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who could make his debut in Thursday’s friendly against Costa Rica, has been given the number 22 shirt. Meanwhile, the midfielder Sergio Peña was the unlucky player to miss out as Peru finalised their 23-man squad for the World Cup on Monday. Peña was forced to make way for the captain, Paolo Guerrero, who has been freed to take part at the tournament after the Swiss Federal Tribunal agreed to temporarily lift a 14-month doping ban pending an appeal. Guerrero, who tested positive for a cocaine byproduct contained in a tea and which he said he ingested unknowingly, was freed to take part on Thursday and scored twice in the 3-0 win against Saudi Arabia on Sunday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/04/i-wanted-to-make-a-change-knowing-older-people-suffer-from-loneliness-","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T12:05:10Z","webTitle":"'I wanted to make a change knowing older people suffer from loneliness'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/04/i-wanted-to-make-a-change-knowing-older-people-suffer-from-loneliness-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/04/i-wanted-to-make-a-change-knowing-older-people-suffer-from-loneliness-","fields":{"headline":"'I wanted to make a change knowing older people suffer from loneliness'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One of the most memorable volunteering moments for Loraine Coleman was when she received a call from another volunteer who works for the Metropolitan police. “Loraine, I’ve found a pair of false teeth in the back of my car ... What do I do?” “Well, give them back. I assume they aren’t yours? Who did you take home after the tea party?” “Er, Peggy, Joan and Alan...” “Well there’s your answer.” “What do you mean? What should I do?” “You’re the detective!” Coleman, 62, from Thurrock always planned to volunteer with older people when she retired: “I knew there was such a big gap in the care and support this generation receive and I found the thought heartbreaking - no one should have to feel lonely and stuck at home.” Since she started volunteering with her husband Mick for Contact the Elderly in 2015, her team of volunteers have set up seven groups in Thurrock. By hosting tea parties for groups of ten, for those aged 75 and older who live on their own, Coleman and her team regularly provide support, friendship and companionship for almost 80 of the most isolated older people in the community. “Working with my older neighbours is very rewarding and a lot of fun,” she says. “To hear their stories, the hardships they have overcome, and their experiences and lessons, is inspiring. I feel like I’m making a positive difference to the lives of other by sharing my time with them, helping older people stay active, social and making clear to them they are valued by our community.” As an area coordinator, Coleman helps organise social events and recruits and manages volunteers, without whom none of the work would be possible: “The 63 volunteers we have are truly incredible and are a constant source of inspiration for me. So many go above and beyond what’s asked, giving their time, energy and kindness, just because they care. I’ve found so much enthusiasm from people wanting to make the lives of our older neighbours better. “I’ve met so many amazing people from all walks of life. It’s one of the best things I’ve ever done and it’s enriched my life so much. I feel very much a part of a growing charity that focuses on reducing loneliness and isolation with our elderly. Our ageing population will require much support over the years and I am looking forward to this challenge and making a difference by helping today’s generation of older people live and enjoy the old age that they deserve.” You can tell us about the volunteering you do by getting in touch with us here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/04/surreal-moment-guardian-destroyed-snowden-files","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T17:00:21Z","webTitle":"The surreal moment the Guardian destroyed the Snowden files","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/04/surreal-moment-guardian-destroyed-snowden-files","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/04/surreal-moment-guardian-destroyed-snowden-files","fields":{"headline":"The surreal moment the Guardian destroyed the Snowden files","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The prime minister’s deputy national security adviser was punctiliously polite, but firm. We want the computer disks back, he said. We want to do forensics on them. We want to find the trail. It had been almost five weeks since the Guardian’s publication of the Snowden files caused a sensation, exposing the secret global network of surveillance that allowed the UK and the US to spy on friends and enemies alike. Earlier, in one morning meeting, the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, had told us: “The prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the foreign secretary, the home secretary, the attorney general, and others in government, have got a problem with you. We want the material back.” So, with the threat of legal action hanging over the organisation – and the real prospect of our reporting being closed down – negotiations began. The deputy national security adviser was replaced by two amiable GCHQ officers. Negotiations were straightforward: “We’ll take the computers away and inspect them,” said GCHQ. “No, you can’t do that.” “OK, we’ll take the computers away, inspect them and destroy them.” “No, you can’t do that.” “We’ll destroy the hard drives in front of you and take away the remains.” “No, you can’t do that. How about we destroy the hard drives and memory cards while you watch?” “You haven’t got the equipment.” “We’ll buy it.” “You’ll need a degausser.” “What’s that?” “It erases the magnetic field on the hard disks.” “We’ll buy one on eBay.” “They cost £25k.” “Oh, right. We’ll use yours.” It turns out it’s quite difficult to destroy a MacBook. Even with the degausser, angle-grinders, dremels (drills with high-speed rotating bits), masks, gloves – and a lot of smoke and sparks – it was a couple of hours’ work. All under the gaze of GCHQ operatives in a concrete room in the basement of the Guardian’s Kings Place offices. And we kept the remnants. By the afternoon of Saturday 20 July, the job was done. A purely symbolic act had been carried out. The government and GCHQ knew, because we had told them, that the material had been taken to the US to be shared with the New York Times. The reporting would go on. The episode hadn’t changed anything. On the way home, still coughing up dust, the phone rang. It was the PM’s deputy national security adviser. He thanked us for what we’d done.

The Israeli prime minister has signalled a desire to keep talks focused on his archenemy. “I will meet there with three leaders and will discuss two subjects: Iran and Iran,” he said at the airport ahead of his trip on Monday. However, the 68-year-old leader is likely to face queries about the Israeli military’s recent use of live fire against Palestinian protesters in Gaza. Troops have killed more than 120 people along the frontier and shot thousands more during two months of rallies calling, among other demands, for an end to Israel’s blockade of the coastal enclave. The army points to attempts to damage the perimeter fence with explosives and set fields alight in Israel using firebombs, moves that undermine claims by Gaza’s rulers Hamas that the movement is entirely peaceful. However, most of the dead and wounded were unarmed. On Friday, a female volunteer medic was shot dead. Netanyahu flew on Monday morning to Berlin, where he is due to meet Angela Merkel, before flying to Paris to speak with Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. He will then travel to Britain for a meeting with Theresa May. His visit follows a diplomatic victory last month when the US president, Donald Trump, announced Washington was withdrawing from the nuclear agreement. The hawkish Israeli premier – who calls the Iranian government a “terrorist regime” – has long led lobbying efforts against the deal. Signed in 2015 under the leadership of Barack Obama, the landmark accord traded sanction relief on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. The UK, France and Germany, also parties to the agreement, issued a statement soon after Trump’s declaration expressing their “regret and concern” and emphasising their “continuing commitment” to the deal. Iran has also continued to abide by the agreement. However, several top officials have suggested it may resume its enrichment activities unless the European Union presents a compensation package to make up for income loss resulting from the fresh US sanctions. Trump and Netanyahu have criticised the deal’s perceived shortcomings, warning about “sunset” provisions that end restrictions on nuclear activities after 10 years, as well as permitting the continued development of long-range missiles. In a televised presentation days before Trump was due to make a decision, Netanyahu revealed what he said was new evidence of Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The material shown did not present a breach of the deal but European leaders suggested it showed evidence of Iran’s pre-2015 nuclear programme that they said only reinforced the need for the agreement, which includes regular inspections. Netanyahu said he would share the stolen cache with the US and other countries and is expected to discuss the findings during his trip. The Middle East has been on edge following Trump’s withdrawal. Less than two days after the announcement, Israel accused Iranian forces in Syria of firing rockets at its forces in the Golan Heights, the first direct strikes on Israeli positions. Israel responded with its most extensive attack on Syria for decades. The Netanyahu visit came as the director general of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said his inspectors had access to all the sites his team needed to visit in Iran. Speaking in Vienna at the first meeting of the IAEA’s board of governors since Trump threw the future of the deal in doubt, Yukiya Amano rebutted suggestions that Iran was not cooperating. Netanyahu’s European visit is in some ways targeted at the credibility of the IAEA. The majority of the board’s members are likely to issue statements through the week challenging the US decision to withdraw, and the repeated Israeli intelligence claim that Iran is secretly preparing a nuclear bomb. Amano urged Tehran to go further in showing its willingness to reassure, saying “timely and proactive cooperation by Iran in providing such access would facilitate implementation ... and enhance confidence”. Some diplomats say Tehran could, for example, invite inspectors to sites they had not demanded access to. In its last report, the IAEA confirmed Iran was still implementing the accord. The other signatories to the 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action are still working on economic measures to keep the nuclear deal alive. None of the European powers are likely to accept Netanyahu’s criticisms of the deal. The EU has urged Israel to send any secret information about non-compliance to the IAEA. Netanyahu will also use his European tour to warn against Iran’s military entrenchment in its northern neighbour, where Tehran has sent forces to support President Assad in a devastating seven-year civil war. Israel has repeatedly warned it will not tolerate Iranian forces so close and has conducted repeated overt and covert strikes on Syrian bases that house Iranian troops, drones and munitions. Officials in Russia, an Assad ally that also has forces in Syria, have hinted in recent days that there may soon be an agreement for Iran to move its garrisons away from Israeli territory, but there has been no confirmation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/05/south-australia-rides-renewables-boom-to-become-electricity-exporter","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T18:00:22Z","webTitle":"South Australia rides renewables boom to become electricity exporter | Giles Parkinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/south-australia-rides-renewables-boom-to-become-electricity-exporter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/south-australia-rides-renewables-boom-to-become-electricity-exporter","fields":{"headline":"South Australia rides renewables boom to become electricity exporter","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The politics may not change much, but Australia’s electricity grid is changing before our very eyes – slowly and inevitably becoming more renewable, more decentralised, and challenging the pre-conceptions of many in the industry. The latest national emissions audit from The Australia Institute, which includes an update on key electricity trends in the national electricity market, notes some interesting developments over the last three months. • Renewables-rich South Australia became a net electricity exporter for first time; • 12 new wind and solar farms totalling 1050MW of capacity were added to the grid, including 500MW of large-scale solar, trebling the amount of large-scale solar in the system; • The continued rapid uptake of rooftop solar by homes and businesses kept a lid on grid demand, even if overall consumption showed a rise, and; • Electricity generation emissions in the national market fell again, but only slightly. The most surprising of those developments may be the South Australia achievement, which shows that since the closure of the Hazelwood brown coal generator in Victoria in March 2017, South Australia has become a net exporter of electricity, in net annualised terms. Hugh Saddler, lead author of the study, notes that this is a big change for South Australia, which in 1999 and 2000, when it had only gas and local coal, used to import 30% of its electricity demand. The fact that wholesale prices in South Australia were higher in other states – then, as they are now – has nothing to with wind and solar, but the fact that it has no low-cost conventional source and a peaky demand profile (then and now). “The difference today is that the state is now taking advantage of its abundant resources of wind and solar radiation, and the new technologies which have made them the lowest cost sources of new generation, to supply much of its electricity requirements,” Saddler writes. Other things to note about the flows between states is that Victoria was about equal on imports and exports with its three neighbouring states, despite the closure of Hazelwood. NSW continues to import around 10% of its needs from cheaper providers in Queensland. Gas-fired generation had increased in the last year or two in South Australia as a result of the Northern closure, but is still below the levels of a decade ago. But because it is expensive, this is likely to spur more investment in storage. As for rooftop solar, Saddler notes that the share of residential solar in the grid is still relatively small but it is the most steadily growing generation source in the NEM. (See red line in chart below). That line is expected to grow steadily. By 2040, or perhaps 2050, the share of distributed generation, which includes rooftop solar, battery storage and demand management, is expected to reach nearly half of all Australia’s grid demand. Saddler, says, however, that the increase in large-scale solar over the last few months is a significant milestone in Australia’s transition towards clean electricity generation. (See very top graph). “Firstly, they are a concrete demonstration that the construction cost advantage, which wind enjoyed over solar until a year or two ago, is gone. “From now on we can expect new capacity to be a mix of both technologies. Indeed, the Clean Energy Regulator states that it expects solar to account for half of all (new renewable) capacity by 2020.” As for the change in emissions, this graph above tells the story, the brown line is key – there was another slight fall in the latest period. But Australia – thanks to the closure of coal-fired generators and their replacement with wind and solar – has cut emissions by 18% from the electricity grid in a decade. Sadly, the government target is just a 26% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. Most of the rest of the target will be met over the next two years when the build-out of more wind and solar to meet the renewable energy target is completed. • Giles Parkinson is the editor of RenewEconomy, where this article was originally published"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/05/essential-poll-labor-jumps-to-eight-point-lead-as-joyce-scandal-revives","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T18:00:22Z","webTitle":"Essential poll: Labor jumps to eight-point lead as Joyce scandal revives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/essential-poll-labor-jumps-to-eight-point-lead-as-joyce-scandal-revives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/essential-poll-labor-jumps-to-eight-point-lead-as-joyce-scandal-revives","fields":{"headline":"Essential poll: Labor jumps to eight-point lead as Joyce scandal revives","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A messy political week for the Turnbull government and the revival of the Barnaby Joyce controversy appears to have propelled Labor further in front in the national political contest, with the latest Guardian Essential poll showing the ALP ahead of the Coalition 54% to 46%. The positive jump for Labor, propelled by a four-point drop in the Coalition’s primary vote, reverses a tightening in the political contest in the weeks after the Turnbull government used the budget in May to promise voters a $140bn income tax cut package. The two-party-preferred result a fortnight ago was 51% to 49%, with Labor ahead – which was the first time the major party gap had been that close since November 2016. The week before that, Labor was ahead of the Coalition 52% to 48%, and the week before that Labor was ahead 53% to 47%, which was the same result as the two previous fortnightly surveys. The Guardian Essential poll’s margin of error is three points. The dip this fortnight follows renewed controversy over Joyce’s private life and his decision to accept $150,000 from the Seven Network for a tell-all interview with his new partner and former staffer, Vikki Campion. Labor sources have told Guardian Australia the opposition’s private research suggests the government began a political recovery at the end of last year, with voters acclimatising to their initial disappointment with Malcolm Turnbull – but the recovery was blown off course when the Joyce scandal dominated the headlines earlier this year. The government recovered again when the scandal over Joyce’s private life receded, but the past week has projected the former Nationals leader and deputy prime minister squarely back into the national political spotlight. The government faced further difficulty last week with splits over energy policy and live sheep exports, and battled separate controversies when the jobs minister, Michaelia Cash, was subpoenaed to give evidence in court, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, washed up on the front pages of the tabloids after an expletive-ridden confrontational tirade against a local mayor. But despite the two-party-preferred result deteriorating over the torrid fortnight of the parliamentary sitting, the latest poll of 1,025 respondents is not all bad news for the Coalition. Turnbull recorded his best net approval rating since June 2016, with 42% of the sample approving of his performance as prime minister, up two points from a month ago, and 42% disapproving – a change in net approval rating from minus two to zero. Bill Shorten, by contrast, went backwards. His approval rating as opposition leader was 33%, down four points in a month, and his disapproval rating was up five points at 46%, which translates to a change in his net approval rating from minus four to minus 13. Turnbull also remains comfortably ahead as preferred prime minister, with 41% rating him as better prime minister (up a point in a month) and 27% backing Shorten. Turnbull is preferred by both men and women, with 48% of men preferring him and 27% Shorten, while 34% of women prefer Turnbull and 26% Shorten. With federal parliament on a two-week hiatus, the leaders have fanned out around the country. Turnbull is touring drought-affected areas of New South Wales and Queensland, and Shorten on Monday night held a town hall meeting in the Tasmanian seat of Braddon – one of the seats Labor is aiming to defend on the “super Saturday” of byelection contests. Polls published over the weekend suggest Labor is in trouble in both Braddon and the Queensland seat of Longman. Strategists concede the ALP is trailing the Liberals in the Tasmanian contest. With Turnbull in NSW, former prime minister Tony Abbott campaigned in Braddon on Monday with the Liberal candidate, Brett Whiteley, trumpeting the policies of “the Abbott Turnbull government”. Labor is campaigning vigorously in the byelections against the government’s plan for a tax cut for Australia’s biggest businesses, and the new Guardian Essential poll suggests voters remain divided about that proposal, with 37% approval, 37% disapproval and 26% not sure. Approval splits along partisan lines: 65% of Coalition voters approve, but 56% of Labor voters and 52% of Greens voters disapprove. Voters intending to back someone other than major party candidates are split: 38% approve and 41% disapprove. Voters were also asked a number of questions this fortnight about the Newstart payment. At budget time there was a push to increase the unemployment benefit – a campaign the government rebuffed. Labor is also not locked in to boosting the payment, promising a review if it wins the next federal election. Half the sample were aware the payment was less than $300 a week. Half the sample thought the current level of the payment was too low, with only 9% saying it was too high, 26% believing it was about right and 15% undecided. People most likely to think it was too low were Labor voters (63%), Greens voters (59%) and workers on incomes under $1,000 per week (62%). Coalition voters and higher-income earners were more likely to think the payment was too high. A clear majority of the sample (68%) agreed Newstart should be increased and 70% agreed with the statement, “a fair government would raise the rate of Newstart, youth allowance and related payments to ensure everybody has enough to live on while they look for paid work”. People were also asked to nominate an income they would need in order to live comfortably. On average, respondents thought they would need a weekly income of at least $660. A separate poll to be released on Tuesday by the Australian Council of Trade Unions shows 64% of a sample of 1,502 respondents agreed with the statement, “increasing the minimum wage will increase the amount people have to spend, creating demand that will create jobs”, with 35.8% fearing a minimum-wage increase would cost jobs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/17/oh-no-ive-become-come-on-guys-this-isnt-cool-dad-nikesh-shukla","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-17T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Oh no, I’ve become ‘Come on guys, this isn’t cool’ dad | Nikesh Shukla","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/17/oh-no-ive-become-come-on-guys-this-isnt-cool-dad-nikesh-shukla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/17/oh-no-ive-become-come-on-guys-this-isnt-cool-dad-nikesh-shukla","fields":{"headline":"Oh no, I’ve become ‘Come on guys, this isn’t cool’ dad","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I remember the exact moment I became the “Hey guys, guys, come on guys, I used to be just like you guys, guys, but come on, this isn’t cool, guys” dad. He’s worse than strict dad, boring dad or “Can I join in?” dad. He’s the dad who wants you to know that he used to be a young rapscallion, who did slightly naughty things, but now he’s a dad and, much as it pains him, he has to tell you that this just ain’t cool guys. A sweltering Thursday afternoon finds me in the park with my kids. We’re lucky to still have the park, as it happens. Last year Bristol council threatened to slash its parks budget. But it backtracked, and so here we are, heading to the paddling pool with swimming costumes, watering cans and a float. Our park has a curious but useful design in that a fence marks out a clear family area. The rest of the park is a free-for-all for circus artists, bad acoustic guitar and teenagers doing whatever teenagers do in the park. We are paddling. My eldest daughter runs up and down the length of the paddling pool throwing water about and squealing with delight. I hold on to my one-year-old’s hands as she navigates the water tentatively. The smell of barbecue and the faint hum of rap drifts over from the other side of the fence. “Ah, summer,” I think. “This is the life. If this is what my Thursday childcare afternoons are to be, then I may as well set up camp here till September.” Three teenagers enter the pool area and head to the far side, which is empty. They all sit with their feet in the water. One of them starts building a spliff and the other two chat. “Surely not,” I think. “Surely they’re just building the spliff to smoke, with cool feet, somewhere else.” I ignore them and carry on playing with my kids until a few minutes later. The sweet smell of weed starts wafting across the paddling pool. I look at them. The three teenagers are smoking and chatting away. I look at the rest of the paddling pool. Kids are playing, splashing, running, but their parents are quietly moving them to our side of the pool. Did I have to be the one to tell the stoner teens to go away? None of the parents seem to want to do anything. Maybe they don’t care. Maybe they feel intimidated. Maybe I am making a big deal. But my lord, the air is heavy with weed. I walk over. “Hey guys,” I say, already off to a bad start. “Now I don’t care if you want to smoke weed in the park, but please can you do it somewhere else?” One of the teenagers looks at me and laughs. “What’s the problem?” she says. “We’re at the other end of the pool.” “I know,” I say. “I don’t care if you want to smoke weed, but you need to do it somewhere else.” Why did I need to reiterate that I didn’t care that they were smoking a spliff? I feel immediately like I would be the kind of dad who would say something stupid like “toke on a doobie” or “take that sweet Mary Jane to the other side of the park”. I am close, goddamnit. “It clearly states that this is a smoke-free zone,” I say. “There are kids everywhere. Smoke that somewhere else.” Stifling a laugh, the teenagers get out of the pool, apologising. I feel my eldest daughter shuffle next to me. She asks who I am talking to. The teens stand outside the pool area, on the grass, finishing their spliff. I can’t bring myself to banish them to the other side of the park, because that is not what the “Hey guys, guys, come on guys, I used to be just like you guys, guys, but come on, this isn’t cool, guys” dad does. I watch them finish their spliff before re-entering the pool area, sticking their feet back in the water. “I used to be one of you guys,” I think. I look at my kids. “But that was such a long time ago…”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/15/ammar-808-maghreb-united-review-an-exuberant-full-tilt-affair","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T07:30:10Z","webTitle":"Ammar 808: Maghreb United review – an exuberant, full-tilt affair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/15/ammar-808-maghreb-united-review-an-exuberant-full-tilt-affair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/15/ammar-808-maghreb-united-review-an-exuberant-full-tilt-affair","fields":{"headline":"Ammar 808: Maghreb United review – an exuberant, full-tilt affair","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It starts with the sound of distant voices at what could be an ancient North African ceremony. Then come repeated, chanting vocals from Sofiane Saidi, urged on by the pounding, insistent electro-percussion that dominates this intriguing blend of ancient and modern styles. Ammar 808 is the name currently used by Sofyann Ben Youssef, the band’s Tunisian leader, producer and arranger, responsible for the electronics on the album, and it was inspired by his love of that vintage drum machine, the TR-808. Until now, Youssef has been best known for providing the bass rhythms for the rousing Tunisian folk-rock band Bargou 08, who matched electronica against traditional acoustic instruments. Now he has applied the same technique to music from right across the Maghreb, with even more impressive results. He is joined by three powerful male singers, Cheb Hassen Tej from Tunisia, Saidi from Algeria, whose career has included a collaboration with Natacha Atlas, and Mehdi Nassouli from Morocco, who has worked with Fatoumata Diawara and Justin Adams. An exponent of Gnawa trance music, Nassouli plays their favoured instrument, the guembri lute, while other traditional instruments, the gasba flute and zukra bagpipes, are added by Lassad Boughalmi from Bargou 08. All but one of the songs are traditional, and for the most part can be heard in their original form before the bass and percussion-heavy electronica, distortion and samples move it, often following the rhythms and textures of African drums. This is a full-tilt affair, with rumbling basslines matched against exuberant vocals from Nassouli and two Moroccan backing singers on the frantic Layli, and wailing bagpipes backed by relentless percussion on Tej’s Alech Taaadini. I look forward to hearing them live. Other world music picks this month From Argentina, there’s an engaging blend of beats, electronica and Andean folk styles on Chancha Vía Circuito’s Bienaventuranza, while from Cuba, there are charming, lilting instrumental duets on the debut collaboration between guitar heroes Eliades Ochoa &amp; Alejandro Almenares on Dos Gigantes De La Música Cubana. From Canada, Trinidadian émigré Drew Gonsalves impressively updates the calypso tradition with his band Kobo Town on Where the Galleon Sank, adding dancehall and funk influences and thoughtful lyrics that include a bleak post-colonial view of London.

Sherman Alexie, the poet and novelist who was due to receive it for a memoir, You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me, has declined the award following allegations of sexual harassment. Last month, the novelist Junot Díaz withdrew from the Sydney writers’ festival and from chairing the Pulitzer prize board after being confronted by his own accusers. As the allegations swept through social media, another writer, Mary Karr, joined the fray, tweeting of her distress that her testimony to DT Max, the biographer of her one-time partner David Foster Wallace, about Foster Wallace’s abusive behaviour had been marginalised. “Deeply saddened by the allegations against #JunotDiaz &amp; I support every woman brave enough to speak. The violence #DavidFosterWallace inflicted on me as a single mom was ignored by his biographer &amp; @NewYorker as ‘alleged’ despite my having letters in his hand,” she wrote. Such high profile cases are far from rare as the #MeToo movement spreads across the creative industries. They come at a time when writers are facing increasingly draconian attempts by publishers to police their behaviour, calling into question centuries old assumptions about the desirability – or even the possibility in today’s networked world – of separating writers’ lives from their work. Sexual harassment might be the most acute manifestation of this crisis but it is only one aspect of it. Last year, Simon &amp; Schuster cancelled a book by the rightwing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos after comments he had made about sex between men and “younger boys” put an abrupt end to tolerance of his controversialist views. Just months earlier, when the book deal was announced, human rights organisations had rallied to defend the firm’s right to publish his autobiography, Dangerous, however objectionable his views were held to be. Cancelling contracts is a costly and legally dangerous business for publishers – as the Yiannopoulos case revealed. It involved waving goodbye to a reported $250,000 advance, and Simon &amp; Schuster only avoided being sued for breach of contract when the disgraced author opted to drop the lawsuit and self-publish instead. The fear among authors and agents is that the case will be seen to strengthen the argument for personal behaviour to be written into author contracts. Morality, or morals, contracts have existed in the film industry since 1921, when Universal Pictures introduced them in response to Fatty Arbuckle’s trial for manslaughter, but they are relatively new in the publishing industry. One such clause, introduced by HarperCollins in the US, stipulated that the publisher could terminate a contract in cases of “conduct [that] evidences a lack of due regard for public conventions and morals”, or in the case of a “crime or any other act that will tend to bring the Author into serious contempt, and such behaviour would materially damage the Work’s reputation or sales”. Caroline Michel, a leading literary agent, said this week that the use of morality clauses had doubled in the US over the past year. In a recent speech, Royal Society of Literature president Marina Warner warned that “being good” should not be conflated with “good writing”. But where is that line drawn? Clearly, reputation doesn’t matter to a controversialist in the way it does to literary authors such as Alexie or Díaz, who are facing serious damage to their careers. In the weeks since 10 women came forward with accusations against Alexie, the Native American author has been subjected to a cascade of punitive measures. His name has been stripped from a scholarship awarded by the Institute of American Indian Arts, all references to him have been “deleted or modified” in the blog Native Americans in Children’s Literature, bookshops and libraries are destocking his books and his US publisher has said that it will be postponing the paperback of his memoir (though his UK publisher, Penguin Random House, says it will continue to reprint his work as required). Díaz’s US publisher scrapped the publicity schedule for his children’s picture book Islandborn, and his forthcoming public lectures have been cancelled. His UK publisher Oneworld has confirmed it is going ahead with publication, but will postpone it until the autumn. Meanwhile, this month three editors resigned from the Boston Review after the magazine, where Díaz has worked as fiction editor since 2003, announced that it was keeping him on, because “the objectionable conduct described in the public reports does not have the kind of severity that animated the #MeToo movement”. Shortly before the accusations – in what has been denounced by his detractors as a pre-emptive move – Dominican American Díaz wrote a long and moving confessional in the New Yorker about the legacy of damage inflicted on him by being raped as a child. Supporters in the academic world have rallied round him with an open letter in the Chronicle of Higher Education claiming that the “(at times uncritical) reception and repetition of the charges ... amounts to a full-blown media-harassment campaign”. While not dismissing the allegations, the 26 signatories, who include professors from Harvard, Yale, New York, California and Florida, warn that “the … characterization of Díaz as a dangerous and aggressive sexual predator from whom all women must be protected reinforces racist stereotypes”. The high emotions surrounding the behaviour of writers are starkly exemplified by the case of Foster Wallace. Though Karr feels understandably aggrieved that her experience wasn’t taken more seriously by his biographer, she would be wrong to think it wasn’t noted. In a blog written at the time, Kristen Roupenian – who went on to write the New Yorker short story sensation “Cat Person” – described her dismay at discovering in Max’s book that the literary hero she worshipped as a student would probably have dismissed her as “audience pussy”. She wasn’t looking for a boycott of his work, she wrote. “All I expect is a quiet, un-showy disqualification for the role of hero, mentor or saint. I would like the ‘statue’ (Wallace’s word) of his public image to be carefully dismantled, for the overblown ideas we have of him and what his life meant to slowly begin to deflate. I would like him to become just another writer, imbued with no moral authority beyond what is contained in his words on the page.” Her blog predates #MeToo, but by 2012 – when the biography was published – some US publishers had already begun to introduce morality clauses. Though they are so far confined to academic presses in the UK, a literary agent who wishes to remain anonymous says “the conversations have started among publishers about this issue. Are [morality clauses] here? Probably not. Are they coming? Most definitely. Whatever happens in the US eventually ends up in London because these are global companies.” Michel says her firm has worked hard to limit the scope of US morality contracts, so that, for example, instead of applying to an author’s behaviour at any time in the past or future, the clause only applies to the period of publication. In any case, she asked, “who decides what past or future conduct of the author is appropriate or not?” As the pressure has mounted, London-based authors’ agent Lizzy Kremer has taken pre-emptive action – drawing up a new, industry-wide code of conduct on behalf of a coalition of authors, booksellers, agents and publishers. The voluntary code was partly inspired by London’s Royal Court theatre, which constructed one in reaction to its own sexual misconduct scandal involving a former artistic director. Among the theatre’s first responses was a call out for testimony about sexual harassment to help it to identify “patterns and scenarios”. In a detail that chimes strongly with the publishing industry, the report drew attention to the dangers of a “blurred social context”: “13.3% of reported incidents happened at work parties … with alcohol.” “Publishers feel an obligation to use their personal social media accounts to publicise books and to go out for drinks,” says Kremer. “People forget that these are not friendships, they are friendly business relationships. You have to understand what’s off limits.” In a personal blog, she recalled meeting up with a younger woman who told her of several “small yet frightening liberties” that men in publishing had taken at parties and in offices over the years. “One of the things that interested me about the [Royal Court] report was its emphasis on the vulnerability of the creative person,” says Kremer. “Obviously it’s not the same in publishing – you don’t have to get changed in communal dressing-rooms – but it’s another industry with a culture of asking employees to give something personal of themselves.” The urgency of addressing these issues is not simply about protecting those who work in the industry, but of finding a way to safeguard the freedom of literature itself. When the Díaz story broke in the US, Elleke Boehmer, professor of world literature in English at Oxford University, considered whether his Pulitzer prize-winning novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao should be taken off her teaching syllabus. Her department decided to let it stay on the grounds that “what would be really valuable would be not to block writers’ voices, but to put others alongside these authors who are now being deplatformed”. “We’ve been here before,” says a senior UK biographer, who declined to be named, citing the furore over Philip Larkin’s racism and misogyny, which threatened to obliterate his reputation after the publication of his Selected Letters in the early 1990s. “Yes, I am fearful that wonderful writers with horrible personal lives are going to fall out of the literary canon because of their terrible behaviour. Puritanism isn’t good for literary understanding.” But these are different times, in which technological changes have created unprecedented forms of accountability. For Kremer, finding a way forward involves responsibility all round – a challenge that is especially tough in an era when reputations can be made or destroyed with an anonymous comment beneath an article, or a single tweet. Her hope is that new, negotiated social contracts will prove more powerful than no-platforming or the imposition of morality clauses that, as Nicola Solomon, CEO of the Society of Authors, points out, could be wrongly invoked to end contracts with writers whom publishers no longer wanted for reasons that had nothing to do with their morality. Writers have a central role to play in exploring the nuances of the new, wired environment, whether through short stories, such as Roupenian’s “Cat Person”, which investigates the politics of unwanted sex, or novels such as Lisa Halliday’s recent Asymmetry, which examines the perils of cultural asymmetry in terms of both a young editor’s relationship with an famous older writer, and the right of a white, female writer to describe the experience of a young Iraqi-American man. As Warner said in her speech: “Striving to be good is not the same as good writing. Engaging in fictive truth-telling is not the same as winning gold stars for conduct.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/18/did-you-solve-it-mirror-mirror-on-the-wall","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T16:00:47Z","webTitle":"Did you solve it?

Mirror, mirror on the wall","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Earlier today I set you a puzzle about a mirror: A man is facing a mirror hanging on a wall 1m in front of him. In order for him to see himself entirely in the mirror, what is the minimum possible height of the mirror and where should it be mounted on the wall? He takes a pace backwards so he is 2m from the wall. What is the minimum possible height that the mirror now needs to be so he can see himself completely? Is the mirror larger or smaller than the one before? (The puzzle requires some basic physics, which I will spell out here. First, light travels in a straight line. Secondly, when light reflects in a mirror the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. In other words, light hitting a mirror behaves just like a snooker ball bouncing against the side cushion: the angle it hits the cushion is the same as the angle of the rebound.) Solution Let’s sketch out the solution. Here’s a person standing in front of a wall. Lets begin by saying that the mirror covers all of the wall. In order for the person to see their feet in the mirror, the light from their feet must hit the mirror and rebound into the eye. Let’s say this light hits the mirror at P. The person is standing straight, so we can assume that their feet and their eyes are the same distance from the wall. Because the angle of incidence and reflection are equal, the distance (L) from P to the eye-line must be the same as the distance from P to the floor. We can use the same logic for what is happening above the eye-line. For the person to see the top of their head, the light must reflect at point Q, equidistant between the height of the top of their head, and their eye-line. The mirror must contain both points P and Q and everything in between, which means the minimum height of the mirror is the distance between P and Q. And which means it has the length L + l. Since the person’s height is 2L + 2l, the mirror is exactly half the person’s size. And it needs to be mounted between points P and Q on the wall. Nowhere in this calculation did I mention the distance from the wall. That’s because it is irrelevant to the calculation. In other words, it does not matter how far back you are when looking at the mirror. Whether you are 1m, 2m or even 1km back, the mirror only needs to be half your height for you to see yourself in it completely. Looking good! I hope you enjoyed the puzzle. I’ll be back in two weeks. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.

Although I have one reservation about Natalie Abrahami’s production, it is admirably faithful to the play’s expressionist origins and never allows its astonishing design to dominate the text, as happened in the National Theatre’s version 25 years ago. Much of the meaning of Treadwell’s play resides in its title: the reduction of human beings to the level of machines. Her protagonist, initially known as Young Woman and only gradually named as Helen, undertakes what seems to be a predetermined course: as a humble stenographer, she succumbs to social pressure and the need to escape her bullying mum by marrying the boss, George H Jones. Marriage and motherhood, however, bring her no joy, and she only acquires an illusory freedom through an adulterous affair with a glamorous transient, one that proves fatal. Treadwell’s writing is impressive for how much it leaves out. She doesn’t need to show us every detail of Helen’s honeymoon or home life to make us understand her sense of suffocation. You only have to listen to the staccato exchanges between Helen and George about a property deal (“Did they come through?” – “Sure they came through”) to realise that Treadwell prefigured Pinter and Mamet. While her dialogue is stylised, Treadwell uses the polyphonic possibilities of theatre to press home her point. From the outset, Helen seems surrounded by “the purgatory of noise”, whether it be the clack of office machinery, the clatter of garbage collectors or the drill that shreds her postnatal nerves. Sound has lately been reduced to an ominous hum in British theatre; in the expert hands of Ben and Max Ringham, it becomes a vital part of the play’s texture. Miriam Buether’s design is also highly impressive without being pre-emptive. Her crucial device is the use of a vast, tilted mirror through which Helen’s life is constantly reflected: we move from the mechanised, meaningless bustle of office life, reminiscent of Elmer Rice’s The Adding Machine, to closeups of Helen’s delicate hands spread out on a kitchen table. If I have any qualm about Abrahami’s production, it lies in its promiscuous approach to period. The office scene, with its typewriters and telephones, is straight out of the 1920s. By the time we get to Helen’s trial, complete with Fox News and CNN reporters, we are clearly in the present. I assume the idea is to portray Helen as Everywoman, but the beauty of Treadwell’s play is that it is both anchored in the past and timeless. For the most part, however, Abrahami trusts Treadwell’s text and has cast shrewdly. Emily Berrington is ideal as Helen. She is fragile and whey-faced at first, angry after the traumas of childbirth (“I’ve submitted to enough – I won’t submit to any more”), then briefly and movingly liberated in the bedroom scene with her lover. Jonathan Livingstone as her smug husband, rejoicing in what he sees as his doll-wife, and Dwane Walcott as the truant lover lend assured support. At 90 minutes, the play is short. But Treadwell packs into that brief span an unforgettable portrait of a particular woman and of America itself as a hellishly dehumanised assembly line. At the Almeida, London, until 21 July.

So why not go to the source, the original brain that figured all of this out?” says Professor Edith Hall. “I think there is a comfort in ideas that people have held for thousands of years.” Her book, Aristotle’s Way, promises to teach you “how ancient wisdom can change your life”, in particular how to achieve a lifelong state of what the ancients referred to as eudaimonia and we come closest to with “contentment”. According to Aristotle, Hall writes: “The ultimate goal of human life is, simply, happiness, which means finding a purpose in order to realise your potential and working on your behaviour to become the best version of yourself.” It’s an ancient version of that poster “Work Hard &amp; Be Nice to People”, but in a less cool font. Aristotle approves of food, drink and sex (all in moderation – he’s big on moderation); he believes leisure is more important than work; that we all have innate talents and that we don’t peak until we’re 49. What’s not to like? But by far his most significant claim is that happiness is achievable by almost everyone – you just have to “decide to become happier”. Simple, huh! “Happiness is not a state as far as Aristotle is concerned, it’s an activity,” Hall explains. “You have to do it. It means every encounter and every day of your life and every decision you take, trying to do it in a measured and deliberated way until it becomes habitual.” Like anything, happiness just takes a bit of planning, Hall argues. “Plato, his teacher, said that the unconsidered life is not worth living. Aristotle would say the unplanned life is slightly less likely to be happy. It’s planning. Just planning.” With all the injunctions to become the Best Possible You, Hall clearly has an eye on the self-help market as well as both feet firmly in the classical world; you almost expect to find a photo of a toga-clad Aristotle smiling beatifically over a slice of avocado toast. “Virtue ethics” doesn’t sound much fun, and Hall gamely breathes new life into his doctrines (which she admits can be heavy-going) for 21st-century readers, flitting over the centuries and across cultural borders, taking in everyone from Philip of Macedon to Pharrell Williams of “Happy” with breezy aplomb. A beguiling cross between Mary Beard and Mary Poppins, Hall is enjoying herself outside the ivory towers: “I love the idea that I’m now in agony aunt territory with Aristotle.” The daughter of an Anglican priest, Hall lost her faith when she was 13 and spent the rest of her teens in a “moral wilderness”. When the rest of us were experimenting with cigarettes and blue mascara, Hall dabbled in astrology, Buddhism and transcendental meditation in an attempt to answer her fundamental question – why be good? “If you don’t believe in an interventionist God or an afterlife, there is no logical reason whatsoever to be virtuous. Why would you not just pursue your own self-interest?” Then, as an undergraduate at Oxford, she discovered Aristotle: “I decided this was such an unbelievably commonsensical way of trying to organise your life. I was blown away. It was a total epiphany. So I just started doing it, as it were.” Planning and moderation aren’t the first qualities we associate with students, and Hall admits it was tricky at first. “It’s terribly grown-up to take complete responsibility.” And here Aristotle is characteristically forgiving, arguing that humans aren’t capable of consistent rational forethought until they are at least 25 (something now backed up by research, Hall points out). And it took her until her mid-30s to realise that if she wanted to fulfil her hopes of becoming a mother, she needed to stop dating “handsome lizards and moral invertebrates”. She now has two daughters, one of whom also loves history and who accompanied her on a tour of Greece in the footsteps of her hero. So what does doing it actually mean? Being nice is “not just a matter of enlightened self-interest”, Hall says. “There is an intrinsic wellspring of good feeling about yourself that does actually supply a feeling of contentment.” The examples she gives are making sure she always smiled at her children “however tired, however annoyed” she was, or taking a purse to the police station or lost property, “when the temptation might be to put it in your pocket… It may hurt a bit, but you just have to start making yourself do it.” If, like me, you come over all anxious at the idea of not handing in a purse, or apologise five times when someone else bumps into you, then you may be what Aristotle calls “an intuitive virtue ethicist”. Who knew? “Good for you!” says Hall, in a way that doesn’t sound so good. You can be “too nice” to be a true Aristotelian: not enough anger, for example, is a problem, especially for women. “It means you have no self-respect, will get walked all over and won’t look after your own. It’s not OK. You can’t be a fully moral person, actually.” Oh dear! One of the joys of Aristotle’s philosophy is that it works whatever your age, Hall believes. But she is evangelical – she describes herself as a “secular missionary” – on the need to offer moral guidance to young people, on those crucial everyday things you don’t get taught at school. “Taking a decision, clear communication, how to use your leisure, how to choose a partner and friends, and when it is absolutely fine to get rid of friends.” If it all sounds like doing what your mother always told you – smile, do your homework, everything in moderation, whatever! – there’s the rub: while we may have been well loved, Hall thinks we have not always been “well parented”; we are failing our young by inadequately training them in basic decision-making skills. And so her book includes practical advice such as how to write a decent job application and when to dump your partner. What are her top three tips for getting in touch with your inner Aristotle? Number one: “Be honest – know your vices.” Hall provides a handy version of Aristotle’s inventory of character qualities, a sort of personality quiz. She identifies her own worse fault as vindictiveness. “I like to get back at people if they’ve hurt me or my loved ones. I enjoy it,” she smiles dangerously. Now, as an enlightened Aristotelian she only goes “out for revenge when it is appropriate”. Number two: “Review all your relationships”, which should all be based “on full-blown reciprocal trust”, according to Aristotle. He has a system for dealing with friends and relatives who don’t come up to scratch – you simply demote them according to his categories “primary”, “pleasure” and “utility” (“I occasionally meet them for lunch,” Hall says of a couple of her relegated rellies). The latter might sound like something you have to assemble from Ikea, but it amicably encompasses most of our friendships. From your spouse to society at large, all relationships are contracts, apparently. What if your partner cheats on you? “I would always give them one more chance,” says Hall. On adultery, Aristotle “talks rather too often about the problem of fancying your neighbour’s wife”, she says. But his belief that if you abuse marital trust “you are actually rotting the foundations of society” has certainly helped her to be “a good girl”. Number three? “Think about your death. Look to the end,” Hall says emphatically. “Because it makes you get on with things. It’s about thinking of your life like a biographer while you are doing it, that your life is an art.” While the idea we can simply choose to be happy is seductive, it is rather in the “chin/socks-up, it’s-all-in-your-head” school of psychology. We can hardly blame Aristotle for being a little old-fashioned (he was also dodgy on women and slaves, which Hall excuses by arguing that he was always open to changing his mind). But taking responsibility for your own happiness will be of little comfort to the clinically depressed or recently bereaved. Hall agrees it can be difficult, but not impossible for people to find gratification after terrible tragedy, and ultimately, she says cheerfully, life is pretty bleak: “We are all in a waiting room. It’s just whether we decide to spend it trying to have a wonderful time with each other.” Aristotle’s Way by Edith Hall is published by Bodley Head at £20.

A dozen flag-waving Moroccans walked through the cavernous interiors of the GUM department store, singing in perfect harmony; a Russian family posed for photographs with a quartet of Mexicans in oversized sombreros behind the domes of St Basil’s Cathedral; and three Peruvians clad in their team’s colours joined thousands of locals strolling around the newly landscaped Zaryadye Park in central Moscow. “It’s much easier to get around than we expected and a much nicer city,” said Carlos, 39, who had travelled from New York to see Peru play in their first World Cup since 1982. He will travel to Peru’s first game, in the city of Saransk, by overnight bus because there were no train or plane tickets available. But he said getting around Moscow, using a combination of Uber and the metro, had been surprisingly straightforward. Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium will host both Thursday’s opening match and the final on 15 July. In between, there will be 10 further games played in the capital, shared between Luzhniki and the Spartak stadium. It is the biggest event hosted in the Russian capital since the 1980 Olympics. During the coming month, much of the spotlight will be on smaller Russian cities not used to hosting major events and unknown to most foreign visitors. But Moscow also has a chance to project a new image as a modern European capital, crafted through extensive renovations and urban planning programmes over the past few years. “It’s a chance to show everyone that Moscow is not bears on the streets and balalaikas,” said Alexander Polyakov, director of the government institute that oversees the Moscow transport network, voicing a widely held belief that foreign concerns about Russia are due to unfair prejudice and ignorance rather than Russia’s behaviour on the world stage. Some of those visiting may not expect to find a modern metropolis with a pleasant city centre. But under the mayor Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow has changed perhaps more than any other city in Europe over the past few years. Dozens of streets have been fully pedestrianised, pavements have been widened to include bike lanes and more space for those on foot, and a number of parks have been renovated and spruced up. Much of the renovation has been carried out without public consultation, amid allegations of corruption and, in the case of the pavement renovations, often at the cost of extreme inconvenience to Muscovites. But there is little doubt that the result is a city centre that is unrecognisable from a decade ago. Stalinist architecture and monuments still give the city an imposing feel, but at ground level everything has become more humane. “The atmosphere in Moscow is different; the streets have a different rhythm. Now it’s pleasant and convenient to walk in Moscow,” said the deputy mayor, Maxim Liksutov. The cafe and restaurant scene has been transformed, with hipster eateries and artisan coffee now more in evidence than Soviet-style canteens. Officials are at pains to stress just how welcoming the city will be for foreign visitors during the World Cup. Liksutov pointed out work on the metro and other transport systems in recent months to ensure all signs and announcements are bilingual. Public transport will be free on match days for those with tickets, and the entire metro system will run until 3am after late games. The city government has launched an app in six languages to help visitors and has provided free English-language lessons to 5,000 of the city’s 50,000 licensed taxi drivers. A number of taxi apps work in Moscow, but the city lacks a centralised system of taxis that run on meters. Liksutov said “We’ve asked taxi drivers not to raise their prices for the World Cup and are counting on their cooperation.” However, a yellow taxi on Moscow’s central Tverskaya street, approached on Tuesday and asked in English how much a ride to Sheremetevo airport would cost, quoted a price of 5,000 roubles (£60), about 400% higher than the standard fare. There are other potential pitfalls for visitors, despite the good intentions. While Russian authorities have reduced visa requirements for those with tickets, they have not waived the cumbersome requirement to register with police, a formality for those staying in hotels but a potential nightmare for the hundreds of thousands of fans who will stay in rented apartments. There also remain concerns over potential racism or hooliganism, though the early fan experience suggests problems of an altogether more benign kind. “Everyone is really friendly and I can’t go anywhere without people trying to have their photo taken with me,” said Carlos, the Peru fan. “I’m thinking I should start charging for it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/12/the-terror-review-amc-ships-souls-and-spirits-are-crushed-in-the-arctic","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T22:15:01Z","webTitle":"The Terror review – ships, souls and spirits are crushed in the Arctic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/12/the-terror-review-amc-ships-souls-and-spirits-are-crushed-in-the-arctic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/12/the-terror-review-amc-ships-souls-and-spirits-are-crushed-in-the-arctic","fields":{"headline":"The Terror review – ships, souls and spirits are crushed in the Arctic","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Was there ever a more apt name for a ship than the Terror? It is as if the Titanic had been called the Sunk. HMS Terror and HMS Erebus were the ships of Sir John Franklin’s doomed expedition that set out to find the Northwest Passage in 1845. Based on the novel by Dan Simmons, this US horror series (AMC), which counts Ridley Scott among its executive producers, is a fictionalised account of that expedition. Come to think of it, Erebus is a good name, too, Erebus being the darker part of Hades. Neither of the ships, nor any of the 129 men aboard them, came home. The TV series takes a more linear passage than the book, with a bit of flashing back to make sense of and fix the current position. We look back to the previous failures of Franklin (Ciarán Hinds), to the repeatedly rejected marriage proposals of Captain Francis Crozier (Jared Harris) and his subsequent attempt to find solace in the bottle and the Arctic. After Franklin’s death, Crozier became the leader of the expedition as well as the protagonist of the story. Things start off well enough – there is a lot of optimism, even if it is misplaced. The crew will find the shortcut through to the Pacific and return home as heroes. There will be further knighthoods, that is the plan. Trouble is, nature does not give a damn about plans. The ships become stuck in the ice. Franklin is not the first to go, but the initial deaths are the sort you may expect on an expedition such as this – consumption, drowning. But then, after they accidentally kill an Inuk man, Franklin’s men are attacked by a monster. Polar bear? Too big; more like a spirit in the form of a beast, it continues to hunt them down and kill them (Franklin included) in horrible ways, ripping off limbs and heads. The locals call it Tuunbaq. Tuunbaq is not the only terror hunting and haunting the men. The total darkness of winter closes in. With it comes another kind of darkness, a darkness of the mind. As well as being hunted and torn apart by the creature, they are being poisoned by their own tinned supplies and ripped apart by divisions and mutiny. Bitter cold, malnutrition, exploding teeth, dwindling supplies, enforced detox for Crozier, very cold turkey. The ice slowly crushes the ships, plus the spirits and souls of the men who can no longer sail in them. It seems as if the place itself wants them all dead. The Terror captures this hell, serving it out in rations that always left me wanting more. It is dark and bleak and does not change much in the way it looks. It is very male: there are women in the flashbacks and at home, plus an Inuk woman in the present – but she does not talk, other than to the doctor, Harry Goodsir (Paul Ready). I too became trapped, in their plight, in what was going on between them and in their minds. Crozier especially becomes a kind of unlikely hero, different from the usual vainglorious colonial chaps who thrived on frostbite and sticking union jacks into godforsaken corners of the globe for Queen and country. He came from a more modest background and was a troubled alcoholic, but he was also a fine captain and a thoughtful human being. It is a lovely, nuanced performance from Harris. Then there is mutinous, murderous, hungry Cornelius Hickey (Adam Nagaitis). Hickey introduced one further horror in last night’s final two episodes: cannibalism. They have left the ships to drag themselves, their supplies and open boats across a desperate landscape towards an unreachable destination. Order, law and humanity has broken down. At least Goodsir killed himself before Hickey and his men tucked in. The cannibalism is not fictionalised – there was evidence of it on the bones that were found. To be honest, I am not sure the monster is necessary; there is enough horror already. But Tuunbaq does give the story an extra dimension, a supernatural Inuk foe to take on imperial English arrogance and Christian certainties. Oh, and then a twist at the end, for Crozier.

This does not mean a definitive end to the Britbet project, which could still launch later in the year if talks do not progress. A statement issued by Britbet on Tuesday morning said it would continue to install new hardware at those 55 tracks and transfer of on-course Tote staff to Britbet will also continue as planned. But the Tote brand will now have an extended life at racecourses beyond the middle of next month. The Britbet board is expected to seek assurances from the Alizeti group, which recently bought 25% of the Tote, including on the extent of committed investment and detail on how racing might eventually benefit from Alizeti’s plans. If the board is eventually satisfied, that would be the beginning of a move back to one brand and one pool operator. Alizeti, which has a guaranteed option to take over the Tote in three to five years, is backed by a group of unnamed investors. It describes those people as racehorse owners with a long-term intention to bring some benefit to the sport from their business. Britbet will surely want something more than expressions of altruism. Today’s main action is at Salisbury, where Pilot Wings (3.00) appeals as a solid option at 9-4. From the Roger Charlton yard which appears to be working its way into form, this three-year-old improved a lot for his first run when a staying-on sixth of 19 at Newbury last month. He was allowed to start at 66-1 that day and looked green but another step forward here will make him hard to beat. Later, Ablaze (5.00) could go well in the middle-distance handicap at 11-2, having scored over the course and distance on her reappearance last month. She’s only up 4lb and faces a favourite who remains a maiden after eight starts. At Thirsk, I fancied Ravenswood in the second race but so does everyone else, evidently, and odds of 3-1 are a bit mad. A better option at 5-1 could be Revenge (5.15) in a later sprint handicap. This Tim Easterby youngster never got into it at Wolverhampton last time after a slow start but I’ll take a chance that he can return to the form he had previously been showing on turf, which would make him dangerous here. The yard is going well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/13/a-beautiful-thing-has-come-out-of-it-how-grenfells-bereaved-found-friendship","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-13T16:08:06Z","webTitle":"'A beautiful thing has come out of it': how Grenfell's bereaved found friendship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/a-beautiful-thing-has-come-out-of-it-how-grenfells-bereaved-found-friendship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/a-beautiful-thing-has-come-out-of-it-how-grenfells-bereaved-found-friendship","fields":{"headline":"'A beautiful thing has come out of it': how Grenfell's bereaved found friendship","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Twelve months ago, Sandra Ruiz and Karim Mussilhy were pounding the streets around Grenfell Tower in desperate loops. They didn’t know each other, but both had close relatives missing on the top floors of the building, which had been ablaze since just before 1am. They pinned up missing posters and tried vainly to squeeze information out of the authorities on the ground. Ruiz’s niece, Jessica Urbano Ramirez, 12, had called from the stairwell but wasn’t heard from again. Mussilhy’s uncle, Hesham Rahman, 57, who was like a father to him, was gone too. For Ruiz, Mussilhy and hundreds of other bereaved relatives and survivors, the last year has been like nothing they have ever experienced or surely will again. Asked to put their year into single words, they offer “exhausting”, “draining”, “disappointing”. And then, extraordinarily, “hopeful”. “He’s my little brother,” Ruiz said of Mussilhy. “We have got to know each other’s families. We eat together. We argue. We cry, we laugh. We talk to each other in the middle of the night.” “Too much, I think,” said Mussilhy, laughing. “But it is a beautiful thing that has come out of it. That’s the strength of the continued work: having each other.” Ruiz, a school business manager, and Mussilhy, until recently a manager at an Audi dealership in Mayfair, have together endured grief, public battles with Downing Street and private battles to keep their families and communities from falling apart. It has taken its toll mentally, as it has on thousands of other people: Ruiz struggles with her memory, while Mussilhy has had sporadic bouts of feeling very withdrawn. Wednesday 14 June 2017 was supposed to be another working day. At her home in south London, Ruiz was woken by a call from a family member and switched on the TV to see the tower on fire. “I thought everything would be under control,” she said. “I have always been very trusting in the authorities.” Realising that the flames were jumping from flat to flat without any resistance, she scrambled to Grenfell, arriving at around dawn. In west London at about 6am, Mussilhy was showering. “My wife screamed. I thought she hurt herself. Then she said Grenfell Tower’s on fire.” His uncle wasn’t answering his phone; neither was his grandmother who lived nearby. He went to the scene, checked the rugby club, a nerve centre for searchers, and the hospitals but found nothing. What followed for both of them was weeks of purgatory: the growing suspicion that their loved ones had not made it, but not knowing for sure. “Those were the worst weeks,” said Ruiz. But incredibly, there were already traces of solace. The day after the fire, many of the bereaved were gathered outside a pub and Ruiz, who describes herself as a reluctant public speaker, stood on a chair and led them in the Lord’s prayer. The next day, the Muslim community prayed in the same spot and Ruiz and her family blocked traffic for them. “It encapsulated what an amazing community we had,” she said. “We were sharing grief but also looking out for each other.” Volunteers were coming from all over the country, but there were agitators too. An angry crowd, including masked men, stormed the town hall three days after the fire. Those waiting for news of loved ones feared that a riot would make it harder to get answers from the authorities. “I was running up to these kids pulling the balaclavas off their faces,” said Mussilhy. Ruiz pushed one in the chest and told him to “stop right there”. Mussilhy struggled when he went back to work after a fortnight among the gleaming Audis in Mayfair. “I felt like I’d deserted my family,” he said. “I didn’t want to speak to customers. What did they want to talk to me about cars for? Did they not know what was going on?” He lasted no more than an hour before he got up and went back to Grenfell. He walked loops around Ladbroke Grove, the Westway and Latimer, sometimes 10 times a day, looking for any trace of his uncle. He let a Sky News crew follow him, and a viewer got in touch with footage taken by one of Rahman’s neighbours, which seemed to show him inside the building. Another clip came in with the sound of Rahman comforting a child as the tower burned. “It broke us,” Mussilhy said. “I said to my nan that he was a hero.” The lack of information from police, hospitals or the council was deeply frustrating. On 19 July, survivors were inside the town hall to observe the first full council meeting since the disaster. A new leader of the council was being elected. Ruiz was with Ed Daffarn, a Grenfell resident who had predicted a major fire, and they had been locked out of the chamber in a fire escape. Only after Daffarn hammered on the door for a long time were they eventually let in. They felt it couldn’t have summed up the council’s attitude to them any better. “We were incensed that the survivors have been put in an area where the fire doors were blocked,” Ruiz said. “I lost all faith in [the council] from then on.” About 70 of the bereaved and survivors formed a WhatsApp group, which pinged away “until two, three in the morning, us just talking to each other,” said Mussilhy. More and more issues were coming up. The future of the tower, the police investigation and crucially, trust in Sir Martin Moore-Bick’s public inquiry. WhatsApp was where ideas, news stories and “rants” were shared in confidence and support was always available. “I would be looking at my WhatsApp and then a customer would want to talk about doing a deal on an Audi Q5,” Mussilhy said. “I was like, really?” Grief came in waves. “There were days when I was blank, emotionless,” said Mussilhy, who laid his uncle to rest in September. “When I was at work I would feel anger because I was being made to forget. People were told: don’t talk to Karim about anything to do with Grenfell. I hated that. I wanted to talk about what was going on.” By early autumn, tense early meetings with Moore-Bick had made many feel “he’s not really understanding us, he doesn’t understand what we’ve been through,” said Ruiz. They felt isolated. On 2 December they created an online petition calling for “additional panel members with decision-making powers to ensure those affected have confidence in and are willing to fully participate in the inquiry”. They got to 26,000 signatures, but needed 100,000 to trigger a parliamentary debate. “We couldn’t understand how such a huge thing wasn’t getting national support,” Ruiz said. “We had had an awful week. We were exhausted. We were trying to plan Christmas.” The six-month anniversary service in St Paul’s Cathedral was “very public, very raw”. Three days before Christmas, Ruiz was shopping on Oxford Street, “trying to maintain normality”, when Theresa May said she didn’t want the panel. “It was a real low blow,” she said. “It ruined Christmas.” There were dark periods where they felt unheard and unsupported. In February, Mussilhy happened to be watching the Brit awards when the singer Stormzy rapped: “You thought we just forgot about Grenfell.” “I just froze. My wife was grabbing my arm. It was like, wow!” Mussilhy said. Stormzy tweeted that he wanted the petition to get to 100,000 signatures, and within a few hours it did. “It was the best night in a horrible year,” said Ruiz. “But we were elated about something that shouldn’t have been a problem.” In March, Mussilhy put on a helmet and mask and was taped into a forensic suit. He was going into his uncle’s flat in Grenfell Tower. It was one of the hardest moments of his year. “When I got to his flat it was unrecognisable, awful. It gave me a sense of how the survivors must have felt and the helplessness of the adults and children.” For a couple of weeks, he stayed at home and didn’t feel well. “It took a lot out of me. In a way I was glad I did it, I said a prayer, but I wouldn’t do that again.” Campaigning, lobbying and supporting each other has become a full-time, seven-days-a-week occupation. “If there wasn’t this group constantly banging on the doors then nothing would happen,” said Ruiz. For the anniversary, they want to rest. It sounds simple: “Just do nothing. Be with each other.” But they all know the day will be anything but easy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/12/the-spin-scotland-england-world-cup-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T10:44:46Z","webTitle":"Scotland should be at Cricket World Cup – here’s a way they could be next time | The Spin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/12/the-spin-scotland-england-world-cup-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/12/the-spin-scotland-england-world-cup-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Scotland should be at Cricket World Cup – here’s how they could be next time","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The enthralling Scottish match raised two simple questions. Why are Scotland not playing in the 2019 World Cup? Why are England favourites for that competition? Scotland performed brilliantly at the Grange in a wonderfully entertaining contest which could be appreciated on either side of Hadrian’s Wall. They have never scored so many runs; they have seldom played better. They were, however, given a helping hand by an England side whose defeat unwittingly reopened the debate about the format of cricket’s World Cup. England were hapless in the field from 11 o’clock on Sunday. It is hard to fathom what they were doing in the field then but these are only the thoughts of an antediluvian. England won the toss and put Scotland in to bat in Edinburgh. There was once a school of thought that the decision taken at the toss should be influenced by this question: “What is the best way to get to the halfway point in charge of the game?” Choosing to bowl first is obviously a good option if the wicket is damp or green, allowing the pacemen a chance to prevail. The notion of exploiting early moisture is sound but this did not apply on Sunday. The sun rose in Edinburgh at 4.28am last weekend so there was probably enough time for any moisture to burn off. Moreover the wicket was true, the outfield fast and the boundaries short. Goodness knows how many England might have scored without the pressure of chasing. Probably the only way England could have lost that game was by letting Scotland bat first and exploit the benign conditions. The stock response to such silly old‑fashioned thinking is that it can be “tricky to set a total” on such a surface and “we think we can chase anything”. Admittedly England did not distinguish themselves with the ball. Indeed it was tough to work out how they can be World Cup favourites when watching this attack on Sunday. England have an array of potent batsmen who can smash the ball everywhere but history suggests the trophy is won usually by the side who have the best bowling attack, one that can cope in sublime batting conditions. England’s seamers offered no movement, pace or guile. Or straight yorkers, which are now as out‑of-date as hula hoops. Yorkers should be the first port of call when the batsmen are getting out of hand and if they happen to be straight there is always the chance of dismissing someone. True, straight balls can be risky when the batsman is dancing around his crease but with the risk comes reward – when they miss. One reason why these yorkers are so out of vogue is because they are very difficult to deliver and the margin of error is small so bowlers tend to shrink from that option; another may be that they are so very 20th century. So much for England’s frailties. What of Scotland’s long-term prospects in a week when their rival, Afghanistan, join Ireland as a Test nation? Scotland have the same ambitions for Test cricket but at the moment perhaps the best they can hope for is to participate in an enlarged World Cup in 2023. They should be there. This does not represent a Damascene conversion on my part, but in the past I have not been so zealous as some of my colleagues about the urgency to increase the number of teams in the tournament. My concerns have centred upon a fear of too many one-sided games, an argument weakened considerably by the match in Edinburgh, and the dangers of an unnecessarily elongated competition. Often in World Cups it has taken at least a month to establish the quarter-finalists, whereupon the tournament comes to life, even though by then some of the players are exhausted having been compelled to travel thousands of miles in the group games. There have barely been two World Cups with the same format. In the Caribbean in 2007 the International Cricket Council may have thought it had found the perfect system, which allowed 16 teams to participate. These were initially split into groups of four, from which two sides would progress to the next stage. The theory had merit; in practice it was soon regarded as a disaster. After playing three matches India were eliminated and the ICC’s commercial wing were tearing their hair out at the consequent loss of revenue. This could not be allowed to happen again. Of course the problem is not insoluble, though, as in most cricketing decisions, at home and away, the one that seems to be the most obviously lucrative is always the favoured option, regardless of the more distant consequences. Here is a rough guide to how things could be improved: a 14-team competition which requires qualification for two or four sides since the recent tournament in Zimbabwe, from which Afghanistan and West Indies emerged as the finalists and therefore participants in the 2019 World Cup, was such a riveting and worthwhile event. There would be two groups of seven sides which all play each other. The top team in each group would have a safe passage to their semi-final; second and third in each group would play eliminators to reach a semi-final, as is the case in the Royal London Cup. Such a system removes the criticism, which is often valid, that “we know who the eight quarter-finalists are going to be before the tournament starts”. That was almost the case in 2015 in Australasia. There was some drama along the way but seven out of eight of the “senior” sides made it; only England of that octet failed to do so. Such a system might satisfy the Scots. If they play with the same passion as they did on Sunday they would surely book their place in the top 14. • This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

Or a loving yet filthy sex scene that’s six pages long and so graphic that the actor reading it for your audiobook had to have three shots of whisky before they waded into it? Why? Also, Mum, where is my lunchbox, and have you seen my gym kit?” My name is Caitlin Moran, and I write books with lots of sex in them. My teenage daughters hate it, because of course you don’t want your mum writing books with lots of sex in them. This is an interesting paradox, because I primarily write the sex in my books for teenage girls. This is because, when I was a teenage girl, sexy books were my main source of sex information, and although there were some great ones – thank you, the blessed text that is Jilly Cooper’s Riders: courtesy of page 32, I’m always gonna find nettles sexy – most of the sex I read about was humourless, unrealistic and frankly alarming to a fat teenage virgin girl, trying to find out about this incredibly important thing that she intended to do as soon as she found a) a nice blouse and b) someone to do it with. Henry Miller, Ian Fleming, John Updike, Martin Amis, Philip Roth – they all wrote about having sex with powerful, mysterious women with perfect breasts and “nipples like hazelnuts”, in scenes where these demanding, often slightly mad chicks would have to be shagged into submission. The sex would happen in weird places like “on a boat”, or in Monaco; the women would always be wearing amazing white silk dresses that fell to the floor “like a puddle of cream”, and the narrator would often later discover that the woman had actually had sex because she was trying to get revenge on her husband or kill James Bond, or had rampant daddy issues. No amusing, nice, fat woman ever had sex, in leggings, in Cannock, because she was horny. That never happened. Presumably, that kind of sex didn’t exist. The result of reading all this was to make me very sexually confused – for starters, I thought I would never be able to have sex until I got a passport, lost four stone and went mad. But when I finally started having sex – thanks, smashing blouse! You really worked! – I found out that absolutely no sex was like the sex in books. Ever. In the subsequent 25 years in which I’ve been having sex, neither I, nor any woman I’ve met, has had sex in Monaco, or because they wanted to kill James Bond, or because they’d been rocking nipples like hazelnuts under a white silk dress that they just chucked on the floor, even though it was dry-clean only. Women just don’t have sex like that. Their motivations are totally different. For starters, they know that floor dust can actually stain – yeah, you heard. Fictional women’s reasons for having sex never seemed to encompass the real funny, silly, dirty, horny and true inspirations behind women who actually exist taking off their knickers and jumping into bed with some intriguing fellow. So here, in the interests of balance and information, is all the sex that is actually happening, outside books. Here is: All The Sex. Sex when you’re single The ‘got to get the practice in’ sex You’re 18. You’re inexperienced. Your ideal shag would be the painfully shy Edward Scissorhands – but only after an operation that made him Edward Handyhands: don’t want those shears near your nunny – but he’s not around, and this pleasant-looking bloke called Ian is, instead. Neither of you feel any kind of heart-melting sexual attraction, but you’re both in a room together, it’s Thursday, there’s nothing on telly, and it seems very unlikely this man will try to murder you, because you’ve just spent 10 minutes talking about how useful his varifocal glasses are. Really, you might as well both take your trousers off and have a bit of a fiddle – to “get the practice in”. At this point in your sexual career, you’re basically like a trainee Olympic swimmer. One day, in front of a roaring crowd, you will put your heart and soul into an athletic, expert performance that people will talk about for years. But, for now, you’re just a novice shagger, metaphorically splashing around in a municipal pool in Nuneaton at 7am, getting your lengths in. You and Ian are learning Synchronised Kissing. You both keep drowning a bit, but that’s OK – this is a Sex Apprenticeship. The ‘maybe you’d be more interesting if we had sex’ sex This party/club/pub is proving a little dull – the music is too loud for you to have a proper conversation and, because you’ve had four ciders, you’ve got the notion into your head that the man you are currently desperately miming at in the corner might prove to be more interesting if you put him in a very different conversational environment, ie underneath you, in your bedsit, naked, with his discarded trousers draped over a lamp. “There is no better way to find out what someone is really like than to bring them to stupendous orgasm,” you think in the cab home, unbuttoning his shirt. “We can short-cut weeks of small talk – it’s the perfect ice-breaker, and we will have bonded over a communal experience. Sex is a great way to make new friends! I’m gonna give this nice guy a chance to shine!” This tactic can have mixed results. Sometimes you end up in a glorious postcoital chat until 5am, enthusing over a mutual love of Squeeze B-sides, and realise you have a friend for life. Other times, you realise that 10 minutes of tipsy mime really isn’t a reliable criterion for judging sexual and intellectual compatibility, and that next time you’re bored at a party, you might be better off getting everyone to do the rowing dance to Oops Upside Your Head. The ‘fine at the time – but now you look back and are not an eager-to-please 18-year-old, that was super-dodgy’ shag “Have you ever dabbled with… whips?” “You haven’t really had sex until you’ve had anal sex.” “I’ll pick you up outside your school – keep your uniform on.” “Do you think your friend would be interested in a threesome?” At the time, you think you’re a great Sexual Adventurer – boldly striding into the Sexual Hinterland, guided by this older (it’s always an older) guy, who is very kindly fast-tracking you past vanilla sex and into all the more niche situations. How thoughtful of you, older guy, you think. Seeing all this edgy sexual potential in me. And until your late-20s, you always used to recount these experiences as part of the odd and hilarious variety involved in “getting about a bit”. A hoot. However, in more recent years – as you get older, as #MeToo kicks off, as, perhaps, you have teenager daughters of your own – you’ve started wondering: is it really a “sexual adventure” if none of it was your idea? If you’d never thought, or mentioned, these things? Would we think of Buzz Aldrin as a brilliant, brave pioneer if, when he went to the moon, he was at his first term at uni and a really big astronaut had kept nagging him to go to the moon – even though the only place he’d ever said he wanted to go was Margate – and he cried a little bit on the way there and, afterwards, rang his mates and went, “I wasn’t really into it, to be honest, and last night, in the pub, I saw the other astronauts pointing at me and sniggering about it”? In the end, what makes the difference between Sexual Adventure and Dodgy Shag is whether or not it’s in any way your idea – if it was a mutual situation, involving both people’s desire – which leads us to… The ‘doing it for the anecdote’ novelty pumping He’s Canadian. Or he has a moustache like Mr Pringle. Or he has a pet rabbit. Or he’s a DJ, “legendary in a very small community”, or he’s got a tattoo of Rik Mayall on his leg, or his mum was your teacher, and there’s something appealingly kinky about banging Mrs Schofield’s son, when she gave you such a shit time in PE once. (You were on your period, yeah? And besides, no one needs to learn how to climb up a rope in this day and age – hello, we’ve invented stairs now, you old hag.) Whoever he is, he’s not the usual kind of guy you go for, but he’s clearly up for some cheerful, meaningless sex, and you’re into it because you’re half turned-on and half already amused imagining telling your friends about it tomorrow. All the pressure on the actual deed is off, because you’re doing this for the anecdote – your vagina is basically in an episode of Quantum Leap, jumping into a mysterious new life, and seeing how it copes, and you’ll be telling Al all about it in the morning. This kind of sex very often overlaps with… The straight-up awful hump – a tale you will tell for the rest of time My literal entry for this was back in the 1990s, when I went back to the house of a famous comedian who, as we began the “opening monologue” on the sofa, reached around for the remote control – and put on his own TV show. As the theme-tune boomed out around the room, I had to ask myself, “Should I continue with this terrible situation – gathering more material for a story I will, surely, be telling for the rest of my life – or do I feel this is, already, a bounteous repast of narrative?” Deciding that it was, in fact, the latter, I ceased proceedings with an apposite, “And that’s all we’ve got time for! You’ve been a wonderful audience – goodnight!” and ordered a cab. While I waited for it to arrive, he very kindly read me some of his terrible poetry – thus doubling the sheer gold of the anecdote without me having to take any more clothes off. In later years, I found out that this comedian had been many, many other women’s Awful Shag, which led to much bonding, and the formation of some manner of community of women, all of whom would go, “Oh my God, let me tell you my one!” as soon as they learned you were “one of them”. The ‘I am going to sort this problem out’ shag This is where a woman engages in the kindly act of relieving a very nervous man of his virginity before he actually explodes. When we do this shag, we tend to pretend we’re a warm, bosomy village strumpet from a 19th-century novel; a-going to the market to sell our fine cheeses, and then having a roll in a meadow at sundown as some mad fiddle player cracks out an enormously long jig, and everyone in the village gets hammered on mead. It’s a jolly old romp, in which everyone has a good time. It’s odd that very little is written by women about “taking” a man’s virginity, when the “taking” of women’s virginity is so endlessly chronicled. By and large, the losing of a woman’s virginity is one of her worst shags – the hurting, the blood, the statistical unlikelihood of coming, the slight edge of terror you might get pregnant, even though you’ve made him put on six condoms. When a woman “takes” a man’s virginity, on the other hand – respectfully, enthusiastically, with care and joy – there isn’t really a downside; save him coming in under one second flat, then lying on his back and laugh-crying, “Oh my GOD!”, before being ready to go again six seconds later. In this situation, everyone is a winner. He’s just the most fascinating, hot dude you’ve ever met, you’re both into each other and he makes your knickers cry every time you see him No more need be said, save: happy pumping! Sex in a long-term relationship The ‘maintenance shag’ This phrase was coined by my friend Sali and it recognises a vital phenomenon: the point, in a long-term relationship, when it’s “been a while” – 10 days, two weeks – and neither of you is particularly up for it, but you know, from your deep wisdoms, that you need to “do a sex” now to keep everything ticking over. For the first 10 minutes or so, you’ll be a trifle desultory – you’ll keep thinking of your to-do list, or remembering a funny cat on Twitter, and laughing – but then, sex being what it is, you’ll suddenly get into it, have a rare old time, and then go back about your domestic business; both pleasingly conspiratorial and sated, because you literally Took Care Of Business. There is such a thing as Sexual Administration, and you will feel the better for “ticking it off”. The ‘at your parents’ and their sheer appallingness makes us horny – quick, go and do it in the shed’ sex Are visits to your parents/in-laws often quite… fraught? Is there a terrible, stifling air of unhappiness, and frantic over-tidying, in their house? Do they snap at each other with all the brittle tension of 45 years of loveless marriage? Is there a sofa you’re not allowed to sit on, or a complicated system of outdoor shoes/indoor slippers, or a clock that ticks very loudly in an otherwise tensely silent room? Congratulations – you’re about to become so horny that you’ll run off and do it in the downstairs guest bathroom, against a wall, disrupting the carefully ordering of the special pink towels on the towel rack. “I am chaos! I am humanity! I am life!” you will gasp, as your husband bangs you so frantically, the White Company potpourri falls off the tiny spindly table and confettis to the floor, like a metaphor in a bad pop video from the 1980s. The “unhappy people make me horny” mechanism is also sprung into action when visiting friends who are divorcing (you will drive the car 800 yards around the corner and frisk in a layby), and also when on holiday with terrible people. There can barely be a holiday cottage in Devon sleeping eight or more that has not seen a tense barbecue (“Well, William here got the wrong charcoal. Again.”) followed by one couple subsequently sloping away to frantically vibrate in the weird disused room with the ping-pong table and spiders in it. The ‘we told each other our fantasies and it went wrong’ shag – AKA ‘I can never talk to the UPS delivery driver again’ Self-explanatory. “Spice up a long-term relationship – by telling each other your most secret sexual dreams,” sex experts say. Absolutely never do this. It is terrible advice. If you’ve got by for 15 years without telling each other about your thing for Martina Navratilova, don’t disrupt your delicate sexual ecosystem by suddenly throwing it into the mix on your birthday, when you’re pissed, in your knickers, holding a tennis racket. It’ll ruin Wimbledon for ever, for a start – and it tends to bring awful consequences. Unless you happen to be married to one of Britain’s great character actors – Paddy Considine, say, or Toby Jones – suggesting role-play is likely to be an agony you will never forget. Your average 45-year-old husband’s ability to convincingly play – without rehearsal or script – a hot pirate or sexually-curious-yet-repressed Victorian doctor is likely to be quite low. The role you will end up playing, after half an hour of self-conscious Scottish accents and hat-wearing, is that of a frustrated Hollywood director, saying, “Let me tell you a bit about Dr Sexington’s backstory. I think it would help give you more range”, while your husband sadly detumesces and wishes he was in Equity, so he could make a complaint about hostile working conditions. Doggy-style Not the position – although, word to the wise: if you do it with the lights on, it is apt to cause you to notice a pile of dirty washing you kicked under a chair last Tuesday, and exclaim, “Oh, that’s where my dungarees are! I was looking for them. You see, the shed key is in the pocket, and I could not for the life of me remember where I’d put it. Now I can mow the lawn!”, which can put everyone off their stride – but the situation. If, some time into your relationship, you get a dog, you will quickly learn that dogs become very upset when a mummy and a daddy love each other very much. They will analyse the situation as, “People who give Dog meat are fight! This are danger to Dog!”, and attempt to Kofi Annan themselves in between your warring genitals. This scenario tends to upset the delicate balance of your sexual compatibility – as one of you (the “Sex Monster”) is fine with locking the stupid bloody dog in the kitchen and hearing its distant weeping, while the other of you (“David fucking Attenborough here”) definitely isn’t. You will end up having to put on the TV, in order to drown out the sounds of Dog Sadness, which is a whole other barrel of pickles in itself (“Just put anything on. Quick! Dr Sexington needs to make his rounds!” “All I can find is Homes Under The Hammer, or some documentaries about the Nazis, and they both make my fanny shut like a clam.” “A DVD on, then!” “I can only find Peppa Pig, Davina’s 15-Minute Workout and season three of The Wire! Why does no one put these DVDs in the right boxes?” “Oh… forget it. Dr Sexington has died”). All the above is, of course, directly transferable to “having children”, too. The querulous utterance of “Mummy, what are you doing?” has prevented more sex than religion and Donald Trump’s face combined. The ‘unexpected purple patch’ This handily describes both the phenomenon, and the visual state of your genitals when it happens. Every so often, in a long-term relationship – the onset of spring, or the purchase of a particularly rakish cardigan – you will have sudden, mad, hormonal weeks of terrifyingly intense pumping, where you do it so much, you both end up semi-injured and have to circle each other warily in case more humping breaks out. “Stop looking so irresistibly sexy,” you will say to your ageing, careworn spouse, as they try to mend the waste-disposal unit in the sink. “Are you trying to make me lose my mind? You saucy little minx.” You will then fly at their Blue Harbour trousers like a woman possessed, as they weakly say things such as, “But we did it last month!” or, “My hand is still wedged in the innards of the unit – be careful!” At this point, you are literally having All The Sex, and if you don’t want to end up in A&amp;E, you probably need to have another child, in order to put the brakes on the whole painful shebang.

The comparative polarisation of media consumers in Australia compared with those in other countries is one of the findings of the Digital News Report, Australia 2018 – a regular collaboration between the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford and the News and Media Research Centre – University of Canberra. The majority of Australian survey participants (60%) identified themselves as political centrists, with 40% identifying strongly with the left or right side of politics. “This reflects a slightly higher degree of political polarisation amongst Australian news consumers than the global average of the 37 countries surveyed,” the survey released on Thursday says. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The study finds that Australian viewers of commercial TV networks and the subscription channel Sky News are more right-leaning than the ABC television audience, which attracts viewers evenly from across the political spectrum. The report notes strong partisan identification by Australian news consumers with particular news brands, with rightwingers more likely to read the Australian and watch their nightly TV news on the Nine or Seven networks, and leftwingers more likely to read Fairfax newspapers and watch SBS. Australian news consumers who identify as leftwing have the highest interest in news and access it most often. In the online news world, outlets including Guardian Australia and BuzzFeed “attract strong leftwing audiences” but the online offerings news.com.au and Yahoo7 skew right. The ABC audience is mixed picture. Consumers of the ABC TV news come from all sides of the political divide but the national broadcaster’s online news service “attracts a heavily leftwing audience”. The survey also reveals this was the year when mobile devices overtook computers as the primary means of accessing online news, with almost 60% of Australians surveyed now consuming their news on the go. There are two heartening pieces of news for mainstream media outlets. Audience trust in established news brands is improving, with an increase from 42% to 50% from last year’s survey, and there has been a 10% increase in the last two years in the number of Australians reporting they are paying for news – the biggest increase out of 37 countries surveyed. Australians are also very concerned about fake news and believe it is the job of news organisations, rather than the global distributors of online content – Google or Facebook – to correct misinformation. But the report notes that globally, concern about political misinformation is much higher than people’s reported experience of it. “In Australia 67% of news consumers are worried but only 25% say they have encountered it,” it says. The form of fake news experienced by most people is “poor journalism”, and news consumers concerned about misinformation are inclined to pay for news they value. Consumers who access information via social media feeds report encountering more more fake news, and this group has lower trust in news. “However, those with higher news literacy also report experiencing more fake news, possibly because they are better at discerning the quality of reporting,” the report says. “There are signs news consumers are adopting strategies to manage their exposure to misinformation by accessing trusted sources directly via brand websites and apps, using news aggregators to get tailored news and following news sources directly on social media.” The report notes “there is an opportunity for news organisations to continue to improve the quality of their reporting with a view to encouraging more people to pay for it”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/12/justice-minister-phillip-lee-resign-over-brexit-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T09:23:55Z","webTitle":"Justice minister Phillip Lee resigns over Brexit policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/12/justice-minister-phillip-lee-resign-over-brexit-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/12/justice-minister-phillip-lee-resign-over-brexit-policy","fields":{"headline":"Justice minister Phillip Lee resigns over Brexit policy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The justice minister Phillip Lee has resigned over the UK government’s handling of Brexit, dealing a significant blow to Theresa May before key Commons votes on the EU withdrawal bill. The minister for victims, youth and family justice, who supported remain at the referendum, said he was “incredibly sad” to stand down, but that he believed the government’s Brexit policy was detrimental to the lives of his constituents. His departure will increase the number of rebels planning to oppose the government on a key amendment to the bill later on Tuesday. The debate on a “meaningful vote” on any final Brexit deal is expected to come down to the wire after No 10 sources said it would not back a compromise deal offered by the leading Tory pro-Europe rebel Dominic Grieve. Lee, the MP for Bracknell since 2010, confirmed on Twitter that he was quitting in order to back the meaningful vote amendment, and also said he would support a second referendum on the final Brexit deal. In a statement on his website, he wrote: “The main reason for my taking this decision now is the Brexit process and the government’s wish to limit parliament’s role in contributing to the final outcome in a vote that takes place today. “If, in the future, I am to look my children in the eye and honestly say that I did my best for them I cannot, in all good conscience, support how our country’s exit from the EU looks set to be delivered.” In a statement, he added: “I am incredibly sad to have had to announce my resignation as a minister in Her Majesty’s government so that I can better speak up for my constituents and country over how Brexit is currently being delivered. “I believe that the evidence now shows that the Brexit policy our government is currently pursuing on the basis of the 2016 referendum is detrimental to the people we are elected to serve.” Lee’s departure is expected to bolster support for those MPs who have already indicated they will rebel ahead of the votes on Tuesday. One Conservative source has claimed that there are also one or two MPs, beyond the original 11 rebels from December, who could vote against the government on the issue. His support for a second referendum will particularly worry Brexiters who fear that a fresh Tory voice speaking out in favour of a vote on the final deal could mark an escalation of the campaign to stay in the EU. He tweeted: “Then, when the government is able to set out an achievable, clearly defined path – one that has been properly considered, whose implications have been foreseen, and that is rooted in reality not dogma – it should go to the people, once again, to seek their confirmation.” However, he added: “I voted to remain in the European Union and have not changed my view that continued membership would have been the better strategic course. Even so, I believe that it would be impossible and wrong to seek to go back to how things were before the referendum”. Ahead of January’s reshuffle, there was some speculation that Lee, still a practising GP, could be in line to take over from Jeremy Hunt at the Department for Health amid Tory fears that it had lost the confidence of health professionals after a series of difficult reforms. He ended up staying at the Ministry of Justice. He was also understood to have been frustrated by the government’s decision to drop plans to improve conditions for women in prisons. Lee added: “If Brexit is worth doing, then it is certainly worth doing well; regardless of how long that takes ... For me, resigning is a last resort – not something that I want to do but something I feel I must do because, for me, such a serious principle is being breached that I would find it hard to live with myself afterwards if I let it pass.” A Downing Street source said: “We will get a good Brexit deal that works for everybody in the UK. The government’s amendment today provides for a meaningful vote.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/14/theatre-refugees-west-yorkshire-playhouse-home-migration-matters","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-14T10:36:38Z","webTitle":"Northern theatres put refugees' work centre-stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/14/theatre-refugees-west-yorkshire-playhouse-home-migration-matters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/14/theatre-refugees-west-yorkshire-playhouse-home-migration-matters","fields":{"headline":"Northern theatres put refugees' work centre-stage","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 2013, West Yorkshire Playhouse staged Refugee Boy, an adaptation of Benjamin Zephaniah’s novel about an Ethiopian-Eritrean teenager arriving in Britain. Alongside the play, the theatre engaged extensively with refugees and asylum seekers in Leeds, and the following year the Playhouse was named the UK’s first theatre of sanctuary. “We didn’t want it to just feel like we’ve put on a play about refugees, great, we’ve ticked that box,” says Ruth Hannant, who heads the Playhouse’s creative engagement team. “We wanted to try and embed it into our wider theatre programme.” Today, theatre of sanctuary events include a women’s choir, a drop-in session for young refugees and asylum seekers, and regular, informal opportunities for new arrivals to practise their English. In particular, the theatre has worked with Syrians, helping them to find their feet in Leeds. While some activities, such as drama workshops and public performances, involve participants directly in the creative work of the theatre, others are about simply welcoming people through the door. “In a world where you feel displaced, having that place to come every week where you feel truly a part of something can be a real lifeline,” says Hannant, who believes it’s all about “human contact”. Hannant’s words might pinpoint the key to shifting the national narrative. Next week is the 20th anniversary of Refugee Week, which was established to push back against a wave of negative feeling towards refugees. At a time of increasing animosity, seen in the rise in hate crime after the Brexit vote and the government’s “hostile environment” policy, and with local authorities in the north of England housing a disproportionate number of new arrivals, this year’s events in Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield are taking on an important role in building understanding between communities. As Refugee Week is emphasising with its campaign encouraging people to take simple but meaningful actions to support and celebrate refugees, small points of connection can have a big impact on attitudes. Theatres, as a platform for sharing stories and generating empathy, could play a vital part in this change of perspective. At Home in Manchester, a new festival is a way of showcasing the creative work already being done by refugees and asylum seekers in the area. One More Push is a new storytelling show by Fereshteh Mozaffari, an Iranian writer living in exile in the UK. “It’s about the idea of pain and rebirth and her experience as a refugee, as a professional woman and as a writer,” explains Anne Louise Kershaw, community and outreach programme producer at Home. The venue is also using its Made at Home programme to support Iranian musician Ali Jaberi, who will be in residence in the theatre developing All Because of Love, a show inspired by the life and work of 13th-century Persian poet Rumi. The week of events, from puppet theatre to poetry, builds on existing relationships with the refugee community in Manchester. The crucial shift, though, is that the theatre is making this work more audience-facing. Over the course of the festival, Home and its producing partner Community Arts North West will be working with more than 100 artists from the refugee and asylum seeker communities in Manchester, including African musicians’ collective Amani Creatives. There’s a similar expansion in Sheffield, where the third Migration Matters festival will be the biggest yet, involving theatre, music, dance, film and visual arts. This year, Refugee Week at the West Yorkshire Playhouse will have a slightly different face. Rather than the broad programme of events it has run in previous years, a celebration of refugee stories will be folded into a main-stage production, Searching for the Heart of Leeds. Performed by a community cast and including performances by Asmarina Voices, the theatre of sanctuary choir, it is based on interviews with more than 200 Leeds residents. The show’s director, Alex Ferris, believes that integrating the theatre of sanctuary programme with a main-stage show “shifts the narrative”, asserting that these voices are just as central to the local community as anyone else’s. Likewise, Kershaw stresses that the work Home is doing is as much about artist development as creative engagement. “Not all artists only want to be labelled … refugee,” she points out. “They’re also theatre-makers, writers, musicians, and it’s about showcasing and celebrating the talent that exists within our city.” Ferris stresses that the Playhouse’s status as a theatre of sanctuary impacts on all aspects of the organisation’s work “equally and intrinsically”. Searching for the Heart of Leeds involves theatre of sanctuary participants as both interviewees and performers, and a scene set within Leeds’s refugee community plays a pivotal role in the show. “It helps our central character who’s having a few doubts about living in Leeds,” explains Ferris. “It’s the catalyst for helping her to reconnect and understand what her city’s all about.” Searching for the Heart of Leeds is at West Yorkshire Playhouse, 19-23 June. Refugee Week festival is at Home, Manchester, 16-22 June. Migration Matters festival is in Sheffield, 19-23 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/12/england-v-south-africa-second-womens-odi-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T19:07:37Z","webTitle":"England beat South Africa to level women's ODI series – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/12/england-v-south-africa-second-womens-odi-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/12/england-v-south-africa-second-womens-odi-live","fields":{"headline":"England beat South Africa to level women's ODI series – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So there we go. Have a good evening - ta-ra. Sarah Taylor is the man of the match. She likes batting on her home ground and also with Tammy Beaumont - they hit in different areas and have fun together. The defeat in the first game was just a bad dat at the office, but she looked to play a bit straighter today. She also praises Sophie Ecclestone, who came back well. Heather Knight says England started much better and notes that Beaumont and Taylor love batting together. Not much needed to be said after the kicking England took at Worcester, and the pitch wasn’t “an absolute belter”, but the batters picked their shots better. Knight still sees herself as a bowling option, but wasn’t required today. Dane van Niekerk says it was like “a runaway train” when England got going, and they knew how good Beaumont and Taylor were. She believed her team could win for a bit, when Lee was hitting it miles, but they expected the world champions to come back fighting, which they did. She gives credit to England, and hopes to go better on Friday. England might be slightly concerned by how long it took them to take a wicket, and how impotent their change bowlers looked. But it’s hard to whinge too much when you win so well, so the decider should be a belter. It fizzled out at the end, but that was an excellent game of cricket, the first in the women’s game ever to feature three centuries. Lee’s in particular, was brilliant, but she couldn’t see it through or, more properly, didn’t get enough help. So, it’s off to Canterbury on Friday; the winners there win the series. 49th over: South Africa 262-9 (Kapp 29, Ntozakhe 3) Target 332 Brunt is trying all her variations to get her third wicket, but has to make do with ceding two. 49th over: South Africa 260-9 (Kapp 19, Ntozakhe 2) Target 332 And there she goes, cracking Marsh over the top and against the boundary advertising for six. Next, she deflects to mid on and looks for a two that isn’t on, but Brunt misses the stumps and Marsh isn’t in position to break them. 48th over: South Africa 251-9 (Kapp 19, Ntozakhe 2) Target 332 Brunt will not be wanting to hang around here, but she can’t force the breakthrough. A single from the over, and Kapp actually looks a pretty competent batter. 47th over: South Africa 250-9 (Kapp 18, Ntozakhe 2) Target 332 Are the batters going to console themselves with a red-inker, or are they going to free their arms? Five singles from the over. 46th over: South Africa 245-9 (Kapp 16, Ntozakhe 0) Target 332 Can England finish this off? Khaka tries to force the issue, mowing across the line only to pick out Sciver at short midwicket. Brunt enjoys herself, as is her wont; my money is still on England. 46th over: South Africa 243-8 (Kapp 14, Khaka 0) Target 332 The required rate is now above 19; Katherine Brunt, just what you need. 45th over: South Africa 243-8 (Kapp 14, Khaka 0) Target 332 Kapp walks down the track and turns two over to the leg side - in the air, but safe. Ismail gets down on one knee, takes an almighty swing, and the ball goes hectares up in the air. Marsh is alert, though, and moves to her right to claim the catch. 44th over: South Africa 240-7 (Kapp 12, Ismail 3) Target 332 Ecclestone continues and raps Kapp on the pad - they appeal on principle, but the umpire is having no such thing. The over yields but three singles, phut, sputter, etcetera. 43rd over: South Africa 238-7 (Kapp 11, Ismail 2) Target 332 13.95 is now the required rate. I think England might sneak this. Lackay gets a lot of this, but hits it straight at extra cover, where Heather Knight gets down low and hangs on well. England have caught pretty well today. 42nd over: South Africa 230-6 (Kapp 4, Lackay 0) Target 332 The required rate is now 12.75. Tryon comes outside her crease, heaves, and sends the ball swirling into the sky. But at long on, Wyatt judges the flight, keeps the heid and takes the catch at chest-height. That was a really decent innings, but - Tryon can become a player. 41st over: South Africa 226-5 (Tryon 43, Kapp 2) Target 332 Knight decides to keep Shrubsole on for her final over, but her first ball is on the pads so is feathered behind for four. A dot follows, then Tryon backs away and though she’s not set at the point of contact, still manages to belt six over cover! She’s got an eye, she has. But Shrubsole comes back well, her final three deliveries yielding just a single. 40th over: South Africa 216-5 (Tryon 32, Kapp 2) Target 332 Kapp scoops a leading edge around the corner that gets her off the mark with two. The required rare is now 11.38. Oh yes! Du Preez swipes over mid on but Elwiss is there and leaps with both hands above her head to take a belter that’s far trickier than the one she ruined last over. 39th over: South Africa 212-4 (Du Preez 10, Tryon 32) Target 332 Shrubsole returns and Du Preez has a dart, skying a leading edge towards long on. Elwiss does everything right, running around to get under it, then spills it! Whoops! And Tryon rubs it in when sent down a full one, carting it over square leg with minimum effort and maximum prejudice. 38th over: South Africa 202-4 (Du Preez 7, Tryon 25) Target 332 Du Preez takes one, and Tryon then drives four through fine mid on. But this time she can’t find a further boundary, just one more run coming from the next four deliveries. 37th over: South Africa 196-4 (Du Preez 6, Tryon 20) Target 332 Surely! Tryon comes down, makes room, and spanks Elwiss for six down the ground. That was a lovely hit, but can she follow it up? She tries, coming across her stumps to open up the leg side, Sarah Taylor-style, but can’t get enough of it ... but then she can! Forward, across, down on one knee and six over midwicket! 36th over: South Africa 182-4 (Du Preez 5, Tryon 7) Target 332 This is all very sedate now. Four singles is all South Africa can manage, amid an appeal for caught behind when Tryon may or may not have edged. Surely the batters will have a dart now. 35th over: South Africa 178-4 (Du Preez 3, Tryon 5) Target 332 Elwiss has been much tighter in her second spell, but Tryon drives four as Wyatt chases, bellyflops, and misses. There are two other singles from the over, which is to say these need to steam in. 34th over: South Africa 172-4 (Du Preez 2, Tryon 0) Target 332 The required rate is at a fat, round 10.00 at the end of the 34th, and the question now is whether England bowl South Africa out or not. There we go. Ecclestone, looking to cramp Van Niekerk, bowls straight and full, but Van Niekerk has no choice but to chuck hands at it anyway. She can’t get under the ball properly, it flies high into the air, and is caught comfortably at mid on. 33rd over: South Africa 171-3 (Van Niekerk 9, Du Preez 2) Target 332 Du Preez gerts off the mark with a Red Bull single; the required rate is now 9.60. This is an excellent catch. Lee cuts hard and it flies to point, phizog-height; Wyatt does really well to get the hands up while taking half a step back, and that is probably that. What an innings, though! 33rd over: South Africa 166-2 (Lee 116, Van Niekerk 7) Target 332 Back comes Elwiss, her field suggesting a full and straight line... 32nd over: South Africa 166-2 (Lee 116, Van Niekerk 7) Target 332 Ecclestone replaces Brunt; here we go. Or he we don’t go; both Lee and Van Nikerk look to free their arms, but three singles is all they manage and this is slipping away from South Africa now. Well bowled, Sophie Ecclestone. 31st over: South Africa 164-2 (Lee 115, Van Niekerk 5) Target 332 After three dots, Van Niekerk has a slash at Shrubsole, but the ball goes just pass Wyatt’s dive. But only a single more follows, and we’re at that point again: someone needs to do something. 30th over: South Africa 160-2 (Lee 114, Van Niekerk 2) Target 332 England will want to see the back of Lee before Shrubsole and Brunt come off again and the spinners have to come on, but in the meantime the required rate has climbed to 8.6 - not impossible to achieve, but for 20 overs, very difficult. “By absolutely any standards it’s possible to imagine, that’s a sensational effort,” says Robert Wilson of Lizelle Lee. “A second fifty in 22 balls from an opener, just as the run-rate is starting to get a bit hairy. Talk about bending the game to your will. It’s less a sign of mental strength than a gross insult to probability. Wow.” Yep, it’s been brilliant. And I think she can go again too - does Heather Knight keep her top bowlers out there and hope they get a wicket, or keep them back for another go at the end? 29th over: South Africa 157-2 (Lee 113, Van Niekerk 1) Target 332 Lee hasn’t been able to attack England’s opening pair in the way she persecuted the rest of the attack, and two runs plus a wicket is a brilliant effort from Anya Shrubsole. Yorker-length ball from Shrubsole and Luus gets hold of it nicely - it’s right in her slot - but picks out Brunt at deep square, who slides under it with no little expertise. 28th over: South Africa 155-1 (Lee 112, Luus 2) Target 332 Brunt gets a proper shy at Luus, who manages a single around the corner from her fourth ball. Lee then can’t find the gap, yes she can, the final delivery of the over strays onto the pads and is duly twisted for four through deep backward square. 27th over: South Africa 150-1 (Lee 108, Luus 1) Target 332 Shrubsole returns, seeking to exploit the new batter, and Lee takes a single from her third ball; Luus can only manage the same from what’s left. The required rate is now 7.97. 26th over: South Africa 148-1 (Lee 107, Luus 0) Target 332 The batters crossed, so it’s Lee on strike and she plays a late cut that defeats the short third man, there especially not to be defeated by that shot. Wolvaardt’s hardly had a hit this last bit, and she looks to go over the leg side but doesn’t get enough of it and Jones takes a simple catch. I’m not sure if that’s a good change from Heather Knight, or one she should’ve made half an hour ago. 25th over: South Africa 140-0 (Lee 101, Wolvaardt 31) Target 332 The highest successful run chase in women’s cricket came in 2012 when Australia made 289-6 to beat New Zealand, which is to say this would be the best and by a street. Anyway, Sciver replaces Ecclestone and Lee deflects one back of a length, which comes on perfectly when she gets in a big stride, over square leg for six! So Sciver goes fuller, and again Lee gets down the track and use the pace to add four through square leg! We are witnessing something very, very special! Yes we are! a controlled pull, that’s 15 from the over, a century for Lee, and what an innings this has been! Power, patience, skill and touch, it’s all there - her second 50 took just 22 balls. This is the first women’s match to feature three tons, and what tons they’ve been. 24th over: South Africa 125-0 (Lee 87, Wolvaardt 30) Target 332 Lee has gone! She swivels on a leg side one from Marsh, caressing it around the corner for four, then cuts a wide one for four more - pressure now for England. As I’ve said all along, she’s martialing this chase perfectly. But the rest of the over yields just two singles, so achieving the run rate but without cashing in given what’s to come back. 23rd over: South Africa 117-0 (Lee 78, Wolvaardt 29) Target 332 South Africa are, though, finding gaps in the field more easily than before, and Lee brings up the hunnert with a deft turn around the corner for four. And look at that! She gets down on one knee to marmalise Ecclestone over wide mid on for six, then annihilates a full toss over square leg and onto the roof of a local accountant’s. she is such a clean and powerful hitter! Surely England will try and break this partnership now? Anyway, there’s a break while they seek the ball, but that’s 17 runs off the over. 22nd over: South Africa 96-0 (Lee 61, Wolvaardt 29) Target 332 England have not often looked, and do not really look, like getting a wicket. I wonder if England might soon bring back Brunt, Shrubsole or both, because they’ll be starting to wonder. But there’s a limit to how many overs can go by without even getting close to the required rate, and this here is another. 21st over: South Africa 92-0 (Lee 59, Wolvaardt 27) Target 332 Ecclestone and her SLA continue, and Lee absolutely mashes her over midwicket, over the fence and against the catering tent. “Shot!” she tells herself, and South Africa are starting to up the pace. 20th over: South Africa 79-0 (Lee 51, Wolvaardt 26) Target 332 Laura Marsh comes on and Lee cuts her hard, earning four through backward point. Lee then edges ... but it keeps low and goes between Taylor’s pads for four! The lights are on now, and the players are starting to dry the ball, but there it is covering itself in dew when Lee cuts again, this time squarer, and that’s her fifth fifty in six innings. She’ll have to convert this one, I shouldn’t wonder, and that’s drinks. 12 off the over, and the required rate is now 8.30. 19th over: South Africa 70-0 (Lee 39, Wolvaardt 25) Target 332 England raised their hundred in the 19th over but South Africa seem content to nurdle - despite facing a new, young bowler in Ecclestone - like it’s the 1992 World Cup final. Except it isn’t, they don’t have Wasim Akram, and they’re batting second. This is actually quite strange now. 18th over: South Africa 66-0 (Lee 36, Wolvaardt 24) Target 332 Five singles. Bats need swinging, now. 17th over: South Africa 61-0 (Lee 33, Wolvaardt 22) Target 332 Sciver tries a full, floaty one that whacks Wolvaardt on the pad, prompting a lusty appeal; it’s well outside leg, so the umpire quickly dismisses it. Wolvaardt then tries a drive over mid off, but it needed more power than she imparted and Ecclestone ought really to have taken the catch, backpeddling. But she was slow to work out her bearings, and dropped it; quickly, she is punished, when Wolvaardt swipes a one-bounce four. The required rate is now well over 8. 16th over: South Africa 55-0 (Lee 32, Wolvaardt 17) Target 332 England’s bowlers have done a pretty good job of restricting width - both batters would love to chuck hands at anything wide, and when Elwiss tries a cutter, Lee does just that - Brunt does excellently to laif around the boundary and save two with a dive. Then, with the final ball, Lee is beaten but well outside the line when hit on the pad. 15th over: South Africa 53-0 (Lee 30, Wolvaardt 17) Target 332 Wolvaardt brings up the fifty partnership with a single and Lee nabs one too, then an edge adds two more. It’s not enough, and I’m beginning to wonder what the South African gameplan is. 14th over: South Africa 49-0 (Lee 29, Wolvaardt 14) Target 332 Here we go. Lee stands and delivers, picking length, settling into a solid base, and lashing Elwiss down the ground for six. But still only seven from the over, so it was a rescue-job rather than a building job. 13th over: South Africa 42-0 (Lee 23, Wolvaardt 13) Target 332 Lee is not scared to go in the air, and a strong bottom hand allows her to whack Sciver over mid on for four; she takes two off the next ball too. These two both have starts now, and you’d expect that at least one of them will need to make something sub sub sub sub substantial if South Africa are going to get anywhere near winning this. Six from the over; the rate is now 7.84. 12th over: South Africa 36-0 (Lee 17, Wolvaardt 11) Target 332 Wolvaardt drives through the covers and they run two while Brunt cuts it off, then a drive back past the bowler is very well cut off by Shrubsole, on the bounce. Wolvaardt needs to find a few more shots, by the look of things - she can drive when it’s in the slot, but most balls aren’t. 11th over: South Africa 33-0 (Lee 17, Wolvaardt 11) Target 332 England were 61-0 at this stage, which tells you just how far behind the game South Africa are. Anyway, Sciver is into the attack and keeping it tight – a nurdled single from Lee is the only run from a hustled-through over. 10th over: South Africa 32-0 (Lee 15, Wolvaardt 11) Target 332 Elwiss, in for Gunn, replaces Brunt to bowl the final over of the powerplay; I wonder if the batters might have a go at her. Wolvaardt turns her to leg first up, and Brunt hurls at the striker’s, disappointed when Taylor can’t collect and break the stumps, but it was never a chance. Still, another good over for England - South Africa need to get a wriggle on. 9th over: South Africa 30-0 (Lee 14, Wolvaardt 10) Target 332 Interesting! Wolvaardt sees Shrubsole coming, takes a short stride down, and lamps a straight one over square leg for a one-bounce four. Three singles follow, and the required rate is now 7.36. 8th over: South Africa 23-0 (Lee 13, Wolvaardt 4) Target 332 And there we go! Brunt drops slightly short and straight, so Lee pivots on her back foot and lifts four over the leg side infield. This is more like it: back of a length delivery from Brunt, again too straight, so again Lee helps it over the leg side for four. 7th over: South Africa 15-0 (Lee 5, Wolvaardt 4) Target 332 South Africa have started to nudge the singles but they’re not going to help much unless accompanied by boundaries. Shrubsole is finding decent inswing, but Wolvaardt is preoccupied with pretty drives whene leg-side swipes is where it’s at. a single from Lee is the only run from the over. 6th over: South Africa 14-0 (Lee 4, Wolvaardt 4) Target 332 The run rate is already above seven, and a wide from Brunt does not put to put much of a dent; is that a half-rhyme? I think it’s passable. Lee then absorbs one on the body before turning a single down to fine leg, so Brutn sends down a bouncer that Wolvaardt has no idea how to play; she ducks while playing an airy drive and the ball flies past. This is an excellent start from England. 5th over: South Africa 12-0 (Lee 3, Wolvaardt 4) Target 332 Wolvaardt is a lovely driver, but can’t stop picking out the fielders. Except when she does so driving at Shrubsole’s second ball, after she did so driving at Shrubsole’s first ball, Amy Jones contrives a dive over it at the cost of four. They’re the only runs of the over, but facing its final delivery, Wolvaardt tries to drive one too close to her body, and is relieved to see it sneak by. 4th over: South Africa 8-0 (Lee 3, Wolvaardt 0) Target 332 This is not yet a problem for South Africa, but this is also not a great start. Perhaps they’re looking to see off the openers and then wade in, but they’re also chasing 332, and doing so successfully generally requires a fast start, or at least a sauntering start. Lee glances two down towards the point fence, but they’re the only runs of the over. 3rd over: South Africa 6-0 (Lee 1, Wolvaardt 0) Target 332 Lee turns one into the leg side and they run one, bringing Wolvaardt onto strike. She’s trying to unfurl that delectable cover drive, but so far can’t find the gaps. 2nd over: South Africa 5-0 (Lee 0, Wolvaardt 0) Target 332 Brunt starts well, offering Wolvaardt no width, before slinging down a wide. She responds well, though, and that aforementioned wide is the only run from the over; we’ve still had nothing off the bat. 1st over: South Africa 4-0 (Lee 0, Wolvaardt 0) Target 332 Bit of swing for Shrubsole first up, whose inswing is pinning Lee inside her crease, and after four deliveries she induces a false shot; Lee looks to turn one around the corner and misses. And what a delivery she produces next up, quick, seaming in, clipping leg stump, and rushing away for four! Lee is exceedingly amused by this, Shrubsole less so. The England players are huddling, which I fully expect to make the difference in this one. It’s pretty overcast out there, which might help the new-ball attack. Right, we’re nearly there: the players will be back with us shortly. In the first ODI, England’s bowlers had nothing at which to bowl, and South Africa’s batters had no scoreboard pressure with which to contend. The next 50 overs will tell us plenty about both, and in particular, the first powerplay will set up the match: can Lee and Wolvaardt get after Brunt and Shrubsole? It’s never too soon to revisit this. I wonder if England might be a little disappointed. I’m sure they’d have taken 331 at the start, but when Beaumont and Taylor were whacking it, they’d have fancied something nearer to 400. They’re still favourites, of course, but they’re not out of sight. Afternoon all! Sarah Taylor is a genius, what else do you want to know? What a fightback. England were smashed up on Saturday and had to bounce back today. So far, they have done just that with the batting line-up standing up with the their sixth highest ever ODI tally. Beaumont’s ton was clever and precise, Taylor’s was outrageous, brilliant and a joy to witness. I hand over to Daniel Harris with the home side in the box seat. Enjoy the second innings. I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Bye! 50th: England 331-6 (Brunt 12 not out) Brunt, who has never been more confident with the bat, smashes a full Kapp delivery down the ground for four to begin the final over. Excellent work from the visiting seamer to take pace off the ball at this stage, executing her skillz, as they say in the caper. More great running through the over, Wyatt to the danger end. Weirdly, Kapp took the ball clean but didn’t take the stumps? She didn’t appear to be watching. Odd behaviour. It means she’ll have to bowl the last ball to Wyatt... who holes out to midwicket. Excellent diving catch from du Preez. And done. 49th: England 320-5 (Wyatt 19, Brunt 4) The penultimate over didn’t bring a boundary, the eight runs all in the smaller currency of Khaka’s final over (2/72), but they scored off every ball and galloped between the wickets. That’s been a feature throughout this innings: brilliant running. 48th: England 314-5 (Wyatt 15, Brunt 0) Wyatt not missing out, deflecing then smashing Ismail for three boundaries in the over to ensure this innings will finish with a flurry. A terrible day at the office for the South African quick who finishes with 2/78 from her ten. Taylor with her foot down to the end, swiping hard but not getting Ismail out of the circle, caught by Lackay at midwicket. Many of the South Africans all go up to the century maker to offer their congratulations on a truly wonderful hand. 47th: England 300-4 (Taylor 118, Wyatt 1) Wyatt drives to get off the mark with a single from the last ball of the Kapp over and it brings up the 300 for the hosts. The 11th time England have topped 300 in ODIs and the fifth since Mark Robinson took over as coach a couple of years ago. Thanks once again to Phil Long on BBC TMS for that. Kapp, by far the best of the bowlers, has earned that entry into the book. Knight tried to lift her over fine leg but didn’t clear the fielder on the circle on the 45. Nice cameo from the captain. Enter Danni Wyatt. 46th: England 296-3 (Taylor 117, Knight 23) More fours! Ismail is unlucky, having four runs marked against her name when Taylor misses another reverse dab, just missing the off-stump but evading Lizelle Lee behind the stumps. Should have been byes but they all count. Four singles before a dot ball to finish when Taylor elects to get underneath an accurate bumper. 45th: England 289-3 (Taylor 111, Knight 21) What do you call that? A reverse standing sweep? She’s tried that earlier today, but this time Taylor executes it perfectly, down for four. Next, down the ground after making room for herself slapping over Khaka’s head for another! “Where do you bowl and who do you bowl to Sarah Taylor?” Izzy Westbury asks on the BBC call. Knight’s turn, making room to slap a bullet past extra cover into the gap to the rope. 16 off it to all-but ensure that England will be defending more than a run a ball. Brilliant batting. 44th: England 273-3 (Taylor 102, Knight 16) Kapp is back, meaning a slightly more conservative approach with four singles to begin. Oh, scrap that, Sarah Taylor is now lapping over the head of the ‘keeper, because she can. Doesn’t quite make it to the rope, so they take a couple. 43rd: England 266-3 (Taylor 100, Knight 11) van Niekerk starts her eighth over at Taylor, who uses her feet to take one down the ground for one. It’s Knight who takes the long handle instead, going inside out over cover to bosh her first boundary. Shot! Taylor again later in the over, on 98 with one ball to come, clips through midwicket and sprints back for her seventh ODI ton! Great running, emblematic of a glittering innings that has had every shot in the book and plenty that aren’t. 93 balls to get there. 42nd: England 258-3 (Taylor 97, Knight 6) Taylor lucky! To begin Ismail’s new over, she worked across her stumps to flick behind square. Didn’t quite get all of it, giving Khaka a chance to take a brilliant catch on the rope but she didn’t quite make it around even with a full-stretch dive. The champion number three now within one strike of a century now but they are happy enough to exchange singles for the rest of this over. 41st: England 248-3 (Taylor 90, Knight 4) van Niekerk is back on and races through her over giving up only three singles. It doesn’t look it from a quick look at the card, but South Africa have had a pretty good half hour or so. 40th: England 245-3 (Taylor 88, Knight 3) Ismail’s had a shocker so far but still has four overs to get through. She fights back well though giving up no boundary balls. That’s the end of the power play for the batting side, worth 35 and bringing two wickets. Not quite what they were after, then. 39th: England 239-3 (Taylor 86, Knight 2) Knight off the mark with a single, Taylor gives the strike back to her, then the captain getting another to midwicket. Plenty of space in the deep with only three allowed outside the circle in this five over block but no boundaries from here, just four runs coming from the successful Khaka set. Urrrgh! Sciver has hit a full toss to deep midwicket. Nice while it lasted. The umpires check upstairs that the terrible delivery wasn’t above the waist, but it’s fine. Nice take from Wolvaardt, who had to move forward to secure the catch. Never easy to do. 38th: England 235-2 (Taylor 83, Sciver 6) Kapp is immediately back on after that awful Ismail over. She only has four left though and she can’t bowl outside leg stump to Nat Sciver, who flicks fine for four. Such a clever little shot. “Only Nat Sciver does those weird angles on the leg side,” says Ebony Rainford-Brent on TMS. Yeah, find a TV. 37th: England 229-2 (Taylor 82, Sciver 1) Sciver is promoted up the order. Find a TV. Very high in the air, the captain van Niekerk was under it at mid-on and took the important catch. Relief for the Proteas after a brilliant Beaumont innings. Ends a dashing partnership of 156 to set this game up for the hosts. 36th: England 226-1 (Beaumont 101, Taylor 80) Happy hour begins for England in a perfect position to land a knock-out blow in this game. Ismail starts her third spell from the far end with five overs up her sleve for this period. Good signs from the batting pair, who turn one into two from a pull shot hit to the sweeper. The opener follows it with a standing slap through cover for four! Into the 90s in lovely fashion. Then four more off an inside edge brings her to 97! Not far at all from the stumps but it doesn’t matter because to 100 she goes! Three fours in a row! That’s one way to move through the nervous 90s! With one of her best shots of the day, steering a lovely cut shot into the gap at backward point. It was her 12th four along with one six. 107 balls to make her fourth ODI ton. Fantastic knock. 16 from the over. Yikes. Been a while. 35th: England 210-1 (Beaumont 86, Taylor 79) To break it up, Taylor moves across her stumps in premeditated fashion from the last ball of van Niekerk’s over and picks it up expertly through the gap at midwicket for four. Nice shot to take a drinks break on. 34th: England 203-1 (Beaumont 85, Taylor 74) Plenty of talk about changing the batting order if England lose a wicket now. Sciver sure would be fun. But don’t discount Knight, who showed in the Women’s Ashes that she is also capable of giving it the big ones. Wyatt could also get a promption. I’d rather see both of these two get to 100 first, mind. Spot on from Kapp here once more, conceding just two singles. So, that’s only eight runs from the last three overs to put the brakes on at last. 33rd: England 201-1 (Beaumont 84, Taylor 73) Good back to back overs as the sun burns through the cloud. After three dots in a row (haven’t said that in a while) Beaumont plays a false stroke attempting to take van Niekerk over the top after coming down the track. Sure enough, the top edge falls between three Proteas’ fielders running around behind the bowler. The England 200 comes up with it but there is only two from the over. Much better. Can Kapp take advantage and force an error from the other end? 32nd: England 199-1 (Beaumont 83, Taylor 72) Attack-leader Kapp is back for her fifth over and not before time. They need her to break this up immediately. A lot more respect being shown when Kapp has the ball in her hand, with just four runs coming. South Africa’s best over in a long while. Something to build from. 31st: England 195-1 (Beaumont 81, Taylor 72) When Beaumont gets her turn, she wants to sweep van Niekerk. So good at it, she gets two with her first attempt with no risk at all. Actually, the right-hander nearly falls over when attempting the lapped version of the stroke later in the over but keeps it together. More runs to the sweepers on the leg side to finish. 30th: England 189-1 (Beaumont 78, Taylor 69) Yuk. Awful start to the Khaka over, allowing Taylor to smack a full toss around the corner for four more. She could beat Beaumont to a century here. Indeed, she should. Oh, the placement! Taylor has made room outside the legstump next up and had the flexibility to alter her stroke to again pick the gap behind the square leg umpire for a second boundary in three balls to start this over. She’s quite unstoppable on days like today. 29th: England 180-1 (Beaumont 78, Taylor 60) Sweeps and paddles and pulls. Runs to the sweepers milked from every van Niekerk delivery. 28th: England 174-1 (Beaumont 74, Taylor 58) Sarah Taylor’s 50! Brings it up through long-on with a single to reach the mark in just 45 balls. Outstanding white-ball batting, scoring all around the ground. Beaumont, going stroke for stroke, ramps a single of her own. This is the Taylor show though, driving Khaka magnificently through the covers - four more. Oh dear, another boundary off the pad, down the legside and running to the rope. “The wheels are starting to fall off,” says Izzy Westbury on TMS and she’s spot on. Taylor keeps the strike with a punch to the square leg sweeper. The 100 partnership is also raised in the expensive over. 27th: England 160-1 (Beaumont 73, Taylor 49) Blimey, what is that?! Sarah Taylor being Sarah Taylor, that’s what it is. She creates a full toss from nothing, reaching out to pull through midwicket for four more. The South African captain, with the ball in her hand, has no answer here. She fights back well with a well-landed wrong’un, but allows Taylor to walk another single from a full toss. Lucky that the over didn’t go for more. 26th: England 153-1 (Beaumont 72, Taylor 43) Well, they are going to regret dropping Taylor. The superstar local tried to play a standing reverse sweep early on - why wouldn’t she? - but didn’t make contact. In response, she unleashed two conventional shots through the legside either side of square leg - a pull then a sweep - to secure back to back boundaries for the second time in her stay. Up comes the England 150. 25th: England 143-1 (Beaumont 72, Taylor 34) Okay, van Niekerk at last. Taylor accumulating from every delivery, Beaumont gets one from a paddle. Six very straightforward runs added. Perfect middle-overs batting. 24th: England 137-1 (Beaumont 70, Taylor 30) That will be SIX more! Beaumont sweeping with raw power. Moves across the off-side and launches the left-arm seamer Tryon. A couple more down the ground to finish takes her into the 70s. 23rd: England 128-1 (Beaumont 62, Taylor 30) Taylor’s turn, smashing Ntozakhe through midwicket! Cop that! Oh, but a dropped catch next ball! Taylor reversing, and gets four, but via the hands of the fielder at point. You can’t drop Sarah Taylor when she’s batting like this. Beaumont sweeps conventionally to keep the strike to cap a run of four more singles in a row. 12 off that over. Gotta get the wrist spinners on and change this up or it’ll get massive. Otherwise, I’m with Causters, some records will tumble here soon. 22nd: England 116-1 (Beaumont 60, Taylor 20) Here comes Tammy! Over the top twice for back to back boundaries off Tryon, over long-on with ease after using her feet. That reminds me of her pair of 2016 centuries, where she drove the bowlers over their head at will after passing 50. Ten off the over. This could get really big. 21st: England 106-1 (Beaumont 51, Taylor 18) Beaumont is reversing sweeping Ntozakhe at every opportunity from round the wicket. She doesn’t make contact this time, but three easy singles are located through the legside to keep the board ticking over. 20th: England 103-1 (Beaumont 50, Taylor 16) Taylor just knocking it around here, giving Beaumont the strike early in the over. Immediately, she brings up her 50 with a single to mid-on. Again, the field was set deep and the opener is all over it, taking on the throw to bring up the milestone. It is her sixth half-century in ODIs alongside three tons. Collected seven boundaries along the way. 60 balls to raise the bat. “From me it started from ball one,” says Charlotte Edwards on TMS. “That drive down the ground set the tone.” Another single around the corner for Taylor who is seeing them well. 19th: England 100-1 (Beaumont 49, Taylor 14) A well compiled first hundred for England, Taylor bringing up the milestone with a push down the ground. The spinner, Ntozakhe, is giving it plenty of air from around the wicket, encouraging Beaumont to dance later in the over, but she can’t beat the bowler in her follow through a couple of times in a row. So just the two runs from it. 18th: England 98-1 (Beaumont 48, Taylor 13) Chloe Tryon, the left-arm seamer, replaces Ismail at the far end to restart. Taylor takes a single down the ground, helped by a misfield. Then a quick single for Beaumont, who bunts and runs. Excellent batting to take advantage of the field sticking deep on the circle much to the dismay of Charlotte Edwards on commentary. Taylor ramps then Beaumont clips; two more singles. Too easy for this pair right now. Will van Niekerk bring herself on? She left it until about over 35 on Saturday despite taking more wickets than anybody in last year’s World Cup. Come on, skip, give it a rip. 17th: England 94-1 (Beaumont 47, Taylor 11) Ntozakhe lets Taylor rotate the strike and give Beaumont a go, who reverse sweeps first up again! Squarer on this occasion, collected before reaching the rope, but they add three. The opener is hitting that shot nicely. Singles exchanged from the pair to end the over. Drinks. England will enjoy them after an excellent first 65 minutes. “Oh cobblers,” tweets Ravi Nair at me. “Jones is a great cricketer but, as this dismissal shows, she’s not yet winning matches. Yes we have to build resilience and Jones likes to open, but. If we want to win, why aren’t we opening with Wyatt, who has surely been our best bat in the last year?” 16th: England 87-1 (Beaumont 43, Taylor 8) Ismail sticking with it from the far end but Taylor is ticking the board over at will, this time with a couple behind square early in the over. Only one further single to point though, so Taylor keeps the strike. 15th: England 84-1 (Beaumont 43, Taylor 5) Spin again from Ntozakhe to Taylor. She’s once again able to get down the other end straight away, behind square leg. Oh no, it’s an overstepped no-ball as well!.“That’s criminal!” roars Edwards on radio. So, that’s a free hit for Beaumont. Not much of a shot with it, swinging hard with a top edge, landing just outside the circle at cover. Always hard with a free hit. The spinner does find Taylor’s inside edge to finish, a single spitting out to the fielder at short fine. Lucky not to play on there. 14th: England 76-1 (Beaumont 40, Taylor 1) The home town hero Sarah Taylor walks out at number three and is straight off the mark with an easy single. Ismail is short again to Beaumont, who lifts her around the corner very fine to the boundary again. Not the most convincing shot, but just got the inside edge or glove or splice to it, by the looks. Her seventh four and she’s into the 40s. “I have been getting frustrated at people talking about South Africa as the underdogs,” says Charlotte Edwards on TMS. “For two years they have been playing some excellent cricket. Many of the South Africans are playing in the WBBL and the KSL playing globally.” Throws it away! Just as Jones did on Saturday, she has fallen when looking in complete control. The opener has miscued a pull to midwicket, nothing much in it at all. 13th: England 70-0 (Jones 29, Beaumont 35) Cleeeever. Beaumont gets her sixth boundary with a reverse sweep perfectly executed off Ntozakhe. “That’s a good option for Tammy,” says Lottie Edwards. “That shot is one of her strengths.” The spinner is now around the wicket and Beaumont is reversing again, albeit straight to a fielder. She gets another run down the ground more conventionally, keeping the strike. 12th: England 65-0 (Jones 29, Beaumont 30) Ismail has to dig herself out of an early hole, having bowled an expensive over at either end so far. And it is a better set, Beaumont cutting from close to her body to third man for the solitary run from it. 11th: England 64-0 (Jones 29, Beaumont 29) Spin for the first time today now that the field can be spread. Ntozakhe, the off-spinner, was frugal on Saturday and raced through her overs in about 60 seconds apiece. I like that she is over the wicket here. Honours shared, just the three singles to the sweepers. This is now Amy Jones’ highest score in England (thanks, BBC) having played the bulk of her internationals abroad. 10th: England 61-0 (Jones 28, Beaumont 27) Ismail has been swung around to the far end of the ground, Jones taking a single first ball. To Beaumont again, who has the bat leave her hand! All happening here. Next up, a ball short of a length beats both Beaumont and the keeper, Lee. She had a terrible day with the gloves in Worcester and hasn’t got much better here. Four byes it is. “You’ve got to have your best wicketkeeper out there,” Edwards says of Lee. “With her opening the batting it looks too much for Lee.” Beaumont again, cutting four more! Wonderful timing and makes no mistake with the placement in the final over of the power play. It sure was a productive one. 9th: England 51-0 (Jones 27, Beaumont 22) That was Jones’ second six in ODIs, Phil Long tells us on TMS. Her only other big one was in Narpur in March, where she made 94, her highest international score. Good signs. Beaumont now, taking a couple to start Khaka’s new over before smashing her through midwicket to the rope to bring up England’s 50. Real stand and deliver stuff there, bouncing only a couple of times before reaching the line. Fantastic start from the hosts. 8th: England 45-0 (Jones 27, Beaumont 16) Biiiig over deep square leg from Jones off Kapp! Really given that a wallop from a ball too short to a player like Jones, who stands tall in the crease and requires no encouragement to play from he back foot. They go upstairs to make sure it has gone the distance, and it has: SIX RUNS! Kapp is right back on it next ball, sliding a yorker into Jones, who just keeps it out. Later in the over, an even better shot from Jones, square driving with wonderful timing to the boundary at cover point. Whaddashot! She’s up and about. “She does look the real deal at the top of the order,” says her former captain Charlotte Edwards on TMS. 7th: England 35-0 (Jones 17, Beaumont 16) Both players take singles with nice drives to the point sweeper. Really encouraging way to tick the board over in these early overs when building a base. Beaumont continues to present a straight blade to Khaka. She’s in much better touch today. 6th: England 33-0 (Jones 16, Beaumont 15) Kapp keeping Jones honest early, who is on the advance later in the over to drive straight. But again, it is too straight, crashing into the stumps at the non-strikers end and she’s robbed of a boundary. Strikes another nice drive to finish, but straight to extra cover. Instead of runs, that is a maiden. South Africa’s first of the day. 5th: England 33-0 (Jones 16, Beaumont 15) Lizelle Lee is up to the stumps for Khaka, who is bowling from our broadcast end. She’s nice and full to Beaumont, who leaps on her front foot to strike a pristine cover drive. That’s Beaumont at her best, what we remember well from the last couple of summers in this country. She’s driving again to end the over, but straight enough that Khaka is able to make a good stop in her follow through. Just the start that England needed after their collapse on Saturday. 4th: England 27-0 (Jones 15, Beaumont 10) Unlike her opening partner, Kapp does get a second over. Again, she is using the seam to bring it back at the right handers, this time Beaumont who is a touch uncomfortable early on in the set. Does well to keep her posture and grab one to midwicket. Very poor finish from Kapp, dropping a half-tracker in at Jones who loves pulling, doing so here for four. Can’t bowl there to her. 3rd: England 22-0 (Jones 11, Beaumont 9) Immediate bowling change for South Africa. Very unusual after the first over of the day, Khaka replacing Ismail. The first ball is waaaay wide and called accordingly. Next up, short and wide giving Jones the chance to strike her through cover. An easy boundary, her first today. Does it again next ball, on the back foot and beating the stacked off-side ring field. Very poor start from South Africa from this end. “England are timing the ball beautifully,” says Ebony Rainford-Brent on TMS. Khaka recovers well, but England have taken nine from it. 2nd: England 13-0 (Jones 3, Beaumont 9) Jones turns the strike over first ball from Kapp’s day - gliding to third man - then Beaumont does the same when clipping to square leg. Good running, good start. Better to finish, locating Jones’ inside edge that isn’t far away from the stumps on the deflection. That’s the first delivery to jag back off the seam. 1st: England 10-0 (Jones 1, Beaumont 8) Jones off the mark with a nicely-timed clip through midwicket for one. I like the fact that she’s taking the first delivery again. I had a chat with her after the opening game and at the top of the list is definitely where she wants to be. Shot! Beaumont plays a wonderful straight drive first ball, racing away to the rope. Ideal way to start her day. Ismail sprays the next down the legside and Beaumont uses the extra ball nicely, striking a second boundary for the opening over, this time carving past point. That’s a poor over from Ismail, capitalised by the openers. The players are on the field! Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont to open for England. Shabnim Ismail will be taking the first over, running away from us at the broadcast end. This is a big day for England’s women, how will they respond? PLAY! A few minutes before we begin. Use them well by reading Vic Marks on why Scotland’s men should be in the 2019 World Cup and how it could work into the future. More from the toss, via the BBC TMS call (which you can grab here) Heather Knight: “I was a bit undecided what to do, the pitch is quite dry so I don’t mind batting first, but we’ve got to bat a bit better than we did the other day,” she said. “As a team, we want to play positive, attacking cricket but adapt to the conditions.” We’re yet to hear if Gunn was dropped or is injured. Either way, Elwiss has earned her recall after sound form with both ball and bat so far this year at all levels of the game. Dane van Niekerk: “The conditions suit us,” she said, citing the experience some of her team had playing at this ground in last year’s KSL Finals. “After the heartbreak of the World Cup, that’s been our driving force, we don’t want to go through that again” No surprises at the toss. South Africa were always going to have a trundle first after what happened on Saturday to keep the pressure firmly on the hosts. And here are those official teams, as named: England: Amy Jones, Tammy Beaumont, Sarah Taylor (+), Heather Knight (c), Nat Sciver, Danielle Wyatt, Georgia Elwiss, Katherine Brunt, Anya Shrubsole, Laura Marsh, Sophie Ecclestone. South Africa: Women: Lizelle Lee (+), Laura Wolvaardt, Sune Luus, Dane van Niekerk (c), Mignon du Preez, Chloe Tryon, Marizanne Kapp, Shabnim Ismail, Ayabonga Khaka, Raisibe Ntozakhe, Stacey Lackay. England: Georgia Elwiss in for Jenny Gunn. Otherwise, unchanged from Saturday. South Africa: Unchanged. Just waiting on some team sheets. Teams in a tick. Hi Tanya! Don’t forget, you can stay in touch with the county cricket blog too. Forget about a cluttered browser, keep us both open as we move through the day. I see that Somerset need 247 after Notts’ massive second dig, which gives Matt Renshaw ample time to register twin-tons for the fixture. Don’t doubt him, he’s pretty good at cricket. Let’s chat. I feel like I should keep saying that my email has changed since the winter, now at this one. Yeah, you better believe I’m casual. As for the twitter, that’s the same as it ever was. Hit me on both. Would you change the England XI? Are they missing a third front-line seamer? If so, then who? Is South Africa’s pace attack the best in the world? Welcome to Hove for the women’s ODI of the summer between England and South Africa. Despite the season, the weather here is eerily similar how it was an hour before the opening rubber: very gloomy. Let’s hope for England that’s where the comparisons end after their shocker at New Road, a match that was all-but over within an hour. If the home side get knocked off again today, it will be the third time in a row they have lost a 50-over series since holding the World Cup aloft at a packed Lord’s in July last year. There is no panic in the camp as yet, per Anya Shrubsole’s words yesterday, but there might be if they cede this three-rubber contest in straight sets. South Africa are all smiles. Their coach, Hilton Moreeng, said yesterday that it was a “near to perfect” performance from his bowlers, who reduced England to 64 for six on Saturday. With the overhead conditions today, you can be sure that Shabnim Ismail, Marizanne Kapp and Ayabonga Khaka will be hoping to again get first with the ball. The teams are on the field now, England limbering up some some keepy-uppy as the Proteas move into a tight huddle for a chat. The toss is scheduled for 25 minutes from now. I saw Danielle Hazell having a bowl beforehand and it wouldn’t shock me if she came into the side given how well she went in India. Who for, though? We’ll see. Adam will be here shortly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/18/why-are-there-more-clothing-lines-for-dogs-than-disabled-people","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T05:00:35Z","webTitle":"Why are there more clothing lines for dogs than disabled people?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/18/why-are-there-more-clothing-lines-for-dogs-than-disabled-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/18/why-are-there-more-clothing-lines-for-dogs-than-disabled-people","fields":{"headline":"Why are there more clothing lines for dogs than disabled people?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Toronto-based designer Izzy Camilleri is best known for her work styling celebrities such as David Bowie, Angelina Jolie and Meryl Streep. But her latest collection, released this month, has one major difference: it is designed for people with disabilities. After doing some custom work in the early 2000s for a client who was quadriplegic, Camilleri had her “eyes opened” to how existing clothing did not necessarily work for women using a wheelchair. For example, having a “seated frame” meant that many traditionally designed trousers rode down or dug into her client’s waist. At the time, “adaptive clothing” – clothes made with disabled people in mind – barely existed; when it did, it was not aimed at fashion-conscious young adults. “Most of what was out there were clothes for [older people] living in long-term care facilities,” Camilleri says. “I realised there was nothing for younger people. [I was] motivated to fill this void.” In fact, Camilleri became so passionate about it that, in 2009, she released the revolutionary IZ collection, one of the world’s first fashion lines created for wheelchair users. Trousers do not ride down at the back or push on the wearer’s waist. Coats are cut so the customer can put them on while seated; they cover the thighs at the front, but reach only the seat of a person’s chair at the back, in order to avoid bunching. Camilleri’s new range, IZ Adaptive, goes beyond the needs of wheelchair users to cater for those with a variety of disabilities. Trousers now come with horizontal pull-tabs at the side, waist and centre of the back, through which wearers with dexterity problems can slip their fingers to help them pull up the trousers without having to grip. They have elastic waists, too, negating the need for zips. Coats in the range have magnetic fastenings and pull-tabs on zippers. Instead of being sold only through Camilleri’s website, as with her previous adaptive ranges, IZ Adaptive will be stocked by Zappos, the Amazon-owned global retailer, while her online store will ship worldwide from this autumn. The 55-piece launch collection is available at a “more accessible price point” than Camilleri’s previous range – from $25 (£19) for a T-shirt to $425 for a men’s suit. Camilleri is tapping into a widespread predicament. I have loved fashion since I was a teenager, but I soon realised this did not sit well with being a wheelchair user. Over the years, I have spent a fortune altering skirts and dresses that sit too long or too short. I cannot buy standard jeans, as the zip and buttons cut in to my waist. The most recent government audit, in 2014, said disabled access on the UK high street, from entrances to changing rooms, was “shocking” – but at least the issue is discussed. Accessibility to the clothes themselves is rarely mentioned. Stephanie Thomas, a consultant in Los Angeles and the creator of Cur8able.com, a fashion lifestyle blog about dressing with disabilities, is conscious of this contradiction. “In the US, we have the Americans with Disabilities Act, which means we have beautiful adapted, wheelchair-accessible changing rooms … and no clothing on the floor for people with seated body types,” she says. “Every time I go in to a store you can hear me mumbling. Ramps? Dressing rooms? But no clothing?” But mainstream brands are slowly coming round. In April, Tommy Hilfiger launched its second full collection of adaptive clothing, following a line for children with disabilities in 2016 and an expanded range that also served adults in 2017. The Tommy Adaptive spring 2018 collection, which features colour-blocking, stripes and the signature red-white-and-blue palette, is fronted by models including the Paralympic gold medallist Jeremy Campbell, who has a prosthetic leg, and the dancer and wheelchair user Chelsie Hill. It features innovations such as magnetic buttons, adjustable hems (to open larger at the leg), easy-open necklines, adjustable waists and one-handed zips. Already available in the US, the range will go on sale to UK shoppers in 2019. “Tommy Adaptive’s mission is to be inclusive and empower people of all abilities to express themselves through fashion,” a company spokesperson said. In many ways, this is an obvious development for an industry always looking for new ground to cover. Walk into any high street store and there will be clothing for specific consumers, be it maternity, plus size or petite. There is no reason ranges for disability should not be next. Such a move would not be a “worthy cause”, but rather smart economics. After all, disabled customers are far from a niche market: nearly one in five people in England and Wales have a disability, with a similar proportion reported in the US, and disabled people are the fastest-growing minority group in the world, according to the United Nations. The “purple pound” – the spending power of disabled people – is thought to be worth about £249bn to the UK economy alone. Thomas says this is one reason why companies have an incentive to work to understand their customers with disabilities and to get the tone right when pitching to them. “Everyone wants to wear their favourite brand. People don’t want to wear a brand that says ‘I’m super-different from you’ in a negative way,” she says. The progress that we are starting to see is long overdue. As Thomas, a congenital amputee, put it in her excellent TEDx talk on adaptive clothing in 2016: “We have more clothing in stores for dogs than we do for people with disabilities”. With Tommy Hilfiger rare among mainstream brands in selling adaptive clothing, the market is populated by independent, small-scale companies: Netherlands-based Chairmelotte offers “wheelchair couture”, while the US firm Abl Denim provides denim suited to disabled people, from lightweight denim with high waists, to avoid “downward slipping” for wheelchair users, to reverse waistbands for people with sensory-processing disorder. There is also variation across countries; while North America and parts of Europe appear to be making gains, the UK is arguably slipping behind. Emma McClelland, from Manchester, hopes to change that. In December, the 30-year-old quit her job as an editorial manager at a law firm to launch Kintsugi Clothing, a fashion line designed with the aim of being “fashionable, accessible and inclusive”. It is a labour of love for McClelland – the project is self-funded by her savings and freelance work and she is selling her house to invest in the development of the range. It was Thomas’s TEDx talk that inspired her to look into the adaptive clothing market. “I was surprised to find that it’s mainly beige, bland and ugly,” she says. “The more I read … the more I see how people with impairments are sidelined, even from things as simple as fashion.” She pointed to existing British adaptive ranges, such as Adaptawear and Able2Wear, which are aimed at older people and carers, rather than independent young adults and fashion-minded older customers. Having researched clothing with occupational health therapists and her local para sports teams, McClelland is now working with a manufacturer to develop samples to test on disabled users. The range will include a magnet-and-Velcro-fastening shirt and two-piece dresses and jumpsuits for wheelchair users, as well as skirts with hidden pouches for catheter bags and support belts for ileostomy bags. That adaptive clothing is slowly becoming a viable market says a lot about fashion’s changing relationship with disability – that it is moving past the idea that disability is not aspirational enough for fashion and that it is the one area of diversity that can still be excluded (the much-praised May cover of British Vogue – pegged as celebrating “diversity across the board” – featured no disabled models). But more than that it addresses popular culture’s wider assumptions of what it is to be disabled. Last month, a study by the disability charity Scope found that as many as one in eight members of the public hardly ever or never think of disabled people “as the same as everyone else”. Thomas believes the slow progress in “disability fashion” is an “oversight” that stems from this way of thinking, rather than a conscious bid to exclude disabled customers. As she points out, disabled people – often judged as “ugly freaks”, asexual or even institutionalised – have not historically been integrated into society and it is only recently that this has begun to change. The fashion industry, like any part of society, is slowly catching up. “You can’t serve someone that you don’t value and you can’t value people you don’t see,” says Thomas. “If people don’t see someone with disabilities as a fashion customer, their needs won’t be considered or met. We have to change the perception around disability. We have to change the conversation.” Perhaps the rise in adaptive clothing is a pivotal part of this conversation, one that begins to understand that just because someone’s needs may be different does not mean their interests are."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/20/fc-st-pauli-how-it-became-the-football-team-of-punk-and-techno","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T15:22:46Z","webTitle":"FC St Pauli: how it became the football team of punk and techno","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/20/fc-st-pauli-how-it-became-the-football-team-of-punk-and-techno","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/20/fc-st-pauli-how-it-became-the-football-team-of-punk-and-techno","fields":{"headline":"FC St Pauli: how it became the football team of punk and techno","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hamburg’s FC St Pauli occupies a distinctive position in world football. A bastion of leftwing activism and DIY arts, its supporters, particularly the legendary “Ultras”, are one of the western world’s most politically and culturally engaged fanbases, and the club is particularly beloved of punk and underground music fans. “St Pauli is unlike any other club,” says Tim McIlrath, frontman of American melodic hardcore band, Rise Against. “We went to their stadium, and to see ‘No Football for Fascists’ painted across the stand, to see them encouraging more girls playing football – it’s fascinating. I was looking for a club that transcends sport – St Pauli is a model of that.” It’s late May, and FCSP are hosting Antira Sankt Pauli 2018. Antira for short, it is an annual international anti-racist football tournament to which progressive, fan-led global teams are invited. As the 2018 World Cup begins, promising to be a carefully orchestrated showcase of Putin’s Russia, this inclusive, DIY contest is an interesting counterpoint to the Fifa pageant. “Everybody in Europe should be concerned about the new far-right movement,” club president Oke Göttlich tells me inside the club’s Millerntor-Stadion. “We are not a party, we only can make our values heard. But we all need to stand strong. If St Pauli can play a little role in that, we are as happy as if we won a football match.” From the outset, the atmosphere is jubilant, as enthusiastic participants waste little time in introducing themselves to one another, buying rounds and cheering each team (male, female and mixed) equally. I spend most of my time with East London’s Clapton Ultras, who praise the sense of community that they’ve found in this network of politicised sporting groups. “We’ll probably get beaten a lot though,” one player shrugs. “Because some of the other teams are actually … fit.” True, this is hardly the most technically impressive football tournament I’ve watched, but it’s also the only one at which pints of lager are passed along the touchline between substitutes. The setting, though, is exceptional: a manicured Bundesliga 2 pitch in a 32,000-capacity stadium, adorned with progressive slogans (“no human is illegal”, “football has no gender”). There’s a decent showing from British sides: Republica Leeds win the women-only competition, and Bristol’s Easton Cowboys claim the mixed-gender title alongside Berlin’s TeBe Party Army. Yet these victories seem beside the point: at the closing ceremony, each team presents another with a gift, each of roughly equal value. Away from the pitch, the Millerntor-Stadion and the surrounding area play host to a number of non-footballing events, including a workshop at which representatives of each team detail their concerns about the far-right in their homelands. DJs pump hardcore punk, ska, dub and electro through a soundsystem overlooking the pitch, and on Saturday evening, we’re treated to sets from Italian punks Bull Brigade, Connecticut rapper Ceschi Ramos, and Stuttgart ska band No Sports. Each night, after the official Antira events have concluded, I’m whisked off by locals to various other DIY events around the area, further underlining St Pauli’s deep-seated musical connections. I find myself at two techno parties, the first in a cavernous community centre in Altona, and another in Flakturm IV, a former Nazi air defence bunker. A hulking mass of concrete and steel designed to withstand allied bombing, Flakturm IV dwarfs the Millerntor. Once inside, we’re nodded through a back door for a look from the roof of the building, thanks to the bouncers’ relationship with the Ultras leading our group. Apparently FCSP Ultras are often employed as security staff in Hamburg because “they’re intelligent, but know how to fight”. To further add to the team’s punk credentials, their recent off-season American tour included a stop-off in Detroit for a Rise Against show. They’re far from the only band in thrall to St Pauli. Acts from Norwegian metal band Turbonegro and London indie group Art Brut to Icelandic post-rockers Sigur Rós and New Jersey rock outfit the Gaslight Anthem are vocally supportive. “They were one of the first clubs to not allow racists in, and they’ve been pretty left [wing], and punk rock,” Gaslight guitarist Alex Rosamilia has said. Punk and metal bars across Europe and North America are plastered with FCSP stickers and memorabilia; the team walk out to the strains of AC/DC every home game. There’s a sense of urgency in many artists’s statements about FCSP. “To stand for ideals together with FCSP is a big honour for us,” says Dema, frontman of Italian ska-punks Talco. “Especially to spread antifascist and antiracist views in a society in which the important and real things are brought out of focus.” Rise Against’s McIlrath adds: “Sport can provide sanctuary to a lot of rightwing motivations and hooliganism – FCSP taking a proactive stand against that is exciting.” And as one middle-aged Ultra tells me, FCSP supporters’ musical interests go beyond punk and metal. In the 1980s and 90s, many Ultras eschewed “cheesy German punk” for dub and reggae. His sentiment still holds – many of the younger supporters have little to do with rock and are active in Hamburg’s DIY techno, house and Afrobeat scenes. It’s increasingly rare to see a subculture blossom to this extent, certainly in the middle of a major western European city. Yet it’s writ large across Hamburg, even away from its nucleus in St Pauli. One factor may be the German government’s fiscal attitude to culture: as Arts Council England’s year-on-year budget reduction since 2010 continues with a further cut of £156m by 2022, German culture minister Monika Grütters has proposed an increase to national arts funding of €302m (£256m) a year. Affordable housing plays a part too – in 2015, Hamburg’s local authority became the first in the world to pass a law allowing the seizure of empty commercial properties in order to house migrants. Unlike London’s more covert equivalent, the city’s squat scene is not only well-known, but highly visible, particularly around such landmarks as the Rote Flora. This results in lower rents and far more public land, affording residents more time and space to engage with art, politics and charity. Combined with a port economy that relies heavily on unionised industry, and given a social institution around which to congregate – FC St Pauli – counterculture has thrived. However, this is not an uncomplicated, wholly positive situation. I’m not alone in noticing a disconnect between the tournament’s messages and its demographic; the vast majority of people here are white, more often male than female, and although there may well have been a significant LGBT+ contingent in attendance, their presence was rarely explicit. And this subculture does not exist in a peaceful, progressive bubble. Clashes between FCSP fans and far-right hooligans are commonplace, and the Ultras are famously active in antifascist violence. Furthermore, the Millerntor sits, quite literally, between two problematic issues: the gentrification of St Pauli, which forces its resident subculture away, and the organised crime that’s bolstered by the red-light district around the Reeperbahn. There are real tensions here. Nevertheless, a subculture on this scale, encompassing music, sport and politics, feels refreshing in 2018, particularly given the grassroots work that FCSP does for refugee and antifascist causes. Without this subculture, those good deeds may go undone; without comparable subcultures, who knows what else we’d lose? As Göttlich says, “If a musician is not working closely with his fans, the musician will disappear. A fan community is something to nurture. Our fans don’t always do everything right, but they are what make St Pauli special.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/12/north-korea-sanctions-may-be-lifted-after-summit-says-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T12:37:40Z","webTitle":"Optimism and confusion in Seoul over Trump-Kim summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/12/north-korea-sanctions-may-be-lifted-after-summit-says-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/12/north-korea-sanctions-may-be-lifted-after-summit-says-china","fields":{"headline":"Optimism and confusion in Seoul over Trump-Kim summit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Seoul has reacted with a mixture of optimism and confusion to the historic summit between Donald Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, after the US president announced an end to joint military exercises with South Korea. Leaders from around the region sought to capitalise on the momentum of the meeting, which resulted in a signed agreement that was light on substance but held up by Trump as a victory. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, welcomed the outcome of the summit and praised the “courage and determination of the two leaders”. “This is just a beginning and there may be many difficulties ahead but we will never go back to the ways of the past and never give up on this bold journey,” Moon said in a statement. “It is a great victory achieved by both the United States and the two Koreas, and a huge step forward for people across the world who long for peace.” But Trump’s pledge to halt longstanding military drills with South Korea sparked widespread confusion. The exercises have been repeatedly criticised by Pyongyang, which in the past has responded with missile tests. The South Korean military issued a statement to NBC News saying: “Regarding President Trump’s comment regarding ending of the combined military drills … we need to find out the exact meaning or intention behind his comments at this point.” For its part, North Korea agreed to “work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, language which was open to interpretation and fell short of Washington’s long-stated goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. No report of the summit was broadcast on North Korean television, where it is not uncommon for news to be delayed or even ignored. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, praised the agreement’s references to denuclearisation and said he was willing to engage with Pyongyang to resolve the cold war abductions of Japanese citizens by North Korean spies. “I’m determined that Japan will have to directly face North Korea and resolve [the abductions] bilaterally,” Abe said. China also appeared to want to seize on the positive atmosphere. “The United States and North Korea have been in a state of antagonism for more than half a century,” said the foreign minister, Wang Yi. “Today, that the two countries’ highest leaders can sit together and have equal talks has important and positive meaning and is creating a new history.” China suggested the international community could consider lifting economic sanctions on North Korea. “Sanctions are a means, not an end,” said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China’s ministry of foreign affairs. “The [UN] security council’s actions should support and conform to the efforts of current diplomatic talks towards denuclearising the Korean peninsula.” The comment by Chinese officials suggests the US policy of “maximum pressure” on Pyongyang until it relinquishes nuclear weapons is already showing signs of cracking. There have been reports that Kim’s charm offensive over recent months has led China to relax restrictions on trade with North Korea, violating UN sanctions. Trump alluded to relaxed Chinese restrictions, which have come without substantial concessions from Pyongyang, in a press conference in which he also praised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for implementing sanctions. “He really closed up that border … but maybe not in the last couple of months but that’s OK,” the president said. At a train station in Seoul, people cheered and applauded as televisions screens broadcast the Trump-Kim handshake live. But the reaction among many South Koreans was disappointment, and in the community of North Korean refugees now living south of the border there was a feeling of betrayal. Choi Jung-hoon, a member of the North Korean Liberation Front, a quasi-military group that advocates for the overthrow of the regime in Pyongyang, said he was furious at the outcome of the summit, which had led to “only good things for Kim Jong-un”. Choi was an army officer in North Korea’s cyber-hacking unit for almost 20 years before he escaped in 2006. “Trump completely lost to Kim, he was dragged around by Kim,” Choi said. “This has all been a political show by Trump, North Korea got away with everything they wanted. They said they will ‘denuclearise’, nothing has been said in detail.” Choi was dismayed that the US demand for complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement was absent from the agreement, and he was particularly disappointed human rights were not prominently featured. The UN estimates North Korea is holding up to 120,000 political prisoners and says the regime is guilty of crimes against humanity. Another refugee, Jung Gwang-il, who works to smuggle information into North Korea, said he was “moderately disappointed”. He previously worked at state-run trading companies but was later sent to a labour camp and tortured. He arrived in South Korea in 2004. “Promising security for Kim’s regime will mean he can stay in power and will just keep on oppressing the North Korean people,” Jung said. “If denuclearisation happens while people in North Korea are dying, it’s pointless.” Many North Koreans who have fled over the border are deeply suspicious of the Kim family, with many having suffered physical or mental abuse at the hands of the regime. Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said the summit proved that diplomacy was the right path to follow, as the bloc had done on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Trump derided and abandoned last month.

However, the weakness in the screenplay – and in the book on which it was based – is that crucial episodes depend exclusively on the uncorroborated evidence of Peter Bessell. I thought I knew Thorpe reasonably well, having served as a Liberal MP under his leadership, but as the trial approached I realised I only knew the public persona. Not so Bessell. As his successor as Liberal candidate in the Bodmin constituency (and subsequently MP) I was able to observe him closely. I have never encountered anyone so skilful in self-deception or deceiving others. I read his book, written after his humiliation at the trial to justify his role in the affair (and published only in the US to avoid a libel action in the UK), which is to my knowledge unreliable. No doubt the judge had his own curious justification for doubting the Bessell evidence. However, I too would not rely on it to conclude that the TV series has told us the whole truth. In addition to the quality of the acting, for me it still has an extra attraction, since it leaves us with a tantalising element of mystery.

Why there’s more to disgust than not getting sick\r\n","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of the fun parts of being a disgustologist – as researchers who study the emotion of disgust sometimes call themselves – must be coming up with revolting scenarios. Repulsive enough to test a theory, but not quite so stomach-turning as to repel the people who have volunteered to take the test. In a recent study led by Prof Val Curtis, director of the environmental health group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the vignettes were admirably imaginative. People were asked to rate their levels of disgust at more than 70 scenarios. These included imagining a hairless old cat rubbing up against one’s leg, stepping on a slug in bare feet, shaking hands with someone with “scabby fingers”, finding out a friend eats roadkill, finding out another attempted to have sex with a piece of fruit, and seeing “pus come from a genital sore”. And, my personal favourite, for warped imagination alone: learning your neighbour defecates in his back garden. The findings, published this week in the Royal Society’s Philosophical Transactions B journal, reveal six categories of disgust: poor hygiene, animals that are vectors of disease (such as rats or cockroaches), sexual behaviours, atypical appearance, lesions and visible signs of infection, and food that shows signs of decay. “The fact we’ve found there is an architecture of disgust that has six components to it tells us something about the way in which emotions work,” says Curtis. “It tells us that emotions are for doing particular behaviours. The emotion of disgust is about doing certain things that avoid disease – they’re about not eating spoiled food, not sticking your fingers in somebody’s weeping sore, not having sex with somebody you know is having sex with lots of other people, not picking up cockroaches and kissing them. It confirms the hypothesis that disgust really is about avoiding infection.” Sensitivity to disgust changes with age. “Very young children don’t have a strong sense of disgust,” says Curtis. “It really only kicks in when they’re about two, which is when they become independent of their parents. It ramps up over the years until you are about 30 or 40, and then it starts to drop.” They also found that women tend to be more easily disgusted than men. “We’re all evolved and we’ve all gained advantages, in terms of reproduction, by avoiding things that might have made us sick,” says Curtis. “In our evolutionary past, it tended to be mothers who looked after the children, so it really paid for them to be extra squeamish because they had to not get sick themselves. They also had to keep young, dependent children safe. Having an extra disgust towards food, for example, or if there was a sick person around who was going to make your child sick, you would perceive that a little more carefully.” When it comes to disgust around sexual behaviours, such as promiscuity, “women are particularly vulnerable to [sexually transmitted] infections. And it might reduce their ability to reproduce, and ability to bring up children, whereas men have so many more chances to reproduce than women do.” Men are also rewarded for risky behaviours, Curtis points out, which may be perceived as bravery or strength by the woman who may be keen for them to father her children. “I’m massively exaggerating, of course.” The emotion of disgust has further extensions, she says. “If I said to you: ‘You’re disgusting, you’re wearing a dirty old shirt,’ you would feel embarrassed, and, tomorrow, you wouldn’t come in wearing it. So, I can use disgust to make you behave in ways that will preserve my health. But I can also say to you: ‘You stole my purse, that’s really disgusting,’ and that will make you ashamed, so that helps make the world better.” Disgust, she says, helps teach people good manners, “so they don’t inflict their bodily emanations on other people, but it also helps to teach you how to be moral”. Disgust can be effectively used in public health campaigns. Other scientists say our disgust response can be indicative of things far broader than only wanting to avoid illness. In new research, yet to be published, researchers found that individuals who were highly sensitive to feeling disgust were also more cautious in areas not related to pathogens and infection. “We like to think of it as potentially existential risk, dangerous situations where one needs to be careful,” says Simone Schnall, reader in experimental social psychology at Cambridge University and director of the Body, Mind and Behaviour Laboratory, and one of the authors of the study. “We find individual difference [in] disgust sensitivity more broadly correlates with risk perception.” In recreational risk, such as skydiving or whitewater rafting, people who are high on disgust sensitivity also perceive greater risk in those activities than people who are low. They found it was the same for financial risk, such as gambling or making a potentially fraught investment. “Even more remote is social risk – such as voicing your opinion that goes against everyone else’s, or speaking with your superiors on an unpopular topic. Basically, putting yourself in social situations that could be perceived as uncomfortable, people who are high on disgust sensitivity find that to be more risky.” Is disgust learned or genetic? Schnall says it is not clear. “My hunch would be that there may be a genetic component, or some sort of preparedness which comes about very early in life. Would it be genetic as such? That’s hard to tell. It could be that it’s easier for some people to pick up these cues of illness and danger relative to others. There would have to be some sort of learning involved, some association: I touched this and it made me sick.” The word “disgust” to describe the feeling we would recognise today arrived, in English at least, in the mid-18th century, says Richard Firth-Godbehere, a historian of emotions. “It was taken up quite quickly because there seemed to be a gap in our language to describe this sensation. The earliest proper research was by Charles Darwin, who had wonderful photos and descriptions about disgust. He had pictures of people pulling this gape face. He noted that people, wherever he went in the world, would pull the same face if something disgusting happened.” Darwin, of course, thought it had evolutionary origins. “Freud had some strange ideas about disgust,” Firth-Godbehere adds. “He talked about the idea that the reason humans walked upright is because we wanted to keep our heads away from our genitals, and animals are closer to the ground because they’re more revolting than we are.” The American psychologist Paul Rozin has spent his career researching disgust and one of his theories is that disgust is a response to “anything that reminds us that we are animals”. There are instances where our disgust response is inappropriate, says Curtis. In the past it made sense to avoid people who were very thin, or looked ill, or had lesions or missing limbs, because it could be indicative of infectious and deadly diseases, such as leprosy. Now, those diseases are rare, and, in developed countries, never seen, but people who do not conform – described by Curtis in the study as of “atypical appearance” – can still elicit revulsion, which is clearly terrible and dehumanising. “I think it’s important we understand that, because we can unconsciously stigmatise and avoid people [who have terrible spots, for instance] and think unconsciously that they might give us a disease. We need to become aware that it happens so we can fight it.” Our attitudes to what is considered disgusting, particularly morally, can and does change, though. “There is a cultural element to it,” says Firth-Godbehere. The first version of the Disgust Scale, devised by Rozin and others, asked people if they thought that homosexuality was immoral. “That was [later] removed. That is an example of perception changing. There are certain things that seem to be almost universal, such as [aversion to] faeces, but something I am interested in is eating insects. A quarter of the world do it, it’s a great source of protein, and we could learn [to eat them].” Some revolting ideas may be overcome; some are just too huge. It will never not be exceedingly disgusting to deposit human manure in the garden, especially if it also means stepping barefoot on a slug."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/05/jeremy-hunt-longest-serving-health-secretary-nhs-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T07:00:38Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt is the longest-serving health secretary?

How did that happen?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the five years and 275 days in which Jeremy Hunt has served as health secretary, the Conservative politician’s name has for some become cockney rhyming slang for a four-letter word beginning with c. Some don’t even bother to stick to that. A host of newsreaders – from the Today programme to Sky News – have managed to simply use Hunt’s crude alternative – before going on to apologise profusely for their slip of the tongue. Whether a Freudian slip or not, it’s safe to say that Hunt’s time in the post hasn’t been plain sailing. Under his reign, we have seen the first all-out strikes by medical staff in NHS history, lengthening waiting times for cancer care as well as accident and emergency, and most recently – to use Hunt’s own words – “probably the worst ever” NHS winter crisis. Yet despite all this, today Hunt has cause for celebration. Yesterday he became the longest serving health secretary in British history. Hunt overtakes Margaret Thatcher’s health minister, Norman Fowler, having sped past Aneurin Bevan– the man responsible for setting up the NHS – back in February. How has this unlikely figure managed to last so long in such a tricky brief? When Hunt was first appointed by David Cameron to take over from Andrew Lansley as health secretary in 2012, it was at a time of great difficulty. Lansley’s health reforms were unpopular and Cameron hoped that in Hunt – a man who had recently survived the Leveson inquiry as culture secretary – he had not only a competent minister but a PR man who could set out a clear vision for the NHS. Hunt found that vision in the Stafford hospital scandal of the late 2000s, which saw high mortality rates and poor care. After the scandal – and the report into the errors that had been made – Hunt made patient safety his focus. That might have seemed a non-controversial aim but the way in which he approached it soon angered lots of health workers. Many NHS staff felt his approach was to see them as the problem rather than the solution. As they were working on a tight budget under his government and many were going without a pay rise, relations soon soured. The situation was most fraught in 2015 in the midst of the junior doctor row. Hunt’s criticism of a “Monday to Friday” culture meant his hope for a seven-day NHS was seen more as a criticism of the current situation than an aspiration that everyone could get on board with. The hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy trended as NHS workers took umbrage at the insinuation they were workshy. There were points when it seemed the backlash might end Hunt’s career. Since then, however, a lot has changed. Theresa May is now prime minister, the Tories have lost their majority and Brexit dominates Whitehall. Somehow Hunt has managed to take on what look like problems and advance his own standing. After the disastrous snap election, May attempted to move Hunt to a different cabinet brief. However, the seemingly amiable politician simply said no and refused to move. Still in place, Hunt has been rebranded as a polite rebel. For all the anger from NHS staff towards him, he is now their best hope of increased funding. It is Hunt who has been leading calls for a new funding package for the NHS to mark its 70th anniversary – whether in private meetings or on Sunday morning political TV shows. But it looks as though his efforts are working. There are plans from No 10 to mark the NHS’s birthday in July with a settlement of 3% extra a year. What’s more, Hunt, too, appears to be attempting to heal old wounds. On his milestone yesterday, he appeared to strike a modest note – tweeting that NHS staff’s career trajectories are more noteworthy than his: “Thanks #NHS for being extraordinary in so many ways: much more impressive than a long serving Health Sec are the staff who have devoted 10, 15 or 20+ yrs to patients.” Thanks to Hunt’s influence and durability, attention is turning inevitably to whether he could be the next Tory leader. Not everyone is so keen. Aside from junior doctors, one cabinet minster tells me that if he were to go all the way and become prime minister, he would resemble a cross between Ted Heath and Harold Macmillan. Given that Heath’s single-mindedness was often seen as arrogance and Macmillan a leftie among some Tories, that’s no compliment. But bearing in mind Hunt’s less than auspicious start as health secretary and where he is now, it would be foolish to rule it out. • Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/15/football-quiz-who-am-i","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T10:23:11Z","webTitle":"Quiz: which World Cup player am I?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/football-quiz-who-am-i","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/15/football-quiz-who-am-i","fields":{"headline":"Quiz: which World Cup player am I?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/04/because-the-night-is-full-of-tv-detectives","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T16:59:42Z","webTitle":"Because the night is full of TV detectives | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/04/because-the-night-is-full-of-tv-detectives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/04/because-the-night-is-full-of-tv-detectives","fields":{"headline":"Because the night is full of TV detectives","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I’m afraid Edinburgh’s Lyceum theatre is wrong in believing its staging of Peter Handke’s play The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other was the first entirely using volunteers (Vast cast: Wordless play puts 450 characters on the stage, 29 May).

I remember our encounter vividly: the chaos of his office, with its filthy walls and toppling piles of notebooks; the unstoppable flow of his conversation; the wolfish greed with which he scoffed his eggs at breakfast. Above all, what has stayed with me was his almost total lack of interest in anything other than his reporting (by his own estimation, pretty brilliant); his contacts (so numerous that they rival the crowd at the Super Bowl); his editors (occasionally fantastic, but more often annoying and dumb). If Hersh had a hinterland, he was keeping it well hidden. Thanks to this, I was well prepared for Reporter, a memoir he only embarked upon because the book he was contracted to write for his publishers – a coruscating volume about Dick Cheney and all who sail in him – had hit the buffers. I guessed – correctly, as it turned out – that Reporter would be unrelenting, and focused entirely on his work; that it would come with no false modesty (or much modesty at all). All the same, even I was taken aback by the extent of his completism. Did he kidnap the book’s editor, tie him or her up until it was at the printers? It’s right that the big stories he has reported – My Lai, the domestic and foreign policy crimes of the Nixon era, the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US soldiers at Abu Ghraib – are recounted in chapters that run to many pages. But it seems a bit much when, determined not to leave anything out, he resorts literally to running lists of the other, smaller scandals on which he worked in between. Detail swamps his narrative, like creeper clambering over an ancient Mayan ruin, and for the reader, hacking through it is completely exhausting. It is not, however, dispiriting – or not all the time. Here is journalistic tenacity of a kind that, social media being what it is, is close to nonexistent today. The story of how Hersh, then a broke freelance, stumbled on the appalling events at My Lai is familiar by now: when a military lawyer told him that a soldier at Fort Benning in Georgia was facing a court martial for killing at least 109 Vietnamese civilians, Hersh simply rocked up at the base and went door to door until he found 26-year-old Lt William L Calley Jr (he later followed this up with an even more amazing interview, this time with Paul Meadlo, a farm kid from Indiana who had shot many of the civilians before losing a leg himself). Reading about it here, though, you’re reminded all over again of just how hard it was to get such a scoop published. The first report was rejected out of hand by many media organisations, among them the New York Times, and carefully rewritten – Hersh sold it through a tiny agency – by others seemingly made nervous and resentful by it. All the Vietnam movies in the world, moreover, cannot lessen the impact of My Lai; 50 years on, its horrors will not be varnished. Hersh’s excitement at the trail, and what it might mean both for his career and those of the warmongers, is tempered here by details that stay with you long after you put the book down: the sight of Calley, on the night the two men first met, vomiting blood, the result of a serious ulcer; an account, given to Hersh by a GI who’d shot himself in the foot in order to get out of My Lai, of a soldier who used his bayonet to toss a little boy in the air as if he were a “papier-mache piñata”. Hersh might be a monomaniac, but he deserves all the respect in the world for the work he did then. Determination, even obduracy sometimes, directed unyieldingly at politicians and other high-ups, is never not a good thing – something that, as he notes, his more craven colleagues in the US press would do well to remember. Judge a hack by his enemies (Kissinger was one of his), not his friends. Journalists must arm themselves with facts, not settle into tired punditry. “I think, I think…” For Hersh, these are the deadliest words in the language. Hersh’s parents were Jewish immigrants to Chicago, and when his father died in 1954, a month after his son had graduated from high school, it seemed likely that he might spend the rest of his days running the family cleaning business. He was saved by a college teacher and after graduating from university, joined a local news bureau as a copy boy. Apart from a brief period when he worked as press secretary to the Democratic senator Eugene McCarthy – surprise, surprise: they fell out – he has never not been a journalist. After winning his Pulitzer he joined first the New Yorker, then the New York Times; he would later return to the former under Tina Brown. Did he make editors like her nervous? Just a little. Brown once told him that the US secretary of state Colin Powell had informed her, over dinner, that Hersh was a liar. He heard the edge in her voice, but reminded her that such a comment was “a badge of honour” for someone who’d never been invited to a White House junket and never wanted to be. (The closeness of editors to politicians, whether of left or right, appals him.) He’s not always sure-footed. In the 90s, when he was working on a book about Kennedy, he was taken in by some documents that purported to show that the president was being blackmailed by Marilyn Monroe; the fact that he discovered this in time to remove all mention of them didn’t stop his critics from piling in. But you have to say that his instincts are mostly great. Hersh’s laws of journalism, which will, alas, never be taught on any media studies course, are something to live by. Sometimes, he writes, a story just “smells” right: this was certainly his feeling when an Iraqi general first told him that under the US occupation, women prisoners were being assaulted by guards to the point where, regarding themselves as dishonoured, they would write to their fathers and beg them to come and kill them. But still, it is important to hold your scepticism, if not your cynicism, close. Or as he puts it: “If your mother says she loves you, check it out.” • Reporter: A Memoir by Seymour M Hersh is published by Allen Lane (£20).

They gave me so many things, but professionally the biggest gift was just being able to watch the way they worked. Neither of them ever took themselves seriously, they were always aware that everything can go away very quickly – an excellent lesson to learn so early. I wish I’d had a bit more confidence when I was younger. I’ve got more confident as I’ve got older, but I still struggle to place value on what I do. I do it because I enjoy it, but I still have to work on that confidence often. The biggest achievement in my life of late is the ability to not care – to not judge myself so much. Not in a negative way, but in knowing I need to think like that to do things. I made my recording debut when I was 12, with my father, on his song, Lemon Incest. I remember those times fondly, because I was so fearless. I don’t think I really understood what I was doing. It took 30 minutes. I was swimming in a swimming pool before I did it, and I was desperate to go jump in the pool when I was done. And then when it came out and there was all the scandal, I was at boarding school, so I didn’t hear about it until a lot later. Art shouldn’t be censored. I feel that freedom of expression is the most precious thing, the thing we need right now more than anything. The world has become so violent, you need to be able to be free to analyse that. This is a very, very strange era. There’s so much rawness about religion… there’s something scary about the world right now. Being an actress hasn’t got much to do with my other job of music. I tend to work with directors I love and that I’d follow anywhere, and that’s because you often need to put yourself in someone else’s hands. But with music, you’re the one behind the project. I have to agree with the result. With film, I don’t. Sometimes I don’t even see the film. It took me a long time to come back to music because I couldn’t imagine doing it without my father, but I’m pleased I did. My sister wasn’t dead when I started making my album Rest [Charlotte’s sister, the fashion photographer Kate Barry, died on 11 December 2013], and when she died, I went to New York and changed everything. Grief became part of the project. I had words that I needed to say, and I needed to say them with anger. Grief manifests itself in many ways. I’m thinking about #MeToo and about whether extremity is needed for change, change that is very much needed. But I’ve also been thinking about the cost to people’s lives, whether lives should be destroyed with tweets and the like. Judgment has become too immediate. I feel that we need more distance – to go the old-fashioned way of trials when we’re judging people. Charlotte Gainsbourg appeared at Field Day Festival 2018.

The acclaimed American playwright and actor – who played Nancy McNally on The West Wing – glances at the rehearsal room floor, draws breath and begins the opening monologue of her one-woman show, Notes from the Field, assuming the voice of famed civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill. “It is impossible to talk about the criminal justice system, mass incarceration, without talking about education,” Smith says, capturing both the matter-of-fact exasperation and scholarly expertise you can imagine the NAACP Legal Defence Fund’s veteran president exuding. The monologue is one of 19 speeches that make up the 90-minute show – all verbatim extracts from interviews Smith conducted herself or speeches made in public, which explore the uniquely American phenomenon of the school-to-prison pipeline. The play is her first appearance in London for more than 25 years, and won critical acclaim when it was performed off-Broadway in 2016, including from President Barack Obama. America incarcerates almost a quarter of the global prison population, with by far the highest rate of imprisonment in the world. The prison-industrial complex began during Nixon’s war on drugs and has continued to proliferate ever since, giving rise to a system that disproportionately punishes people of colour. Feeding into this dysfunction is a public school system, increasingly punitive and over-policed, that feeds the machine with young adults – disproportionately black and brown – abandoned by formal education. Smith’s work seeks to engage this dark trend with a group of characters carefully chosen from more than 250 interviews the playwright conducted around America over a period of roughly three years. It is the latest in her On the Road series, encompassing more than a dozen plays using verbatim interviews as the foundation for drama. She flits between young people caught at the harsh end, and teachers, judges, activists and politicians who see the problem from different personal and historical vantages. The performance combines these perspectives with live musical accompaniment and video clips documenting the contemporary events her subjects are grappling with. It is an extraordinary accomplishment, which provides a rich exploration of the subject through deeply personal narratives. But how does she think audiences in London will engage with such a raw, perhaps alien, exposé of contemporary America, when the play comes to the Royal Court this month? Her response, like the show, is direct and honest. “Maybe it’s a dangerous thing to say, I haven’t been all that excited about going back to London,” she says, explaining that the last time she took a play to the UK – her 1992 work Fires in the Mirror that documented the Crown Heights race riots in Brooklyn – “I just didn’t feel they [the British audience] were there with me.” “I’m honoured to be invited, but I haven’t pursued London since that time as a place to go with my work, because I’m very mission-driven,” she says. “I’ve thought maybe I’m just too American. I’m very aware of my mission in America, my place in America.” She recognises, of course, that the UK has long faced its own entrenched prejudice within the criminal justice system, albeit on a scale that is dwarfed by the juggernaut of American inequality. And she suggests a meaningful run in London, at a theatre located in one of the most affluent boroughs in the city, is ultimately about raising awareness. “I would say that success in London would be if anyone’s concerned, and concerned enough to see how that plays out in England. Racism is not unique to the United States.” There is a pang of sadness watching Notes from the Field, recorded as a live action movie for HBO, in the era of the Trump presidency. The play was researched throughout the Obama years and, although its subject matter touches on some of the darkest moments in his presidency – from the racist massacre of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, to the riots in Baltimore – it is a reminder that the nation’s first black president had actively engaged with the need for sweeping reform of America’s broken criminal justice system. Trump, who branded himself the “law and order candidate”, has already taken significant measures to roll back any of the progress made by the previous administration and appointed former Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, who has had to deny allegations of racism, to be his attorney general. Smith says the play has not been significantly altered since it was first performed in the Obama years. “I’ve always had a sense of purpose with this project. So, I don’t think that’s changed because Trump is president. He’s not helping the plight of poor kids, and he’s not helping the disparity between rich and poor, and he’s not helping our situation with regard to what punishment has become in this country at all. But the problems were here before Trump.” And yet, she says, certain points within the work now carry a different weight. A closing moment sees the actor assume the role of congressman John Lewis, the civil rights veteran brutally beaten by police officers during civil disobedience in Selma, reflecting on a moment of reconciliation with one of the officers there that day in 1965. “Hold on. Never give up. Never give in. Never lose faith. Keep the faith,” she says as Lewis. “When I say [that] … I’m speaking exactly to this moment,” she tells me. The intensity of the performance leads her to what she describes as a “monkish existence” during runs. She avoids loud places, won’t kiss or hug anyone after shows, and mostly heads straight home to bed – all in a bid to keep free of germs, preserve the quality of her voice, and sit with the weight of the stories she is telling. Smith, who received a George Polk award – one of America’s highest journalism honours – for her body of work last year, is nonetheless uncomfortable with the label of a journalist. “You’re supposed to be objective,” she says to me, forthrightly bashing her fists on the desk we’re sitting at. “So you can’t call yourself an art form, even if it’s beautiful and it has that aesthetic value. But I can say that I’m looking for metaphors to reveal the truth. I don’t have to say I’ve found the truth. You do.” She accepts though that her research methods bear a similarity to the journalistic process itself: travelling long distances, booking in interviews as the trip unfolds and speaking to people about the most desperate, difficult moments in their lives. I tell her that the play had a profound effect on me in a way that theatre rarely does. Many of the events included were stories I covered on the ground. Some of the characters in her work are people I have interviewed, too, and it brought up feelings of residual trauma associated with covering the endless cycle of violence and brutality in American society. As a reporter there is a tendency, as I have experienced, to lose the ability to empathise with your subjects, and I wonder if it’s something she feels, too? “The compassion fatigue is something very, very serious,” she says. “In my case, I respect what I’m carrying. I know it’s not light. But I’ve been training to carry it for my whole life. You know, it’s rough.” Notes from the Field is at the Royal Court, London, 13-23 June, as part of London international festival of theatre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/05/alex-strangelove-review-netflix-gay-teen-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T09:00:40Z","webTitle":"Alex Strangelove review – Netflix's gay teen sex comedy plays it too straight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/05/alex-strangelove-review-netflix-gay-teen-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/05/alex-strangelove-review-netflix-gay-teen-comedy","fields":{"headline":"Alex Strangelove review – Netflix's gay teen sex comedy plays it too straight","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"While bemoaning the imperfect state of her love life, a character in Alex Strangelove unfavorably compares her personal drama to that of “this old movie my mom made me watch”. Briefly, you wonder what idealised golden age romance has left her heartsore and starry-eyed: Casablanca? Breakfast at Tiffany’s? Of course not: she means Sixteen Candles, John Hughes’ now 34-year-old high school love triangle, of which this well-meaning Netflix original is quite plainly a gawky adolescent descendant. If that makes you feel old, well, Craig Johnson’s perky tale of a virginal teenage boy working out sex, sexuality and the whole damn thing isn’t made for you. Whether kids will think it’s for them is another question – one to which, as the film joins Netflix’s unmeasured content mill, we’ll never get a firm answer. Like Love, Simon, the recent multiplex charmer that brought gay desire to the foreground of the teen mall movie, Alex Strangelove attempts a post-millennial shake-up of identity politics in the genre that Hughes built. Unlike Love, Simon, the carnal peak of which was a soft kiss atop a ferris wheel, Johnson’s film has slightly hornier matters on its mind. Which isn’t to say there’s anything rude or remote off-colour about Alex Strangelove – nor anything so eccentric or madcap as to justify its Kubrickian title reference. It’s set in a bright, frictionless, diverse-but-not-too-diverse pocket of suburbia where children are largely, acceptingly versed in the LGBTQI alphabet – a world that feels contemporary, certainly, but not quite authentic. Johnson, who negotiated more adult concerns to sharper effect in the sibling comedy The Skeleton Twins, puts such tidy quips and such glib observations in the mouths of his teens that they occasionally sound more like middle-aged comics than confused, hormone-raddled adolescents. “Isn’t anyone just plain straight any more?” sighs one boy after noting the plethora of sexual preferences and identities within the student body. Does anyone younger than Michael McIntyre talk like this? In any event, upon meeting our hero Alex Truelove (Danny Doheny), viewers will suss out well before he does that he’s not just plain straight at all. A smart, pretty, clean-scrubbed 16-year-old – the kind who passes for a geek only in a Hollywood-cast classroom – who’s been skittishly skirting the issue of sex with his girlfriend Claire (the wonderful Madeline Weinstein), a mature, level-headed type who acts far more like his BFF than his lover, earns him the mockery of his dorky pals, though they can scarcely chat up a girl between them. Or a boy, for that matter, which Alex inadvertently does quite effectively at a house party, where he hits it off with Elliot (Antonio Marziale), a gay, Art Garfunkel-haired college freshman who goes to indie gigs in Brooklyn and plays Dusty Springfield in his car. Hanging out with Elliot, Alex feels stirrings he’s never felt with Claire, even as he sets his mind on having sex with her with a mixture of passionless determination and abject terror. We know where all this is going, of course, but Alex doesn’t. That’s both the truth and the charm of Johnson’s script which, amid its various too-cute contrivances, is written with a tender, empathetic understanding of how hard it can be to see yourself at a certain malleable age; no matter how much the social environment around alternative sexuality shifts and clears, determining your own identity is never as easy as checking a box. That said, a strange streak of old-school conservatism sneaks in when the physicality of gay romance is tackled. Heterosexual sex may be shown and discussed here in ribald terms, but two boys doing anything more than locking lips on screen – fully clothed, of course – is off the table. Alex Strangelove is most credible and affecting when the kids at its centre speak out, act out and make out with the insecurity and inconsistency of, well, kids. There’s a depiction here of fumbling, failed intercourse so aching and awkward that Ian McEwan could stand to take notes; key breakups and personal confessions are articulated and performed with authentic, nerve-spiked intimacy. Its best, most bruised passages revolve not around Alex and Elliot, who perhaps rather aptly comes off as a hipster mirage of gay liberation – the man Alex wants to be, maybe, more than he wants to fuck. Rather, it’s Claire, beautifully played by Weinstein with vulnerability and peppery insight, who holds the film’s heart, ensuring that the pain of being undesired doesn’t go unfelt against Alex’s keen, tumbling rush of self-discovery. (Weinstein – no relation to Harvey, incidentally – also impressed with a comparable character arc in Eliza Hittman’s far rawer, bleaker coming-out study Beach Rats, which may as well be set in a different dimension from this film; here’s hoping we see her in more generously rewarded parts soon.) Between these moments of candour and clarity, however, Johnson appears to become overly preoccupied with making a Teen Movie™, with all the cuddly Disney Channel hijinks, mild gross-out gags and marshmallow moralising that entails. Alex Strangelove feels furthest from its intended audience when its characters are licking hallucinogenic frogs, vomiting gummy worms and spouting the hackneyed animal kingdom analogies that the script unwisely makes its framing device. Sometimes – most of the time, actually – teenagers do nothing zanier than sit, talk, drink and, if they’re lucky, get naked. When Alex Strangelove simply cops to that, it earns its John Hughes stripes. Alex Strangelove is available on Netflix from 8 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/05/young-people-love-country-patriotism-millennials","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Why would young people love a country that seems not to love them? | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/05/young-people-love-country-patriotism-millennials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/05/young-people-love-country-patriotism-millennials","fields":{"headline":"Why would young people love a country that seems not to love them?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Despite growing concerns over wage stagnation and insecure work, far fewer young people are members of unions,” were the journalist Kamal Ahmed’s actual words on the Today programme, describing the wage gap between the over-30s and the young. Frances O’Grady, the TUC leader, is heroically patient in trying to keep the commentariat on track: this is no crazy paradox, that at the very moment people need unions the most, they stop joining them. It is precisely because the young are ghettoed in low-wage sectors where unions aren’t recognised; it is because their work is insecure that they have no leverage; it is because their wages are stagnant that they can’t build up the savings cushion you’d need, if you wanted to make trouble on a zero-hours contract. The tendency to look at all hardship through the wrong end of the telescope – why do people on low wages eat so badly? – is not new, but in analysing the conditions of the younger millennial, the debate has progressed from having its arse on backwards to being deliberately, comprehensively wrong. Young people can’t organise in the workplace because they’re too narcissistic, goes the argument. They can’t afford houses because they eat too many avocados. They don’t get paid for the first five years of their careers because they can’t tie their own shoelaces. They don’t need living rooms because they’re always out eating £15 burgers. They’re anxious because they’re snowflakes. They don’t understand hard work, and the fact that they do so well at A-level and beyond is due to grade inflation, which is somehow also their fault. They’re not political any more, until they are, whereupon they’re in cloud-cuckoo land. Structural pressures back up to make the lives of the under-30s economically unviable. Housing is impossible because of student debt, inability to save for a deposit, stagnant and falling wages, the investment value of land peeling away from use value and the role of housing debt in the wider economy. The lending of the 90s and 00s drove prices up faster than wages; even if you could still get the famous “underwater mortgage” that did for Northern Rock (when you could borrow 105% of the asking price), you still – on an average income for a 30-year-old – wouldn’t be able to afford a third of an average home. The “gig economy” is a euphemism for chronic precariousness. Internships are no more than the repudiation of the precept of a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay, which is how we all clawed our way out of serfdom in the first place. Apprenticeships are code for exploitation. A Kafka-esque logic has emerged where you have no value to an employer until you’re experienced, yet all the cost of gaining experience has to be generated by your worthless labours. The condition of youth is like a claw game in an arcade: if you do everything right, work hard, concentrate, make wise choices, save for your pension, get your head down at university, consider your options, you should, in principle, be able to pick up the plushy with the giant claw. Except you can’t, because it’s physically impossible. In real life, of course, there is no shortage of creative, collective action among the young. Housing activism ranges from Generation Rent to Acorn, the country’s first community union. The direct-action groups Focus E15 and New Era 4 All did not originate with the middle-aged. The idea of the pop-up union – people uniting to support each other across sectors, with legal rather than wildcat strike action, on a time-limited basis – originated on a university campus. Jeremy Corbyn’s overwhelming support among 18- to 24-year-olds is written off as naivety by those whom it pleases to believe that anything not resembling the status quo is unrealistic. The smarter right feels the chill of change on simple demographics, since the direction of travel is more likely to be set by those who are still alive a decade hence. But they’re missing the bigger ruction, that for all the differences of opportunity and wealth between the young – and those still exist – no one under 30 is served by an economy that loads them with debt, locks them out of property and then doesn’t reward them with the dignity of decent wages at work. As the sociologist Phil Burton-Cartledge pointed out, “the often noted ‘age effect’ is actually a cohort class effect”. The TUC is right: young people should join a union; workplaces should recognise collective bargaining; if this is a class cohort, nobody could tell you more about mobilising as a class bloc than a trade union. But any explanation for young people’s failure to do so that relies on personal deficiencies will turn out to be catastrophically complacent. Also this week, the young were revealed to be less proud of their Englishness than ever before, with one in 10 saying they were actively embarrassed. There is nothing more corrosive to patriotism, of course, than hearing your situation blithely, constantly misrepresented by your countrymen. A lack of national pride may feel like the least of our problems, set against the damage done when there’s a surfeit of it. Yet it speaks not of cynicism, but of a failure of reciprocity. It’s hard to love a country that shows no sign of loving you. • Zoe Williams is a regular Guardian contributor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/20/puzzle-review-jigsaw-kelly-macdonald-irrfan-khan-edinburgh-film-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"Puzzle review – Kelly Macdonald sees the big picture in jigsaw indie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/20/puzzle-review-jigsaw-kelly-macdonald-irrfan-khan-edinburgh-film-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/20/puzzle-review-jigsaw-kelly-macdonald-irrfan-khan-edinburgh-film-festival","fields":{"headline":"Puzzle review – Kelly Macdonald sees the big picture in jigsaw indie","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Compare how vital Kelly Macdonald was to 1996’s Trainspotting with her cursory presence in 2017’s boysy sequel, and you’ll have some sense of how the British film industry has underestimated her. Macdonald has always been a supremely sympathetic performer, but her mousy air may have been seen as a big-screen limitation. She scuttled round in subservient roles (Gosford Park, Nanny McPhee), before escaping pantry duty via HBO’s Boardwalk Empire: a wife part, yes, but one that proved steelier than first imagined over that five-season run. TV arcs bend towards their own form of justice. Puzzle, the offbeat US indie opening this year’s Edinburgh film festival, finds Macdonald tending house yet again – though here it’s an acknowledgement of wasted potential, a corner from which her character Agnes needs to be sprung. We join her doing the day shift in her commuter-belt New York home, odd woman out in a conservative bolthole lorded over by mechanic husband Louie (David Denman) and two boisterous college-age sons. Escape comes, unexpectedly, in the form of a jigsaw puzzle – a birthday present that gives Agnes respite from chores. Yet the gift also opens this meek den-mother’s eyes to her great, long-honed facility for putting everything in its rightful place. The out-of-the-box story derives from The Puzzle, a 2009 Argentinian drama written and directed by Lucrecia Martel associate Natalia Smirnoff. What the new version’s director Marc Turtletaub and screenwriters Oren Moverman and Polly Mann presumably responded to was the gradual expansion of one woman’s horizons. (Agnes’s first jigsaw forms a map of the world.) Puzzling allows our heroine welcome downtime, but also draws her outside in pursuit of bigger challenges. Shuttling into Manhattan, she’s steered towards competitive puzzling by cosmopolitan émigré Robert (a nicely understated Irrfan Khan), a spiritual guru who reformulates into something more. What follows never entirely assumes those now-familiar, Sundance-approved indie contours. Yes, it’s a semi-quirky drama that repeatedly returns to the sight of fully grown individuals using jigsaw puzzles as metaphors for the way we live our lives. (“It’s a way to control the chaos,” insists Robert.) Yet there’s even odder activity going on within these frames: they haven’t had the haphazardness of lived experience sanded off them to better fit a screenwriting template. Abundant religious symbolism sometimes gives Puzzle the look of a consoling matinee remake of Darren Aronofsky’s Pi, one in which the protagonist finds, rather than loses, herself in patterns and shapes. The cast lend this quest emotional weight and complexity. There are moments that Macdonald nails out of decades-long habit: Agnes’s quiet pride at completing a 1,000-piecer, say, or her painful modesty upon meeting Robert’s gaze. What’s new is that she also gets to assert herself: Agnes will eventually hit Louie with a pricelessly sarcastic: “I’ll get your dinner now, dear.” Her pairing with the eternally lived-in Khan is itself an assertion of sorts – no one would have thought of putting these two together – and one complicated by Denman’s bluffly sympathetic hubby, though it’s perhaps inevitable the latter should start sweeping completed puzzles on to dining-room floors. Puzzle remains as unfashionably analogue a diversion as jigsaws themselves might be in the computer game era – touchingly committed to watching flawed, lopsided humanoids attempting to tesselate – and it sometimes seems a little neat about recording this process. A wilder project might have gone all-in on the competitive puzzling, where Turtletaub skirts the scene’s fringes, more compelled by character than sensation. Yet there is modest craft and genuine heart here, not to mention an eye-catching centrepiece: an actor growing more certain of herself, and more capable than ever of holding an entire picture together – even one as unusual, and sometimes as unlikely, as this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2018/jun/05/five-myths-about-the-refugee-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"Five myths about the refugee crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/05/five-myths-about-the-refugee-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jun/05/five-myths-about-the-refugee-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Five myths about the refugee crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Myth 1: The crisis is over The refugee crisis that dominated the news in 2015 and 2016 consisted primarily of a sharp rise in the number of people coming to Europe to claim asylum. Arrivals have now dropped, and governments have cracked down on the movement of undocumented migrants within the EU; many thousands are stuck in reception centres or camps in southern Europe, while others try to make new lives in the places they have settled. But to see the crisis as an event that began in 2015 and ended the following year is a mistake, because it obscures the fact that the underlying causes have not changed. To see it in those terms only gives the impression of a hitherto unsullied Europe, visited by hordes of foreigners it has little to do with. This is misleading. The disaster of recent years has as much to do with immigration policies drawn up in European capitals as it does with events outside the continent, and the crisis also consists of overreaction and panic, fuelled by a series of misconceptions about who the migrants are, why they come, and what it means for Europe. The European Union has perhaps the world’s most complex system to deter unwanted migrants. Since the 1990s, as borders have come down within Europe, giving most EU citizens free movement and passport-free travel, its external frontier has become increasingly militarised. Amnesty International estimates that, between 2007-2013, before the crisis, the EU spent almost €2bn on fences, surveillance systems and patrols on land or at sea. In theory, refugees – who have the right to cross borders in search of asylum under international law – should be exempt from these controls. But in reality, the EU has tried to prevent asylum seekers from reaching its territory wherever possible: by closing down legal routes, such as the ability to claim asylum at overseas embassies; by introducing penalties for transport companies that allow people to travel into the EU without the correct documents; and by signing treaties with its neighbours so they control migration on the EU’s behalf. And within the EU, an agreement called the Dublin regulation forces asylum seekers to apply in whatever country they reach first. After the Arab uprisings of 2011, the number of people coming to Europe to seek asylum – via Turkey, or across the central Mediterranean from north Africa – began to rise. But Europe continued to make security its priority, rather than the protection of vulnerable people. In the same period as it spent €2bn euros on border security, the EU spent only an estimated €700m on reception conditions for refugees. Almost 3 million people claimed asylum in the EU in 2015 and 2016 – still only a small fraction of the EU’s total population of 508 million – but the manner of their arrival was chaotic; thousands died in the attempt. Most of the migrants who arrived tried to continue their journeys to north-west Europe, and enforcement of the Dublin regulation temporarily collapsed. Border defences often produce or exacerbate the very problems they purport to solve, by forcing irregular migrants to take more dangerous routes, often with increasing reliance on people smugglers, which in turn encourages states to crack down even harder. In November 2017, a coalition of human rights groups published a list of 33,293 people who had died since 1993 as a result of “militarisation, asylum laws, detention policies and deportations” in Europe. But Europe has continued to try and push the thousands of uninvited migrants who try to reach European shores further and further away from the continent. A deal with Turkey, launched in March 2016, has reduced the movement of Syrians towards Europe, even though over 12 million Syrians remain displaced by the war – 5 million of these outside their country – and many are still in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. Even as Afghanistan becomes more dangerous, European governments persist in their attempts to deport many Afghans to Kabul. And to stem unwanted migration from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe has tried to strike deals to stop the people-trafficking routes that run across the desert and through north Africa. Italy has cracked down on NGO sea rescues and paid off militias in Libya, even as evidence of torture and abuse in Libyan detention centres trickles out; the EU has explored deals with Sudan’s repressive dictatorship; in Niger, one of the world’s poorest countries, European money, troops and diplomats have flooded the desert city of Agadez, to try to put a stop to the smuggling trade. Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable individuals will be directly affected by these new policies. We are often encouraged to think about “solutions” to the crisis, but there is no neat end to it. For as long as wars continue – wars that are sometimes started or joined by European states, or fuelled by their arms sales – people will continue to flee them. And others will continue to try to migrate even when states don’t want them to. But our governments’ efforts to stem unwanted migration can end up creating or exacerbating the very problems they purport to solve. Decisions to ramp up immigration control taken at moments of crisis, or in response to media pressure, can have profound and long-lasting effects – from the treatment of Windrush citizens in the UK to the thousands of refugees languishing in filthy camps on Greece’s Aegean islands. The crisis is not only the movement of refugees, but the border systems designed to keep them out – and it is still happening. Myth 2: We can neatly separate ‘refugees’ from ‘economic migrants’ Most of us are economic migrants – even if within our own countries – but the term has taken on a new and pejorative meaning since the refugee crisis. It is often deployed in much the same way that “bogus asylum seeker” was in the past by the British tabloid press – to suggest that people are trying to play the system, that their presence is the cause of problems at the border, and that if we could only filter them out, order would be restored. In fact, the history of migration is a history of controls on the movement of all but a wealthy elite. In the past, states sought to restrict the movement of their own populations, through slavery or serfdom, or poor laws and vagrancy acts; today the right to move freely within one’s own territory is enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Most of us take this right for granted, even though it is relatively recent. Now, instead, the movement of people across international borders is tightly controlled and regulated. As a proportion of the world population, the total number of international migrants – of any kind – has stayed relatively steady: roughly 3% since 1960, according to the sociologist Hein de Haas. This might seem surprising in an age where goods, communication and certain kinds of people can move with greater ease than ever before, but globalisation is a highly unequal process. Although the proportion of migrants has not grown significantly, the origin and direction of migration has changed: research by De Haas and Mathias Czaika suggests that people are leaving a much wider range of countries than ever before, and they are heading to a much narrower range of destinations than ever before. They are going to the places where power and wealth have become concentrated. Europe, and north-west Europe in particular, is one of those places. It is by no means the only destination – most African migration, for instance, occurs within Africa. And most migration to Europe takes place legally: an estimated 90% of migrants who enter Europe do so with permission. But wealthier countries are making increasingly severe efforts to keep out the uninvited: in 1990, according to research by the geographer Reece Jones, 15 countries had walls or fences on their border; by the beginning of 2016, that number had risen to almost 70. International law aims to protect refugees while allowing states to retain control of their borders – but the definition of “refugee” status is political, and subject to a constant struggle over who is deserving and who is not. The term has both a legal meaning, in that it describes a person who is eligible for asylum under international law, and a colloquial meaning, in that it describes a person who has fled their home. Under the 1951 refugee convention, a refugee is defined as someone who has left their country due to “a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion”. At first, the convention only applied to Europeans, and did not cover everyone who fled a war zone; this kind of protection was only created after pressure from newly independent African states in the 1960s and Latin American states in the 1980s. People forced from their homes by economic disaster or catastrophic climate change have never been included. Even today, the convention leaves power mainly in the hands of nation states. It does not oblige its signatories to give anybody asylum, merely to hear their case and not push them back to a country where they might be in danger. In the 21st century, a border is not just a line on a map; it is a system for filtering people that stretches from the edges of a territory into its heart, affecting those who are already in the country – as we have learned since Theresa May’s “hostile environment” has come to light. Asylum seekers are subject to particularly complex and often violent filtering. Once they cross Europe’s frontiers, their movement is restricted: they are locked up or segregated in accommodation far from city centres. Their right to work or to access social security is denied or severely limited. While their claims are being assessed, often by a process that is opaque, hostile and inconsistent, they live with the threat that the freedoms they do have may be curtailed at any moment. The system tries to place them into categories – refugee or economic migrant, legal or illegal, deserving or undeserving – that do not always fit the reality of their lives. And if the system breaks down, people are cast into a legal and moral grey zone that lasts for many months or even years. As Caesar, a young man from Mali who I met while reporting in Sicily, put it to me: “It’s not as if one person has ‘refugee’ printed on his forehead and another has ‘economic migrant’.” Myth 3: Telling ‘human stories’ is enough to change people’s minds Empathy matters, but it always has limits, and it should not be a precondition for people to access their rights. Caesar arrived in Sicily in late 2014, rescued from a drifting smuggler boat in the Mediterranean by the Italian navy. When he arrived, Sicily had the attention of the world’s media: journalists wanted to know the stories of people like Caesar: where they had come from, what kind of journeys they had taken, what the worst things they had experienced were. But by the following summer, attention had drifted elsewhere. In late August 2015, as unprecedented numbers of refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East made their long walk through the Balkans, I was visiting Caesar at his home in Sicily. As we watched TV, which was showing looped footage of people clamouring to board trains to Germany at Budapest’s Keleti station, Caesar gestured towards the screen. “You see? The cameras don’t come here any more because it’s only blacks arriving in Sicily now.” He felt very strongly that people like him had been abandoned – by the media, and by a system that was taking years to process his asylum claim. When there is a major disaster, the understandable response of journalists is to rush in and find the most urgent stories as quickly as possible. It serves a necessary purpose: to tell people what the problem is, who is affected and what help is needed. Aid agencies and NGOs often follow a similar logic in their public communications. The idea is that vivid “human stories” that focus on the experiences of vulnerable individuals – very often children – will elicit sympathy from an audience whose attention is fleeting. But these stories also have the potential to alienate. If I tell you that Caesar spent 18 months being handed from one trafficking gang to another in Algeria and Libya, during which time he was tortured and put to work as a slave, does that help you understand who he is and why he has made the choices he has – particularly if that is all you know about his life? And what if hundreds of people all have similar stories? At some point, we feel overwhelmed and start to switch off. Some of us may even start to feel hostile: why are we constantly being told to feel sorry for these strangers? What is more, media coverage that jumps from one flashpoint of a crisis to another can neglect to examine underlying causes – Europe’s complex border system, for instance. And a sense of panic can inadvertently be encouraged by well-meaning attempts to produce dramatic statistics and soundbites. The idea of a “global refugee crisis” may provoke sympathy among some, but for others it may increase the sense that we are, in the words of Ukip’s leave campaign, at “breaking point”. The UN’s refugee agency, the UNHCR, says there are more people displaced by conflict in the world today than at any point since the second world war. This is true: an estimated 66 million people are currently displaced, either within their home countries or abroad. But 86% of these remain in the developing world, not in wealthy regions such as Europe. And despite recent conflicts, according to De Haas, refugees account for around 0.3% of the world’s population; a small and relatively stable proportion. The problem is one of resources and policy, not overwhelming numbers. If we want to understand why some people will keep moving despite the obstacles put in their way, then we need to see the whole person, rather than only the worst aspects of their situation or their most traumatic experiences. I have met a number of people who had journeys similar to Caesar’s, and each one is trying in very different ways to retain control of their lives and make decisions about the future. Caesar told me he just wants to find a dull job and “forget about the past”. By contrast, Fatima, a woman from Nigeria who also ended up in Sicily, made “a bargain with God” when she stepped on to an inflatable boat on the Libyan coast, and wants to devote the rest of her life to raising the alarm about trafficked women. Azad fled Syria because although he was sympathetic to the uprising against Bashar al-Assad, and proud of his Kurdish identity, he simply didn’t want to kill people. It is also important to recognise that the stories we consume are, for the most part, commodities produced by profit-making companies. Like other commodities, their production, value and demand are driven by market forces. This can harm those at the centre of the stories, distort our understanding of a crisis and even contribute to a sense of panic – which, in turn, provokes panicked responses from the authorities. Myth 4: The crisis is a threat to European values In recent years, “European values” have been invoked both in support of refugees and migrants and to attack them. On the one hand, demagogues such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán have positioned themselves as defenders of a Christian European civilisation, enacting anti-migrant policies to protect Europe from being overrun by Muslim hordes. On the other, humanitarians have frequently appealed to a vision of Europe like the one set out by José Manuel Barroso, president of the European commission in 2012, when the EU was awarded the Nobel peace prize. “As a community of nations that has overcome war and fought totalitarianism,” Barroso said in his acceptance speech, “we will always stand by those who are in pursuit of peace and human dignity.” Both visions are wrong. The first tries to erase the fact that Europe is a diverse continent, in which Christian, Muslim, Jewish and secular traditions have been present for centuries. Orbán’s vision also has a liberal companion, especially popular in western Europe, which holds that Muslim immigrants present a threat to “European” traditions of tolerance, freedom and democracy: this, too, ignores the fact that where these principles do exist they have been fought for and won, usually against the violent resistance of European elites. It is no small irony, either, that many of the refugees who arrive on European shores today have been engaged in similar struggles for rights and equality in their home countries. The second vision presents Europe as a beacon of hope to the rest of the world. Europe certainly has great power to affect the world for better or worse, and pressing our politicians to live up to such an aspiration is worthwhile. But the aspiration will remain unfulfilled if we ignore the fact that while the nations of Europe have overcome war and fought totalitarianism, many of these same nations became rich and powerful by conquering and administering huge empires, which were partially justified by the idea of European racial supremacy. And European unity, in its founding documents, was conceived of as a way of maintaining imperial power, as well as preventing future conflict in Europe. Rather than seeing European racism as a thing of the past, the recognition of its persistence is essential if we are to understand the refugee crisis and some of the responses to it. Thousands of people from former European colonies, whose grandparents were treated as less than human by their European rulers, have drowned in the Mediterranean in the past two decades, yet this only became a “crisis” when the scale of the disaster was impossible for Europeans to ignore. In 2015, the UN’s special rapporteur on migration proposed two responses that would have done much to alleviate the crisis: mass international resettlement of refugees from Syria, and a temporary work visa scheme so that economic migrants could come and go, without getting trapped in the deadly clandestine routes. The reason this hasn’t happened is because European governments simply don’t want to do it. There are domestic political pressures within Europe, and a wider crisis of the international system through which conflicts and disagreements between states are supposed to be resolved. Even now, a hierarchy of suffering pervades much of the debate, in which people’s struggles are ignored or dismissed depending on their background, with little discussion of how Europe might have contributed to the situation of the countries the migrants leave behind – either historically, or through the military and economic policies of current governments. And when local conflicts involving newly arrived refugees break out in European countries, many commentators jump seamlessly from an incident that needs a considered response, to declaration of an existential threat to Europe from its Muslim minority. At its extreme end, this is genocidal logic, of a kind Europe has known in its past. We do not have to accept this. A more honest conversation about the crisis would involve a reckoning with our own past – and a good starting point would be to recognise that for many of the migrants making perilous journeys to Europe today, Europe is already a part of their lives. “We remember the past, we remember slavery; they started the world wars and we fought for them,” I was once told by a group of men from west Africa marooned in a southern Italian reception centre. This isn’t about apportioning blame or guilt. It is about recognising that the world is not easily divided into “European” and “non-European”. This is as true for Britain as it is for the rest of Europe, even if Britain leaves the political union. “I’m always surprised when people ask, ‘Why are refugees coming to the UK?’” said Zainab, who fled Islamic State in Iraq and brought her three young children to Britain via Calais, hidden in a series of lorries. “I would like to answer back: ‘Hasn’t Iraq been occupied by Britain and America?’ I want people to see the suffering that the populations from these places have gone through. I really wish for people to see the connection.” Myth 5: History is repeating and there’s nothing we can do about it The Holocaust is never far from the surface of European consciences. And its presence has been felt in a range of responses to the refugee crisis – from grand political statements about Europe’s duty to act, to the invocation of the Kindertransport in Britain’s debate over child refugees, to stories about elderly Jewish Europeans helping today’s displaced migrants cross borders. But it can lead us to a Schindler’s List interpretation of history – the one dramatic moment of rescue that either averts disaster, or absolves us of a greater crime. An awareness of this history matters, and can motivate us to act, but there are considerable differences from the past. Our system of refugee protection was set up primarily to deal with the huge population upheavals in Europe that were caused by the two world wars. Now largely in the past, these upheavals are generally seen as having provided a moral lesson – one of several ways in which Europe declared: “Never again”. But although Europe’s crisis of displacement had a beginning and an end, for much of the world, displacement is persistent, its causes apparently more complicated, the people at the centre of it afforded less significance. Often, they are given no story at all, reduced to a shadow that occasionally flits across European vision. But it is vital that we pay attention, not just for humanitarian reasons but because displacement points to a dangerous weakness in liberal democratic societies. Although we have come to regard certain rights as fundamental and universal, these are often only guaranteed through membership of a nation-state. In her 1951 book The Origins of Totalitarianism, the political theorist Hannah Arendt argued that the inability of states to guarantee rights to displaced people in Europe between the world wars helped create the conditions for dictatorship. Statelessness reduced people to the condition of outlaws: they had to break laws in order to live and they were subject to jail sentences without ever committing a crime. Being a refugee means not doing what you are told – if you did, you would probably have stayed at home to be killed. And you continue bending the rules, telling untruths, concealing yourself, even after you have left immediate danger, because that is the way you negotiate a hostile system. But the presence of millions of displaced people also became a powerful tool for those regimes that wanted to undermine the idea of universal human rights. “Look,” they could say, “there’s no such thing; you only get rights by being part of the nation”. Instead of resolving this problem, governments cracked down on unwanted migrants, giving police forces extensive powers that were eventually also wielded over their own citizens. This happened in the western European democracies, argued Arendt, and not just in the totalitarian states. This has a disturbing parallel with the new powers and security infrastructure – from Britain’s “hostile environment” and laws criminalising European citizens who help migrants to the “temporary-stay facilities” that Italy’s new, far-right interior minister has proposed as part of a plan to increase deportations – that European governments are creating. Far from being the barbarians they are often portrayed as – a mass of “illegals” threatening European security and identity – rightless people appear “as the first signs of a possible regression from civilisation”, Arendt warned. But Arendt points out a threat, not something inevitable – and importantly, governments respond to pressure from the electorate. In the autumn of 2015, for instance, public outcry over the photograph of a drowned toddler, Alan Kurdi, that circulated in international media pressured the British government into expanding a scheme to resettle Syrian refugees. We must be alert to the ways in which some politicians try to convince people to give up rights and protections that exist for the benefit of everyone. Any authority figure who says: “We should look after our own before we look after refugees,” probably isn’t interested in doing either. And we should recognise the importance of collective action. There will not be “solutions” to this crisis, in the sense of one or more policy decisions that will make refugees vanish. Wars produce refugees. People will continue to move to improve their quality of life – not only because of extreme poverty, but because they are connected to global culture and global networks of communication. Climate change has the potential to create far greater displacement than we have seen in recent years; as with refugees from war, it is likely to be poorer countries who feel the greatest impact. We cannot control whether these things happen; what matters will be how we respond, and whether we repeat the errors of this crisis. You do not have to let your thinking be limited by the categories that currently exist. It is possible to defend the protections that the current system of refugee law offers, while recognising their limits. Politicians may try to draw a distinction between “genuine” refugees and other irregular migrants, and our economy may assign relative values to people’s lives based on their use as workers, but that doesn’t mean we should accept that one of those people is any less a person, or that their experiences are any less real. Refugee law provides an essential protection for some kinds of displaced people, but not all of them. Drawn up in a world where power and wealth are unequally distributed, it has always reflected the concerns of the powerful. The more rigidly we enforce distinctions between the deserving and undeserving, the more likely we are to accept the violence done in our name. Throughout 2015, I kept hearing and reading about refugees having a “dream” of Europe. Perhaps that’s the case; we are all moved at times by an ideal. But it implies a certain naivety on the part of the beholder, that someone is being pulled by an illusion that the rest of us do not share. It belittles them, while at the same time aggrandising us. To the European audience, and by extension audiences in other rich parts of the world, it is reassuring: they are dreaming of having lives like ours – and who can blame them for idealising our existence? Yet it is striking how often the word “dream” seems to crop up in place of the less comforting words “want” and “need”. This person has arrived in Europe and they want to go to Britain, where their uncle lives. Wouldn’t you? This person needs to get to Europe to work. Why can’t they earn a living at home? Why should anyone have to put up with these conditions? Whose interests does it serve to regulate their movement? And how likely is it that states which treat migrants with such callousness will behave similarly towards their own citizens? These, I think, are the sorts of questions we should be asking. • Daniel Trilling’s Lights in the Distance, based on years of reporting on refugees in Europe, has just been published by Picador and is available from the Guardian Bookshop • Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/04/mariah-carey-bossiness-breakups-bipolar-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T17:51:12Z","webTitle":"‘I bathe in milk': Mariah Carey on bossiness, breakups and being bipolar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/04/mariah-carey-bossiness-breakups-bipolar-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/04/mariah-carey-bossiness-breakups-bipolar-interview","fields":{"headline":"‘I bathe in milk': Mariah Carey on bossiness, breakups and being bipolar","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mariah Carey is the most famous, or infamous, diva in the music business. And today she doesn’t disappoint. When I ask whether the outlandish stories about her are true, she becomes spectacularly diva-ish about her own divadom. “Are there myths about other people and their diva-ishness?”’ she asks. Of course, I say – but not as many. “So I have more myths about the diva-ishness?” Yes, but I’m trying to find out if they are true. OK, fire. Is it true you once asked for 20 white kittens and 100 white doves as a rider? (In 2009, it was reported that this is what she had asked to be surrounded with when opening the Westfield shopping centre’s Christmas lights, but she was turned down on health and safety grounds.) “No, 20 cats is an absolute lie. I’m not a cat lady. I don’t have one cat any more.” Fair enough, I say. Do you insist on a new toilet seat and gold taps whenever you stay in a hotel? “I mean, honestly? Golden taps! I could just buy a house for that!” Please, can this next one be true – your reputation is at stake: do you only bathe in French mineral water? “No, I bathe in milk.” Really? “Yes, sometimes I use milk as a beauty treatment. I don’t want to give away all my secrets.” Hot or cold? “‘Cold milk.” So the mineral water is not true? She smiles. “Well, I guess if there’s no clean water and I had to use mineral water, maybe I would.” This comes towards the end of one of the strangest interviews I’ve ever done. When I first arrive, the waiting room is so cold I’m convinced Carey’s team will only let me meet the Queen of Christmas once I’ve been cryogenically frozen. It’s a gorgeous LA day out there, but this is Planet Mariah. Brrr. The room gets colder and colder. I’m still waiting. Eventually, an imposing woman whisks me upstairs. “Mariah will answer no personal questions,” she says. “But you can ask her anything – anything – to do with her upcoming Christmas tour.” A giant of a security man blocks my way. “Yeah, all the interesting stuff,” he says, without irony. Jesus. I’ve just flown from London to LA at a few hours’ notice to meet the great Mariah Carey to discuss … her Christmas tour, and nothing else. There is no time to argue. I am led into the interview room. Only it appears to be a film studio – camera operators, producers, makeup artists, cushion primpers. But I can’t see them clearly. The room is dark. At the end is Carey, sitting like a waxwork on her throne. My chair is opposite her, but about three metres away. If I lean forward and stretch my arm out, I’ll still be touching thin air. There is a flurry of whispers and panicked activity. Carey is unhappy. I am moved, then returned. She is every bit as poised – only on a new throne. Carey, 48, looks Jessica Rabbit fabulous, but I wish I’d brought my specs. I can make out a tight red dress and rocks galore – two huge butterfly diamond rings, diamond necklace and bracelet. Even her sandals are sparkling. It’s great that you’re coming to Britain for the Christmas tour, I say. She smiles graciously. “Thaaaaaaaank you,” she says. “I’m so excited, especially coming to Britain at Christmas time is gonna be so special. I feel it’s one of those places you like to be during the holidays. I mean, it’s great all the time, but the holiday period is especially festive.” Keep on topic. Her team’s orders ring in my ears. What will you be bringing to the Christmas show? “I’m bringing everything I can for Christmas. It’s really about the music and being with the fans at Christmas time. I’m trying literally to spread good cheer to people who come to the show.’” Behind Carey, I can make out a huge Christmas tree. It’s 1 June. To my left and right, her team are standing and kneeling, faceless shadows in the dark, ensuring I stay on topic. Will there be reindeer at the show? “I can’t respond about the reindeer. I’m definitely gonna have reindeer in my house at Christmas.” Silence. Her people told me that although she doesn’t do personal, she is happy to talk about being a proud mom. She has seven-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan, with her former husband, the actor and comedian Nick Cannon. Do the kids like Christmas? “They luuuuurve Christmas. They’ve met Santa Claus.” What did he say to them? “He told them not to use bad language.” Silence. Two minutes in, we’ve exhausted Christmas. I swallow loudly. She smiles. Are the twins like you, I ask. “They both have traits. My son is a little bit bossy.” Does he get that from you? “Bossiness? Not on his level, no. He’s next level. I’m not that bossy, honestly. I try to be nice. I doooo,” she coos. Then her tone changes. “I know everybody thinks I am. Whatever. I don’t know what they think. I don’t care.” Do you think there are lots of misconceptions about you? “Yeah, I do.” Such as? “I don’t know and I don’t want to know. If I looked at every single thing people say about me I couldn’t exist as me, so I’d rather just see certain things.” Carey is not merely Queen of Christmas, she is pop’s record record-breaker – the first star to have their first five singles top the US charts; the most weeks at No 1 in the US singles charts alongside Elvis Presley (79); the only artist to have had three singles debut at No 1 (Fantasy, One Sweet Day with Boyz II Men and Honey). One Sweet Day spent longer than any other single at No 1 in the US (16 weeks). Merry Christmas is one of the bestselling Christmas albums of all time (15 million and counting), and her joyous All I Want for Christmas Is You is the bestselling Christmas single in the US (in the digital era). Her vocal pyrotechnics inspired a generation of singers to perform big (see just about every female singer on a TV talent show). She was born in New York state to a white Irish-American mother and an African American/Afro-Venezuelan father – Patricia was an opera singer, Roy an aeronautical engineer. But they divorced when she was three and her mother struggled to make ends meet. They moved numerous times for work, money was in short supply and family life was turbulent. Her older sister Alison developed a drug problem, had a baby at 15, went into sex work and became HIV positive. Carey has said she sang and wrote songs from an early age to escape. At 12, she was working in studios as a backing vocalist. At 19, she was discovered by the Sony boss Tommy Mottola. Carey wangled her way into a party attended by record executives and handed Mottola a tape. He listened to it on his way home, and rushed back to find her. But she had left. Mottola spent two weeks tracking her down. He signed her up and spent two years working with Carey on her first album, released in 1990; it produced four No 1 singles. Her voice had an incredible five-octave range, the music often winsome – designed for white teenage girls. In 1993, Carey and Mottola married – she was 23, he was 20 years older. Carey’s life was called a Cinderella story. When she and Mottola split up four years later, she claimed he had been controlling and compared married life with him to being imprisoned at New York maximum security jail Sing Sing. He denies the claims. I ask if she supports the #MeToo movement. “How can I not? I’m all for people speaking their truth.” Have you experienced sexual harassment in the work environment? “I have.” How have you coped with it? “Like I try to cope with many things by turning a negative into a positive. Even if it’s just escaping an awkward moment.” Were they just moments or something more sustained? “A bit of both, but I definitely don’t want to get into it in this interview, so don’t hate me, darling!” Carey’s natural voice is rather gravelly. But now she is channelling Marilyn Monroe. #MeToo is not simply about sexual harassment, it’s about exposing controlling men, I say. “I have experienced that, yes,” she says with a tight smile. In your first marriage? “Other occasions as well. But that had less of an impact on my life than being in a completely controlling relationship.” Did it strengthen you? “Yes, but it also wounded me. When you have to control your own emotions constantly and be aware of every move you make and pretty much ask permission to exist it affects your life.” The split with Mottola also marked a change musically. She became more adventurous, recording with rappers Jay-Z (Heartbreaker), Snoop Dogg (Say Somethin’) and Ol’ Dirty Bastard (Fantasy). Was divorce liberating? “I was definitely more free. But that started a bit before. Fantasy with ODB happened when I was still in that relationship. There were a lot of things that felt liberating, but it was also a battle because of being embroiled in the business when you’re in a relationship.” She might be reluctant to answer questions about her personal life, but she can’t help herself. Carey is by nature a talker – emotionally literate and open. In April, she faced her own allegations when her former manager Stella Bulochnikov, until recently a close friend, said she was suing Carey over breach of contract. She also claimed the singer sexually harassed her. I ask Carey if she wants to comment. She glares at me incredulously. “I can’t talk about it, but I think you can see on my face what I think about it.” One of the shadows turns her index finger in rapid circles. The message is clear – change the subject. Now. I ask Carey what music she most likes to listen to. “Silence!” she says. She bursts out laughing. As do the shadows. Suddenly the room is full of giddy, screw-you laughter. It’s a good putdown. This is the Carey I like – acidic, sharp-tongued, direct. She pauses. “No, I’m just kidding. You have to write that I’m just kidding. Hahahaha!” Or what? “Or I will hunt you down.” She pauses. “That’s a lyric from one of my songs.” She finally answers the question. “Stevie Wonder is my favourite artist of all time, and Aretha Franklin is one of my favourite singers ever. I love Prince, Michael Jackson.” Not surprisingly, her professional relationship with Sony deteriorated after she and Mottola divorced. In 2001, she signed for Virgin Records in a huge deal – $100m (£75m) to make five albums. But the first album, Glitter, was a relative flop (accompanied by a disastrous film) and the deal was terminated, although Virgin had to pay $28m for the privilege. In 2005, she returned on Island with a massive album, The Emancipation of Mimi; the single We Belong Together was No 1 in America for 14 weeks and named song of the decade by Billboard. Since then, her career has dipped. Her last album, Me. I Am Mariah … The Elusive Chanteuse, released four years ago, failed commercially. It is nine years since she had a solo hit single. Doubtless she would tell the world that she is still big, it is the music industry that got small. She corrected a reporter who said she had been paid $12m to be a judge on American Idol in 2013 (which she described as the worst experience of her life). The true figure, she said, was $18m. Carey is worth an estimated $520m. It is interesting that she mentioned Jackson and Prince as two of her heroes. They also struggled to cope with extreme fame. Two months ago, Carey revealed she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 17 years ago and talked about her continued struggle. This came three years after a former friend told the Daily Mail that she “lived in a bubble” and that “the biggest byproduct of fame is that it makes people almost bipolar”. Does she agree? “There is a price to pay for living a public life. You can either sit there and go ‘Woe is me, I’m famous!’, which some people do. But you kinda asked for it.” If she could track the roots of her bipolar disorder back to anything, she says, it would be an identity crisis in childhood. “It was a combination of being biracial and experiencing the darker side of life. My mom experienced a lot of racism as an opera singer because she was married to a black man. Again, it’s impossible to encapsulate that in this setting.” She tells me she is writing her memoirs and all will be revealed. Her mother’s own family disowned her for marrying a black man. How did that affect her mother? “She was very active in the civil rights movement. She marched with Martin Luther King.” As a child, many people assumed Carey was white. I mention a story she once told about a friend coming to her house when she was a little girl, meeting her father and screaming. “She burst into tears because she had never seen a black person. I just remember how that impacted on me.” Did you wish you had darker skin? “Of course! But what can I do? I can’t go in the sun. I had to go through so much in my childhood just to feel accepted and feel worthy of existing on Earth because I felt so different from everybody else growing up, because I was biracial, because I was so ambiguous-looking and because we didn’t have the money to escape whatever the everyday realities of life were.” She says she has always struggled to believe in herself. “I have very low self-esteem.” Has there ever been a time when you unambiguously liked yourself? “I like myself when I record a song and listen back to a bit and feel good about everything about it. There’s a sense of accomplishment in the work.” In 2001 Carey made a memorable impromptu appearance on the MTV show TRL. She turned up, uninvited, on the live show with an ice-cream cart, and shocked the host by removing her top and handing it to him. Soon after this, she announced she’d had a breakdown and was “under psychiatric care”. This was when she was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Many people with mental health problems will draw strength from you speaking out, I say. “Well, that is the goal.” Were you worried about making it public? “I wasn’t excited about having to talk about these details of my life. I wasn’t thrilled. But again, what you’re saying to me about other people finding some kind of strength from that is the most important thing.” Why did you decide to go public about it now? “I wanted to be more free to be who I am.” Carey once said that after signing her first major record deal, she couldn’t sleep for more than two hours. Was that because of the pressure to succeed? No, she says – again, it goes back to her childhood. “I’ve always had sleep issues. I remember being six years old and not being able to fall asleep. There was always something going on in my house when I was little so I never really felt safe. I think that started it.” Among the many people she appears to have fallen out with is her sister Alison, who complained that Carey has given her no financial support while she has been desperately ill. Alison also claims that the money she earned from sex work was used to subsidise the family, and paid for the outfit Carey wore when she first met Mottola. Did what happened to Alison as a teenager scare her? “Absolutely. It turned me into a very guarded person, and a very prudish person on a lot of levels.” Does she feel guilty that she enjoyed such success while Alison struggled through life? “Well, I don’t think it’s for me to feel guilty about decisions that other people made with their lives. I do as much, privately, as anybody would do for people who have not been very considerate of me, to put it mildly.” The Shadow-in-Chief is making circles again. So I change the subject. Carey once said: “I went from one semi-psychotic guy to the next.” Does she have dodgy taste in men? “Oooooh … possibly. That could be one assessment. I have to take the blame for it.” Who has been the best man in her life? She takes her time. “I gotta go with my son. He’s not a man yet, but he will be one day. I have high hopes for him.” Her second husband, Nick Cannon, suggested Carey’s romance with her backup dancer/choreographer Bryan Tanaka was confected for her recent reality show. Is it a real relationship? “Yes.” Is it love? “I’ve been trying not to talk about it, and all you do is push me more and more. And then you wonder why I have low self-esteem. You don’t listen to a damn thing I say. Hehehehehe!” Her laughter is wholehearted, but the Shadow-in-Chief is making circles. A voice shouts: “Last question!” What do you think of Donald Trump? But she doesn’t have a chance to reply. “OK, we’re done,” the voice says. “Thank you so much Simon. I appreciate it.” I walk up to Carey to thank her. But the imposing woman comes between us. “‘You weren’t supposed to ask a lot of that,” she says. “It’s my job,” I reply. “I know, but I’m trusting you to tell it properly.” Well, if I don’t, Mariah can always hunt me down, I say. “I will hunt you down,” Carey sings quietly at me. And then, puff, she disappears into the darkness.

It is the first time that a patient with late-stage breast cancer has been successfully treated by a form of immunotherapy that uses the patient’s own immune cells to find and destroy cancer cells that have formed in the body. Judy Perkins, an engineer from Florida, was 49 when she was selected for the radical new therapy after several rounds of routine chemotherapy failed to stop a tumour in her right breast from growing and spreading to her liver and other areas. At the time, she was given three years to live. Doctors who cared for the woman at the US National Cancer Institute in Maryland said Perkins’s response had been “remarkable”: the therapy wiped out cancer cells so effectively that she has now been free of the disease for two years. “My condition deteriorated a lot towards the end, and I had a tumour pressing on a nerve, which meant I spent my time trying not to move at all to avoid pain shooting down my arm. I had given up fighting,” Perkins said. “After the treatment dissolved most of my tumours, I was able to go for a 40-mile hike.” Laszlo Radvanyi, scientific director of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, who was not involved in Perkins’s treatment, said it was “an unprecedented response in such advanced breast cancer.” The dramatic success has raised hopes that the therapy will work in more patients with advanced breast cancer and other difficult to treat cancers, such as ovarian and prostate. Researchers are now planning full scale clinical trials to assess how effective the treatment could be. “We are now at the cusp of a major revolution in finally realising the elusive goal of being able to target the plethora of mutations in cancer through immunotherapy,” Radvanyi said. But experts caution that the treatment has only proved itself in one woman and that the clinical trials are needed to see how effective the therapy could be in other cancer patients. Researchers point out that while the treatment could in principle work for many different kinds of cancer, it will not help everyone. To create the treatment, doctors first cut small pieces of tissue from Perkins’s tumours and studied the DNA to find mutations specific to her cancer. They focused on mutations that disrupted four genes which produced an array of abnormal proteins in the tumours. Next, the doctors extracted immune cells known as tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, from the tumour biopsies. These are cells from the patient’s immune system that have invaded the tumour in a bid to kill it, but which failed in the task by being either too weak or too few in number. After growing billions of these immune cells in the lab, the researchers screened them to find which ones would most effectively find and destroy the woman’s cancer cells by recognising their abnormal proteins. The doctors treated Perkins by injecting 80 billion of the carefully-selected immune cells into her body. The therapy was given alongside pembrolizumab, a standard drug that can help the immune system to attack cancers. Tests after 42 weeks showed Perkins was completely cancer free. She has remained so ever since. “It feels miraculous, and I am beyond amazed that I have now been free of cancer for two years,” Perkins said. “I had resigned my job and was planning on dying. I had a bucket-list of things I needed to do before the end, like going to the Grand Canyon,” she added. “Now, I have gone back to normal everyday life.” While the US doctors who developed the therapy cannot be sure how much the infused immune cells contributed to her recovery, the use of pembrolizumab alone has not been very effective for advanced breast cancer in the past. The infused T cells were found in Perkins’s system for at least 17 months after her treatment began. The success, reported in the journal Nature Medicine, is all the more remarkable because breast cancers, like prostate and ovarian cancer, have relatively few mutations, which makes them harder for the immune system to spot amid the body’s healthy tissues. Alan Melcher, professor of translational immunotherapy at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, who was not involved in the study said: “The work shows that even cancers like breast cancer, which don’t have many antigens, are amenable to this sort of treatment. It would certainly be applicable in principle to a range of tumours, and even those in which immunotherapy hasn’t worked so well yet.” But Melcher points out that the therapy is complex and expensive and more importantly, requires doctors to find enough infiltrating immune cells in a patient’s tumour to make the treatment effective. “The case with other TIL therapies in the past is that they’ve not been able to expand enough T cells in many patients, there aren’t enough to start with.” Simon Vincent, director of research at Breast Cancer Now, added: “This is a remarkable and extremely promising result, but we need to see this effect repeated in other patients before giving hope of a new immunotherapy for incurable metastatic breast cancer. “Metastatic breast cancer remains incurable, and if we are to finally stop women dying we urgently need to find new ways to target and stop the spread of the disease. We are thrilled by this early finding, but we must remember that this type of immunotherapy remains an experimental approach that has a long way to go before it might be routinely available to patients.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/06/andy-warhol-ads-record-sleeves-paul-marechal-interview-mechanical-art-picasso-museum-malaga-spain","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Andy Warhol's days as an artist for hire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/06/andy-warhol-ads-record-sleeves-paul-marechal-interview-mechanical-art-picasso-museum-malaga-spain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/06/andy-warhol-ads-record-sleeves-paul-marechal-interview-mechanical-art-picasso-museum-malaga-spain","fields":{"headline":"Andy Warhol's days as an artist for hire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“I can show you my latest acquisition, which I’m very proud of,” says Paul Maréchal, the world’s foremost collector of what snobs might refer to as Warhol ephemera – copies of illustrations, brochures, posters and album covers commissioned by companies and clients. Maréchal is adamant that they are “works of art”. He whips out his phone and shows me a photo of a poster for Mademoiselle, a defunct Condé Nast publication (“The Magazine for Smart Young Women”). It’s a red, white and blue map of the US, hand-drawn, with potatoes in Idaho, film reel and grapes in California and a Statue of Liberty in New York. Maréchal’s eyes bulge with enthusiasm as he describes how he found it for sale at a little auction house in Connecticut. “I’ve known only three examples of this poster. Two of them are in a private collection in Texas,” he explains. It was a snip at $4,000 (£3,000), and will shoot up in value once he adds it to the catalogue raisonné of Warhol’s commercial work that he has spent the past two decades compiling. A dapper French Canadian in his early 50s, Maréchal, whose day job is curating art for a corporation in his native Montreal, owns more than 700 such pieces. They include Christmas cards for Tiffany, copies of Interview magazine – which filed for bankruptcy this month after a nearly 50-year run – and a medical booklet on rheumatoid arthritis featuring an ink drawing of a gnarled hand. At the Picasso Museum in Málaga, where we meet, a major Warhol retrospective features more than 150 items from his collection, the largest group ever to go on public display. Maréchal started collecting in 1996. At the time, he says, Warhol’s reputation was in a kind of limbo. “Art historians and collectors didn’t know much what to do with his work – was he just a society portrait painter, an artist who created two or three famous artworks, but the rest was uninteresting? So in the early years, I could buy anything, I had no competition.” That soon changed, however, after Maréchal began to publish records of what he had acquired, building a market in his wake. His first find was a copy of The Painter, an album by Paul Anka. “It’s not the rarest, but it struck me.” He found himself thinking of Warhol’s notorious sleeve for Sticky Fingers by the Rolling Stones, with its bulging crotch and real-life workable zipper, and the peelable banana on the Velvet Underground’s debut. “It just sparked a question in my mind: how many record covers did Warhol create?” He called the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. “They came up with a list of 23.” But because Warhol didn’t keep track of commissions, they couldn’t say for sure. By 2015, Maréchal had discovered a further 42. It was a labour of love, and involved flipping through tens of thousands of LPs in record shops (“It’s easier now there’s the internet”). The Málaga exhibition – subtitled Mechanical Art, an allusion to Warhol’s obsession with repetition and reproduction – presents silk-screen icons alongside the lesser-known commercial material. The Jackies are here, next to a Liz Taylor, some Maos and some Marilyns (10 of the latter, loaned by the Metropolitan Museum in New York, haven’t been seen in public since 1968). In the flesh, these are powerful, disturbing images, for all their familiarity. You are momentarily dazzled by the glamour before you remember that Jackie (Kennedy) was bereaved, Taylor had pneumonia and Marilyn Monroe was painted after her overdose. Marilyn (Reversal) in funereal black, a print made from a photographic negative, recalls the Turin shroud. In an adjacent section, the lurid Electric Chair and Car Crash paintings remove any doubt; Warhol was as interested in the American way of death as he was fascinated by the minutiae of life, the soup cans and the Brillo pad boxes. Curator José Lebrero Stals has placed most of the commercial work in a separate room, though he insists this is not to “segregate” it, but to make it easier for visitors to “discover” a different side of Warhol. In any case, he admires the Christmas cards as much as the canvases, saying both display the artist’s characteristic mix of “sweet innocence and strong perversity”. Warhol’s 1950s illustrations err on the side of sweet innocence, unavoidable given the nature of the commissions – cards, a trade catalogue of children’s books, or a double-page spread on bags for Mademoiselle. His blobby ink lines are playful, animated, and frequently twee, conjuring cherubs, unicorns and golden slippers. As time goes on, they become more like the art we already know, bold, neon, printed rather than hand-drawn. This reflects a curious inversion of the artistic trajectory: Warhol was a sell-out first, a successful commercial artist well before his debut solo show at Ferus gallery in Los Angeles in 1962. Having arrived in Manhattan in 1949 with a degree in pictorial design, he quickly established himself as an illustrator, making enough money in that first decade to buy a gable-roofed town house near the new Guggenheim Museum. These were the years when he hung around at the edges of the New York scene, which was still in thrall to high-minded abstract expressionism. According to art historian Louis Menand, he was described by his idol Truman Capote as a “hopeless born loser” and by one major gallery owner as “a very boring person, but you have to be nice to him because he might buy a painting”. The transformation was swift, and total. By the mid-1960s, he was the doyen of the city’s avant garde. He branched out from painting, becoming a film-maker and music producer, despite a total absence of experience in those fields. By 1969 Warhol was ready to try magazine publishing. According to long-time editor Bob Colachello, he co-founded Interview so he could get press tickets to New York film festival premieres, continuing an obsession with celebrity that first manifested itself in the letters he sent to Capote while still a child in Pittsburgh. Initially an esoteric film journal, Interview changed direction in 1972. It would now cover fashion, interiors and, above all, famous people. In doing so it defined a new template for popular magazines – and one whose slick nonchalance stood in stark contrast to the likes of Mademoiselle. Although there is talk of it relaunching in September, Interview arguably did well to outlive the man most closely associated with it. “I think that the legacy of Interview magazine is really the legacy of Andy Warhol,” says Patrick Moore, director of the Warhol Museum, who lent dozens of pieces to the Málaga show (“We have 10,000 works of art, so we didn’t have to take anything off the walls”). For Moore, it was best understood as one more limb of the “integrated business” the artist created around him. “If you appeared in Interview you may have appeared in a film that Andy was directing, you may have had a commissioned portrait. Artists like Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst, who are unabashed in terms of their embrace of money and commerce, really wouldn’t exist without Andy.” Maréchal provides his own example of the 360-degree service: “I remember for instance Miguel Bosé, the Panamanian pop star, Warhol did a record cover, the interview for Interview magazine, he also interviewed him on Andy Warhol’s TV”– a cable show broadcast in Manhattan in the early 80s. Bosé didn’t get a full-scale portrait, perhaps because, at 26, he didn’t need one. As Moore explains, “Andy, as with most great portraitists, was not ashamed to give a facelift as part of the process.” He would take a sitter, “put white pancake makeup on them, overlight them, and all of the wrinkles would go. And he might give a little snip around the jawline as well – so everybody looked fabulous.” The commercial activity seems to ramp up as the years go on. There is, for example, the garish tie-in for Absolut Vodka from 1985. But it’s an illusion – in an issue of Playboy from 1962, Maréchal has unearthed a Warhol advert for Martini, complete with gondoliers. Fine Art Andy and Business Andy were always one and the same. Were there any red lines, then? “I think that there was a lot that he wouldn’t stoop to,” says Moore. “Warhol was very discerning. You know he would associate with a lot of things, but the work itself was always very well done. He always had people around him who made sure that the actual realisation of the work was quite beautiful.” Moore supplies a footnote about one 80s scenester. “He did a portrait of Trump Tower, and we own two of them, and Trump never paid for the paintings and they got sent back. So they were commissioned – and Trump never paid. They’re quite dark. I feel they’re very sinister. You would’ve thought it would’ve been a portrait of him or his wife, but no, it’s a picture of Trump Tower.” (Warhol’s diaries state that the artist did eight drawings of the Tower in the hope that they would lead to a commission, but “Mr Trump was very upset that it wasn’t color-coordinated” and backed out. “I still hate the Trumps because they never bought the paintings I did of the Trump Tower,” Warhol wrote on 15 January 1984.) Maréchal is realistic about Warhol’s ability to say no. “Warhol never declined any commission. Or very rarely. I’ve heard of one – a movie poster, I don’t remember the name, but the actors were unknown, so that probably did not entice [him] to create.” We return to the huge fortune Maréchal has amassed – just like Warhol – by being obsessive, having a brilliant eye, and creating his own market. In any case, he claims he’s not in it for the investment opportunity, despite stretching every paycheck to fund the hobby. Later on, he seems to have second thoughts. “Because I’m 52 years, I’m at the point where I’m asking myself: what am going to do with this? Am I going to donate half of it, sell half of it, enjoy the money or not, keep it together? It’s a questioning each and every collector goes through during his lifetime. But no, I don’t want to disperse. I could sell everything I’ve collected because the books will always remain as a trace of that collection. But it’s not enough for me. Like when I started – I wanted to touch, to see. I had to buy every record cover because I wanted to see the inner sleeve, the credits. For every work I need to have [it] within my hands”.

A fresh-faced bright young thing surfaces amid great excitement and curiosity; suddenly they somehow evolve into an established international cricketer and then after minimal blinking there is the gnarled old pro maybe pondering a career as a coach or a pundit once the playing days are gone. It all happens so fast. Imperceptibly Jos Buttler seems to have arrived at that middle stage. He is 27 now; he has played 190 times for England, 20 of which have been in Test cricket, and since his return to the red-ball game has so far proven to be a damn fine idea, the chances of him resuming as a three-format cricketer are now excellent. He is not yet gnarled, but it is almost seven years since he first played for England in a Twenty20 match against India at Old Trafford. The management team increasingly seek his opinion – with good reason. For such an instinctive, free-spirited batsman, Buttler thinks seriously about the game. The past fortnight has prompted Buttler’s career to swerve in an exciting direction – for him and for those who treasure Test cricket. The manner in which he changed gear on Sunday morning, from dutiful Test batsman to devastating destroyer, made for compelling viewing. His success in two Tests against Pakistan has suggested, contrary to the age-old mantras, that it is possible to swerve from T20 to Test cricket without any intervening period of rehabilitation in the longer game – provided you are blessed with exceptional talent and a clear mind. Before the match at Lord’s Buttler mentioned that he felt as if he was making another debut after his 18-month absence from Test cricket and he returned to that theme after the game at Headingley. “My mentality has been similar to my first few Tests, not worrying about external factors, just trying to play the game and trusting myself‚“ he said. “But the big difference is experience,” he said. “When I was a young player I didn’t really believe in experience when the older guys told me I would improve or understand things in time. I used to think you could either do it or you couldn’t. But now I understand how valuable experience is, not only on the field but in the stuff that goes on beyond it.” Buttler excelled with the bat at the start of his Test career before petering out and he can now rationalise why. “I started to think too much about how not to get out as opposed to how to score runs and I got into a really bad rut. The only way out of it was to be dropped, which actually released a lot of pressure.” This is a point worth remembering for selectors. Rather than being consumed by giving someone countless chances in an effort to be fair, it is worth recalling how a cricketer can benefit from being dropped and having the space to reassess. Buttler has returned to Test cricket via the white-ball game. In particular his form in the Indian Premier League this spring enabled him to start a Test with confidence high, even if his surprise selection also represented a voyage of discovery – or rediscovery. “The IPL gave me huge amounts of confidence, to be in those pressure situations in India, in front of big crowds and being one of the overseas players‚” he said. “For me, not trying to worry about the colour of the ball definitely helps.” He explains some of the different demands of T20 and Test cricket. “In T20 there’s generally another game around the corner. You’re almost set up to fail a lot of the time, especially if you’re batting in the middle order. The tough thing with Test cricket is that if you get out early you’ve got a long time to think about it. “You guys have to write about it; the Sky commentators have to fill time and they can pick you to pieces. In T20 you just move on to another game two days later. In cricket you fail in your head maybe seven or eight times out of 10. You’re always dealing with failure, which makes it such a tough game to master mentally.” Buttler clearly understands how precarious the game can be and he would never claim to have cracked it. “I’ve only played two Test matches coming back so I’m not going to get too far ahead of myself.” His globetrotting on the T20 circuit over the past two years has also helped him. “I haven’t been kicking my heels, saying I’m a failure in Test cricket and regretting how it went.” But unlike Adil Rashid and Alex Hales, he has not been tempted to rule out returning to the most taxing form of the game, for which England are very grateful. Even in the helter-skelter world of the modern cricketer there is still time enough for Buttler to have a significant Test career."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/07/costa-rica-memories-a-lesson-in-softball-and-blade-runner-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T09:28:05Z","webTitle":"Costa Rica memories, a lesson in softball and Blade Runner: 2018 | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/07/costa-rica-memories-a-lesson-in-softball-and-blade-runner-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/07/costa-rica-memories-a-lesson-in-softball-and-blade-runner-2018","fields":{"headline":"Costa Rica memories, a lesson in softball and Blade Runner: 2018","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) England are squeezing in one last friendly before departing for Russia. The game against Costa Rica at Elland Road is sure to spark nostalgic memories of a classic encounter in Brazil four years ago in which the Three Lions mustered just one shot on target. The Keylor Navas-inspired Ticos, of course, went on to play the Netherlands in the quarter-finals only to succumb to Louis van Gaal’s last act of managerial genius as he replaced goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen with Tim Krul in extra-time, specifically for the penalty shootout. But for all Italia 90 heads we shouldn’t forget their 1-0 win over Scotland in Genoa on their first appearance at a World Cup. The Tartan Army never quite recovered. 2) Few players have defined the World Cup quite like Ronaldo with “O Fenômeno” lighting up two tournaments. France 98 ended up not quite going to script but watching defenders of the calibre of Marcel Desailly and Lillian Thuram displaying near-hysterical fear at the prospect of facing him in the final goes a long way to emphasising just how good a player he was. 3) We’re unsure if Sir Geoffrey Boycott ever played softball but if he did, we’re fairly confident he’d have been a fan of the bunt, that act of tapping a shot to secure first base rather than committing to a full swing. But as FSU’s Jessie Warren showed, it’s far from a foolproof manoeuvre. 4) Steph Curry is a man who knows his way around the three-point line and has revolutionised basketball this decade. Shaquille O’Neal’s impact was equally as seismic (quite literally), although across 18 years in the NBA, Diesel drained just one shot from beyond the arc. He doubled that this week. Shaq always had moves and also enjoyed a relatively successful hip-hop career. Curry probably won’t. 5) Say hello to Blade Runner: 2018. Double amputee Blake Leeper ran a 44.42sec 400m in Prague this week, the fourth-fastest time by an American over the distance that would have seen him finish sixth at last year’s world championships. Leeper is also a self-confessed alcoholic returning to competition after serving a two-year ban for cocaine. 6) There are dodgy boxing PR stunts, Haye and Chisora brawling in the bowels of Munich’s Olympiahalle, Tyson Fury dressed as Batman and then there is the Wealdstone Raider aka Gordon Hill turning up at a Fury press conference offering the Gypsy King out. 2013 called, it wants its novelty football memes back. 7) And finally, a big win at Oklahoma’s Remington Park for up-and-coming race horse ... Bofa Deez Nutz. Which brings back memories of My Wife Knows Everything v The Wife Doesn’t Know.

Testing of 55 waste lagoons at 35 hog-raising operations by regulators showed large discrepancies in levels of key pollutants compared with what was self-reported to the state by farmers. Excessive nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, which can poison the water supply, were, in many cases, much higher than that reported by the farms. The presence of hazardous heavy metals such as zinc and copper in the waste lagoons was even greater – zinc levels were as much as 101,108% higher in the regulators’ testing compared with what was reported to them. Inspectors from North Carolina department of environmental quality (DEQ) took the samples from farms on 13 April and compared them with what was self-reported on that day. The farms are supposed to adhere to permits that restrict harmful pollutants befouling the air and water of nearby residents. There are about 2,000 industrialized hog farms in North Carolina, making the state the second largest pork producer in the US. The pigs are kept in huge barns where their waste falls through slatted floors and is kept in huge cesspools before being sprayed on to nearby fields. The pig farms of North Carolina produce around 10bn gallons of feces a year, which is more than the volume of waste flushed down toilets by the human population of Germany. “This manipulation of data is an insult to the community members suffering from the industry’s continued use of the lagoon and spray field system,” said Devon Hall, co-founder of local anti-hog farm group Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help. “We demand real enforcement. The response to this slap in the face should be more than a slap on the wrist.” The pork industry, dominated by the Chinese-owned business Smithfield, insists that contracted farmers abide by strict permits that ensure nearby communities are not affected by the huge pits of animal waste that sit beside them. But environmental groups and a band of North Carolina residents claim the industry has tainted the air and water for decades with little intervention from supine state regulators. More than two dozen North Carolinian communities are in the process of suing Smithfield, complaining of pig waste sprayed on to their homes, polluted drinking water wells and unbearable odors. In letters to the 35 hog farm operators, state authorities apologized “for the short notice” given ahead of inspections. A spokeswoman for the DEQ confirmed an investigation was under way but would not provide any further details."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/06/nsw-government-set-for-showdown-after-refusing-to-release-of-documents","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T01:49:19Z","webTitle":"NSW government caves in to pressure and agrees to release key documents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/06/nsw-government-set-for-showdown-after-refusing-to-release-of-documents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/06/nsw-government-set-for-showdown-after-refusing-to-release-of-documents","fields":{"headline":"NSW government caves in to pressure and agrees to release key documents","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The New South Wales state government has bent to pressure to hand over three documents related to contentious policy decisions to the upper house, avoiding a showdown that could have seen one of the most senior members of the government ejected from parliament. In a spectacular about-face, the government agreed to hand the Tune report on out-of-home care for at risk children and the business cases underpinning stadium upgrades and the plan to move the Powerhouse museum from Sydney’s city to Parramatta to the Legislative Council by Friday. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon This does not necessarily mean they will be made public – there may still be claims for privilege – but it is likely that each document will be made public in some form. The release will shed light on three highly contentious policies in NSW. The decision to spend $2.3bn on the upgrades of Sydney stadiums has dogged the Berejiklian Liberal government for months and despite efforts to reduce the size of the projects, there remains deep scepticism in the community about whether it represents good value for money. The decision to move the Powerhouse to Parramatta was made by previous premier Mike Baird. Its current site at Ultimo appears destined to be turned into apartments. The report by David Tune was completed in 2016 and is understood to be highly critical of the out-of home care system for children. Since then, the government has announced an expansion of the program, which disproportionately affects Aboriginal children. Members of the upper house will be able to view the documents. “This is a complete surrender by the Berejiklian government to the power asserted by the Legislative Council to compel the production of these documents,” the opposition leader in the upper house, Adam Searle, said. “It is now clear that the upper house does have the power to order production even of cabinet documents, as long as they do not disclose the internal workings and decisions of the cabinet.” The threat of a constitutional showdown, prompted when maverick Liberal MP Matthew Mason-Cox crossed the floor on Tuesday night to back the opposition and minor parties in a motion censuring the leader of the government in the upper house, Don Harwin, has now been defused. This kind of constitutional showdown had not been seen since the 1990s, when former Labor treasurer and leader of the house Michael Egan refused to produce documents. Mason-Cox had already crossed the floor on three occasions to demand the reports. On Tuesday night Labor, the Greens, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party and Mason-Cox joined forces to issue an ultimatum to the government to either release the reports or face Harwin’s expulsion. Christian Democrat Fred Nile sided with the government. The vote was 21 to 20. The expulsion of Harwin would have made the numbers for the government in the Legislative Council even more precarious than they are now. It currently depends on the votes of one minor party member to pass legislation. It also threatened to test the limits of claims of cabinet in confidence, which has been increasingly used by the NSW government and other governments to resist calls to provide information to both the parliament and the public. Several members of the upper house made impassioned speeches about the role of the chamber as a house of review and their concern that the executive branch of government was attempting to stifle proper debate. “The long-suffering public should welcome this commitment to accountability and transparency,” Greens MLC David Shoebridge said. “There has been a shroud of secrecy over almost controversial decision made by this government. Finally parliament is striking back at executive overreach.” Mason-Cox has been an outspoken advocate for reform of the child protection system and has been seeking the Tune report into out-of-home care for at-risk children for over a year. In the past two months he has also been outspoken about the spending of $2.3bn on the controversial stadium upgrade and moving the Powerhouse to Parramatta, at a cost of $1.1bn, without the public seeing the business cases behind the projects, while child protection is underfunded. On Tuesday night Mason-Cox said he had come to “a fork in the road”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/06/fury-despair-masterpiece-cakeshop-ruling-misplaced","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"Fury and despair over the Masterpiece Cakeshop ruling are misplaced | Joshua Matz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/fury-despair-masterpiece-cakeshop-ruling-misplaced","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/fury-despair-masterpiece-cakeshop-ruling-misplaced","fields":{"headline":"Fury and despair over the Masterpiece Cakeshop ruling are misplaced","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Legacies are fickle things. Until 10.15am on 5 June 2018, supreme court justice Anthony Kennedy was widely celebrated in the LGBTQ community as a judicial hero. The author of Romer v Evans (1996), Lawrence v Texas (2003), Windsor v United States (2013) and Obergefell v Hodges (2015), Kennedy had played a singular role in advancing the cause of equal dignity for gay and lesbian Americans. A few hours after he issued Obergefell, which guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry, the Onion cheerfully published a not-entirely-satirical piece announcing that Kennedy had ruled in favor of “the most out-of-control, bonkers gay pride parade that anyone could possibly imagine”. But what has he done for us lately? Nothing good, according to my social media feed, which informs me that Kennedy has “torched”, “trashed” and “wrecked” his legacy of protecting LGBTQ rights. Supposedly he did so in Masterpiece Cakeshop v Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC), which upheld a baker’s claim that he could not be required to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. I’m not enthusiastic about the holding in Masterpiece Cakeshop. Indeed, I helped write a brief on behalf of church-state scholars advocating the opposite outcome, and there is some language in the opinion that offers cause for concern. But reactions of fury and despair are misplaced. Kennedy wrote a narrow opinion that served more to recognize and frame an important conflict than to resolve the hardest questions. Moreover, there are three features of Kennedy’s opinion that should be celebrated by progressives and members of the LGBTQ community. First, rather than address the baker’s far-reaching claim that the free speech clause and free exercise clause exempt him anti-discrimination requirements, Kennedy based his holding on the highly unusual facts of this case. He emphasized that when the baker appeared before the CCRC, one of its members described “freedom of religion” as little more than “one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use … to hurt others”. To support this point, that commissioner explicitly invoked “slavery” and “the Holocaust”. To Kennedy, these statements revealed “elements of a clear and impermissible hostility” that deprived the baker of “neutral and respectful consideration of his claims”. As Kennedy correctly noted, the commissioner’s statements disparaged the baker’s faith in two distinct ways: “By describing it as despicable, and also by characterizing it as merely rhetorical – something insubstantial and even insincere.” It’s one thing to neutrally enforce civil rights law; it’s quite another for a governmental commission to demean and condemn a person’s faith. The principle that Kennedy invoked to support this conclusion is one that should appeal to Americans of all ideological persuasions. Simply stated, the government “cannot act in a manner that passes judgment upon or presupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices”. Indeed, although Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented from Kennedy’s application of this principle, they did not disagree with its fundamental importance to our constitutional order. Nor could they have: that principle is a vital one. In fact, it rests at the heart of the constitutional challenge to Donald Trump’s travel ban. And as several commentators have noted, Kennedy’s reliance on public statements by a commissioner in Colorado to find religious discrimination only strengthens the case for concluding that Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric dooms his hateful proclamation. A second significant feature of Kennedy’s opinion is that it attracted a cross-ideological coalition of justices to support momentous statements about the rights of gay and lesbian people. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorusch –joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer – stood behind Kennedy’s declaration that “gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth”. That’s a big deal. Words like this can change (and save) lives. They can also change doctrine. At several points, Kennedy squarely rejected some of the most pernicious arguments made in support of a right to discriminate. For example, Kennedy knocked aside the notion that the LGBT community deserves less protection than other groups, warning that “the exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts”. Citing a famous case forbidding religiously-motivated racial discrimination, he added that religious beliefs “do not allow business owners and other actors in the economy and in society to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law”. Next, Kennedy sidelined arguments that discrimination doesn’t really burden gays and lesbians because they can find other vendors. The constitutionally relevant harm, he recognized, is “a community-wide stigma inconsistent with the history and dynamics of civil rights laws that ensure equal access to goods, services, and public accommodations”. For that reason, he emphasized that any exceptions must be “sufficiently constrained” to avoid a “serious stigma on gay persons”. Finally, Kennedy left no doubt that bakers – and other vendors – cannot receive a blanket exemption on the basis of their faith. “If a baker refused to sell any goods or any cakes for gay weddings,” he wrote, “that would be a different matter and the state would have a strong case under this court’s precedents.” These holdings lead to the third and most remarkable aspect of Kennedy’s opinion: its performative character. The majority opinion in Masterpiece Cakeshop is more than a mere articulation of doctrine. It seeks to model a conception of civility that takes seriously the claims on both sides of this controversy and recognizes the need to resolve them in a respectful fashion that can work in our pluralist society. Consider the final lines of Kennedy’s decision: “These disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.” Here we see a call for further reflection and an earnest plea to recognize the dignity of all persons, notwithstanding the depth of the underlying disagreement. If Kennedy’s open-ended call for tolerance and compromise seems unsatisfactory, fair enough. This case presents tough constitutional questions, especially in our anxious and polarized era. His fact-specific solution dodges many of the hardest issues and leaves the public (and the lower courts) in an uncertain position. Still, the idea that Masterpiece Cakeshop has undermined Kennedy’s legacy must be rejected. As his decades of jurisprudence make clear, Kennedy cares deeply about LGBTQ rights, religious freedom, and the emergence of social understandings and legal rules that allow each of those values to flourish. It’s no damning indictment that he failed to solve that impossible puzzle in a single opinion. To the contrary, Kennedy should be commended for assembling a diverse coalition as he strives to help us all find a path forward through troubled waters.

Scalir, 48, is one of a dwindling group of people still committed to what was once the most popular social networking platform in the world, with more than 100 million users at its peak. While most people have long abandoned Myspace in favour of Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, Scalir roams the digital graveyard searching for signs of life. “Myspace is such a huge part of my life. I’ve met new people I otherwise wouldn’t have met and learned about new fashions and bands,” said Scalir, who goes by KROQ Ken online because of his love for the alternative rock station. “It has given me so much joy,” he said. “When I didn’t have a girlfriend or lovers, at least I had Myspace.” Scalir joined Myspace in early 2004, about six months after the site launched. “It was real addicting,” he said. He loved how the site allowed users to customise their profiles and discover new music. In the early days, he would regularly chat to other users and in a handful of cases met up with digital friends offline. Today when Scalir logs in, it’s a different story. Although he now has more than 700,000 connections, interactions with other humans are rare. Most profiles have been abandoned. Users can no longer customise their profiles with cursor animations, script fonts and other basic coding. Scalir spends his time trawling through profiles – now homogenised into neat, uniform tiles – making dozens of friend requests and commenting on or liking photos. The homepage automatically pulls in articles from other websites, giving the ghost town a veneer of vitality. However, a prominent invitation to “connect with” Avicii, the Swedish DJ who died in April, acts as a jarring reminder of the site’s zombie status. “It’s almost like I’ve taken over a dead site,” he said, noting that at least women did not block him or remove his comments any more. “I think it’s funny. I’ll leave comments and messages for girls who haven’t been on there for years.” Scalir achieved minor celebrity status in the 1990s and 2000s through several appearances on TV dating shows including Blind Date, Love Connection and Singled Out. Myspace offered an alternative way to meet women. “I always hoped I’d get a girlfriend out of it, but it never really happened,” he added. The 25-year-old Bronx resident Ray Maldonado, who describes himself as the “fresh sole survivor of Myspace”, also remains loyal to the platform he joined in May 2007 to keep in touch with school friends. “For the longest time I’ve favoured Myspace, even though it gets heavily satirised for being a website that no one uses anymore,” Maldonado said. While he used to interact with friends and the occasional celebrity (such as Miley Cyrus) on the platform, these days he mostly posts status updates and reads the aggregated news articles on pop culture. Despite the obvious deterioration of the platform, he takes jibes about it personally. “Every criticism directed towards Myspace is technically also directed towards me, being that I am still as active on the website now as I was 11 years ago,” he said. “But there are also times where the phrase ‘Myspace is dead’ motivates me to prove those people wrong.” The film producer and stunt performer Jennifer Baca, 49, first joined Myspace in 2010 and liked the way you could “personalise your own space”. Initially she found it useful for promoting her movies. “The actors would use it to talk about the film and that generated a lot of fans.” In 2012, Baca injured her hand at work and spent the next couple of years focused on recovery. When she next logged on she found she had more than 70,000 connections and hopes that these might be useful for promoting her interactive, choose-your-own adventure-style experimental films. “Myspace is forgotten a bit but I’d like it to be remembered. I feel safer here, more so than Facebook,” she said. Both Maldonado and Scalir echo Baca’s preference for Myspace over Facebook. “I’ve never been a big fan of [Facebook]. I understand that it’s the norm to have that as your main platform for social media activity but it’s never been preferable to me,” Maldonado said. Scalir feels more liberated on a less dominant platform. “There are people on Facebook I don’t really want to deal with,” he said. For the last six years Maldonado has used his Twitter and YouTube accounts to make impassioned pleas for people to return to Myspace. But luring users back would require a complete overhaul of the platform’s “ghost town” reputation. “I wholeheartedly believe we can live in a world where Myspace will become popular again, but it’s gonna take a lot of effort from both sides,” he said, referring to the site’s users and owners. Keeping track of its owners is almost as hard as finding active users. The co-founders, Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe, sold MySpace to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation for $580m in 2005. That company in turn sold it to the online advertising company Specific Media, which counted Justin Timberlake among its investors, in 2011. Specific Media subsequently became the ad tech firm Viant, which was bought by Time in 2016, which in turn was acquired by Meredith at the end of 2017. Meredith is currently marketing some Time assets for sale, including Myspace. It’s clear from the number of glitches – including problems with the notification system, music player and video upload tool – that there’s not much investment in software development for the site. However, pop-up messaging about Europe’s recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation indicates it’s not been entirely neglected – even if a bug meant you had to accept the new terms of service dozens of times to get rid of the pop-up. Unlike other social networks, Myspace’s value doesn’t come from its paltry monthly or daily active user numbers. It comes from the first-party data it has about its registered users, particularly the email addresses and other profile information such as age, gender and connections that its users consented to giving to the company. This data can be linked to other online data sources to track individuals across the internet and target them with advertising elsewhere. When Viant was sold to Time, it claimed to have a database with information on 1.2 billion users worldwide, most of which came from the various iterations of Myspace. So even if you ditched Myspace years ago, the personal data trails you left on the site may haunt you. It’s not clear what will happen to the site when Meredith finds a buyer for Viant, but the survivors of the platform apocalypse fear for its future. Maldonado said he’d be “absolutely heartbroken” if Myspace shuttered, but acknowledged that most people consider it to have died “years ago”. “I’d be very depressed if it closed down, but it would free up a lot of my time,” said Scalir, before suggesting a more optimistic alternative: “Maybe it’s a site that just won’t die and will be around forever like Keith Richards.” Contact the author: olivia.solon@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/05/forbes-top-100-no-women-mayweather","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T22:21:47Z","webTitle":"No women in Forbes’ top 100 athletes list as Mayweather reclaims top spot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/05/forbes-top-100-no-women-mayweather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/05/forbes-top-100-no-women-mayweather","fields":{"headline":"No women in Forbes’ top 100 athletes list as Mayweather reclaims top spot","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The retired boxer Floyd Mayweather has reclaimed first place from Cristiano Ronaldo in Forbes’ 2018 list of the world’s 100 highest-paid athletes – but for the first time since 2010 there was not a single female on the list.

Moshiri sold his 15% Arsenal stake to Usmanov, freeing him to buy 49.9% of Everton, where he has loaned £104m interest-free for funding and debt repayment. The new stadium project at Bramley Moore dock is his and the club’s greatest challenge to elevate Everton’s fortunes.

But, infuriatingly, we don’t get much of that legendary Jurassic hero and style-guru of the moment – Jeff Goldblum. But we do get the dinos in cages, fed with goats, dinos having to be wrangled in the driving rain, great white hunters with guns, yikes-it’s-behind-you comeuppances for the corporate bad guys and dusty old electrical circuit boxes that have to be fixed by torchlight. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom hedges its bets a bit by giving us a good dinosaur and a bad dinosaur amidst the panoply of prehistoric beasts. But weirdly, director JA Bayona, with his track record in the supernatural, only seems to make the material his own with a potentially interesting and disturbing genetic plot twist concerning not dinosaurs but homo sapiens. Yet this is left undeveloped – or maybe its creepy implications will emerge in the next movie. Basically this new film has to sidestep the eternal question of dinosaurs being penned up in an amusement park and then things going horribly wrong – over and over, film after film. Now the situation depends on uncomfortably reversing the question of jeopardy. Previously the humans were in danger from the dinosaurs. Now it’s the other way round. After running wild on their island, the dinosaurs have been left alone, but now an erupting volcano threatens to wipe them out altogether and soft-hearted pro-dinosaur ecologists campaign for these animals to be saved. Specifically, the ageing Sir Benjamin Lockwood, former business partner of the park’s founder Hammond (once played of course by Richard Attenborough) is now planning to exfiltrate the dinosaurs and keep them in a new Shangri-La island where the tourists won’t bother them. The old boy is played by James Cromwell, much as he played Prince Philip in The Queen and his gigantic mansion looks like a scary-movie Balmoral. To facilitate all this, Sir Benjamin has hired a smoothie CEO, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) – and it is Mills’s job to get the old gang together. This means rounding up Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard – in which role she is starting to look a little glassy-eyed – and the Indiana-Jones-y dino handler himself, Owen Grady, played with beefy self-deprecation by Chris Pratt. It’s a game enough performance but without the zing of his Peter Quill in Guardians of the Galaxy. Also, Sir Benjamin’s smart, lonely granddaughter is to be important; this is Maisie, well played by newcomer Isabella Sermon. Owen and Claire had supposedly broken up but now they have to meet-cute all over again and all the excitement rekindles the old romance, although there doesn’t seem to be much chemistry between them here. They daringly make their way out there with Sir Benjamin’s crew to rescue the dinosaurs, only to discover that they, and the Jurassic beasts they have come to respect, are just pawns in a nasty scheme cooked up by the money-grubbing suits. There are some reasonably entertaining scenes and set pieces, but the whole concept feels tired and contrived, and crucially the dinosaurs themselves are starting to look samey, without inspiring much of the awe or terror they used to. It could be that a meteor of tedium is heading towards these CGI creatures, despatching them to extinction. • Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom opens in the UK on 6 June and the US on 22 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/06/americans-vox-pop-everyday-racism","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T10:00:11Z","webTitle":"'I can feel aggression because of my color': Americans tell of everyday racism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/americans-vox-pop-everyday-racism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/americans-vox-pop-everyday-racism","fields":{"headline":"'I can feel aggression because of my color': Americans tell of everyday racism","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Albert Price, 53, Florida Price was in a chain restaurant in Margate, Florida, when the assisted living facility where he’s a senior manager called his cell. He stepped outside briefly to take the call, but on returning, a bartender, server and the restaurant manager were hovering at his table, about to call police. “To them it was simply a black man skipping out on his check – for two damn draft beers,” said Price. He finds himself saying “excuse me” in public, “to let white people know I’m behind them, because I don’t want to surprise them, being 6ft 4in and black.” Brianna Wilkins, 33, Texas When Wilkins moved into her new home in Houston, neighbors called the police, saying she was breaking in. “We were moving our stuff in, we weren’t taking anything out,” she said. “We had to pull out our lease [to show them] and everything.” Soon after, it happened again. “We don’t dress up, we’re real basic, just wear regular clothes. They’re trying to say we look homeless, that people are coming here selling drugs. They call the police, call our landlord. We feel like we’re in prison in our own house,” she said. Malika Bilal, 34, Washington DC Bilal hasn’t forgotten a Fourth of July fireworks and picnic when she was in middle school in Chicago. Her family were piling into their station wagon afterwards, when a white man in a pickup rolled by, shouting: “Go back to your country, we don’t want you here.” Her mother wore a headscarf and it was unclear if the problem was race, religion or both. “Sometimes it’s hard to differentiate between racism and what we now know as Islamophobia,” said Bilal, a journalist. Common micro-aggressions include store clerks speaking extra slowly, while other people question why she “talks white”. “It’s not always malicious,” she said. She tries to give the benefit of the doubt, but acknowledged that’s sometimes a coping mechanism. Andres Raygoza, 20, California “I’ve had racist people while working in customer service,” said the movie theater assistant, who is also an intern at a youth radio and media non-profit program in Oakland. “They won’t want to be helped by me, or they come at me with a certain tone, I can feel aggression because of my color or my demeanor. I laugh it off.” While working as a barista in San Francisco, previously, some customers would behave uncomfortably around him for no obvious reason other than that he is Latino. “I have to keep a smile on my face to be professional,” he said. He recalls a white customer bringing a Confederate flag into the coffee shop.

Another time, she was browsing wigs in a beauty store, but was rushed along by a sales associate. Leaving, discouraged, another associate yelled at her to stop, accusing her of stealing the wig she had been wearing when she walked in. The first sales associate vouched for her innocence, and the second said: “Well, you know, you people steal a lot, so excuse me. I’m sorry.” Cameron Belton, 26, Texas Belton acknowledges past felony convictions but is keen to move on. However, the Houston musician says he’s overly scrutinized. “I walked to the store, came back and there were cops in front of my apartment.

Belton said police ask him to take his shirt off in public. “Going to the store they might roll up alongside me, leaving the store they might pull me over – seems like just to pull me over,” he said.

Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command and the security services are running the inquiry into the 4 March attack on the former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia with military grade nerve agent associated with Moscow. The Guardian has learned that their investigation has narrowed down the time when the poison was smeared on to the front door of Skripal’s Salisbury home. Investigators believe it was placed there after his daughter arrived at the home on Saturday 3 March, having flown to the UK from Russia. She did not leave until 9.15am on Sunday, when she and her father got into his car and drove to a location in Salisbury. By 4.15pm that day, the pair were found on a bench in Salisbury town centre, gravely ill. Being able to narrow down the time when the poison was placed on the door has allowed investigators to concentrate resources as they race to identify those responsible. DS Nick Bailey was later was poisoned by the nerve agent when he and other officers attended Skripal’s home looking for evidence, including signs of drug use or suicide notes, according to the chief constable of Wiltshire police. Kier Pritchard told the Salisbury Journal that Bailey was one of a team of officers who attended Skripal’s home on 4 March. He said the group underwent a “decontamination process” at the town’s district hospital overnight on Sunday and into Monday morning, after details of the attack became clearer. Deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism, said: “Our enquiries are focused around the people and vehicles that were in the vicinity of the Skripal’s address and leading up to where they fell ill in the Maltings. We would ask anyone who may have information, or who may have seen or heard something – however small – to contact police on 101.” Police said that 100 counter-terrorism officers remain in Salisbury to continue the investigation. British authorities strongly believe that those responsible are connected to Russia, but the Kremlin denies all responsibility. The nerve agent novichok was used in the attack, which had been expected to be fatal. While Bailey was discharged from hospital after about a fortnight, the Skripals spent many weeks in hospital and are now recovering."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/05/h-and-m-change-uk-womenswear-sizes-customer-frustration","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T18:39:15Z","webTitle":"H&M to change UK women's clothing sizes after customer anger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/05/h-and-m-change-uk-womenswear-sizes-customer-frustration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/05/h-and-m-change-uk-womenswear-sizes-customer-frustration","fields":{"headline":"H&M to change UK women's clothing sizes after customer anger","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"H&amp;M is to change its UK womenswear sizes after years of complaints from customers that the clothes are smaller than expected. “We are taking the steps to change our womenswear measurements to be in line with UK sizing, for example, the previous measurements and fit of a size 12 will now be the measurements of a size 10,” said a spokesperson for the retailer. The existing sizing policy has frustrated many shoppers, leading one, Rebecca Parker, to write an open letter on Facebook in March. “I’ve always been a 12/14 and pleased with it, but when I tried on your jeans, I was annoyed, hot and frustrated. The pair of jeans clearly were not made for a woman who is a size 14. Why is that?” she asked. Parker said she was not “able to pull the jeans past my one thigh”. She went on to question how the retailer could sell pencil cases emblazoned with the word “#GRLPOWER” and T-shirts that say “SISTERHOOD” and expect women to feel empowered, while selling clothes that “do the exact opposite”. The Swedish company has until now translated its European sizes to a lower UK size than the majority of other high street shops, meaning a European 38 would be labelled a UK 12, where in other places it would be a 10. Although H&amp;M has begun using the new sizing on labels, the spokesperson said: “This will be a gradual process whereby customers will experience a transition period, and are encouraged to use our sizing guides online or ask our store staff for advice when shopping.” Customers appeared to broadly welcome the change.

In a speech in Washington on Tuesday, the Massachusetts senator and potential 2020 challenger to Donald Trump delivered a liberal rejoinder to the president’s aggressive deregulatory agenda, which she said was really just evidence of a determination to “let the rich guys do whatever they want”. The Republican argument that regulations hamper economic growth, she said, was a “big, greasy baloney sandwich”. Instead, the rollback of regulations catered to the interests of Wall Street and big business while forsaking rules that protect consumers, workers and the environment. “The so-called war on regulations isn’t about freedom,” Warren said at Georgetown University Law School. “The war on regulations is waged on behalf of giant companies that don’t want to follow any rules. So let’s call it what it really is – a war on public health, a war on public safety, a war on truly free and competitive markets, a war on American workers, a war on American consumers.” Warren’s speech was expected to be the first of several on the subject. In the coming weeks, she said, she will introduce “sweeping anti-corruption legislation” that will aim to “padlock the revolving door between government and industry”, restrict lawmakers’ ability to make policy decisions that benefit themselves, and bolster the ability of federal agencies to pass consumer-friendly regulations. Trump rode to Washington on the promise that he would “unleash” the American economy by stripping away red tape. In one of his first acts as president, he signed an executive order that required federal agencies to relax or eliminate two regulations for every new one introduced. He has since boasted that he has slashed more regulations than any other president and that the ratio is closer to 22 regulations scrapped for each new one introduced. Independent factcheckers have called his claim hyperbolic. Nonetheless, with the help of Congress Trump has rolled back regulations including a rule that would make it harder for mentally ill people to acquire guns and privacy legislation intended to protect internet users’ browsing data. The administration has also turned its attention to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, the agency Warren established in the wake of the financial crash. On Tuesday she defended the agency, drawing applause when she noted that it had returned roughly $12bn to consumers. Earlier this year, however, several Democrats joined Republicans in loosening rules imposed on the banking industry after the financial crisis. Warren led opposition to the move, which was meant to relieve small banks and credit unions. The debate exposed deep Democratic rifts. The financial sector is not the only industry taking advantage of a Republican Congress and White House. Warren also discussed the rollback of protections for workers, the environment and public lands. Not “every regulation is good”, she said, admitting that sometimes “old rules need updating” and citing her bipartisan work to roll back restrictions on the purchase of hearing aids. But, she said, such changes are not the ones Republicans want to enact. “The Republicans are working to insulate big corporations from competition and accountability,” she said. “They are making government work better and better for fewer and fewer people.” Warren closed with a call to arms and a promise that “change is coming”. “When we send a message that corporate profits and powerful interests cannot overpower the health, safety, and economic wellbeing of hardworking families, we fire a warning shot,” she said. “This is our time, our responsibility, our chance to rebuild a country where government works, not just for the rich and powerful, but for the people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/everyman/3739","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T23:00:34Z","webTitle":"Everyman crossword No 3,739","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/everyman/3739","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/everyman/3739","fields":{"headline":"Everyman crossword No 3,739","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/06/morning-mail-civilisation-degree-row-drastic-action-on-plastic-origin-expectations","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T20:39:06Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: University explains decision to drop western civilisation degree","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/06/morning-mail-civilisation-degree-row-drastic-action-on-plastic-origin-expectations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/06/morning-mail-civilisation-degree-row-drastic-action-on-plastic-origin-expectations","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: University explains decision to drop western civilisation degree","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 6 June. Top stories A contentious degree in western civilisation backed by John Howard will no longer be considered after the ANU vice-chancellor’s decision to pull out of negotiations. Brian Schmidt released a statement late on Tuesday explaining he had come to the conclusion the university had a “fundamentally different vision for the program than the Ramsay Centre, and that there was no prospect of us reaching agreement”. A brainchild of the late healthcare mogul Paul Ramsay, the degree was part of a $3.3bn bequest. Tony Abbott also supported the course, criticising current degrees for being “pervaded by Asian, Indigenous and sustainability perspectives”. But Schmidt called time on six months of negotiations, concluding: “I understand this caused disappointment to some, but my first duty is to advance the university I am so proud to lead.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A Liberal MLC has crossed the floor to spark a constitutional crisis within the NSW parliament after the upper house voted to censure and likely expel the Coalition leader, Don Harwin, over the Berejiklian government’s refusal to release three crucial reports. Matthew Mason-Cox broke ranks to deliver a rare victory for the opposition and minor parties, meaning the government must now either table the reports or face the expulsion, a move that could see it head to the state’s supreme court. An outspoken advocate for reform of the child protection system, Mason-Cox condemned a “perverse culture of secrecy”. The final two stages of the federal government’s income tax cut plan will cost the budget more than $130bn from 2023, with higher-income earners enjoying the bulk of the $144bn plan, forecasts from the Parliamentary Budget Office show. Costings compiled for the Greens show Scott Morrison’s landmark plan to increase the 32.5% marginal threshold from $90,000 to $120,000 from July 2022 will cost the budget $36.5bn, while scrapping the 37% marginal rate, and putting all income earners between $41,000 and $200,000 on the same flat tax rate, will burden the bottom line by $32.55bn. Vladimir Putin has dodged questions about the shooting down of flight MH17 during his first visit to an EU member state since being re-elected, instead calling for an end to “harmful” economic sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Speaking from Vienna, Putin accused an Austrian journalist of engaging in “a monologue rather than an interview” but used the opportunity to cast doubt on an international investigation that suggests Russian culpability for the disaster. “The tragedy we are talking about is terrible, and I feel immensely sorry for the victims and their families, but this investigation must be objective and comprehensive,” Putin said. India will eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022, Narendra Modi has announced, in the most ambitious yet of global actions to combat plastic pollution. Modi’s move aims to drastically stem the flow of plastic from the 1.3 billion people living in the fastest growing economy in the world. “The choices that we make today will define our collective future,” he said. Sport Queensland’s preparations for State of Origin’s opening encounter have been far from smooth – deprived of Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston and Cooper Cronk, they lost Billy Slater and Dane Gagai to injury. But given their game plan and an inherent knowledge of how to win, this fixture at the MCG has Maroons ambush scrawled all over it, writes Matt Cleary.

After failing to impress in season one of Super Netball last year and losing four of their first five matches in 2018, Collingwood’s shock win over the Queensland Firebirds has enabled the “galácticos” of Super Netball to somehow recalibrate their season, writes Erin Delahunty. What has changed for the Magpies? Thinking time “As an outsider, I could see that Lightning Ridge is a refuge for misfits,” says the Russian-born Australian film-maker Alena Lodkina. In her feature Strange Colours, part of the Sydney film festival, she casts an interloper’s eye over the remote opal town and finds a microcosm of Australia itself. It’s an ultra-low-budget, hyper-distilled story of dreamers, drinkers and drifters stuck in a remote community, in which Lodkina herself says “nothing much happens” at all. It’s been hailed as the best-directed Australian feature of last year. The festival runs 6-17 June. In 2014, the Guardian asked if Uber was the “worst company in Silicon Valley”. That was before the sexual harassment lawsuits, the #DeleteUber campaign, the employment tribunals over its failure to pay the UK’s minimum wage, and the forced resignation of its chief executive, Travis Kalanick. As the taxi app attempts to turn around its toxic image with a quirky documentary narrated by Dawn French, Richard Godwin asks: is Uber’s PR offensive a cynical corporate whitewash? A primary school in Inverness, Scotland, has announced that girls and boys will compete together on sports days. But why, asks Anna Kessel, should that work the world’s media into a complete lather? “We are talking about the egg-and-spoon race here, for kids aged four and upwards. As I write, my daughter is out in the playground practising the three-legged race with her classmates as they get ready for their sports day this week. She’s excited and determined to win a medal, like last year, and it won’t have occurred to her for a millisecond that she shouldn’t be racing alongside 50% of her classmates because they are boys.” What’s he done now? After “disinviting” the 2018 Super Bowl winners, the Philadelphia Eagles, from the annual White House visit after the majority of players declined to turn up, Donald Trump has billed it as a win for his opposition to players kneeling during the national anthem. He also attacked “High Tax, High Crime Nancy Pelosi” and condemned the “Russian Witch Hunt Hoax”.

If that’s a qualified claim, that’s because Ryan Coogler’s impressively hungry, purposeful comic-book spectacular is still operating within a straitjacket, albeit one of chic, futuristic design: it’s stifled, particularly in a protracted, place-to-place first half, by the box-ticking rigours of in-house Marvel storytelling. When freed from the business of franchise-founding, however, it pounces, bounds and even, in less feline fashion, flies: its flashes of political conscience, no-nonsense gender parity and glimmering Afrofuturist aesthetic feel collectively new. Whatever its other compromises, Black Panther is a widest-possible-audience juggernaut that leads with its blackness rather than smuggling it through big-studio customs. How the film’s impact will shift or rearrange the identity politics of commercial Hollywood movie-making remains to be seen. In the meantime, we can hope its success encourages some crossover interest in the less moneyed black cinema that inspired it. Perhaps that’s optimistic, though either way curious viewers will have to do more digging in the streaming archives than they should to find substantial reserves of black-directed and black-oriented films. Take, for example, Touki Bouki, the raw, seductive, cooler-than-being-cool 1973 Senegalese road odyssey that arguably contributed a hair of DNA to Black Panther’s African heroism, and was visually quoted by Beyoncé in her most recent tour marketing: a genuinely iconic Afro classic, yet not streamable anywhere in the UK. (The US edition of FilmStruck has it; here’s hoping ours catches up soon.) It may not stretch to Touki Bouki, but the BFI Player’s excellent Black Star collection, a still-growing offshoot from their 2016 cinema season of the same name, is the kind of library more specialist streaming outlets could stand to build. The brief is broad and so is the range: obviously indispensable US canon titles such as Do the Right Thing and Moonlight, cris de coeur from modern Africa such as Of Good Report and A Screaming Man, odd cultural artefacts such as Car Wash and For Queen and Country, starring Denzel Washington as an unlikely embodiment of 1980s London urban alienation. The underseen pick of the menu: Charles Burnett’s angry, on-edge, morally creased cop thriller The Glass Shield, which may have been made in 1994 but feels notably current in its examination of racial persecution by (and within) the police force. Those inclined to dig deeper still, meanwhile, might consider giving the little-heralded streaming service Kweli.TV a look. Billed as a curated collection of African diaspora content – including films, documentaries, TV and shorts from around the world – it’s a mixed but often revelatory bag. Given that it’s a US-based service, inconsistent international licensing can lead to some roadblocks: I was disappointed to find Raoul Peck’s sterling political biopic Lumumba barred in the UK, but had better luck with the genuinely bewitching, west African folk-inspired animation Kirikou and the Sorceress. Subscription fees (the conversion of $6 a month) are low enough to make such spottiness forgivable, though pay-per-view options are also available. It’s not as if you’ll find such fascinating nuggets as T’Ain’t Nobody’s Bizness, a half-hour short on lesbian blues goddesses of the 1920s, anywhere else. That’s a long way from Black Panther, but here’s to gates, and minds, opening. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week Roman J Israel, Esq (Sony, 12) Denzel Washington is at the legacy stage, where he’ll get Oscar-nominated for just about anything, including this unusually shaped, minor-key legal drama — but his turn as an awkward, idealistic defence attorney is among his most interestingly eccentric. The Defiant Ones; No Way Out (Eureka, U/15) A fine, straight-backed pair of early Hollywood civil rights inquiries, linked by the flinty star presence of Sidney Poitier: the former’s symbolically direct black-and-white convict study has endured more, but the latter, a film noir setting a black doctor against a racist patient, is perhaps riskier and more complex. Loveless (Altitude, 15) Russia’s most muscular auteur, Andrey Zvyagintsev, follows Leviathan with another beautiful blunt instrument of where-are-we-now social critique: mapping the despairing fallout of a child’s disappearance, it’s vast and delicate, chilling and fire-breathing. Alex Strangelove (Netflix) After Love, Simon sweetly introduced gay desire to the teenage mall movie, this perky Netflix Original takes the inevitable, raunchier next step. There’s a little more zing and strut to its classroom coming-out tale, but marshmallow hearts still prevail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/05/snowdonia-helicopter-crash-pilot-kevin-burke-inquest","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T17:30:29Z","webTitle":"Snowdonia helicopter crash pilot ‘should have turned round’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/snowdonia-helicopter-crash-pilot-kevin-burke-inquest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/snowdonia-helicopter-crash-pilot-kevin-burke-inquest","fields":{"headline":"Snowdonia helicopter crash pilot ‘should have turned round’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A helicopter pilot flying four members of his family to a surprise party should have turned back before descending into low cloud and smashing into a mountain in Snowdonia, an inquest heard. Kevin Burke, 56, a company director, flew at 140mph into a wall of steep ridges and rocks on Rhinog Fawr mountain in north Wales and was killed instantly along with his wife, Ruth, 49, brothers Donald, 55, and Barry, 51, and sister-in-law Sharon, 48. The family members, all from the Milton Keynes area, were heading to Dublin on the afternoon of 29 March last year. A hearing in Caernarfon in north Wales was told that Burke had set off in good conditions but came across thick cloud and turbulence in Snowdonia. The alarm was raised in the early evening when Burke’s privately owned aircraft did not land in Dublin at 2.30pm as expected. Their bodies were later found with the wreckage of the helicopter in the remote Rhinog mountain range. Investigators concluded that Ruth, a fellow company director, was in the front passenger seat next to her husband and the other passengers were in the rear. A consultant forensic pathologist, Dr Brian Rodgers, said all five sustained massive impact trauma from the collision and were identified from their dental records. He said toxicological tests on Burke showed he had consumed cocaine at some point before the crash but Rodgers said he thought the usage was non-recent and ruled it was “highly unlikely” the pilot was under the influence of the drug at the relevant time. The inquest was told Burke would fly the helicopter – which was properly maintained and in good condition – at least once a week for business or pleasure. He held a private pilot’s licence, was “very experienced” and had flown the route to Dublin previously, said a senior inspector at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Paul Hannant. The terms of his licence did not allow Burke to fly in cloud, but he had recently undertaken a proficiency test in which he satisfactorily turned away in similar poor visibility. Hannant said: “The main point about the weather on that day was to begin with it was good, but as you got to Wales there was a complex system of weather which brought down the cloud and created turbulence.” He said Burke should have completed a 180-degree turn away from the rising ground instead of continuing to descend. “The aircraft should have turned round,” he added. “Sadly, it did not and struck the mountain.” In conclusion, the senior coroner for north-west Wales, Dewi Pritchard Jones, said Burke’s training and licence was for flying in conditions where he was able to see the terrain and that “ideally” he should have turned back in the thick cloud. He pointed out that near the crash site there was an area of “relatively flattish land” and said: “Had he seen that through the cloud I am certain that would have given him the false confidence that he was at a good and safe height above ground level. “Unfortunately, Rhinog Fawr is not a mountain that gradually increases in height. It is more a series of walls of steep ridges and rocks. My belief is that his instruments would not have given him much warning of the ridges. “Being at the height he was, it was inevitable he would hit that ridge. It led to the complete destruction of the aircraft. Recording verdicts of misadventure for all five deceased, he said: “Here we have a situation of sheer bad luck. This aircraft was not greatly below its safe height. It just clipped the mountainside.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/09/one-to-watch-rolling-blackouts-coastal-fever","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T17:00:28Z","webTitle":"One to watch: Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/09/one-to-watch-rolling-blackouts-coastal-fever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/09/one-to-watch-rolling-blackouts-coastal-fever","fields":{"headline":"One to watch: Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Equal parts thrilling and wistfully melancholic, Melbourne five-piece Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever are that rare beast: a band capable of breathing excitement back into a too often uninspiring indie scene. While the individual elements of their sound - the melodic nous of their compatriots the Go-Betweens, the dynamism of the Strokes before they went rubbish, the jangle of 1980s-vintage Flying Nun – are nothing new, it’s been a long time since they have been whipped up into such a fresh-sounding confection. Their full-length debut, Hope Downs, is released this week and represents a huge leap forward from last year’s already impressive French Press EP. Guitar lines from their three singer-songwriters, Tom Russo, Joe White and Fran Keaney, interweave and interlock more intoxicatingly, like a turbo-charged Television - most notably on kinetic opener An Air Conditioned Man and recent single Talking Straight - and there’s a greater urgency to the delivery throughout. They’ve widened their perspective lyrically too. Beneath the breezy melodies, the protagonists of their vividly depicted vignettes are now seen through the prism of our tumultuous times. As Russo puts it: “The songs on this album are like a collection of postcards about wider things that were going on through the lens of these small characters.” As engaging live as on record, Rolling Blackouts CF might be just the band to fall in love with this summer. Hope Downs (Sub Pop) is released on 15 June.

He did not mention the Eagles or attempt to heal divisions. The event on the south lawn had been intended to follow the tradition of US presidents welcoming the national football champions to the White House. But on Monday night Trump disinvited the Eagles after learning that fewer than 10 players planned to attend, reopening his feud with American athletes over protests during the national anthem. Instead, a “celebration of America” for Eagles fans was promised. Four US national flags hung on the south portico and 18 more curved around the south lawn. A few hundred people gathered, many waving stars and stripes, but there were more suits and ties than Eagles shirts or caps on display. “This is a beautiful, big celebration,” claimed Trump, notorious for his obsession with size, at the end of remarks that lasted only four minutes. “Actually, to be honest, it’s even bigger than we had anticipated.” With that, the US marine band and the US army chorus, their helmets and tunic buttons gleaming in the summer sun, played God Bless America. Trump sang some of the words but his lips were sealed for trickier lines, suggesting that his knowledge of Irving Berlin’s patriotic song is somewhat sketchy. He then departed and the crowd began to disperse, showing little interest in the band music that moved on to hits by the Four Seasons and others. Earlier, during the national anthem, one man in the crowd had taken the knee in protest, emulating Colin Kaepernick and other football players, though no Eagles made the gesture last season. There was also a shout of “Eagles” and some heckling at the start of Trump’s speech, eliciting boos from the crowd. The president said: “We love our country. We respect our flag. And we always proudly stand for the national anthem. We always will stand for the national anthem.” There was a cheer from a gathering that seemed more like a Trump rally than a football watch party. The president went on to reel off achievements including unemployment figures and claiming: “Our country has never done better than it’s doing right now. Never!” There was support for Trump’s stand against the NFL players’ protests among the guests. Steve Woods, a retired business lobbyist from Alexandria, Virginia, described himself as a lifelong Eagles fan. “It would be nice if they showed up but I didn’t think they would,” he said, a Stars and Stripes in his top pocket. “Too much peer pressure to be politically correct.” The 69-year-old, who voted for Trump because of his policies for small businesses, added: “The great thing about our country is they can make a political statement and he can make a political statement.” Michael Carr, 56, a logistician from Philadelphia, said: “I agree with the president 100%. The whole situation is disappointing. I believe respecting our country should have nothing to do with one personal’s beliefs. It’s simply a matter of pride and respect. Our flag and anthem are sacrosanct and not a matter of debate in my view.” Trump’s statement on Monday cancelling the visit cited player protests throughout the NFL over police brutality and racial inequality. “They disagree with their president,” he said, “because he insists that they proudly stand for the national anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.” On Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted against a form of protest that will be allowed under an NFL policy banning kneeling during the anthem on the field or sidelines that was announced last month. “Staying in the locker room for the playing of our national anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling,” Trump wrote, returning again to an issue seen as attractive to his Republican base. “Sorry!” Later, a statement issued by the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said that “despite sensing a lack of good faith”, the White House had “attempted to work with the Eagles”. “Unfortunately,” Sanders added, “the Eagles offered to send only a tiny handful of representatives, while making clear that the great majority of players would not attend the event, despite planning to be in DC today. In other words, the vast majority of the Eagles team decided to abandon their fans. “Upon learning these facts, the president decided to change the event so that it would be a celebration of the American flag with Eagles fans and performances by United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus.” The Eagles issued a statement that avoided the issue, paying tribute instead to the supporters who followed the team to its first Super Bowl win. The NFL Players Association said the cancellation had resulted in the concurrent cancellation of “several player-led community service events for young people” in the Washington DC area. “Our union is disappointed in the decision by the White House to disinvite players from the Philadelphia Eagles from being recognized and celebrated by all Americans for their accomplishment,” the statement said. “NFL players love their country, support our troops, give back to their communities and strive to make America a better place.” LeBron James and Steph Curry, star players for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors, indicated their teams would not accept any invitation to visit the White House should they win the NBA finals series. At the daily White House briefing on Tuesday afternoon, Sanders seemed to attempt again to cast the NFL team in a bad light with its followers, saying: “The Eagles are the ones that changed their commitment at the last minute … and the president thinks that the fans deserve better than that. “Certainly,” she added, “we would hope that all of the people of Pennsylvania would share the Potus’s commitment to the national anthem and pride that we have in the country.” Pennsylvania was one of a group of usually Democratic states that Trump won in 2016, paving his road to an electoral college victory despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3m ballots. A Trump-backed candidate, however, recently lost a special election in a Pennsylvania district the president took by 20 points. Though many of Trump’s usual Republican supporters rallied to his side on Tuesday, there was some dissent in party ranks. Ryan Costello, a Pennsylvania congressman, wrote: “This is a depressing commentary on our political culture, very deflating to me. Was really excited for today. As a fan who bleeds green. Not going to WH. Disappointed in all of this.” Among a number of Democrats and Pennsylvania lawmakers who criticised Trump, Philadelphia’s mayor, Jim Kenney, said the president was a “fragile egomaniac”. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, the Democrat defended players’ rights to protest under the first amendment. He did not want to debate the issue with the president, he said, because the president was “a child”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jul/12/techno-titan-nina-kraviz-people-were-suspicious-of-a-pretty-woman-making-music","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-12T13:30:42Z","webTitle":"Techno titan Nina Kraviz: 'People were suspicious of a pretty woman making music'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/12/techno-titan-nina-kraviz-people-were-suspicious-of-a-pretty-woman-making-music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jul/12/techno-titan-nina-kraviz-people-were-suspicious-of-a-pretty-woman-making-music","fields":{"headline":"Techno titan Nina Kraviz: 'People were suspicious of a pretty woman making music'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Musicians are often said to be on top of the world, but rarely are they actually perched on one of its wonders. Way up in the misty hills of Mutianyu, north-east of Beijing, the Siberian DJ and producer Nina Kraviz is soundtracking sunrise at the Great Wall of China. Forty ravers have gathered on an ancient watchtower to dance as dawn breaks, while two replicas of terracotta army soldiers preside over the decks beside her. A few hours earlier, the authorities had cut short Kraviz’s headline show at a nearby festival, claiming – incorrectly – that it was overrunning. So, this otherworldly afterparty feels subversive. It is being livestreamed on Facebook, which is banned in China, along with most western social media. Wine is passed around as though it is the prohibition era. Kraviz’s metallic sound feels thunderous enough to bring the terracotta warriors to life. Moments like these are why Kraviz has become the most talked-about DJ in techno. One of the first women to become a headline act, she thrives on challenging her audience. Her sets stand above other DJs’ slickly synchronised, clinically pristine beats as she plays fast and loose with ghetto house, old-school hardcore, footwork, trance, drum’n’bass and her favourite genre, acid. Her style is unkempt, never dull. “When I DJ, I’m fucking alive,” she says. “All my channels are open. People think I’m on drugs, but I’m not – I’m just really experiencing it.” She calls her approach “raw”, but she dislikes how that has become a byword for anyone who plays vintage-sounding house music through software: “Fuck you, man, [your show is] pre-cooked, taken out of the fridge and then burned in the fucking microwave.” By contrast, she never pre-plans her sets, let alone stands still while playing. “I’m putting my physical presence into it. And it’s different from one show to another because I’m a different person every day. I’m the kind of person that goes from highest point to the fucking lowest point in a second. “I’m not a psychopath,” she laughs. “I’m just extremely emotional.” An interview with Kraviz is as trippy and impassioned as one of her sets. Her body clock is back to front; we end up talking in her hotel room at midnight the next day. Chain-smoking in her dressing gown, she spends an hour explaining how techno has been “underestimated” as a genre. “It’s a phenomenon, it’s as important as jazz,” she says. “It’s incredibly rich, culturally, but it’s so underground that it took me 15 years to have even a little bit of a frame of reference. There are still areas that I don’t know about.” Kraviz’s techno education started in her hometown of Irkutsk and developed in the early 90s (she won’t disclose her exact age), when she would listen to early-hours radio broadcasts of electronic music on the Europa Plus network. By the end of that decade, she was living in Moscow, working as a dentist at a war veterans’ hospital by day and holding down a club residency on Friday nights. She briefly fronted the band MySpaceRocket, but left to focus on her own productions after being told she was “just a singer”. Two of her tracks, 2009’s Voices and 2010’s I Am Gonna Get You/Pain in the Ass, were released by labels outside Russia, putting her on the dance music map. But sexism was a problem. Back in the mid-00s, the male-dominated dance music scene struggled to get its head around a woman who knew what to do with electronic hardware. In 2012, she released her self-titled debut album, a collection of simmering 808 love songs and gauzy techno-pop. While “some people loved it”, says Kraviz, “people were suspicious of a pretty woman making music on her own, with a vision. They couldn’t handle me. It was like: ‘It cannot be true that you can have lipstick on and make music.’” A year later, she starred in a video portrait by dance music site Resident Advisor, during which she was interviewed in the bath. A picture of a foamy, playful Kraviz was plastered across blogs and divided the club world. The criticism levelled at her – including from male peers – said she was putting “sexuality” before artistry, as though the two were mutually exclusive. The renowned house DJ Seth Troxler called Kraviz a “bitch” in an interview. “With me, people feel very loose in expressing their opinions,” she says. “It sometimes seems like it’s bad to be a sexist, unless it’s about Nina Kraviz.” If a man had been in the video, she says, the focus would have been their music: “I was one of the only artists at that time who had made an album without ghost producers.” Still, she doesn’t regret the bath scene. “I’m thankful now, because it made me famous.” Bathgate encourage her to create a “comfort zone where I’m myself and no one affects it but me”. She started her record labels Trip (which celebrates 20 releases this month with a new compilation) and Galaxiid, which established her as a tastemaker for severe and surreal techno: the muggy, Kraftwerkian anti-anthems of Icelandic artist Bjarki; Russian duo PTU and their breakneck whirls of pinging samples; and Kraviz’s own releases, which sound as though they were made for the dungeon of a Detroit techno club in 1991. She still has to deal with sexist comments about her mixing skills and men leering during her live streams. “I try not to think about it, but the majority of people are maybe not that interested in music on a deep level.” As it nears 3am, I wonder how she maintains her sanity in a world of sunrise sets and constant travel. “I have a pretty serious sleeping problem,” she says. “I’m so excited; I can’t go to bed for three hours after the show, no matter how tired I was before. But I cannot control it, so I just accept it.” Her schedule is about to get even more busy. There is a summer of festivals ahead, she is making remixes for art-pop musician St Vincent (“She’s a character; I like characters”) and she is writing new music. “I think people are mostly attracted to the energy I bring,” she says. “And if people like my energy, that’s already the greatest compliment I could get.” The compilation album Trip 20: Don’t Mess With Cupid is released on 20 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/05/mark-gladwin-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T16:49:28Z","webTitle":"Mark Gladwin obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/05/mark-gladwin-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/05/mark-gladwin-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Mark Gladwin obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My brother, Mark Gladwin, who has died aged 71, was a respected figure in the field of children’s play, particularly in the areas of theory, strategy and training. After many years in the voluntary sector he took a job as a participation officer at a Children’s Society project in Leeds, and from 2002 until his retirement in 2011 he worked for Bradford council, where he wrote its strategy, All to Play For, and trained and supported workers. Passionate about the importance of children taking risks as a necessary part of their development, he belonged to a number of organisations devoted to the promotion of play, and at the time of his death was still an active member of Play England, a body that campaigns to increase opportunities for young people. Born in London, Mark was the youngest child of the Australian journalist Peter Gladwin and his British wife, Irene (nee Packard), a press cuttings librarian. Brought up in Surrey, Mark attended the Royal Grammar school, Guildford, and met his future wife, Ann Burrett, when they were both at school. On a scholarship he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics. From 1969 to 1976 he was a research fellow then lecturer in social policy at York University. After teacher training in 1977 he taught in primary schools before filling various roles, from 1982 to 1998, at York Playspace, including as a coordinator and a trainer. A man of integrity and an inspiration to those who knew him, Mark was a firm believer in the value of local action: among his many practical initiatives was the founding of a local branch of the Woodcraft Folk in York, where he and Ann lived. He was a member of the Labour party and of CND, a committed republican, an advocate of electoral reform and latterly an anti-Brexit campaigner.

Williams on Tuesday expressed satisfaction with early medical opinions on her injury and might yet make it to Wimbledon. Meanwhile, there is plenty of drama left in this tournament. Certainly, the Americans will be there at the finish, as Sloane Stephens secured a semi-final spot against her compatriot and friend Madison Keys with a so-easy 6-3, 6-1 win on Court Philippe-Chatrier over the Russian shot-maker Daria Kasatkina. Keys, who lost to Stephens in the 2017 US Open final, booked her spot with a more difficult 7-6- (5), 6-4 win over the player who put Johanna Konta out of these championships in the first round, Yulia Putintseva. They have a clear day to rest ahead of their rematch on Thursday, while on Wednesday the world No1, Simona Halep, looks in good shape to beat the resurgent Angelique Kerber in the first quarter-final, and Sharapova will be buzzing after her walkover gift from Williams, to take on the reigning Wimbledon champion, Garbiñe Muguruza. A Halep-Sharapova semi-final looks likeliest from those options – and Stephens might just have enough on Keys to reach the final ahead of them. After taking just 70 minutes to dismiss the artful Kasatkina, she said, “I’m super-excited again to have my best result here. Being in another semis of a slam is amazing.” Asked how she and Keys might avoid each around the locker room before playing such a high-profile match again, she said, “When we get on the court, it’s time to compete. But, before that, we are not going to be weird and awkward. Now I just have to go find her, because I need to tell her some juicy stuff. “ I think everything will be normal. And then when we get on the court. Until then, we’re the same girls as always.” As for her demolition of Kasatkina, the 14th seed, she realised what she had to do from the first ball, and that was to nullify her opponent’s brilliance. “I knew I had to come out and keep swinging,” she said. “Sometimes I start well and sometimes a little sluggish. I knew I needed to keep swinging no matter what, even if it was very close. When I got my opportunity at 4-3 to break, I was like, It’s go time.” Keys had to work harder for her win and said later, “I was down a break in the first so, to be able to get that back and play a lot better after that, was really great.” She said she drew on previous battles here to maintain her composure under pressure. “Being down a set point against [Naomi] Osaka the other day and being able to win that point in the tie-breaker, those are the moments where you feel, like, you get through it, and that just helps you later in the tournament.” She confirmed rumours, also, that her coaching arrangement with Lindsay Davenport had changed. “She’s no longer going to be ‘the’ head coach, but I will always have a relationship with Lindsay. And whenever she’s at a tournament, she will be around and be helping out. And there’s still going to be weeks where she’s going to be there.” And as for her ongoing rivalry with Stephens, she is comfortable with the prospect of being thrown into matches with her on a serial basis. “We don’t really have boundaries. I don’t think that’s going to change. That’s never really stopped us before, so I don’t think we’re going to have that issue. That would just be weird and awkward. Before every match, no matter who the opponent is, I’m trying to get used to how they play. I lost to Sloane at the US Open, but I feel on clay it’s a little bit of a different match-up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/coombeshead-farm-cornwall-restaurant-review-grace-dent","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T12:00:10Z","webTitle":"Coombeshead Farm, Cornwall – restaurant review | Grace Dent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/coombeshead-farm-cornwall-restaurant-review-grace-dent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/08/coombeshead-farm-cornwall-restaurant-review-grace-dent","fields":{"headline":"Coombeshead Farm, Lewannick, Cornwall: ‘I shed a tear when I left’ – restaurant review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When the spiritual teacher Heather Small from M People sang of One Night in Heaven, she demonstrated, I feel, that “heaven”, if we reach it, is a subjective concept. She indicated that it would be a place of romantic bliss, orbiting like a “love satellite”. For me, though, heaven would look and feel a lot like one neverending overnight stay at Coombeshead Farm in north Cornwall: a self-sufficient, gaspingly tasteful, food-forward, wunderkind-chef-led passion project set in 60 acres of rolling, remote British rural splendour. For me, it’s our answer to Fäviken in northern Sweden or Dan Barber’s Blue Hill Farm in the Pocantico Hills, New York. This five-bedroom B&amp;B is a place to pull out of the bag when you need to save your marriage, because not only is it exclusive and exquisite, but both of you will have to be so much on your best behaviour in the communal drawing rooms, while eating ornate, wafer-thin Stithians cheese tart amuses bouches with the other eight guests, that you’ll remember why you fell in love in the first place. My heaven, where I will go for my good deeds in keeping your hearts alive with mirth and joy, will be waking eternally in pristine, quality bed-linen, with no phone signal – ergo no deadlines – to the smell of fresh, plump, Aga-hewn sticky lardy cakes and exemplary sourdough served with homemade rhubarb compote. A place where I can float through the working farmyard like a rested Sleeping Beauty, festooned in birdsong and sunlight. But this is not agriculture as I know it from my northern childhood, full of shit, death, afterbirth and inbred young men on quad bikes looking for a fox den to dig up. No, in my heaven – as it is at Coombeshead – all the unseemly bits of land management will take place out of my eyeline, and I will instead snack on polytunnel sunflowers dipped in fresh curds, be at one with the piglets, geese and bees, and my soul will feel as if it’s just had a bloody good jetwash, much like Coombeshead’s yard. I felt all of these emotions, and even weirder ones, for every breathing moment of my 17 hours as an inmate ... sorry, guest. I certainly remember shedding a bizarre and quite unexpected involuntary tear when I left. In fact, the more I think about it, I’m not entirely sure that Tom Adams hasn’t started a cult. You arrive around 4pm, but there is no reception desk. Tom, or someone else lovely, will wander over to your car, lure you into the kitchen, fix you a drink and show you your room, which will make Babington House feel gauche. Tom will waft an arm across the vast honesty bar, then tell you that pre-dinner snacks will begin around 6.30pm. On the May evening we ate there, dinner, served in an adjoining barn, and no longer communally and B&amp;Bers-only, as it was in the operation’s early days, started with said sourdough with Guernsey butter, a robust, no-holds-barred porky “country” terrine, a skewered lamb kidney with paprika and a plate of faultless green asparagus made devilish with brown butter. A whopping Looe diver scallop appeared in a seafaring, kelp-laden broth. We ate alongside Californians who had made a 600-mile detour from Europe, bankers and bespoke furniture makers. If the night had been written by Agatha Christie, one of us would have disappeared after every plate of fermented vegetables, puffed breads, cured pork belly or paper-thin fennel, each time leaving one foodie fewer to muse over Noma’s new summer vegetarian menu, until there were none. The main event was Waterloo Farm lamb with spring onion and wild garlic, or ramsons, as they call it at Coombeshead. Or weeds, as some readers would probably call it while wondering where the potatoes to go with the lamb were, or the carrots, red cabbage or mint sauce for that matter. But Coombeshead is not for that type of person. Even so, those people would adore the breakfast here. Yes, it is served communally. And yes, you do have to talk to other people about your day’s plans. But while the cooked breakfast of the freshest eggs, griddled home-cured pork belly bacon and sausage is prepared, the table just off the kitchen heaves with homemade bircher muesli, hazelnut granola, warm breads, and an embarrassment of gut-healing kombuchas and fruit smoothies. After breakfast, you will wander the farm’s many acres in a jocund manner, pointing at pleasant views, snuffling pigs and bumptious cockerels. You will pay your bill, hug people goodbye and go back to the real world. Your hire car will smell a little of sick and old Costa cups. The real world will feel cold, unkempt and distinctly non-heavenly. • Coombeshead Farm Lewannick, Launceston, Cornwall; 01566 782 009. Open dinner 7pm Thurs-Sun; 1pm Sun lunch.

Why was it even considered that the majestic concrete battleship that is Preston bus station might be demolished? Yet it was, a few years back, to make way for a proposed shopping centre of uncertain viability. Central government, in the face of prolonged and well-made arguments for its listing, hedged and prevaricated until deciding in 2013 that, yes, it was worthy of protection. Now, as its renovation is completed, it’s plain that the bus station deserves to stand alongside the other robust civic masonry that Preston, like many industrial cities, boasts: the neo-Greek Harris Museum and Art Gallery; the Edwardian baroque Sessions House. It’s also again clear (see, too, the Southbank Centre in London) that the listing of postwar architecture is the last, best defence of public space that the tattered planning system can provide. The signature of the bus station, which was completed in 1969 to the designs of the architecture company Building Design Partnership and the engineering firm Ove Arup, is its great long striated form, 190 metres of it, made of curved profiles to the parking decks above the ground-level terminal. These curves are, in truth, somewhat for effect, being add-ons to what could more easily have been a blunt square edge, but it is quite an effect. It’s simple and memorable, a statement that this mundane but vital building type – a bus station plus car park – could be a thing of pride. It reflects the ambition of its makers that a bus station could have the status of an airport. Like much magnificent architecture, it speaks of a future that never quite arrived: in this case it was expected that Preston’s population would double, as part of an expansion plan that didn’t materialise, but one that the station was intended both to serve and announce. Having made this grand gesture, the design devolves into unexpected shades of subtlety. The seeming monolith of the superstructure (actually made of multiple elements of precast concrete) levitates above a delicate and airy ground level in which play out subtle rhythms of repeating lines – glazing bars, pillars, tiling, benches, the concrete beams. Every eighth recess in the coffered ceiling contains fluorescent tubes, which adds another beat of light and shade. The building’s length is exploited, as on the exterior, this time to create halls that balance transition and repose, in which the sense of distance given by its deep perspective is offset by good proportions and a high ceiling – to put it less pretentiously, these are good spaces both for catching a bus and waiting for one. The functional decor is given a slightly luxurious quality by a black rubber Pirelli floor, by vertical slivers of yellow and the use of a tropical hardwood, iroko, for handrails and seating. There is also quality and durability in these finishes, which still do their job after 50 punishing years. Care was taken to make the ceramic wall tiles align and space them such that almost none needed to be cut. There are, finally, flourishes within the generally disciplined composition, with the flying car park ramps making playful doodles at the ends, along with curved, faintly art deco “satellite” structures. The bus station’s renovation is the work of Lancashire county council, which in 2014 relieved its former owner, Preston city council, of the worry of dealing with its brutalist treasure by buying it off them for £1. The council then decided to invest £35.3m, with the help of funds that might otherwise have gone into building a new station, into remodelling what they had, rearranging the traffic around it and building a “youth zone”, a sports and leisure, alongside. Where previously there were plazas for the buses on both sides of the building, the council decided to move them all to the side furthest from the city centre, creating a new pedestrianised area, which will make for a friendlier approach to the station than the system of subways that people were originally expected to use. The rearrangement also makes space for the youth zone, which had long been desired for the city but for which the council had had difficulty finding a site. The council took the bold and now rare step of choosing the architect by an open anonymous competition – in other words, one in which the quality of design counts for more than track record and reputation. At first, this approach didn’t have the desired effect. The winning architect John Puttick, who had only just set up his practice when he won, produced a proposal that was rightly slammed for the way in which the youth zone glommed on to the bus station. What was the point of keeping the bus station, it was asked, if its grand horizontals were interrupted by the new building? A change of brief and of design followed. The youth zone, due to be completed at the end of 2019, will now take a stepped, zinc-clad shape that, while having a presence of its own, will stand apart from its neighbour. Puttick’s work on the new building, carried out with the close attention of the Twentieth Century Society, is tactful and commonsensical, recycling the iroko as necessary to make new benches and sills, tidying up the signage, using the original typography in new ways, improving the lighting by returning to something like the original scheme. Some things are necessarily different. At some point in its life the concrete of the curved bands was painted white, which means it’s impossible to return to its original raw state, so it has simply been refreshed. The right notes are sometimes missed, as with some new seating bought off the peg and the details of a new glazed screen. But the overwhelming feeling is of a public facility which, if it were created new now, would have little of the same dignity. The generosity of the volumes, the precision of the detail and the quality of the surfaces would all be squeezed out by value engineering. So too would those superfluous curves. The intent of the architects, essential to achieving the building’s balance of heft and lightness and the coherence of its composition, would be crowded out by other consultancies. Every spare space would be invaded by retail opportunities. Perhaps the most telling detail is in the signs at the bus stands. The many companies who now operate the lines in and out of Preston wanted these to carry their competing garish graphics. The council insisted that they should simply give the routes’ destinations and numbers. So while the buses themselves look, in their violent liveries, like a confectionery display at a supermarket checkout, the information on the building is all that the user needs to know – what goes where, not the financial coagulations that extract the profit. The photographer Martin Parr, who published books of his collections of Boring Postcards, included one of Preston bus station. “Largest in Britain”, it said proudly, beneath an image in which double-deckers in uniform municipal blue placidly circulate around the mothership. There is indeed something quaint about the postcard, which would be why Parr put it in his book. But the grace and power of this structure is considerably less boring than the commercial miasma that now engulfs most centres of public transport."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/28/world-cup-quiz-england-team-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-28T09:12:15Z","webTitle":"Quiz: England at the World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/28/world-cup-quiz-england-team-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/28/world-cup-quiz-england-team-football","fields":{"headline":"Quiz: England at the World Cup","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/09/saturdays-best-tv-germaine-bloody-greer-hidden","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: Germaine Bloody Greer; Hidden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/09/saturdays-best-tv-germaine-bloody-greer-hidden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/09/saturdays-best-tv-germaine-bloody-greer-hidden","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: Germaine Bloody Greer; Hidden","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Germaine Bloody Greer 9pm, BBC Two Perhaps the presence of this in the TV schedules can explain Greer’s controversy-courting recent behaviour (such as telling the Hay festival that most rape is just “bad sex”)?

Plus, it only stays closed when the trousers are zipped and buttoned. Tricky all round. I don’t know what to say. That’s OK. Sometimes there is nothing to say. I mean, I lived through puffball skirts and everything, but this … I know. It even puts those “invisible jeans” jeans in the shade, and those were just a few strings of denim hanging around your arse. Not to mention Sock Crocs. And bumbag sliders. And those Loewe trainers that have turned-up toes, as if for a marathon-running medieval jester. Who is making the crotch pocket trousers? Gu, a brand owned by the same people who own Uniqlo. But Uniqlo is so sensible! So useful! It has obviously got to them. I’m going to go and lie down now. I think you should.

Trevor Noah Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah addressed the president’s announcement that the planned summit between the US and North Korea would be taking place, just weeks after it was formally cancelled. “In general, I’m not a big fan of President Trump,” Noah said. “But the one area where I’m rooting for him is with North Korea. I want him to win that Nobel peace prize, mostly just to see him bite into it because he thinks it’s chocolate.” The host then showed news coverage of the run-up to the summit, which Trump has reportedly coined as a “getting-to-know-you meeting, plus”. Noah replied: “What? A ‘getting-to-know-you meeting, plus’? Plus what? Plus onion rings? Or plus a plan to shut down North Korea’s nuclear program? Maybe he means plus an NDA, because that’s usually how he gets to know someone. “Still,” Noah continued, “the summit is officially back on. Don’t get too excited yet. If anything, I think we should treat this like the Roseanne reboot. Sure, it’s on now. But it’s only one 3am tweet away from getting cancelled again. “For now, we can enjoy how North Korea got back on the president’s good side,” Noah said, showing news coverage of the vice-chairman of North Korea’s ruling party, Kim Yong-chol, delivering a letter to the White House, making him the first North Korean official to visit in 20 years. “Look at how excited he is about his giant envelope. “So, what did that letter say that convinced Trump to resume denuclearization talks with North Korea?” the host wondered. “Well, that’s what reporters outside the White House wanted to know.” When asked about the “flavor” of the letter, Trump told reporters it was a “very nice” and “very interesting” letter. Several minutes later, though, Trump said he purposely hadn’t yet opened the letter. “There are times when I understand why Trump lies because it’s about something important, like this is the biggest tax cut in history, or no collusion, or my wife hasn’t left me,” Noah said. “But going from the letter is interesting and great to I haven’t read it in under 10 minutes: that’s just wasting a lie.” He added: “It’s like getting to ask God one question and going: ‘Wasssuuuuupppp?’” Stephen Colbert “Today is Donald Trump’s 500th day in office,” Stephen Colbert began. “Which means, congratulations, we have made it through the first trimester of his presidency.” “But for some reason, my nausea hasn’t gone away,” Colbert continued. “You know what else isn’t going away? The Mueller investigation, no matter how hard Trump tries.” The host then read aloud a tweet Trump sent on Monday morning: “As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?” “I love riddles,” Colbert joked. “I know this one. It’s because if you bring the grain over the river first, the fox will collude with the Russians to get the chicken.” The host proceeded to share the memo, acquired by the New York Times, sent by Trump’s legal defense team to special counsel Robert Mueller, claiming Trump “could, if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired”. “In the memo, Trump’s lawyers also argue that the president shouldn’t have to sit down for an interview with Mueller, because having him testify demeans the office of the president before the world,” Colbert explained. “Adding, now if you’ll excuse us, the president has to go get spanked by a porn star while watching his shark stories.” Trump’s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, defended the president’s power to pardon himself in a television interview with Chuck Todd, Colbert noted. Giuliani added, though: “It’s not going to happen, so it’s a hypothetical point.” Colbert continued: “He has a point. There is nothing in the constitution that stops him. After all, it says in article II, section 2: ‘The president shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons’ … which I guess, hypothetically, includes … himself?” Jimmy Kimmel Finally, Jimmy Kimmel briefly remarked on Trump’s 500th day in office. “Today, in case you didn’t know, is a bigly day for our president,” he said. “Today is Donald Trump’s 500th day in office which, I have to say, it feels like only yesterday that it was Trump’s 1,000th day in office.” Kimmel added: “Tonight will mark Trump’s 500th night of getting Cheese Whiz all over the Lincoln bedspread.” “The president congratulated himself on Twitter today,” the host noted, reading his tweet aloud. “This is my 500th. Day in Office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any President in his first 500 days. Massive Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts, Military &amp; Vets, Lower Crime &amp; Illegal Immigration, Stronger Borders, Judgeships, Best Economy &amp; Jobs EVER, and much more …” “Donald JLo Trump has accomplished so much in his interminably short 500 days, so we thought it fitting to celebrate all his many accomplishments tonight,” Kimmel said, before showing a video of Trump’s time on the golf course while in office. “Happy 500, Mr President. I’ll see you on the back nine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/05/fifa-files-criminal-complaint-against-ticket-site-viagogo-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T14:11:46Z","webTitle":"Fifa files criminal complaint against ticket site Viagogo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/05/fifa-files-criminal-complaint-against-ticket-site-viagogo-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/05/fifa-files-criminal-complaint-against-ticket-site-viagogo-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Fifa files criminal complaint against ticket site Viagogo","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fifa has filed a criminal complaint in Switzerland against the ticket website Viagogo as part of a crackdown on unauthorised World Cup sales. The move by football’s world governing body, shortly after an undercover investigation by the Guardian revealed Viagogo’s involvement in the illegal resale of football tickets in the UK, represents the latest in a line of legal challenges to the company’s business practices. Last week, a UK government minister urged consumers to boycott Viagogo as National Trading Standards launched an investigation into allegations that it has persistently misled consumers, while the Competition and Markets Authority has separately threatened the company with court action. In the run-up to the tournament in Russia this summer, Fifa said it had “received numerous complaints from individuals, consumer protection bodies and other market players over the opaque and deceptive business conduct of Viagogo AG”. The governing body said its website was the only official and legitimate seller of World Cup tickets, and any bought through Viagogo would be cancelled once identified. However, on Tuesday, Viagogo’s Swiss website was selling tickets for more than 50 of the matches, including the first three England games against Tunisia, Panama and Belgium. Prices for England’s opening Group G match against Tunisia, at the Volgograd arena on 18 June, range from £55 to £124 a ticket, according to Viagogo. For the match against Belgium in Kaliningrad on 28 June, tickets are priced at up to £377 each, while for the final in Moscow on 15 July, the site is offering category one tickets for up to £3,317 each. However, while the listings can be viewed and the prices are given in sterling, UK-based fans appear to be currently unable to buy World Cup tickets via the website. A message to would-be purchasers states: “We are sorry, the page you are trying to access is not available to customers in your country.” The site added that “prices are set by sellers and may be below or above face value”. As part of its efforts to protect fans, Fifa said it had this week filed a criminal complaint against Viagogo with the public prosecutor’s office in Geneva, “based on a breach of the law on unfair competition”. The governing body said it decided to take action “after aligning with other stakeholders that have already filed criminal complaints … due to the company’s unfair business practices”. “Tickets purchased via unauthorised distribution channels, including all tickets purchased through Viagogo AG, will be cancelled once identified. Fifa reserves the right to refuse entry to the stadium to any holder of such tickets,” Fifa added. Strict admission checks would be carried out, it said. While it is a major player in the UK ticket resale industry, the company, which has been no stranger to controversy over its business practices, has an address in Geneva. In 2016, European football’s governing body, Uefa, also filed a criminal complaint against Viagogo over illegal ticket sales at Euro 2016, prompting a raid by French police on a hotel where the company’s agents were handing out tickets. Viagogo did not comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/05/sheffield-council-leader-backs-case-against-tree-protesters-court-told","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T12:45:53Z","webTitle":"Sheffield council leader backs case against tree protesters, court told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/sheffield-council-leader-backs-case-against-tree-protesters-court-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/sheffield-council-leader-backs-case-against-tree-protesters-court-told","fields":{"headline":"Sheffield council leader backs case against tree protesters, court told","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Tree protesters in Sheffield are being taken to court on the orders of the council leader, a judge has heard. Labour’s Julie Dore, the leader since 2011, “positively agreed” with legal action against four Sheffield residents who were charged after demonstrating against plans to fell up to 17,000 trees, Sheffield high court heard. Paul Brooke, Simon Crump, Benoit Benz Cumpin and Fran Grace could be sent to prison if they are found to have breached an injunction during protests in December and January. Before the hearing began, the judge, Mr Justice Males, asked the council’s barrister to confirm that the case was being brought with the blessing of the council leader. “This is a serious application. The council seeks to commit Sheffield citizens to prison for contempt,” said Males. He noted that judges, “like everybody else”, read newspapers and that he had read of a “moratorium” on tree felling, under which the chainsaws had fallen silent since March. He said: “I would just like to be reassured that this application is brought on the instructions of democratically elected councillors. Do you have the instructions from the leader of the council to make this application?” After a short adjournment, Yaaser Vanderman, the council’s barrister, said he had been assured that Dore “positively agreed that proceedings should be brought”. Dore has only rarely spoken out about trees in recent months, and earlier in the year was filmed driving away from a BBC reporter, refusing to answer questions. In May’s council elections in Sheffield, Labour lost two seats to each of the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, and councillors accepted the tree saga had cost them votes in leafy areas. If found guilty of the breach, the four protesters could be jailed or, more likely, could face a large legal bill. Last year another protester, Calvin Payne, was found to have breached an injunction not to enter a “safety zone” around trees earmarked for the chop, and to have incited others on Facebook to follow his lead. He was given a suspended sentence and told to pay the council’s £16,000 legal costs, after the local authority instructed a prominent QC for a one-day hearing. Local celebrities including Jarvis Cocker helped crowdfund the legal fees for Payne and another protester, who was handed an £11,000 bill for spending 10 minutes in a tree safety zone. In August the city council obtained an injunction to stop protesters taking direct action against the felling of trees as part of a £2.2bn PFI deal to maintain Sheffield’s roads and pavements. The council says its outsourcing company, Amey, removes trees only if they are “dangerous, dying, diseased, dead, damaging or discriminatory” – meaning they damage pavements and potentially obstruct disabled residents. But protesters accuse Amey of chopping down healthy trees because they are more costly and difficult to maintain than young saplings. The environment minister, Michael Gove, has described the tree-felling programme as “bonkers”. Two of the defendants in court on Tuesday – Brooke and Crump – had previously avoided legal sanctions after promising a judge they would not break the injunction. Before the hearing, Laraine Manley, an executive director at Sheffield council, said: “Despite a high court injunction being in place to allow work on some street trees to continue safely, four more people have breached this ruling and are now facing court action. In addition, two of the individuals had previously signed an undertaking not to breach the injunction order. “It is totally regrettable that we are in this position once again, but breaching the injunction is breaking the law, and we ask that people respect the high court judge’s ruling by remaining outside of our safety barriers.” The court also heard that the “ultimate decision” to take the protesters to court was made by Gillian Duckworth, the council’s head of legal, a non-elected position. But Vanderman said Duckworth consulted Dore and “relevant council members” and “took their views into account”. Yet last week on BBC Radio Sheffield, Dore’s council colleague Lewis Dagnall, the new cabinet member for environment, said he was “insulated from the legal process” and had no power to stop the cases being brought to court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/08/public-sector-pension-funds-put-millions-in-tax-haven-linked-pfis","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Public sector pension funds put millions in tax haven-linked PFIs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/08/public-sector-pension-funds-put-millions-in-tax-haven-linked-pfis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/08/public-sector-pension-funds-put-millions-in-tax-haven-linked-pfis","fields":{"headline":"Public sector pension funds put millions in tax haven-linked PFIs","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Public sector pension funds have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in Scottish private finance schemes linked to offshore tax havens, a new report has found. The pension funds, which act for tens of thousands of retired council workers, bus drivers and Environment Agency officials and scientists, have invested money in dozens of privately financed projects in Scotland to build new schools, hospitals and colleges and to make motorway improvements. An analysis of these projects for the Guardian has traced nearly 30% of the investments in the schemes to companies based in tax havens such as the Channel Islands, Dubai, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg and Cyprus. In all, the analysis showed, those offshore companies stand to earn more than £1.7bn from these contracts over the next 25-30 years, charging interest rates as high as 13% for their financing. The pension funds earn substantial returns too: one of the UK’s largest, Strathclyde Pension Fund, said last year its investments were “performing in excess of expectations” with their value growing by 12.5%. The report was commissioned by the Guardian and the Ferret news website from Dexter Whitfield, a specialist in private finance initiative (PFI) schemes with the European Services Strategy Unit and an associate professor at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. Whitfield analysed the ownership and investments of 47 Scottish projects overseen by the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT), an agency launched 10 years ago by the then first minister Alex Salmond, to provide new hospitals, health centres, colleges, schools and roads. Mirroring the private finance initiative set up by the Conservative government in the mid-1990s, private companies are contracted to construct public buildings with debt finance which is paid off by the taxpayer over decades. Private companies also control maintenance of the building for up to 30 years, charging commercial fees for their work. Maintenance contractors at a new psychiatric hospital in Edinburgh built under the SFT programme charge the NHS £33 an hour for an electrician, plus VAT and overhead fees. Salmond insisted the SFT model would be cheaper than the previous system by capping debt interest payments, and would include some level of public ownership. Critics argue the model costs governments more over the long term than using cheaper public borrowing and the operations are less transparent than publicly run schemes. Scottish government data shows the 47 schemes overseen by the SFT were built for a total cost of £2.7bn but will cost taxpayers nearly £8bn by the time the borrowing needed to finance their construction is paid off and their maintenance contracts finish in 25 or 30 years time. Whitfield’s analysis also shows offshore investments and shares in these projects are spread across 60% of these schemes. Only a small fraction of the shares and ownership of those 47 projects, equivalent to about 16% of their total lifetime costs, is from firms based in Scotland. The PFI investments cited by the research include Ayrshire College in Kilmarnock, which is 100%-owned by a 3i Infrastructure based in Jersey. It will cost £48.5m to build but the full contract will cost taxpayers £141m by the time it ends in 2042. There is also a substantial amount of offshore involvement in projects such as Dumfries acute services hospital and motorway improvements for the M8, M73 and M74. The research found 14 council-run pension funds in England and Scotland, and the Environment Agency based in Bristol, have each invested in a range of funds run by a London-registered firm called Equitix Holdings Ltd which is ultimately 85%-owned by Tetragon Financial Group. Some Equitix funds are specific to SFT projects; others cover PFI projects around the UK. Tetragon Financial Group is registered in Guernsey via a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, tax jurisdictions rated among the 10 most secret by the Tax Justice Network campaign group. It made $168m (£125m) in profit last year but was not required to pay UK corporation tax. Such firms base themselves in low tax countries entirely legally. A source close to Tetragon said all the Equitix companies registered in London paid the tax due to the UK Treasury, and said UK based investors would pay their relevant taxes. But she refused to discuss the tax status of their ultimate owner or confirm its registered office was in Guernsey. Tetragon’s annual report states: “Investors may suffer adverse tax consequences if Tetragon is treated as resident in the United Kingdom or the United States for tax purposes.” The public investments in these Equitix funds include: £80m by Strathclyde Pension Fund; more than £71m by Lothian and Lothian Buses Pension Funds; £51m by East Riding council; and £26m by Croydon council. The councils involved say their pension funds are legally required by the UK and Scottish governments to maximise their returns, by finding the best investments and to ensure they can meet all future pension obligations without needing bailouts by tax payers. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents the 11 English councils which invest in these SFT projects, said a pension fund’s first duty was to meet all future pension obligations without needing bailouts by taxpayers. “Other matters such as the environmental, social or corporate governance impact of individual investment decisions should be considered but should also not result in a material reduction in return and have the support of scheme members,” the LGA said. The Scottish government admitted that “diverse international holdings”, including offshore companies, were a feature of the investment market. The SFT programme had supported 5,355 construction jobs with 77% of contracts awarded to Scottish firms, while leaving the financial risk with private firms instead of public bodies, it said. “The [SFT] programme has enabled investment in schools, hospitals and other projects to be brought forward more quickly than would otherwise have been possible with limited UK government capital funding and restrictions on borrowing,” a spokesman said. “[It] transfers risks and exerts private sector discipline during the construction phase of a project and throughout its lifetime without the excessive private sector profits associated with past PFI projects.” Whitfield said privately financed projects were inherently flawed because they lacked the higher transparency and accountability used in the public sector. “The use of offshore tax havens significantly further reduces transparency and democratic accountability,” he added. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s finance spokeswoman, said Whitfield’s analysis presented a compelling case for Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National party (SNP), Salmond’s successor as first minister, to review the SFT and consider a buyout by the government of as many PFI contracts as possible. “This report exposes the staggering hypocrisy of the SNP, who spent years campaigning against PFI only to set up a system that has enabled corporations headquartered in tax havens to own and profit from infrastructure, such as our roads, schools and hospitals,” Baillie said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/05/crystal-palace-threatened-with-being-dissolved-over-late-accounts","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T11:44:21Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace threatened with being dissolved over late accounts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/05/crystal-palace-threatened-with-being-dissolved-over-late-accounts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/05/crystal-palace-threatened-with-being-dissolved-over-late-accounts","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace threatened with being dissolved over late accounts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Crystal Palace have been threatened with being dissolved and struck off the companies register for being more than two months late filing their annual accounts for last year. The accounts detailing the financial position of the Premier League club in 2016-17 were due by law to be sent to Companies House by 31 March but the official register is highlighting that they have still not been filed. On Tuesday the Registrar of Companies issued a notice to the company which owns and runs Crystal Palace, CPFC 2010 Ltd, that it will be “struck off the register and the company will be dissolved” in two months “unless cause is shown to the contrary”. That is understood to mean the company will be struck off and legally cease to exist unless it files by then. All limited companies must by law file accounts to Companies House within nine months of the end of their designated financial year. CPFC 2010 Ltd has a year end of 30 June, so the accounts for last year, the club’s fourth season since winning promotion in 2013, were due by 31 March. Failure to file accounts can often be a sign that a company is in financial difficulties, having problems in its own administration, or that the accountants auditing the books have raised concerns which the company’s directors have not resolved to the auditors’ satisfaction. Palace representatives have told the Guardian since early April that there are no such issues and that the accounts were due to be filed imminently with Companies House. The penalties for failing to file accounts are not severe unless the delay becomes extensive. A fine of £150 is levied for a month’s delay, then £375 for between one and three months. The Palace representatives have not said whether the club has been fined. Palace are alone among Premier League clubs in being late filing. All other 19 clubs who were in the top flight in 2016-17 have had theirs published by Companies House, within good time. Most show healthy financial positions, 2016-17 having been the first year of the 2016‑19 record £8.4bn Premier League TV deals. The 2015-16 accounts for CPFC 2010 showed that Palace, who are owned by the chairman, Steve Parish, and two US financial investors, Joshua Harris and David Blitzer, made a £7m loss on turnover of £102m. Last year’s accounts are expected to show a pay-off for the manager who was sacked, Alan Pardew, but no indication or explanation has been given as to why the accounts have not been filed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/05/chris-grayling-railways-transport","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T11:29:47Z","webTitle":"If Chris Grayling can’t sort out the railways, what’s the point of him? | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/05/chris-grayling-railways-transport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/05/chris-grayling-railways-transport","fields":{"headline":"If Chris Grayling can’t sort out the railways, what’s the point of him?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We are sorry to announce that Chris Grayling has not been cancelled. This service will continue running for some time yet, regardless of disruption to your journey, although the government does apologise for any inconvenience caused. That was roughly the substance of the transport secretary’s statement to parliament on the mushrooming rail crisis – which, if nothing else, helped to explain the Whitehall mutterings that any minister following Grayling into a department can expect to spend a fair while sorting out the mess. The Ministry of Justice is still grappling with the legacy of his three years there, including legal aid cuts that have recently brought barristers out on strike. Anyone using the Northern or Govia Thameslink rail lines, meanwhile, will know just how well his current brief is going. The Commons heard this week of children in tears at stations because cancellations meant they couldn’t get to school (remember, this is exam season), and adults fearing for their jobs because they can’t physically get to work, or get back in time to collect the kids from nursery. Yet somehow Grayling lurches on, towards an issue that has defeated wilier transport secretaries than him for over a decade: expanding Heathrow. Never forget that he is both a Brexiteer, one of those whose declining political stock perked up instantly after the EU referendum, and Theresa May’s old campaign manager when she ran for the leadership. The politics of Brexit suggest he’s unsackable at least until the prime minister has struggled through the EU withdrawal bill process (and associated threats to her tenure), even as the laws of electoral physics suggest he should go. And so he serves as a handy reminder of everything that’s hamstringing this government: too many people in high office for the wrong reasons, a perceived tin ear for northern England, and a not unrelated fatal inability to deliver on the central promise of May’s premiership. She said she’d stand for the forgotten places and people, those overlooked by fancy London elites. Two years on, and people in Burnley and Bolton and Blackpool can’t get to work, journeys from Hull across the Pennines are apparently taking longer than before the new “improved” timetable, and the government gives the unfortunate impression of having launched itself into ineffectual action only when the furious commuters of Hertfordshire and Kent started emailing their Conservative MPs. Grayling’s resignation alone will not solve the wider problems all this exposes. For most people, most of the time, politics forms at best an irritating background hum in life. But there’s nothing like hours of stewing on an overcrowded platform, panicking about what the boss will say if you’re late again, to remind people of its existence. That much was evident all the way down the line from south London to Brighton and the south coast back in 2016, where a long-running dispute between drivers and management on the Southern line exposed a hidden economic precariousness. People priced out of London property over the last decade have coped by moving further and further out into the shires, banking on still being able to reach the big city fairly easily for work. But during the stoppages they were stranded, and even those not directly affected began to realise just how much they relied on often unreliable trains. Rail was an issue at the 2017 election in marginal seats such as Amber Rudd’s Hastings and Rye; and a similar feeling that the government can’t even be trusted with the basics that make everyday life possible will now be growing in the commuter belt around Manchester and Liverpool. This fiasco doesn’t, in theory, make a particularly strong case for re-nationalising the railways; Network Rail is an arm’s length public sector body, but it’s hardly emerged covered in glory, accused as it is of failing to deliver all necessary infrastructure upgrades before new timetables came in last month. But in practice the chaos is absolutely feeding Labour’s argument that the railways should be under direct political control; as voters hear Grayling wailing – much as he did during the Southern dispute – that there isn’t really much he personally can do to sort this out, they naturally enough wonder what’s the point of him then. Sweeping up after this particular mess, in short, will require one hell of a dustpan and brush. • Gaby Hinsliff is a regular Guardian contributor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/05/europes-mental-health-institutions-uniformly-substandard-says-who","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T22:01:56Z","webTitle":"Europe's mental health institutions uniformly substandard, says WHO","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/05/europes-mental-health-institutions-uniformly-substandard-says-who","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/05/europes-mental-health-institutions-uniformly-substandard-says-who","fields":{"headline":"Europe's mental health institutions uniformly substandard, says WHO","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Mental health institutions in Europe are failing to safeguard residents’ human rights, with many described as shocking by experts who have found not one institution among 75 visited across the continent fully met all of the standards set by the United Nations. While some institutions took care to train staff to deal with crises, create individual recovery plans and provide access to legal support, others failed to even partially meet such standards. The findings are part of a broader report, produced by the World Health Organisation (WHO), with the assessment of institutions such as mental hospitals and social care homes covering 25 countries across Europe. It notes instances of patients sleeping on floors, bedbug infestations, lack of toilet paper and broken windows with many facilities not even having toilet doors and shower screens or curtains. In addition, most did not offer patients any form of occupation. “Residents often had literally nothing to do and were not given opportunities for learning or training in skills that might provide them with an occupation,” the authors write. The report also reveals that most institutions restricted patients’ communication with people outside its walls – for example only allowing them to contact family, or allowing communication only at certain times. “Furthermore, only a few institutions respected service users’ right to privacy in communications,” the authors note, adding that at most institutions patients where not free to roam. And while in general staff were found to treat patients well, neglect, isolation and even sexual abuse of female patients was found in some institutions – with one reportedly conducting forced abortions of resulting pregnancies. What’s more, the authors note that most institutions did not help to rehabilitate patients into the community, with staff often seeing institutions as a permanent step for patients due to factors including a lack of community supported-housing. Daniel Chisholm, head of the WHO’s mental health programme and a co-author of the report, said the findings were shocking, although not surprising. “This is well known as a long-standing problem,” he said. When asked whether the attitude within institutions was to admit patients and forget about them, Chisholm said: “In the worst case you can say that is true.” Teams of trained assessors were sent to 75 mental institutions across 25 countries and to examine whether they were meeting the standards set out by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The UK did not take part in the study. However, the Care Quality Commission last year criticised mental health care providers for what it called “outdated and sometimes institutionalised care” for large numbers of patients. Each assessment involved rating 25 standards across five main areas, including the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to enjoy the highest achievable standard of physical and mental health, and freedom from torture, abuse and punishment. The results reveal that while some institutions met or partially met standards across the board, others had not made any attempt to put certain standards in place. Only 28% of the 2,450 ratings made by the teams of assessors were classed as achieving a standard in full. “The implication is that countries who have signed up to the UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities are not fully meeting the requirements of that convention,” said Chisholm. The study had limitations, including that institutions were not randomly selected, assessors differed from team to team, and that the governments themselves chose who assessed facilities. Dr James Kirkbride, a psychiatric epidemiologist at University College London, described the findings as a wake-up call: “It really is quite shocking that the level of care in some inpatient psychiatric settings in parts of Europe is so behind what we would expect a 21st century mental health care system to look like.” The Liberal Democrat MP and former health minister Norman Lamb said many of the report’s “dreadful findings” reflected situations founds in parts of the UK, including the use of physical restraint. “We are lacking a global movement to address the systematic violation of the basic rights of people with mental ill health which, as this report shows, is happening right across Europe,” he said, adding that the injustice extends beyond inadequate healthcare provision to other areas including legal rights.“The treatment of people with mental health problems as second-class citizens is a global scandal which demands a global response.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/10/scars-summer-dresses-and-the-healing-touch","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"Scars, summer dresses and the healing touch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/10/scars-summer-dresses-and-the-healing-touch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/10/scars-summer-dresses-and-the-healing-touch","fields":{"headline":"Scars, summer dresses and the healing touch","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Darker skin scars more easily.

There’s the stamp of pain on my bum cheek from when I was adamantly instructing an ex-boyfriend to steam a creased dress I was wearing at the time. More recently, it’s the dot to dot of mosquito bites from a fantastical work trip to Lebanon and a great big, annoying scrape on my left knee!

With its Easy Boarding, Biria has tackled the tricky problem of the top crossbar. By replacing this with a U-shaped frame, Biria has created a bike that can be used by anyone who finds it difficult to mount a standard cycle. Kevin Watkins of Southsea Cycles, for instance, says that more than half the bikes he has sold have been to people living with MS, while other customers have included riders who have had hip replacements. And extra exercise brings health benefits and pleasure for all. The bike is robust, easy-to-use and comfortable.

The charity Electrical Safety First (ESF) found that one in three UK consumers – about 18 million people – has mistakenly purchased a counterfeit electrical item online. They were led to believe that the product was genuine, only to find it was a knockoff item at risk of causing an electric shock or even a fire. Products found to have serious safety flaws range from large household appliances such as tumble dryers, to kettles, travel adaptors, hair straighteners and Kodi boxes, which allow users to stream content from apps and on-demand services. Millennials are most likely to fall victim to counterfeit scams, according to the new findings which show that about half of 25- to 34-year-olds have been conned into buying fake electrical goods online. In contrast the research found that less than 10% of people aged 55 or over have received a counterfeit item after shopping on e-commerce websites. Potentially dangerous electrical goods for sale were identified by ESF across a selection of e-commerce sites, including Amazon, Amazon Marketplace, eBay and Fruugo. Alarmingly, a number of goods advertised also matched items listed on its national product recall list. A Guardian investigation in April found that Amazon was rife with potentially dangerous counterfeits and other knockoff goods despite years of attempts to crackdown on mis-selling on its platform. Electrical Safety First is calling on e-commerce websites to strengthen their efforts in preventing the sale of counterfeit, substandard and recalled goods and to improve their regulation of third-party sellers to protect consumers. The Charity has written to Amazon UK, eBay UK, and Fruugo UK to highlight the problem of sellers advertising dangerous appliances on these websites. “We are appalled to discover how easy it is to buy dangerous electrical goods online” said Phil Buckle, chief executive of Electrical Safety First. “Our investigation uncovered appliances that were visibly sub-standards, counterfeit or even subject to a recall, with model numbers matching items on our product recall list. Latest figures show card spending on the internet totals £154bn per year, so it’s unsurprising that one in three have mistakenly bought a counterfeit online.” Amazon said in a statement: “All Marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don’t will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The products in question are no longer available.” It is understood that eBay has been working closely with ESF over the past couple of weeks and immediately removed any “hazardous listings” that were flagged up. It said in a statement:“We are fully committed to combatting the sale of counterfeit and potentially dangerous electrical goods and work closely with both manufacturers and regulatory authorities to quickly remove such items from our marketplace.”Dominic Allonby, chief executive of Fruugo, said: “We have strict criteria for inclusion of retailers into our marketplace which operates in 33 countries. We welcome the excellent work of bodies such as ESF and Fruugo has no hesitation in removing any retailers who continue to fail to comply with the relevant standards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/05/test-cricket-mark-lathwell-dom-bess","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T18:00:51Z","webTitle":"Bright lights of Test cricket reveal contrasting paths of Lathwell and Bess | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/05/test-cricket-mark-lathwell-dom-bess","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/05/test-cricket-mark-lathwell-dom-bess","fields":{"headline":"Bright lights of Test cricket reveal contrasting paths of Lathwell and Bess","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Some shots linger, so that years later you can still see their shape, hear their sound, when about everything else has faded. Mark Lathwell hit a lot of those in his early years. There’s one in particular his old team-mate Neil Burns can still see, from the summer of 1992. A pull off Courtney Walsh that “disappeared like a tracer bullet at head height through midwicket and blasted into the boundary boards”. Walsh laid waste to the counties in ’92; seven for 27, six for 42, six for 21, six for 33, seven for 38. But one morning in Taunton he was mastered by Lathwell, a 20-year-old kid in his first full season. Anyone who was around English cricket in the 1990s knows the bones of Lathwell’s story. What’s forgotten now, is just how good he was in those early seasons. “The wider cricket world was denied the chance to see what I, and several others, witnessed first-hand,” Burns wrote 20 years later. “He was touched by genius, and in the first half of 1993, he displayed it virtually every time he batted.” Back then, Marcus Trescothick was only the second best young batsman at the club. Lathwell had a talent, Trescothick wrote, “that sometimes left you speechless”. It wasn’t just the runs, but the way he made them. Burns remembers another game against Glamorgan, when Steve Watkin was tearing in. Lathwell made 70 out of 75 for three. At lunch Viv Richards said he’d pick him for Test cricket tomorrow. A month later, England did. But Test cricket wasn’t Lathwell’s game. Mike Atherton recalled how, in that first match, he told Lathwell: “Good luck, the crowd are rooting for you”, and Lathwell said back: “They won’t be in a minute when I’m on my way back.” Alec Stewart reckoned Lathwell “was the one England player of my era who I believe just didn’t want to be there”. Lathwell played two Tests against Australia, 25 years ago this summer, and was never picked again. Earlier that same year, in April, the Guardian sent David Foot along to Taunton to interview him. “Publicity bothers me, I simply can’t see why anyone should be interested,” Lathwell told Foot. “I’m not by nature outgoing. If I don’t know someone, I’m apt to go into the corner.” Stewart remembered that Lathwell “barely said a word” when he was with England, “despite all our efforts to involve him in conversations, we couldn’t drag anything out of him”. Burns always felt Lathwell would rather be “in his local, playing darts and chewing the fat”. And that was where Lathwell fetched up when he unexpectedly quit Somerset in 2001, after a year in which he’d scored eight fifties and two hundreds for the club. Back home, batting for Braunton in the Devon League. Which brings us round about to Devon’s latest Test cricketer, Dom Bess. Braunton is on the far coast from Sidmouth, where Bess played a lot of his club cricket, but the Besses and the Lathwells are two of the county’s cricket families, and their stories are intertwined. Dom’s three cousins still play for Sidmouth, Lathwell’s two sons have done for Bideford and Braunton. One of them came through the county’s under-13 team the season after Dom had moved on up a year. There’s a lot of “Lathwell b Bess” and “Bess c Lathwell” entries in the league’s scorebooks, and both names are engraved on the cup given each year to the county’s best young cricketer, though the dates are a generation apart. The real reason they are a pair, though, is that despite their living so close together, they seem so very far apart. Bess took to Test cricket like a fish to water, Lathwell like a fish to the bank. It seems unlikely that in 20 years’ time any of Dom Bess’s team-mates will be waxing about how breathtaking his talent was, will be talking about his deliveries the way Lathwell’s do his strokes. Even those who know him are unsure he’s got all the skills he will need to hold down his place in the Test team. But what he does have, everyone agrees, is the appetite for it. “The one thing we knew we were going to get from Dom was that character,” said Joe Root on Sunday. “He was padded up for 45 minutes on Saturday night, desperate to get out there as nightwatchman. That’s the sort of player he is.” Bess took up spin-bowling because, he says, he was a “porky” kid who didn’t want to run in for more than five or six strides. His approach to the game changed when he met Darren Veness, who was strength and conditioning coach at Somerset, and now works for Surrey. Veness says he taught him that “whilst talent is respected, it comes behind hard work and discipline”. He remembers Bess as a “very adept and understanding learner”, “not shy of graft, someone who is always looking for the angles, looking for the opportunities, looking for the ways to get ahead”. Bess seemed to relish every second of his two Tests against Pakistan. Which speaks to the differences between this England dressing room and the one Lathwell walked into back in 1993, yes, but also the contrasting characters of the two men, one so introverted, the other so extroverted. Cricket is a sport for all sorts, but the bright lights, the big stage, of the Test game aren’t for everyone. And like Veness says, talent only takes a player so far. Everyone who saw Lathwell play was left with a lot of regrets. Bess, you guess, is not going to have so many of those, whatever happens next."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2018/jun/12/10-best-surf-schools-in-world-portugal-hawaii-south-africa-norway","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T08:18:09Z","webTitle":"10 of the best surfing schools in the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jun/12/10-best-surf-schools-in-world-portugal-hawaii-south-africa-norway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jun/12/10-best-surf-schools-in-world-portugal-hawaii-south-africa-norway","fields":{"headline":"10 of the best surfing schools in the world","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lapoint Surf Camps, Portugal Surf camps provide a taste of the surfing lifestyle and include accommodation and transport, as well as social activities where you can meet other surfers.

Yet by his own account, before noon every Wednesday, wherever he is in the world, he still feels an icy chill – an instinctual reaction to the imminence of prime minister’s questions. On paper, PMQs should not hold such terror. The prime minister needs simply to show up in the House of Commons once a week and answer 40 minutes of questions from MPs, half from their own side and half from the other, including six from the opposition leader. But as this new study makes clear, the event has a significance far greater than its parts. It has the power to shift the prevailing political mood and the stock of each party leader, being the occasion for an instant collective judgment that hangs in the air of parliament until at least the following week. The fact that it happens so regularly should diminish its importance, but in practice, this only makes the pressure relentless. Harold Macmillan, who in 1961 became the first prime minister to face regular question sessions at fixed times, confessed in his retirement that he felt physically sick preparing for each “ordeal”. This was a man who had fought on the Somme. I have stood in at PMQs for Jeremy Corbyn on just four occasions, and it hasn’t yet traumatised me as much as it troubled Macmillan or Blair, but nothing can prepare you for the experience. Many people get anxious before speaking in public, but imagine speaking while 300 MPs screech and roar to put you off – shouts that prevent you from hearing yourself speak and which it would be unwise to try to make out. This book does the best job imaginable of putting you in the shoes of those who have faced that test, and by shining a light on this one aspect of our political life it succeeds in illuminating the whole. Ayesha Hazarika and Tom Hamilton draw on their first-hand experience of working with Ed Miliband and Harriet Harman, as well as on interviews with Blair, David Cameron, William Hague and George Osborne. They are clearly skilled interviewers, getting each subject to reveal much of themselves, from the unrepentant arrogance of Cameron to the brutal introspection of Miliband. And with the level of honesty that Osborne shows here, I was left itching to read his future autobiography. Osborne regrets misjudging the mood of the house at his first PMQs when he stood in for Cameron against Hilary Benn in 2015: “I made some nice remark about him but it was inappropriate because he’d raised some terrorism incident. And I knew the moment I said it.” Contrast this with Cameron’s outlook: seven years after the event he still doesn’t know what was wrong with telling Angela Eagle to “calm down, dear” during a heated exchange in 2011. “I don’t think it was particularly at Angela Eagle actually,” he mansplains to the authors. “I think I was referring to Ed Balls, but anyway the point is there was no mens rea, it was not sexist in intent, it was the funny line from Michael Winner.” I enjoyed the Tory voter who wrote to Theresa May praising her PMQs performances but urging her to chastise the MP behind her doing his “office work” – shuffling papers and making notes – rather than listening to the debate. The MP concerned rang the voter to explain that he was the one passing May her answers. But I shivered reading about the attempted ambushes of prime ministers that blew up in the faces of opposition leaders. Hazarika and Hamilton recall Miliband asking Cameron at the last PMQs before the 2015 election if he would rule out raising VAT. Cameron gave the one answer they weren’t prepared for, “Yes”, then challenged Miliband three times to rule out the prospect of a Labour government increasing national insurance contributions. Perhaps because of the pain of the memory, it is one of the few key PMQs moments when the authors do not simply let the transcript tell the tale. The VAT misfire jars all the more because of the astonishing effort that went into getting Miliband ready for each PMQs. The book reveals that preparations began almost as soon as the last session ended, involved vast numbers of people – and yet still he would go into the chamber every Wednesday asking whether his strategy and lines were right. If that seems like overkill for the official opposition, what the book exposes about preparations inside government is equally worrying, in terms of the sheer amount of time and energy involved in commissioning briefing across Whitehall, and taking the prime minister through it. The argument, made both by the authors and their interviewees, is that this is an essential part of Downing Street keeping an eye on what each department is up to, and nipping potential problems in the bud – an excellent concept in principle, but one that does not explain, for example, why the Windrush scandal went unaddressed so long. But just stirring up the argument is a triumph for the authors. Since 1961, PMQs has moved to the centre of our political life, and since its first televisation in 1989 and the more recent use of Facebook and Twitter to distribute key moments, its importance has increased inexorably. It is high time to have debates about whether its format, length, volume and – most vital – the amount of effort our leaders put into it are right for our age and good for our politics. I hope Hazarika and Hamilton have started that debate. Because as Blair tells them: “It was really important without being truly important, if you can see what I mean.” Yes, after reading this invaluable and enthralling book, I certainly can.

There are no frills, just Uys in black, on a stool, narrating his life story from 1940s Cape Town via a London education and back to a career mocking the apartheid regime in theatre and drag. It’s performed in a low-key style, but Uys is a capable raconteur with an eventful story that shines a light on social and political history across two continents. It will be most enjoyed by expat Afrikaners: several of the punchlines are in Uys’s native tongue; dewy-eyed memories of Springbok Radio elicit gurgles of recognition from compatriots in the crowd. You start to wonder whether these reminiscences of a sheltered white upbringing at 10 Homestead Way, Pinelands, are a bit too fond, as Uys recalls endless classical music recitals and sings paeans to his heroic Malay maid. But the childhood innocence – and ignorance – are soon punctured, and the second half recounts the actor and writer’s clashes with authority as, in situ at the radical Space theatre in Cape Town, he flouts one apartheid law after another. At points, particularly as the monologue extends deep into its second hour, one craves dramatic structure, or some sense of where this monologue is going. Finally, its heroes – besides Uys himself – are his beloved mother, an exiled German-Jewish pianist, and his charismatic but disciplinarian Afrikaner dad. The former’s suicide gives the show its most heartfelt moments. A long-distance friendship with Sophia Loren provides a rather improbable subplot. Uys ends his tale in 1994, when South Africa, blazing with hope, holds its first democratic election. A rueful aside acknowledges that those hopes have not been fulfilled. But recent history is not Uys’s territory here. Titled The Echo of a Noise, the show offers a privileged but engaged perspective on apartheid’s near half-century, from a performer who learned early to laugh at his own fears, and is still doing so. • At Soho theatre, London, until 16 June.

The test uses a beam of light to analyse the exhaust plume of a car as it passes and automatic number plate recognition to link the measurement to a specific model. More than 370,000 such measurements taken in the UK, France and other countries have been compiled into new rating system called The Real Urban Emissions Initiative (True) and made available to the public on Wednesday. Volkswagen was exposed as cheating emissions tests in September 2015. But, without breaking the letter of the law, almost all car manufacturers were producing diesels that emitted far more in real-world driving conditions than in official lab-based tests. This was done by optimising vehicles to pass standardised tests, but the beam test is conducted as cars pass and so cannot be manipulated. The True analysis shows that new diesel models released in 2016 were still on average five over times above the EU’s official baseline limit of 0.08mg of nitrogen oxides (NOx) per kilometre. The 2017 models were a little cleaner, but still nearly four times over. NOx pollution is at illegally high levels in numerous EU nations. It is estimated to cause 23,500 early deaths a year in the UK, where government plans to cut pollution have been repeatedly ruled so inadequate as to be illegal. Separate research published on Wednesday calculates that diesel cars and vans, which make up less than half the UK’s fleet, cause 88% of the health damage from light vehicles. The beam tests are continuing and will be able to single out highly polluting models in future. “I see this remote sensing mostly as a screening tool, to see which vehicle models behave suspiciously,” said Peter Mock, at the International Council on Clean Transportation which produced the True rating in partnership with the FIA Foundation and other groups. Those models highlighted as highly polluting could then be tested by putting a portable emissions measuring system (Pems) on a car, which is more accurate but also much more expensive. Diesel cars shown by the True data to emit far more NOx than the official baseline when on the road included two-litre Fiat Chrysler models – 18 times more – and 1.6-litre Renault Nissan models – 14 times more – though the cars passed legally required tests. “If I was a customer, I would look at these figures at the moment and have to conclude I should not buy a diesel car,” Mock said, noting that the petrol versions are far cleaner. “Even Euro 6 [the most recent standard] diesel vehicles are not performing well at the moment so pretty much all of them should not have access to city centres.” Greg Archer, at campaign group Transport &amp; Environment, which is part of the True initiative, said: “The True rating exposes the legacy of dieselgate – tens of millions of dirty diesels that are still on the roads producing the toxic smog we daily breathe. It identifies the worst performing models and regulators must act to require carmakers to clean these up.” The True rating is a “brilliant” screening tool and also good at monitoring pollution from cars as they get older and enter the used car market, said Nick Molden, chief executive of Emissions Analytics, which performs 300-400 Pems tests every year on new car models and publishes another rating system called the Equa index. But Molden cautioned that the True rating system, which averages the same models across several years, will not show when the latest model has radically cut its pollution. He cites the example of a Mercedes model that improved significantly between 2014 and 2017: “It went from quite dirty to really quite clean.” Since September 2017, new cars have had to pass a road-based test, but an EU compromise with the industry means emissions can still legally be double the baseline limit. Molden said car manufacturers are now very wary of being caught launching cars that fail emissions tests and some new diesel models are very clean, sometimes 50% below the baseline. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders, said: “Thanks to massive investment, each generation of vehicle is more advanced than the last, with significantly lower pollutant emissions. This is acknowledged by the [True] report, and consumers can be assured that new cars on sale today are the cleanest ever and fully compliant with EU emissions standards.” The new analysis of the health impact of diesel in the UK was conducted by experts at the University of Oxford and University of Bath in advance of Clean Air day 2018 on 21 June. They used data on the number of vehicles and mileage, along with government estimates of the harm caused by pollution. The researchers found the health damage from diesel vehicle emissions are about 20 times greater than from electric vehicles and five times more than petrol vehicles. Christian Brand, at the University of Oxford, said: “Cars and vans are responsible for 10,000 early deaths each year, and diesel vehicles are the main problem unfortunately.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/05/mps-to-launch-inquiry-into-rail-timetable-chaos","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T12:45:43Z","webTitle":"May must act to end northern England rail crisis, Corbyn says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/mps-to-launch-inquiry-into-rail-timetable-chaos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/mps-to-launch-inquiry-into-rail-timetable-chaos","fields":{"headline":"May must act to end northern England rail crisis, Corbyn says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has called on the prime minister to intervene to stop the ongoing rail disruption in the north of England, as MPs launch an inquiry into the chaos on train services across the UK. The Labour leader said the government should be taking urgent action to help passengers who have faced thousands of cancellations and delays on Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Northern rail services since a new timetable was introduced two-and-a-half weeks ago. “The government must take urgent action to fix the travel chaos unleashed on the north of England by Chris Grayling’s failures,” Corbyn said in a statement on Tuesday. “Northern communities already only get a fraction of the transport investment that the south-east receives. The Tories should be working day and night to put this scandal right. “Their failure to do so shows their disregard for people in the towns and cities in the north. If the transport secretary won’t stop trying to pass the buck, Theresa May must personally intervene to sort out this mess and end the disruption to people’s lives.” Theresa May described the rail disruption as “absolutely unacceptable” at Tuesday’s cabinet meeting where ministers were briefed by Grayling. “It is important we get to grips with this issue quickly,” she said. “The current passenger disruption is letting people down.” The prime minister’s official spokesman said May described the need to fix the problem as “an absolute priority”, and that those affected must be “properly compensated”. She said the new timetable would deliver hundreds more services when properly implemented, but that until this could be done there was a need to “urgently minimise the disruption”. The transport select committee said it would launch an inquiry into the rail timetable debacle. The committee chair, Lilian Greenwood, said the MPs would seek “to properly understand why the introduction of the new timetable has gone so badly wrong, what is being done to put it right and the steps needed to prevent this happening again”. “The secretary of state has said there have been ‘major failures’ – we want to unpick this mess and understand how it can be prevented from occurring in December, when another timetable change is due,” Greenwood said. Network Rail, GTR and Northern have all apologised for the chaos, saying they did not have sufficient time to plan for the introduction of the new timetables because of delayed engineering works. They said the disruption had come as part of “the biggest modernisation [of the railways] since the Victorian era”. Grayling faced furious questions from MPs of all parties on Monday after making a statement to the Commons on the rail crisis. He announced he had commissioned an independent inquiry, led by the Office of Rail and Road chairman, Prof Stephen Glaister, into the timetable fiasco. He said his officials would also launch a review into whether GTR and Northern had breached their contracts, and what sanctions they should face. Speaking in the Commons, Greenwood said Grayling had signed off GTR’s unworkable timetable despite Network Rail’s reservations, and had demanded cuts in spending on planning. Grayling responded that he had followed the advice of the industry readiness board. Mick Cash, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, called on Grayling to meet rail staff, who were being “hung out to dry as human shields for a failed Tory privatisation dogma”. He called for support and protection for union members, who were being abused by angry passengers, “before we have a major incident on our hands”. On Tuesday morning, major newspapers across the north of England joined together to demand that May “get a grip” on the government’s response to the crisis. The 25 titles, which are owned by various groups and include the Manchester Evening News, the Liverpool Echo and the Yorkshire Post, called on May to lead an emergency summit in Downing Street this week to find a solution to the crisis, and urged a review of rail franchising. Transport for the North – which has a mandate to make recommendations to the Department for Transport, Network Rail, Highways England and HS2 Ltd – called for compensation for Northern passengers who had bought advanced or season tickets for the next two months, a reduction in the cost of disrupted journeys, and for tickets to be accepted on other rail operators and modes of transport."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/10/red-wines-for-summer-fresh-and-fashionable-david-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T04:59:42Z","webTitle":"Red wines for summer | David Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/10/red-wines-for-summer-fresh-and-fashionable-david-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/10/red-wines-for-summer-fresh-and-fashionable-david-williams","fields":{"headline":"Red wines for summer","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Atamisque Serbal Cabernet Franc, Tupungato, Mendoza, Argentina 2017 (from £14.95, Drink Monger; Hennings Wine) I’m focusing this week on three fashionable red grape varieties that are known – and this is not unconnected – for providing the kind of freshness that is particularly suited to the food and mood at this time of year. The first, cabernet franc, is widely used as a blending component – and occasionally on its own – in Bordeaux. But it’s best known for the racy, sappy reds it makes further north, in the Loire Valley – wines such as the silky, typically graphite-shaded, black and red currant-flavoured Plessis-Duval Saumur-Champigny 2017 (£10, M&amp;S) or the crunchy, brisk raspberry-scented Les Nivières Saumur 2016 (£9.49, Waitrose). Increasingly, however, it’s achieving excellent results in the high-altitude vineyards of Argentina, producing wines – such as Atamisque’s gorgeous Serbal – that are fleshier than their Loire counterparts and feel like a fresher, more incisive version of malbec at its most aromatic. Feiler-Artinger Blaufänkisch, Burgenland, Austria 2015 (£8.49, down from £9.99, from 13 June to 10 July, Waitrose) Better known for its white wines, notably those made from grüner veltliner and riesling, Austrian red wine is one of those arcane wine styles with which wine trade professionals have long been smitten, but which have stubbornly failed to catch on in the UK’s mainstream wine shops. Though it can make a variety of styles, what makes a wine such as Feiler-Artinger’s version work in these spring-into-summer days is its delightfully tangy acidity, which comes in a package with succulent red and black cherry-berry fruit. You can find that quality, too, in the slightly richer, deeper Heinrich Blaufränkisch, Burgenland 2015 (from £16.75, Hailsham Cellars; Alexander Hadleigh; Mr and Mrs Fine Wine); while Pittnauer Red Pitt, Burgenland 2015 (£13.95, The Wine Society) mixes in a bit of spicy fellow Austrian variety zweigelt and the plush, well-travelled merlot, for a lipsmacking, refreshing grilled meat match. Leeuwenkuil Bushvine Cinsault , Swartland, South Africa 2017 (£10, Marks &amp; Spencer) Very few people would have had cinsault down as the next big thing even a decade ago. This southern French variety was considered to be no better than a bit-part player in the vast production of rustic vins de table below the Massif Central. It still does that job. But its shown itself to be capable of far more than that, as producers have rediscovered old vines of the variety in neglected vineyards from southern Chile to California. The leader of the cinsault renaissance (or maybe simply “naissance” is more appropriate in this case) is without doubt South Africa, where it makes distinctive, thirst-quenching reds with a burst of red fruit and a kind of warm-earthiness, such as the barbie’ bargain Wine Atlas Cinsault, Western Cape 2017 (£5.48), the downright racy Chris Alheit Flotsam &amp; Jetsam Cinsault South Africa 2016 (£14.60, laywheeler.com; swig.co.uk) and the savoury-succulent Leeuwenkuil from M&amp;S.

I remember taking my son when he was younger. I could feel him squirming, trapped in the seat next to me, confused by the strange convention where people seem to be talking to you but you are not allowed to talk back. The darkened auditorium filled with surprises and the lack of control over the experience made for a situation that could have been designed to make a young autistic person anxious – second, perhaps, only to mainstream education, as we were soon to discover. So when faced with staging Naoki Higashida’s extraordinary book The Reason I Jump, about his experiences as an autistic teenager, we wanted to make something that didn’t behave like a conventional theatre show. How could we give the audience – autistic or otherwise – more control of the experience and a say in how the story unfolds? An obvious starting point was to involve people with autism in creating the show: to make it their story as well as Higashida’s. If we were to say anything as interesting about autism as the book, we had to involve those with firsthand experience – parents of autistic children being the worst kind of “experts”, as my autistic friends like to remind me. The book allows us to hear directly from its author and spend precious time getting to know how his mind works. Could a theatre show communicate this remarkable worldview at the same time as allowing an audience to meet others with autism and hear their stories? After all, the diversity of behaviour and experience of those on the autistic spectrum is one of the condition’s defining and often confusing characteristics. Creating a space for that diversity of voices felt important. The idea of taking the audience on a physical journey, to reflect a journey of discovery, seemed appropriate for a book that has taught so much to so many. We first thought of a journey through a series of rooms, each exploring a question related to autistic experience in the same way that each chapter of Higashida’s book asks and answers a question. As the complexity of these questions and this journey developed, it felt as though we were creating a kind of labyrinth or maze that might stage a series of encounters with our autistic performers. I discovered that a maze and a labyrinth represent almost opposite types of journey. The maze is a puzzle to be solved, a series of rational choices, directions to be negotiated and dead ends to be recovered from. There are no choices to be made in a labyrinth, with its circuitous design, but instead a single path to be followed, an experience to give yourself up to, and a chance to enter into a more meditative frame of mind. The labyrinth design is as old as civilisation itself and appears independently in many cultures. Its use as a means of spiritual practice, both pagan and Christian, endures to this day. That these two types of journey might represent different kinds of psychological experience – rational and spiritual – and help to explore the different ways in which the mind works, seemed fascinating for a project that has neurodiversity – the acknowledgement that all our minds work differently – at its heart. The decision to stage our show outdoors came when we secured the collaboration of a community-owned wild space in Glasgow’s West End dedicated to strengthening our relationship with nature. The Children’s Wood and North Kelvin Meadow was already working with local schools and groups to promote the role of outdoor activity in development and wellbeing. This wonderful space has become home to our temporary wooden maze structure (designed in collaboration with Dutch artists Observatorium), with a permanent stone labyrinth, built with the community, at its centre. As you travel through the maze you encounter the show’s autistic performers, who relate Naoki’s insights from the book as well as their own stories. After finding your own path through the maze, and discovering more about autism as you go, you are invited finally to walk the labyrinth, a more personal experience of self-discovery for those who desire it. We’ve called this place Naoki’s Garden. Nature is a fundamental theme in The Reason I Jump and an essential part of Higashida’s relationship with the world: “Nature calms me down when I’m furious, and laughs with me when I’m happy. You might think that it’s not possible that nature could be a friend, not really. But human beings are part of the animal kingdom too, and perhaps us people with autism still have some leftover awareness of this, buried somewhere deep down. I’ll always cherish the part of me that thinks of nature as a friend.” The National Theatre of Scotland’s production The Reason I Jump is at the Children’s Wood and North Kelvin Meadow, Glasgow, until 23 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/05/junk-food-ad-ban-could-cost-tv-industry-200m-says-channel-4","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T11:02:56Z","webTitle":"Channel 4 tells Jamie Oliver he's wrong on junk food ad ban campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/05/junk-food-ad-ban-could-cost-tv-industry-200m-says-channel-4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/05/junk-food-ad-ban-could-cost-tv-industry-200m-says-channel-4","fields":{"headline":"Channel 4 tells Jamie Oliver he's wrong on junk food ad ban campaign","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Channel 4 bosses have said Jamie Oliver’s campaign for a ban on airing junk food adverts before 9pm is wrong, arguing that it is anachronistic because children rarely watch live television. The celebrity chef, who is one of Channel 4’s biggest stars, recently launched a campaign backed by Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon for a ban on TV advertising for food high in salt, fat or sugar before the watershed, arguing that such products are a cause of childhood obesity. However, Channel 4 said any such ban could have a substantial impact on its revenue and prevent it from funding programmes about healthy living. Alex Mahon, the Channel 4 chief executive, said that if such ads were restricted on mainstream television, junk food advertisers would instead spend their money with the likes of Facebook and “target young people even more specifically”. “None of us want childhood obesity in the UK,” she said, saying she had no objection to Oliver making his case. “We’re just saying on this particularly point we need a slightly more complex consultation.” Jonathan Allan, the channel’s chief commercial officer, said a ban could take £200m out of the commercial television industry. “It’s a serious financial risk for broadcasters,” he said. “We feel the 9pm watershed is probably not proportionate because it would stop advertising around shows that don’t appeal to kids at all. It is potentially anachronistic when children are watching on-demand at any time of the day.” The news may disappoint Oliver, who made Jamie’s School Dinners for the channel in 2005, when he helped focus media attention on children’s diets by launching a war on Turkey twizzlers. “Jamie is obviously free to have his agenda,” said Allan. “We fund and commission loads of great shows about health and if we’ve got less money we can afford to put less shows like that out.” Channel 4 launched its annual report on Tuesday, the first under its new leadership team of Mahon and director of programmes Ian Katz, a former Newsnight boss and deputy editor of the Guardian. They have pledged to focus on attracting a younger audience with investments into E4 and online programming. The commercial broadcaster, which is ultimately publicly owned, said revenues fell from £995m to £960m in 2017, amid a weak advertising market. It is looking to move a substantial part of its operation outside London as part of a deal with the government to spend more money on programmes produced away from the capital. Channel 4 announced a deal with Vice to bring hundreds of hours of programming to its All 4 catchup service by the end of the year. Vice, which recently appointed a new chief executive, has struggled to gain a British audience for its Sky channel but hopes to reach younger viewers through the Channel 4 partnership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/05/dangerous-building-works-turned-grenfell-tower-death-trap-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T18:24:43Z","webTitle":"Refurbishment made Grenfell Tower a death trap, inquiry hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/dangerous-building-works-turned-grenfell-tower-death-trap-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/dangerous-building-works-turned-grenfell-tower-death-trap-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Refurbishment made Grenfell Tower a death trap, inquiry hears","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Grenfell Tower was turned into a “death trap” by a dangerous and reprehensible refurbishment carried out by Kensington and Chelsea council and the local tenant management organisation (TMO), the inquiry into the fire has been told. The accusation came as commercial firms responsible for the work came under pressure to end their effective silence and participate more actively in the investigation. On the ninth day of the inquiry, Danny Friedman QC, speaking on behalf of law firms representing survivors and the bereaved, said his clients were watching the inquiry with “calm rage”. Cladding fitted to the outside of Grenfell Tower was lethal, he said. “In the second decade of 21st-century London, governed by a regulatory framework designed to ensure fire safety, a local authority instigated and oversaw the refurbishment of a social housing, high-rise tower block in such a way as to render it a death trap. “The royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the tenant management organisation did this using public funds paid to an array of contractors and subcontractors – none of whom have yet taken any responsibility for what happened.” The building works were “obviously dangerous, reprehensible and contrary” to regulations, he said. “Residents and many people told them that this would happen but they were fobbed off and certainly not treated as equals. Seventy-two people died. Those who escaped owed their survival to chance rather than as a result of assessments or contingency planning by the fire brigade.” He said the fire service failed to realise quickly enough that this was a “fire that could not be fought and required evacuation that could not be delayed”. Friedman drew attention to a blog published two years ago by Edward Daffarn and Francis O’Connor, of the Grenfell Action Group, in which they concluded that “only an incident that results in serious loss of life … will allow the external scrutiny to occur that will shine a light on the practices that characterise the malign governance of [the Kensington and Chelsea TMO].” Stephanie Barwise, counsel for the same group of law firms, focused on the flammability of the material used in the cladding and refurbishment: “Our understanding is that the ignition of the polyethylene within the cladding panels produces a flaming reaction more quickly than dropping a match into a barrel of petrol.” She added: “The insulation used to line the original concrete wall of Grenfell was predominantly the product Celotex RS 5000 … All the insulation was supposed to be of limited combustibility, or class A2, but Dr Lane [the inquiry’s expert chartered fire engineer] finds none of it was. “The sandwich infill panels between windows were Aluglaze, the white aluminum panels with blue styrofoam filling … which ignite at 356C and for which no public fire performance test evidence has been supplied.” Barwise pointed to previous examples of cladding fires on high-rise buildings around the world. “Since the turn of the century, both internationally and in the UK, fires involving external cladding systems have become almost the archetypal form of mass fire disaster,” she said. “This fact put construction and fire engineering professionals on notice of the imperative to develop their risk assessment systems accordingly; and also ought to have informed fire brigade contingency planning. Industry openly acknowledges that polyethylene equates to petrol.” Regarding the building contractors, Barwise said: “Despite their words of condolence to the victims, these corporates have no desire to assist this inquiry, even though their participation could save lives in the immediate future. “The corporates’ silence deprives the families of the degree of resolution and understanding to which they are entitled, and has only served to increase their pain and uncertainty. It is inhumane to remain silent when so many seek understanding and answers: answers which are within the corporates’ gift.” Before its refurbishment, Barwise noted, Grenfell was constructed of virtually incombustible concrete. Sam Stein QC, representing another group of survivors and residents, told the inquiry: “The loss of life was wholly avoidable.... The very safety system [advising residents to stay put] that was meant to preserve life had been perverted into a fire killing system.” Stein said the fire safety consultants used for the refurbishment, Exova Warrington, had advised that there would be “no adverse impact” on the spread of fire by the refurbishment. How could that be, he asked? The TMO, he continued, managed 10,000 homes yet seemed to be waiting for the inquiry to tell it why the tower was wrapped in combustible material. Pete Weatherby QC, representing other survivors and residents, said that in 1999 the Commons regional affairs committee had written to local authorities warning them about the dangers of external cladding on towers. And last year, he said, the London Fire Brigade wrote to London councils after a fire at the nearby Shepherd’s Court tower warning that cladding had had an impact on fire safety measures. The “stay put” advice given by the LFB should have been abandoned earlier than it was, Weatherby stressed. “As early as 1.08am, the residents at Flat 26 [above where the fire broke out] said their flat was on fire. By 1.12am, flames were licking up the building and the incident commander said the cladding was burning ‘like magnesium’, sparking and spitting.” The solicitor Imran Khan QC, who also represents the bereaved and survivors, called on the inquiry to expand its remit to consider whether race, religion and social class played a part in events surrounding the fire. “The question that we might want to ask and have answered is whether RBKC (Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council) and TMO and its associates were guilty of institutional racism,” he said. “These features might have been at play because of the background of the residents of the tower. Ethnic communities are over-represented in tower blocks around Britain.” Earlier, a lawyer for the Metropolitan police told the inquiry that the scale of the criminal investigation was “unprecedented and extremely demanding”. Jeremy Johnson QC said the investigation was going according to schedule, and he revealed that the building would cease to be a crime scene by July or August.

She wanted to watch cartoons but instead there was a special news broadcast. This was how she learned her father had been shot. Kerry and other younger members of the family flew from Los Angeles to Washington. The next day, word came that Robert Kennedy had died at the age of 42. “What I remember about that is going into my room and laying on my bed and crying and praying for my father,” she told the Guardian, “and then saying a prayer to God that they wouldn’t kill the person who killed my father because I didn’t want any other family to have to go through this pain, and I didn’t want a mother to lose another son and, if this man had children, for them to lose their father. I just wanted an end to the violence.” On Wednesday, Kerry Kennedy will join former president Bill Clinton at her father’s resting place in Arlington National Cemetery, for a memorial service marking the 50th anniversary of his death. Civil rights hero John Lewis, 78, and 18-year-old gun control activist Emma González will be among those reading quotations from the slain senator’s works. Two are inscribed in granite near the plain white cross at his grave: “Some men see things as they are and ask ‘Why?’ I dream things that never were and ask, ‘Why not?’” and: “… each time a man stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope …” Like the remembrance two months ago of Martin Luther King’s murder, this American tragedy will be thrown into sharp relief by current circumstances. If Robert Kennedy were still alive, he would be 92 – younger than former presidents Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush – and quite possibly channeling his last energies against Donald Trump. Instead, that falls to surrogates such as grandson Joe Kennedy III, a Democratic congressman, and Kerry Kennedy, president of Robert F Kennedy Human Rights. “I think that he would have been very distressed about Donald Trump,” she said by phone from her home in New York. “My father spent most of the ’68 [presidential] campaign focused on healing the divisions within our country and he saw that this can get a lot worse than it was. Donald Trump came to power as somebody exploiting those divisions, and he has led through exploiting divisions, and that’s extremely harmful to our country. “Daddy loved our country, he loved our history. He was always talking about American history and telling us stories from American history, and loved our most treasured values of freedom, democracy, justice. So I think that having Donald Trump as president of our country, and also his impact around the world, would have left my father in dismay.” The eulogies will not dwell on some aspects of Robert Kennedy’s past: he was an aide to Joseph McCarthy’s witch-hunt of suspected communists; was named attorney general by his brother John F Kennedy in what now looks like an act of nepotism; and, in that role, ordered the wiretapping and surveillance of King. But his commitment to civil rights hardened with time. A film clip from 1963 shows him talking by phone to assistant attorney general Nick Katzenbach, who is in Alabama to force the segregationist governor George Wallace to admit African American students to university. In a moment of bathos, he puts Kerry on the line. “How are you doing?” the little girl asks. “Are you at our house?” Katzenbach asks Kerry to tell her father the temperature in Alabama is 98F (37C) and they should all get hardship pay. Today, Kerry Kennedy recalls: “It was a funny thing for Nick to say but it was also reflective of my father’s sense of humour, his capacity to cut tension, his love of his children.” On the wall of her apartment is a letter her father wrote to her that day: “Dear Kerry, Today was an historic day, not just because of your visit, but because, over the objections of Governor Wallace, two negroes registered at the University of Alabama. It happened just a few minutes ago. I hope these events are long past by the time you get your pretty little head to college. Love and kisses, Daddy.” Despite his use of the phrase “pretty little head”, Kerry Kennedy, the seventh of Robert and Ethel Kennedy’s 11 children, insists her father was the opposite of a chauvinist dinosaur. “I loved that television show Mad Men because it really was a reminder of what reality was back then,” she says. “And that made him stand out in contrast all the more. He was really a wonderful father, fully engaged, fully present, especially for a father in the 1960s in his kind of position.” Squabbles among the siblings would be resolved by their father asking each to give their side of the story while the other had to listen quietly without interrupting, Kerry Kennedy recalls. “In that process the truth would out and both sides would understand that neither side was all wrong. Then we would have to kiss and make up and go to our rooms to read for an hour. “The message he had for us as children was the same message he had for our country, which is we must create peace. It’s not just about the war in Vietnam. You have to look at your enemies as brothers and sisters.” In the family home, the air was thick with politics and poetry, Kerry Kennedy recalls in a new book, Robert F Kennedy: Ripples of Hope, which contains interviews with Clinton, Lewis, Barack Obama and others. At dinner on Sunday nights, they would recite lines from Rudyard Kipling’s If, Robert Service’s The Cremation of Sam McGee and Alfred Lord Tennyson’s Ulysses. Books filled every nook and cranny of the house and newspapers and magazines coated the breakfast table. Kerry Kennedy says: “All of us were expected to read the newspaper and to go round the table and tell one story that we had read that day. Then there would be a discussion about the issues that they raised. “Every night without fail he would read from the Old Testament, and then we would play games and then go upstairs and kneel around our parents’ bed and say rosaries and go to bed. It’s pretty remarkable how much he really was present considering how busy he was and how many kids he had.” ‘Daddy was never ruthless but he was tough’ In November 1963, John F Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. His younger brother and closest confidant was shaken to the core. “Daddy was never ruthless but he was tough,” Kerry Kennedy says. “I think part of that toughness was a confidence that allowed him to really embrace the mourning process and to go very deeply into his sadness and despair and not to run away from that and not to be fearful of it, which so many people are to their great detriment. “He was pretty absent from public life for about six months, and that’s when he read The Greek Way [by Edith Hamilton] and became really enthralled with the ancient Greeks. I think that process deepened his capacity to understand pain.” Robert Kennedy’s erudition stands in contrast to the anti-intellectual populism embodied by Trump. At the Democratic National Convention in 1964, Robert Kennedy paid tribute to his late brother by quoting Shakespeare. Four years later, in a speech from the heart, he broke the news of King’s death to a potentially febrile crowd in Indianapolis. He reached for Aeschylus. Robert Kennedy became a US senator for New York and ran for president in 1968 after Lyndon B Johnson – “I think they really disliked each other,” Kerry Kennedy says – decided to not to seek re-election. When he won the California primary, Robert Kennedy told aide Kenny O’Donnell: “You know, Kenny, I feel now for the first time that I’ve shaken off the shadow of my brother. I feel I made it on my own.” Had he gone on to clinch the Democratic nomination, then emulate his brother by beating Richard Nixon, history might well have looked very different: no Watergate, probably a shortened Vietnam war, perhaps less division and more healing. Instead, after his victory speech at the Ambassador hotel in Los Angeles in the early hours of 5 June, Robert Kennedy made his way through the kitchen to avoid the surging crowd. There he was shot by a Jordanian citizen, Sirhan Sirhan. He died the following day. The BBC journalist Alistair Cooke was standing a few feet away. “Down on the greasy floor was a huddle of clothes and staring out of it the face of Bobby Kennedy, like the stone face of a child, lying on a cathedral tomb,” he wrote. Each Kennedy child responded to the loss in his or her own way. Kerry, now 58, formerly married to the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has spent most of her life as a human rights activist. After all the challenges posed by tyrannies abroad, she never expected to be confronted at home by a figure like Trump, rattling allies, praising authoritarians, advocating torture and popularising terms such as “fake news” around the world. She says: “We have a president of the United States who has launched a full-frontal attack on human rights in myriad ways.” Yet the shards of memory from being a child of the 60s – the killings of John F Kennedy, Malcolm X, King and Robert Kennedy, the urban uprisings and Vietnam – offer a sense of perspective today. “It was an amazing time. People feel that this moment, our moment here in 2018, is such a difficult time in our country’s history. “Boy, in 1968 we had 125 cities burning on fire and not for one night, not for two nights – Philadelphia, I think, was three months of basically martial law in that city. This was all over and huge demonstrations against the war, this incredible rage of black against white, rich against poor, young against old and back and forth. “So when people say how horrible it is that Donald Trump is president, well, yeah, but we’ve faced a lot worse than this and our country went on to go from the world of Mad Men to the world it is today, and that’s what’s going to happen now. That’s what’s going to happen in the next 50 years. We’re going to be fine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/04/shipping-containers-lost-overboard-leave-debris-on-nsw-beaches","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T07:04:30Z","webTitle":"Shipping containers lost overboard leave debris on NSW beaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/04/shipping-containers-lost-overboard-leave-debris-on-nsw-beaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/04/shipping-containers-lost-overboard-leave-debris-on-nsw-beaches","fields":{"headline":"Shipping containers lost overboard leave debris on NSW beaches","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There are fears whales, dolphins and other marine life could be hurt as debris from shipping containers continues to wash up on beaches north of Newcastle, with questions being raised over how a Liberian-registered ship lost more than 80 containers in rough seas. Locals from the New South Wales region have collected dozens of bags of plastic material, jars, packaged food, clocks, nappies and sanitary items from 83 containers that fell off a cargo ship last Thursday night. About 30 more were moved or damaged. The 50,000-tonne YM Efficiency was making its way from Taiwan to Sydney when it was hit by heavy swells about 30km off the coast. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Port Stephens EcoNetwork’s Nigel Dique and about eight volunteers have already filled at least 20 large bags of debris from Zenith and Box beaches. “There were broken clocks, bits of structural plastic material, lots of jars and food items packaged in plastic,” Dique said. “I don’t know what else was in these containers, if there was anything toxic, but certainly turtles and whales and large marine creatures think they are food and swallow the stuff.” A further 30 volunteers – including Julie Sims from Hawks Nest - found car parts, drinks, sanitary items and other plastics strewn across Jimmys Beach. “It goes on and on and on – it is just plastic, plastic, plastic,” Sims said. The NSW Greens say the plastic poses a particular threat to marine life, including sea birds, whales, dolphins and turtles. The party has called on the state government to fast-track the clean-up to prevent further damage. “The NSW coastline is a very busy maritime route. We should have excellent emergency response protocols, but it looks like they have either failed or are grossly inadequate,” the NSW Greens marine spokesman, Justin Field, said in a statement. The NSW environment minister, Gabrielle Upton, said the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the state’s Roads and Maritime Services agency and the NSW Environment Protection Authority were working with local councils to ensure all material was cleaned up. The government says it will try recoup the cost of the clean-up from the ship’s owner. The ship’s insurer has employed local company Varley to put skip bins out for residents to dispose collected rubbish and use a helicopter to find the debris floating at sea, local MP Kate Washington said. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the incident, but Dean Summers from the International Transport Workers’ Federation told ABC news there were questions over how the containers were loaded and whether they were secured properly. “Crews are being encouraged, forced or paid extra to do the wharfies’ work, that is to lash containers, and we just wonder if this is a component of this incident,” Summers said. Angus Mitchell from NSW Roads and Maritime Services said that while incidents of containers being lost overboard were not uncommon, it was quite rare for it to happen so close to the coast. “We have had adverse weather conditions over the last 24 hours. At this stage it looks like it’s bad weather and the ship has rolled heavily and it has caused these containers to come off,” he said. The Bureau of Meteorology issued warnings for hazardous surf on Sunday as a powerful winter swell hit the NSW coast. The ship’s owner, Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation, is coordinating the search for containers and a spokeswoman said there were no dangerous goods or contaminants inside. “There is no security concern about the condition of the vessel,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/04/fears-naurus-sweeping-new-contempt-laws-target-opposition","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T08:33:08Z","webTitle":"Fears Nauru's sweeping new contempt laws target opposition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/04/fears-naurus-sweeping-new-contempt-laws-target-opposition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/04/fears-naurus-sweeping-new-contempt-laws-target-opposition","fields":{"headline":"Fears Nauru's sweeping new contempt laws target opposition","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Nauru has enacted sweeping contempt-of-court laws that make almost any criticism of a case – including in media reporting – a crime, but create exemptions for members of the government. The legislation came into force last month. Anyone accused of the crime would be refused a presumption of bail, alongside those accused of murder or treason, under separate laws that came into force on the same day. Members of the so-called “Nauru 19”, who are facing jail for protesting against government crackdowns on opposition MPs, have expressed concern about the laws. Separately, a Lowy Institute report has warned of Nauru’s “lurch towards authoritarianism”. Under the Administration of Justice Act, it is now a crime to criticise any party to a case, which could include the government, as it is party to any criminal prosecution. Also outlawed are: criticisms of any witnesses, judicial officers or legal representatives in a pending court matter publishing a judgment of the court “scandalising” a judge or judicial officer “scandalising” or undermining the authority of the courts or justice system “in any manner whatsoever” An online offence applies if it is viewable in Nauru, regardless of where it was published. Penalties are up to two years in jail and $20,000 fines for individuals, and up to $50,000 in fines for corporations. It has a 12-month statute of limitations. Defences include comments made “in good faith”, or as part of fair and accurate court reporting, or in a legitimate complaint. The government is exempt if it believes it’s in the public interest or for national security, and MPs are protected by parliamentary privilege. “No servant or agent of the republic shall be convicted of contempt of court for the execution of his or her duties in good faith,” it also said. There are concerns the new laws are targeted at the “Nauru 19”, who along with their legal representatives, have frequently criticised the case against them and the actions of the court. Mathew Batsiua, a former justice minister and member of the 19, signalled their legal team would challenge the constitutionality of the laws in pre-trial motions. “They are a chilling and extraordinary attack on the rule of law and democratic freedom, and undermine our right to a fair trial,” Batsiua said. “Yet again we see this irresponsible government responding to developments in the case by passing new laws and undermining our legal system.” In the long-running case, three of the defendants are currently appealing their increased jail sentences for a 2015 protest. Nineteen people – including a former president – were charged over the protest against the government’s suspension of opposition MPs who criticised the expulsion of high-ranking members of the judiciary from the country. John Jeremiah, Job Cecil and Josh Kepae had appealed increases of up to 700% to their sentences when the Nauruan government quietly severed a treaty with Australia that enshrined the status of Australia’s high court as its highest appeals court. The creation of a local appellate court has been legislated, but it’s unclear whether it is operational. A Lowy Institute report on the state of governance in the Pacific Islands region found Nauru had “lurched towards authoritarianism” in its recent moves towards political stability. “After years of frequent changes of government and states of emergency, Nauru’s politics is characterised by an authoritarian approach to parliamentary oppositions, public demonstrations and freedom of speech”, said the report, which was published on Monday. This year the Nauruan government also introduced laws that criminalise disrespect of the national flag, anthem or emblem. Under the laws, a person could face up to five years in jail for not stopping their car when driving through a public area when the national anthem is playing. The Lowy Institute called for the Australian government to “do more to indicate its disapproval” of Nauru’s crackdown on opposition, media and the judiciary. “As host of the Australian detention centre, the Nauru government has entrenched executive power in the knowledge that criticism from Canberra will be low-key at most,” the report said. The Nauruan government has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/04/new-us-ambassador-to-germany-under-fire-for-rightwing-support","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T19:14:29Z","webTitle":"New US ambassador to Germany under fire for rightwing support","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/04/new-us-ambassador-to-germany-under-fire-for-rightwing-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/04/new-us-ambassador-to-germany-under-fire-for-rightwing-support","fields":{"headline":"New US ambassador to Germany under fire for rightwing support","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"German politicians have criticised Donald Trump’s new ambassador to Germany after he said he wanted to “empower” anti-establishment rightwing forces throughout Europe. In an interview with the far-right news outlet Breitbart over the weekend, Richard Grenell, who has been in office for less than a month, said: “I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders. “I think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the left.” In Berlin, the foreign ministry asked him to clarify the comments and politicians criticised him for a perceived breach of diplomatic protocol. “In the past, Germany was fortunate to have had great US ambassadors who built bridges and did not do party politics,” said Metin Hakverdi‪, a Social Democrat delegate and member of the German-US parliamentary friendship group. “As a member of the SPD, a left party with a long proud legacy of fighting, together with the United States, both Nazis and communists, I am irritated to hear from Ambassador Grenell about our allegedly failed policies. “US Senator Chris Murphy said rightly that ambassadors are not supposed to ‘empower’ political parties. Ambassador Grenell is new on his post and I hope this irritation will not be repeated.” Omid Nouripour, a Green MP and deputy chair of the German-US parliamentary friendship group, said: “The comments made by Richard Grenell give the impression that the new US ambassador still hasn’t adjusted to his new role. At least the Russians make an effort not to be seen to be meddling in other countries’ affairs.” He added: “The US ambassador represents the American people, not just the readership of Breitbart. That’s why it is important that he conducts himself as neutrally as possible.” A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said on Monday that the government had asked Breitbart to confirm the authenticity of Grenell’s comments and that the US ambassador would be expected to “explain what he meant” during his first official visit to the foreign ministry on Thursday. Angela Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said the chancellor had registered the comments made by the US ambassador but would not comment on the matter. At the White House, press secretary Sarah Sanders declined to address Grenell’s comments, saying she did not have “any updates on that front at this point”. While the use of political appointees – candidates with little or no foreign or diplomatic experience to be an ambassador – is more common in America than in other countries, ambassadors tend to subscribe to an unwritten code of conduct according to which they must remain politically neutral. Their ambassadorial instructions, signed by the US secretary of state, usually remain private, however. In 2013, Germany formally summoned the US ambassador over allegations that US secret services bugged Merkel’s mobile phone. The only time a US ambassador in Germany has been recalled to the US was in 1990, after the American embassy to East Germany ceased to exist. “The question to ask is whether Grenell in his Breitbart interview was explaining the US government’s position, or that of the Republican party,” said James D Bindenagel, a deputy chief of mission in the German US embassy from 1994 to 1997. “The latter is just not done. If he is saying that Trump is in fact seeking to deal with anti-establishment politicians in opposition rather than the German government, however, then that’s a whole new problem.” In his Breitbart interview, Grenell did not voice support for the rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland, which has been a vocal critic of Merkel’s refugee policies and is the largest opposition group in the Bundestag. But he did express admiration for the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, whose conservative Austrian People’s party governs in a coalition with the far-right FPÖ. “Look, I think Sebastian Kurz is a rock star,” he said. “I’m a big fan.” On Sunday, Grenell attended a workshop on transatlantic relations with a number of younger delegates from Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, organised by the health minister, Jens Spahn, a leading advocate of a rightwing realignment of the CDU.

Performers will use video projection as a backdrop to simulate walking through each other’s homes and streets, and interact as if they were in the same room, even as they are separated by 2,000 miles. The show’s producers say At Home in Gaza and London explores “survival tactics, creative impulses and coping mechanisms that sustain those living in Gaza, while at the same time celebrating a temporary release via the technological innovation of a working space, a playing space, without borders”. It is led by Station House Opera, a UK-based theatre group that has operated concurrent performances across the globe, including in Brazil and Singapore. However, Gaza is one of the most inaccessible places on earth, with neighbouring countries Israel and Egypt strictly limiting freedom of movement. Many Palestinians living there have never left the 140 sq mile strip of land. Co-director Taghrid Choucair-Vizoso said the idea was to see how “people in radically different circumstances, with different cultural circumstances, come to collaborate”. Palestinian artists involved in the forthcoming performance are not professional actors but from Gaza’s creative community, including a musician and a dancer. They have helped draft the show, which is semi-autobiographical. “It was really important for us not to send over a play script or design a performance, finished and polished. Because that’s very presumptuous, it’s slightly colonialist. We wanted to work collaboratively,” said Choucair-Vizoso. The plan originated in 2010, and during the 2014 war in Gaza between its rulers Hamas and Israel, the two directors decided they should work towards a performance. Co-director Julian Maynard Smith said the pair set up workshops in which Palestinian artists and actors in London could use the technology for joint workshops. “We found very early on with the workshops that it was very moving to inhabit a [shared] working space,” he said. The project has funding from arts and culture organisations, including the UK-Palestinian AM Qattan Foundation. Operating under such onerous conditions has been tough. The team had to source a generator because Gaza suffers from crippling 20-hour power cuts. Tight restrictions on imports, which Israel and Egypt say are for security reasons, mean the group have had issues bringing in equipment. One designer working with the group had been trying to get a visa to Turkey for five years. He finally managed to leave for Istanbul the day before rehearsals began. And in the weeks leading up to the performance, Gaza has suffered its most devastating violence in years. For the past two months, Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians and shot thousands protesting along the perimeter. Gaza-based militants have fired rocket and mortar shells into Israel, whose forces responded with wide-scale airstrikes. Choucair-Vizoso said the team decided the recent violence had to feature in the performance, although she added: “Just because there is a common experience in Gaza, it doesn’t mean everyone feels it in the same way.” Assistant director and Gaza-based collaborator, Amjad Shabat, said there is no plot or timeline. “It’s more about artists using each other’s homes, streets, workplaces to share their personal stories and their life perspective.” One scene focuses on living costs in the two places, while others deal with marriage, children and the inability of Palestinians trapped in Gaza to travel. Teams in both countries have developed deep bonds during years of interacting via live video channels, says Shabat. “For me, this project gives us the space to experience different places. Sometimes in rehearsals, we forget about the place that we are in.” At Home in Gaza and London is at Battersea Arts Centre, London, 28 June-1 July, and Liverpool Arab Arts festival, 9-10 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/04/man-who-abused-pm-pub-charged-with-attempted-of-woman","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T04:30:01Z","webTitle":"Man who abused PM in pub charged with attempted murder of woman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/04/man-who-abused-pm-pub-charged-with-attempted-of-woman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/04/man-who-abused-pm-pub-charged-with-attempted-of-woman","fields":{"headline":"Man who abused PM in pub charged with attempted murder of woman","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The man who was fined for abusing Malcolm Turnbull in a Brisbane pub last month has been charged with the attempted murder of a woman. Queensland police charged Nick Gordon, a 26-year-old landscaper, with the attempted murder of a 30-year-old woman in a Brisbane suburb on Sunday. Police responded to reports of a disturbance at a Carina Heights address on 3 June, and arrived to find a woman with “significant facial injuries and cuts to her hands”. Gordon, whom police said was known to the woman, was charged with attempted murder, contravention of domestic violence order and contravening order about information. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon He will appear in the Brisbane magistrates court later on Monday. Asked about the arrest at a press conference, in light of the man’s history with the prime minister, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said it highlighted the seriousness of an issue which some political opponents had attempted to make light of. Gordon, known as “Bluey”, made national headlines and appeared on breakfast television shows after he was removed and fined from a Brisbane pub after abusing Malcolm Turnbull and giving him the finger for allegedly cutting in front of him in line. He later said he did not realise it was the prime minister. He was immediately removed from the bar and fined for public nuisance. Former Labor senator Sam Dastyari began crowdfunding for the man, to pay his $756 fine. Footage released later showed Turnbull and the man were at different areas of the bar. “The only point I’d make is that there was some, in the Labor party, including Mr Shorten, at the time who tried to make an issue of this,” Dutton said. At the time, Bill Shorten said he did not believe anyone “should abuse anyone – it doesn’t matter if it is Malcolm Turnbull or somebody’s grandmother” but also advised Turnbull not to hold his political events where alcohol was served. The pub incident also became an issue during Senate estimates, with Mathias Cormann questioned by the Labor senator Kimberley Kitching over whether or not the prime minister had jumped the queue. A social media post, published on 1 June by Gordon, reposted one of his television appearances with the caption “never gets old what a laugh”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/04/north-korea-us-summit-nuclear-goodwill","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T12:03:00Z","webTitle":"North Korea has taken big steps.

During our recent trip to South Korea as part of an international women’s peace delegation, South Korean women complained that Donald Trump’s erratic conduct showed disrespect for the mediating role of their president, Moon Jae-in. They also commented on the lack of US reciprocity for North Korea’s goodwill gesture of returning three imprisoned US citizens and blowing up three of the four tunnels and all the administrative buildings at the Punggye-ri nuclear testing area. Assuming the US-North Korea summit takes place and marks the start of a long negotiation process, President Trump will need to make gestures of goodwill and sincerity along the way. The lifting of sanctions that have been so devastating to the North Korean economy is a priority for the North, but the US administration has indicated it will not lift sanctions before significant progress has been made. In the interim, here are three easy but significant measures Trump could take to build trust. 1. Open a US interest section in Pyongyang and allow a North Korean interest section in Washington. Already we have seen how the lack of a good communication system almost derailed the 12 June summit. In the absence of diplomatic relations and embassies, interest sections in our respective capital cities would facilitate communications between the two governments and provide an opportunity for US and North Korean officials to become more familiar with the workings of their respective governments and gain greater insight into each other’s cultures and societies. 2. Lift the travel ban. North Korea became the only country to which Americans are totally banned from traveling. The ban came in the aftermath of the tragic death of 22-year-old American student Otto Warmbier. Warmbier was arrested on 2 January, 2016 for allegedly stealing a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. Seventeen months later, he returned home in a coma and died on 19 June 2017. The Trump administration then banned all US travel, with some waivers granted for reporters, humanitarian workers and those traveling “in the national interest”. Previously, only about 1,000 Americans visited North Korea every year. Most were tourists but they also included between 200 and 500 Korean Americans who traveled for reunions with family members from whom they were separated during the Korean war. The new restrictions put an end to these family visits and tourism, and have also complicated the few ongoing exchanges that have kept the door to the United States open in this hermetic country, such as the agricultural assistance program that US Quakers started back in 1997. The ban prohibited our recent women’s delegation, organized by Women Cross DMZ and the Nobel Women’s Initiative, from traveling to North Korea to meet with women’s groups, as we did in 2015. Trump should encourage visits by citizen diplomats, from farmers to athletes to birdwatchers (North Korea is a major migration route for millions of birds, including cranes and songbirds). Direct interactions with North Koreans help humanize the American people in a country that has been so isolated from the west. The administration should also lift the 2017 ban prohibiting North Koreans from entering the United States and renew academic exchanges that have been taking place since the 1990s in areas such as agriculture, medicine and economics. 3. Provide humanitarian support, especially in light of the devastating effect of sanctions on the economy. More than 10 million people, or 40% of the population, are believed to be in need of humanitarian assistance, and one-quarter of children are stunted due to malnutrition. UN-wide appeals for North Korea, while small in dollar amounts, are chronically underfunded. Only seven governments, led by Russia and Switzerland, contributed to the $113.5m requested by the UN Office of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) in 2017 and only 30% of the goal was reached. Of the tiny $16.5m 2018 Unicef request for North Korean children, a mere $6.7m has been raised from the international community. The United States stopped assistance to North Korea in 2009, with the exception of $900,000 provided in 2011 for flood victims. To show goodwill, the US government could easily kick in the $10m shortfall for Unicef, and – for the cost of one B-52 bomber – it could fund the entire 2018 OCHA request of $111m. Together, these funds would enhance food security, reduce malnutrition, and increase access to healthcare, water and sanitation services for one-fourth of the nation’s 24 million people. Paying for life-saving programs would certainly be an inexpensive way to win hearts and minds. Considering that North Korea has blown up a nuclear facility and has returned three American prisoners, these easy-to-do measures would demonstrate a US commitment to dialogue and communication that could help smooth the way in what will undoubtedly be a very bumpy road ahead.

The move is part of a trial by the government that seeks to gain extra revenue to maintain the network of walks – one of the country’s major tourist drawcards. “New Zealand’s nine great walks are premier tracks that pass through unique and spectacular scenery and are a magnet for international visitors,” said the conservation minister, Eugenie Sage. She said the seven-month trial from October will provide information on the effectiveness of pricing as a tool to manage visitor pressure. “It is also part of setting and maintaining a fair pricing system for New Zealanders.” Currently, the Department of Conservation’s (DOC) investment in maintaining the great walks exceeds the revenue from users’ hut fees by up to NZ$3.8m (US$2.6m) each year. “DOC expects to recover up to an additional $2.9m during the trial period, without significantly reducing bookings and visitor demand,” Sage said. “The increased accommodation fees may also encourage overseas visitors to use less visited wreat walks where prices remain the same.” Prices for huts for international visitors, including children, on the Milford Track will be $140 per night, on the Kepler and Routeburn $130 per night and Abel Tasman Coastal Walk $75 per night. Hut prices for New Zealanders remain at $70 per night for the Milford, $65 per night for the Kepler and Routeburn, and $38 per night for the Abel Tasman Coastal Walk. New Zealanders under 18 will remain free of charge. With almost five million international visitors predicted to arrive each year by 2023, the announcement is one way the Labour-led government is looking to increase revenue off the back of the lucrative tourist market. Tourism directly contributes $14.7bn to the country each year, with a further $11.3bn contributed indirectly. As part of its election campaign the party also proposed a $25 “tourist tax” that would be levied on visitors at the border. However, it was unclear when or how that might be implemented."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/jun/06/keeping-up-with-the-crossbenchers-all-the-senate-changes-since-2016","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T22:30:56Z","webTitle":"Keeping up with the crossbenchers: all the Senate changes since 2016","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/jun/06/keeping-up-with-the-crossbenchers-all-the-senate-changes-since-2016","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2018/jun/06/keeping-up-with-the-crossbenchers-all-the-senate-changes-since-2016","fields":{"headline":"Keeping up with the crossbenchers: all the Senate changes since 2016","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/04/monday-briefing-police-warn-of-surge-in-terrorists-released-from-jail","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T05:24:53Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Police warn of surge in terrorists released from jail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/04/monday-briefing-police-warn-of-surge-in-terrorists-released-from-jail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/04/monday-briefing-police-warn-of-surge-in-terrorists-released-from-jail","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Police warn of surge in terrorists released from jail","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: ‘Step change’ in security threat Good morning – Alison Rourke with the main stories on this Monday morning. Police and security services say they are facing a surge in convicted terrorists being released from prison. Analysis by the Guardian shows that more than 40% of the terrorism sentences handed down over a 10-year period will have been served by the end of this year. The figures, compiled by the Sentencing Council, show that more than 80 of the 193 sentences from 2007 to 2016 will end, including for the Islamist preacher Anjem Choudry, who was jailed in September 2016 for five and a half years. The figures come as the home secretary is set to unveil the government’s updated counter-terrorism policy on Monday. Sajid Javid will warn that there has been a “step change” in the threat from terrorism, drawing a comparison between Islamic extremists and far-right groups. The new policy will include plans to bring forward legislation giving the government new powers to disrupt terror threats at an earlier stage; and to step up the pressure on tech companies to remove extremist material. * * * Kim wields the axe – Pyongyang’s three top military officials have been shown the door, according to a senior US official, just eight days before the on-again, off-again summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore. According to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, the men include the defence chief, the head of the army and the director of the country’s general political bureau. US officials have suggested they didn’t agree with North Korea’s new approach to its southern neighbour and the US. * * * Pay gap between young and old widens – The generational pay divide is leaving younger workers struggling to survive, the council of trades unions has warned. The TUC’s new report, Stuck at the start: young people’s experience of pay and progression, reveals the gap between over- and under-30s has grown from 14.5% in 1998, to 21.9% in last year. “We’re creating a lost generation of younger workers,” says the general secretary, Frances O’Grady. The report is part of the TUC’s push to boost union membership amongst younger workers, including the launch of a new digital service which will provide information about rights at work. * * * More doctors for Britain? – Visa caps on skilled migrants, including more than a thousand doctors denied entry to the UK, may be lifted after the home secretary said he was “taking a fresh look” at the policy. The government has been under pressure to loosen the restrictions on the so-called tier 2 visas, after quotas began to bite in recent months. A No 10 source said the policy was kept under review, and the NHS was always a high priority in ensuring Britain’s economy has the workers it needs. * * * ‘Hard to believe’ – A former New Zealand sex worker has been made a dame in the Queen’s birthday honours list for services to the industry. Catherine Healy, who was arrested in a Wellington brothel in the 1980s, told the Guardian of her surprise: “I was very daunted and found it very hard to believe.” In 1986, Healy helped found the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective, an organisation that supports sex workers’ rights. “Back then, I remember reading stories that spoke about us, but journalists never spoke to us,” she said. “It’s different to think about it today where we are sitting around table as equals with the police and plotting how to make sex work safer and allowing workers to report sexual violence.” * * * ‘Slovenians first’ – The nationalist, anti-immigration Slovenia Democratic party has won just under 25% of the vote in the country’s general election, but it may struggle to pull together a government due to its hardline position on immigration. The party, led by former prime minister Janez Janša, said his party “puts Slovenia, Slovenians first”. Janša, who spent six months in prison in 2014 on bribery charges, enjoyed the backing of Hungary’s Viktor Orban, and effectively evoked memories of more than 500,000 migrants who crossed Slovenia in late 2015 and early 2016, even though most continued on to northern Europe.

With his car company, Tesla, haemorrhaging money and shareholders pushing to dump directors from its board, the once-feted Elon Musk is being labelled as erratic and vengeful, writes Rory Carroll. Musk’s attack last week on the “holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie” drew ire as a man lashing out at negative headlines. He threatened to “create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda.” For some it was was evidence of Musk burrowing into ethical murk. Instead of Iron Man here was Gollum, erratic and vengeful. So how did it come to this? One possible answer: Tesla has skidded into trouble and Musk is blaming the messenger in apparent hope of soothing skittish investors and potential investors. Has that reality overtaken the hype?

Bidda Jones from the RSPCA, together with a group of experts who helped draft a management plan for the estimated 6,000 wild horses in the park, have issued a scathing critique of legislation to formally recognise the cultural and heritage significance of wild horses. They say the bill would “make it impossible to conserve the unique environmental values” of Kosciuszko and urge the government to reconsider. Last month the NSW government scrapped a recommendation from its own environment department to cull brumby numbers in the national park by up to 90% and instead introduced legislation to ensure they are protected. Instead of culling, numbers will be managed by trapping and rehoming programs, supported by a government marketing campaign to promote brumby adoption. The deputy premier, John Barilaro, whose electorate of Monaro includes the national park, told the parliament the horses were part of the “cultural fabric and folklore” of the region. He said the bill was aimed at finding a way to “preserve a sustainable population in a way that minimises harm to the environment”. But the decision has been widely criticised by environmentalists, academics and the Victorian government, which has its own plan to remove more than 1,200 feral horses from the Alpine national park, because of the environmental damage they cause. The Victorian environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, told ABC radio on Monday that the horses were causing “significant damage to the ecosystem”. “Through their legislation they will attribute the same values culturally to the feral horses as they do to the natural environment,” she said. “The two are incompatible, that is the reality. There is some cultural value to these horses in these alpine regions, however they are quite a destructive part of the environment.” On Monday, the RSPCA and other experts said the bill would make it impossible to fulfil the goals of the 2016 brumby management plan they had helped the government to draft. In a letter to members of the NSW government and opposition seen by the Guardian, the RSPCA and members of the NSW government-appointed independent technical reference group said recommendations were being “ignored” by the government. It said the 2016 expert review found that wild horses were having “a significant negative environmental impact” in Kosciuszko and that “doing nothing is not an option”. It also found that trapping and rehoming was not an effective non-lethal means of population control. “The outcome for 70% of trapped horses was long-distance transport and slaughter in an abattoir or knackery, with only 30% of horses being ‘adopted’ for domestication,” the letter stated. The government’s bill would see the establishment of a “wild horse community advisory panel” to advise the National Parks and Wildlife Service on brumby control policy. The panel would include horse riding and alpine tourism groups, many of which oppose horse culling. The experts fear that the appointment of the group, as well as ruling out culling, will mean the management plan is made redundant. It called for the government to reconsider the bill and instead return to the “rigorous scientific and technical advice for future management of wild horses” recommended in 2016. “There is very little detail in the bill about how wild horses will now be managed in [Kosciuszko],” the letter reads. “However, we note that the NSW government has indicated that the heritage management plan will specifically prohibit lethal culling of wild horses in [the national park]. “It will also limit any other management of wild horses to ‘highly sensitive alpine areas’ and such management will be limited to relocation and rehoming. “We urge you to reconsider this approach and, at the very least, ensure that the bill includes the appointment of a new [expert group] to ensure that there is appropriate representation from the scientific community into future management decisions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/jun/04/commonwealth-bank-agrees-to-pay-700m-to-settle-money-laundering-lawsuit","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T00:43:56Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Bank agrees to pay $700m to settle money laundering lawsuit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/04/commonwealth-bank-agrees-to-pay-700m-to-settle-money-laundering-lawsuit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jun/04/commonwealth-bank-agrees-to-pay-700m-to-settle-money-laundering-lawsuit","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Bank agrees to pay $700m to settle money laundering lawsuit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Commonwealth Bank has agreed to pay $700m to settle civil proceedings relating to breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. If the federal court accepts the offer it will be the largest civil penalty in Australia’s corporate history. The announcement follows court-ordered mediation between CBA and the government’s financial intelligence agency, Austrac. The deal would close civil proceedings against CBA, which began 10 months ago. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon In August Austrac announced it was suing CBA for 53,700 alleged breaches of money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. The case related to CBA’s use of intelligent deposit machines, a type of ATM launched in 2012, which let customers anonymously deposit and transfer cash. The investigation, undertaken in partnership with federal police, NSW police and Western Australia police, found that the machines were being used to launder the illicit proceeds of crime. CBA has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $700m and Austrac’s legal costs of $2.5m to end the matter. It had originally provided for an estimated penalty of $375m. The bank’s share price jumped from $68.70 to $70.23 - or 2.2% - after the announcement, a sign shareholders were relieved about the size of the penalty. By midday the share price had settled near $69.70. “This agreement, while it still needs to be approved by the federal court, brings certainty to one of the most significant issues we have faced,” CBA’s chief executive, Matt Comyn, said on Monday. “While not deliberate, we fully appreciate the seriousness of the mistakes we made. Our agreement today is a clear acknowledgement of our failures and is an important step towards moving the bank forward.” In reaching the agreement with Austrac, CBA has admitted it contravened the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 on 53,750 occasions. It has also accepted that: It failed to carry out an appropriate assessment of the money laundering and terrorism financing risks of its intelligent deposit machines before October 2017. It failed to complete the introduction of appropriate controls to mitigate and manage the risks before April 2018. It failed to provide 53,506 threshold transaction reports to Austrac on time for cash transactions of $10,000 or more through IDMs from November 2012 to September 2015, having a total value of about $625m. For three years it did not comply with the requirements of its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing program relating to monitoring transactions on 778,370 accounts. It failed to report suspicious matters on time, or at all, involving transactions in the tens of millions of dollars. Even after it became aware of suspected money laundering or structuring on CBA accounts, it did not monitor its customers to mitigate and manage money laundering and terrorism financing risks, including the ongoing risks of doing business with those customers. Austrac’s chief executive, Nicole Rose, said the agreement sent a strong message to the financial industry. “As we have seen in this case, criminals will exploit poor business practices to launder the proceeds of their crimes,” Rose said. “This has real impacts on the everyday lives of Australians and puts the community at risk by increasing opportunities for terrorists to support attacks here and overseas, and enabling organised crime groups to peddle drugs to our families and friends. “We know that businesses are the first line of defence in protecting the community and our financial system from criminal abuse, and it is critical for [money laundering and counter-terrorism financing] compliance and risk management to be embedded in business strategy and practices.” Comyn apologised to Australians for letting them down. “We have changed senior leadership in the key roles overseeing financial crimes compliance supported by significant resources and clear accountabilities,” he said. The attorney general, Christian Porter, said: “I congratulate Austrac, its CEO and legal team for their engagement with me which has enabled this matter to be resolved in such a successful and speedy way.” The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said CBA’s disregard of its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism obligations had allowed criminals to exploit its systems and put the Australian community at risk. “This very large number of breaches over several years is unacceptable and should never have been allowed to happen,” Dutton said. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the law was non-negotiable, especially when it came to the country’s largest financial institutions. “The government is serious about enforcing any breaches,” he said. “Banks should be leaders in ensuring their systems cannot be compromised by criminals seeking to launder money or finance terrorist activities.” Labor’s opposition assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, said the size of the payout reflected the gravity of CBA’s wrongdoing. “Again it reinforces the call we have been making for the last two years for a royal commission,” he told Sky News. “We have seen from CBA alone, scandals ranging from children’s bank accounts to charging dead people for work that hadn’t been done.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/06/cancer-treatment-latest-news-genetic-profile-medicine-life-span-","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Tailoring cancer treatment to genetic profile extends lives, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/06/cancer-treatment-latest-news-genetic-profile-medicine-life-span-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jun/06/cancer-treatment-latest-news-genetic-profile-medicine-life-span-","fields":{"headline":"Tailoring cancer treatment to genetic profile extends lives, study finds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Cancer patients with diseases that are difficult to treat may live longer if doctors engage in genetic sequencing and then match treatment to their illness, a long-term “precision medicine” study has found. The study represents part of a push in cancer treatment to personalize medicine for specific patients, matching known tumor mutations to treatments in an effort to extend patients’ lives. It is the first long-term study to compare tailored methods to traditional, more generic treatment. “All patients should have access to next generation sequencing and I believe in the next few years we are going to see this approach dramatically improving outcomes,” said Apostolia Maria Tsimberidou, a professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, who led the research. “We need to know what is really causing these diseases so we can treat them properly.” The study was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco) in Chicago, the world’s largest gathering of cancer specialists. The study looked at more than 3,700 people with cancer that had proved difficult to treat and who had already undergone other types of treatments. Their ages ranged from 16 to 86, with a median of 57. Included in the study were gastrointestinal (24.2%), gynecological (19.4%), breast (13.5%), skin (11.9%) and lung (8.7%) cancers. Of those patients, 1,307 had a known mutation, and 711 received treatment based on that genetic profile. Those patients were twice as likely to live three years (15%) versus those who did not receive tailored treatments (7%). Patients were also six times more likely to live 10 years if they received tailored treatment, at 6% of the sample compared with just 1% for those who received general treatment. Another, more comprehensive trial is due to take place at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, which will address an admitted shortcoming in the previous study, by using randomized trials. Tsimberidou said her own clinic had witnessed the potential of personalized cancer medicines. One patient has been kept alive despite being diagnosed in 2011 with an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma. The same cancer killed the former US vice-president Joe Biden’s son, Beau, who died in 2015, and former British cabinet minister Tessa Jowell, last month. Cancer research is increasingly pushing for patients to have tumors sequenced for personalized treatment after analyzing key details within the DNA. Some types of genetic testing are already on the market. Another major study presented at the conference found that many women with the most common form of early breast cancer do not benefit from chemotherapy. That test looked only at 21 genes. Researchers believe more detailed genetic testing is on the horizon. Dr Catherine Diefenbach, an Asco expert, said scientists had barely “scratched the surface” of the potential of precision medicine. “Now with faster and more robust genetic tests, we can help even more patients by treating the cancer based on its genetic makeup rather than solely on its location in the body,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/22/hungarian-nationalist-rock-opera-to-retell-1920s-grievances","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T04:00:17Z","webTitle":"Hungarian nationalist rock opera to retell 1920s grievances","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/hungarian-nationalist-rock-opera-to-retell-1920s-grievances","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/22/hungarian-nationalist-rock-opera-to-retell-1920s-grievances","fields":{"headline":"Hungarian nationalist rock opera to retell 1920s grievances","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The signing of a 1920 peace treaty does not immediately sound like ideal subject matter for musical theatre. But on Friday and Saturday night, hundreds of singers, dancers, acrobats and horsemen will fill the vast concrete expanse of Budapest’s Heroes’ Square for performances of Trianon: the rock opera. The treaty of Trianon sliced up Hungary in the aftermath of the first world war and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It still features heavily in Hungarians’ historical imagination 98 years later, and the so-called “Trianon trauma” is one of the building blocks for the nationalism of Viktor Orbán’s government. “Trianon – the word and the subject matter – has been stirring passions in our country for a hundred years,” Gábor Koltay, the rock opera’s director and a member of Orbán’s Fidesz party, said at a recent press conference. “We will show how the events of 1920 – the dismemberment of the country – impacted our lives.” Orbán, who recently won a third consecutive term as prime minister, has cannily taken advantage of the sense of historical victimhood and loss among many Hungarians. It has helped him deliver a hard-right agenda, which this week saw parliament pass the so-called Stop Soros law that criminalises any individual or group that offers to help an illegal immigrant. At Trianon, Hungary was deprived of more than half of its pre-war territory and population. Many of these people were not ethnic Hungarians, but the treaty left more than 3 million Hungarians outside the borders of the new Hungary. “Around 2 million of these Hungarians were living right on the borders, in majority-Hungarian areas, so any fair treaty based on self-determination would have included them,” said András Mink, a historian. When Orbán’s government came to power in 2010, one of its first acts was to establish a “day of national unity” on 4 June, the anniversary of the signing of the Trianon treaty. Orbán quickly made ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states eligible for Hungarian citizenship. These new citizens – in Slovakia, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine – have voted overwhelmingly for Orbán’s Fidesz party, giving it an electoral boost. Orbán has painted himself as the man who has led Hungary on a path back to recovering from some of the mental and moral losses at Trianon, if not the territorial ones. “Since Trianon we have never been so close to bringing our nation back to self-confidence and vitality as we are now,” Orbán said in a speech last year. “And if Hungary has a government that will serve foreign, globalist interests then Hungarians will lose this historic opportunity, and not just for one electoral cycle but for decades to come.” Few Hungarians believe that a redrawing of borders to regain lost land is possible or even desirable, although the opinion is still occasionally aired in pro-government media. More often, government figures have called for “moral reparations” and used the painful memory of Trianon as a rallying call for modern-day nationalism, and even to back up Orbán’s virulent anti-migration philosophy. In a letter to locals asking them to vote against EU migration quotas in a 2016 referendum organised by Orbán’s government, István Vitányi, a Fidesz MP, wrote: “At Trianon we lost the majority of our country and we cannot lose the rest of it. So vote no!” Orbán’s critics say history teaching is one of many areas where the government is attempting to exercise increasing control. “There used to be a relatively free textbook market; now there’s basically a monopoly,” said László Miklósi, chairman of Hungary’s Independent Association of History Teachers. He said textbooks now offered a simplistic take on the “Trianon dictate” and Hungary’s victimhood. “Nobody sensible can doubt that what happened to Hungary in 1920 was unfair; however, it’s better if students can form their own opinions from looking at the sources.” The approach also stretched to more recent history, Miklósi said. Two years ago the association fought a court battle to have a government-funded history textbook withdrawn that painted Orbán as a national hero and asked students to write an essay in support of an anti-migration speech by the PM. The classroom is not the only place where the lessons of history appear tailored to an official narrative that portrays Hungary purely as a victim. A 2014 monument to the Nazi occupation in a central Budapest square has been criticised for whitewashing the role of Hungarians in the Holocaust. It depicts Hungary as the archangel Gabriel under attack from the German imperial eagle. Locals have created a rival, makeshift memorial on the pavement by the monument, dedicated to “historical truth”. Mária Schmidt, an Orbán loyalist, runs the Terror House, a central Budapest museum that chronicles the horrors wrought on Hungary by both the Nazis and the Soviets. Her latest book, heavily advertised inside the museum, is a collection of rants against the alleged Islamisation of Europe and “self-assured and arrogant” migrants who are enacting a long-held plan of eastern peoples to occupy Europe. A magazine controlled by Schmidt recently ran a list of 200 “mercenaries” supposedly paid by the Hungarian-American financier George Soros to destroy Hungary – an eyebrow-raising gambit from someone who runs a museum dedicated to the memory of victims of repressive regimes that drew up similar enemy lists. Orbán’s critics say the prime minister has exploited Hungary’s difficult history to push his nationalist messages, but they also acknowledge that the trials of the 20th century, and particularly the dismemberment at Trianon, provide fertile ground for doing so. “When you want to track down the roots of anti-western and anti-liberal sentiment in Hungary, you should go back to that moment in history, when for many the lesson was that the ideas of liberty and self-determination are valid only for the western powers,” said Mink."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/03/joe-root-england-pakistan-headingley","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T19:26:16Z","webTitle":"Joe Root warns that win over Pakistan must not ‘paper over cracks’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/03/joe-root-england-pakistan-headingley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/03/joe-root-england-pakistan-headingley","fields":{"headline":"Joe Root warns that win over Pakistan must not ‘paper over cracks’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Joe Root has warned that England’s series-levelling win against Pakistan must not “paper over the cracks” despite expressing some personal satisfaction that his players delivered on their orders to show more pride and passion. The three-day innings victory at Headingley stopped what had become a worrying rot for Root’s side, who had gone winless over the course of their Antipodean winter and then hurtled into a full-blown crisis with the crushing defeat at Lord’s last week. Questions were asked of their head coach, Trevor Bayliss, while the former captain Michael Vaughan set the hare running on a war of words with Stuart Broad after suggesting either he or Jimmy Anderson should miss out in Leeds to “ruffle a few feathers” among the squad. Speaking after Broad had fittingly taken the final wicket to cap a fine individual performance, Root said: “I asked the guys to play with pride and passion and you saw that on the field. I think there is an element of that that comes out through criticism. “To play for such a long time at this level like our senior guys have, you need to have that. They need to make sure they harness everything that they did leading into this game. It’s very important we don’t paper over the cracks and think this is going to be us [fixed] for ever – we have to make sure we don’t find ourselves in those positions like last week.” While Vaughan’s theory was always unlikely to come to pass, defeat here would have seen England tumble to No 7 in the world Test rankings and certainly increased the pressure on Bayliss given Ed Smith has just begun his selection role and Root is only a year into captaincy. “Trevor is the easy target when the side is losing,” Root said. “It would have been very easy for the whole group to get tense and have a negative feel but Trevor’s experience pulled us through. You saw it on the field, the energy the guys had. The confidence after that great start was there all week and that is a big thing for the team moving forward.” The chief positives to emerge from the 1-1 series draw came from the two standout selections at the start. Jos Buttler’s two half-centuries validated his return, while Dom Bess followed a maiden half-century on debut at Lord’s with 49 from nightwatchman here and then claimed his first three Test wickets as Pakistan crumbled on Sunday. Root said: “The one thing we knew we were going to get from Dom was that character. He was padded up for 45 minutes, desperate to get in as nightwatchman, because he wanted to be involved in the game. He wants to bowl, he wants the ball in the field – that’s the sort of player he is. It’s no surprise to me that you get the results you’ve seen this week from him.” England’s thoughts now turn to their strongest format – one-day cricket – before the Test series against India in August, with a one-off match against Scotland in Edinburgh on Sunday followed by a five-game series with a somewhat callow looking Australia side. Ben Stokes, who missed out in Leeds with a hamstring tear, is confirmed to sit out the weekend fixture and the “first part” of the Australia series that starts on 13 June. Dawid Malan comes into the squad for the former, while Sam Billings has been added for the latter. Pakistan can reflect on two Test wins from three on their tour of Ireland and England, having beaten the Irish in Malahide ahead of this drawn series, and some fine performances from Mohammad Abbas – the man of the series – and the teenage all-rounder Shadab Khan. Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan’s captain, said: “When we came here people thought that we will not win one game. The way we played at Lord’s was perfect, the batting, the bowling the fielding. It’s disappointing that we had a chance to win the series but we didn’t play well here. I am still proud of my young team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/03/mps-call-on-may-to-decriminalise-abortion-in-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T18:34:57Z","webTitle":"MPs call on May to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/03/mps-call-on-may-to-decriminalise-abortion-in-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/03/mps-call-on-may-to-decriminalise-abortion-in-northern-ireland","fields":{"headline":"MPs call on May to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A cross-party group of backbench MPs will seek to ramp up pressure on Theresa May to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland on Monday, as they demand an emergency debate on the issue. Campaigners have been pressing for the government to liberalise the abortion law there after a historic referendum in the Republic of Ireland last month backed reform, and a number of current and former ministers have expressed support. MPs including Labour’s Stella Creasy and the Lib Dem deputy leader, Jo Swinson, hope to amend the domestic violence bill due to be tabled in parliament shortly, in a bid to repeal arcane legislation that makes abortion illegal in Northern Ireland. They are calling for an emergency debate on Monday, which would force a government minister – most likely the women and equalities minister, Penny Mordaunt – to come to the House of Commons and explain publicly why the right to abortion should not be extended. If a debate is granted by the Speaker, it would also reveal the scale of support among MPs for a bid to change the law. The Offences against the Person Act (OPA) was written in 1861 and makes it a crime for any woman to cause her own abortion. The 1967 Abortion Act exempted women in England and Wales – but the restrictions continue to apply in Northern Ireland. Creasy and her supporters believe they can force all parts of the UK to reconsider their abortion laws by repealing sections of the 1861 Act. With the power-sharing government in Stormont suspended, the government is sensitive to claims that it would be interfering in devolved issues if it took action. But the campaigners insist repealing the OPA would simply open the way for politicians in Northern Ireland to make their own decision about how to proceed. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, whose MPs back the government, has taken a robust line against decriminalisation. She told Sky News on Sunday that former Sinn Féin voters had been contacting her to say they had switched support to her party over the issue. “I have had emails from nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland not quite believing what is going on and saying they will be voting for the DUP because they believe we are the only party that supports the unborn.” Foster also criticised the celebrations in the Republic of Ireland after voters overwhelmingly backed reform in last month’s referendum, saying she found it “quite distasteful to see people dancing about on the streets”. Some Conservative MPs sympathetic to the cause of liberalising abortion rules in the province believe a referendum should first be held to gauge public opinion. “They need to have a referendum – now,” said Anna Soubry. But critics warn that could open the way for other highly contentious issues to be settled in the same way. Sinn Féin responded to last month’s referendum result by pressing its case for a referendum on a united Ireland. “I think in terms of the conversation at home now it’s very much about a union referendum, it’s very much about the constitutional future,” the party’s vice president, Michelle O’Neill, said. The Tory deputy chairman, James Cleverly, claimed last week the bid to amend the domestic violence bill had “little to do with women’s right to choose, and everything to do with opportunistic party political game playing”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/03/letters-sir-richard-body-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T17:08:36Z","webTitle":"Letters: Sir Richard Body had a strong sense of history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/03/letters-sir-richard-body-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/03/letters-sir-richard-body-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Letters: Sir Richard Body had a strong sense of history","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Giles Oakley writes: On the one occasion I met the Tory MP Sir Richard Body he made a great impression. In 1987 I was interviewing him for a BBC2 Open Space documentary entitled Aggro Chemicals presented by self-taught scientist and campaigning organic dairy farmer Mark Purdey. Sir Richard supported Mark in his principled refusal to comply with a Ministry of Agriculture order to apply an organo-phosphate-based compound on his cattle to prevent a hypothetical infestation of warble fly. Mark, preferring his own organic treatment, took the matter all the way to the high court, and won. As chair of the House of Commons select committee for agriculture, Sir Richard invited Mark to give evidence to MPs about his evolving theories regarding the dangers of OP pesticides and his belief that they were at the heart of the “mad-cow disease” crisis. I know how much Mark, a mud-on-his-boots and straw-in-his-hair idealist, valued Sir Richard’s support and encouragement to keep on pushing the issue. I warmed to the squire-like MP with his old-school courtesy and twinkly eye for mischief. He had a strong sense of history and he told me he had backed the rebellious Mark in part because he likened him to a “village Hampden”, in honour of the 17th-century parliamentarian John Hampden, who had refused to pay “ship money” to Charles I. Charles Harris writes: When preparing my BBC2 satirical documentary Sex, Drugs and Dinner in 1991, I found that Sir Richard Body was sharp, had a very dry sense of humour and was passionately committed to the environment. Indeed, his views were so diametrically opposed to those of his farmer constituents in south Lincolnshire that I finally asked him why on earth they voted for him. “They would vote,” he said laconically, “for a pig if it wore a blue rosette.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/03/maria-sharapova-serena-williams-french-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T16:40:50Z","webTitle":"Maria Sharapova has steely will to upset unseeded Serena Williams | Kevin Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/03/maria-sharapova-serena-williams-french-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/03/maria-sharapova-serena-williams-french-open","fields":{"headline":"Maria Sharapova has steely will to upset unseeded Serena Williams","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thunder and lightning are expected to light up Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, and that’s only the weather forecast. After the deluge of words that accompanied the most anticipated collision of this French Open there is a gathering conviction here that Maria Sharapova will emerge from her fourth-round match on Monday celebrating her first win over Serena Williams in 19 matches, leavened only by the obligatory nod of consolation. They might also swap an air-kiss of the check (double, not triple) – or half a smile. They are, after all, mature professionals. Yet, whatever the cosmetics applied in the interests of balance, good taste and commerce, there is no denying the heat between them is not generated by anything other than respect and trepidation. And what a story they have authored, not as collaborators but arch enemies. They have not met since January 2016, when Williams defeated her in the Australian Open quarter-finals. No sooner had Sharapova packed her bags than she failed a test for the banned substance meldonium – which she announced at a stage-managed press conference in a dowdy Los Angeles hotel in March, pre-empting the official statement by the International Tennis Federation. Banishment followed. For a year since she has been rebuilding her career, now ranked 30 in the world. Williams, meanwhile, went on to earn $8.9m in prize money and $20m in endorsements in 2016, becoming the highest paid female athlete in the world. The following year she beat her sister Venus in the Australian Open final, carrying her recently conceived baby. The birth was complicated and painful. When she returned to the majors here last weekend, she brought her daughter, Olympia, and wore a black catsuit to help control blood clots that have troubled her since giving birth. Their rivalry is not an even sporting one but a fight for the love of the fans – as well as sponsors – and their place in history. Williams, whose hauteur at 36 has garnered some media critics, has some close friends in the game – notably Venus, Caroline Wozniacki and Marion Bartoli – while the 31-year-old Sharapova remains distant in the locker room, not to say regal. Her fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova has understanding words for her but, generally, other players do not get many invites to her photo-shoots. Others sports would crave such a rivalry. Boxing had to wait more than five years for Floyd Mayweather to settle his differences with Manny Pacquiao. Once. And, while Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have honoured each other’s space in golf, even Lefty is now supportive of Woods’s comeback – and practised with him last week. Williams and Sharapova are different – from each other and everyone else. Nobody matches them for bloody-mindedness and staying power. However, if they have one shared interest it is their edgy relationship with the media and, in recent months, they have launched their own approved responses: Sharapova in a documentary put out by her agent IMG as well as a sugary book Unstoppable: My Life So Far; and Williams in a five‑part documentary being shown on Eurosport. Neither would win a prize for objectivity, although Williams does not indulge the sort of score‑settling that marks Sharapova’s output. “... People talk about Serena’s strength, her serve and confidence, how her particular game matches up to my particular game, and, sure there is truth to all of that,” Sharapova writes of her win over Williams in the 2004 Wimbledon final. “But, to me, the real answer was there, in this locker room, where I was changing and she was bawling. I think Serena hated me for being the skinny kid who beat her, against all odds, at Wimbledon.” When that was put to Williams on Saturday night after she had beaten Julia Görges in two quick sets, she looked surprised but not shaken. Her response was measured and clever. “The book was 100% hearsay – at least all the stuff I read and the quotes that I read, which was a little bit disappointing.” 15-love. “What happens there should definitely maybe stay there.” 30-love. “I don’t have any negative feelings towards her.” 40-love. “I feel negativity is taught. Women, especially, should bring each other up.” Game. And, if Williams can dredge up a similarly sharp response on court, perhaps it will be set and match as well. She will not want for motivation now. Sharapova already has hers: 19 defeats in 21 matches. What is remarkable about her – and needs no public relations gloss – is her frightening determination to ignore adversity, even when crushed by a pile of statistics. It takes the heart of a lioness to keep going back for more the way she does. She will scream and glower, allowing not a trace of warmth to show, and, given she is five years younger and has more match fitness than Williams, she will make every point a last-ball slugging feast. Indeed, if she fulfils the majority of predictions here – having looked devastatingly good thrashing the world No 6 Karolina Pliskova in the third round – and actually beats Williams, it is difficult to imagine she will be able to contain that ice-cool facade for long. She might even be caught bawling in the locker room."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/03/greece-tourism-at-record-high-amid-alarm-over-environmental-cost","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T14:56:23Z","webTitle":"Greece tourism at record high amid alarm over environmental cost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/03/greece-tourism-at-record-high-amid-alarm-over-environmental-cost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/03/greece-tourism-at-record-high-amid-alarm-over-environmental-cost","fields":{"headline":"Greece tourism at record high amid alarm over environmental cost","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Greece is braced for another bumper year. The tourists will not stop coming. For every one of its citizens, three foreign visitors – 32 million in total – will arrive this year, more than at any other time since records began. It’s an extraordinary feat for a country that has battled with bankruptcy, at times has been better known for its protests and riots and, only three years ago, narrowly escaped euro ejection. Tourism is the heavy industry that has helped keep catastrophe at bay. But is Greece almost too successful for its own good? Tourist numbers have increased by an additional two million every year for the past three years. Arrivals from China alone have doubled since 2017. But with forecasts predicting record numbers over the next decade, a growing number are asking: can Greece really cope? The prominent environmentalist Nikos Chrysogelos says: “We can’t keep having more and more tourists.” He says he now shudders at the prospect of record numbers of arrivals. “We can’t have small islands, with small communities, hosting 1 million tourists over a few months. There’s a danger of the infrastructure not being prepared, of it all becoming a huge boomerang if we only focus on numbers and don’t look at developing a more sustainable model of tourism.” Few would agree more than Nikos Zorzos, the mayor of Santorini. Last year, two million holidaymakers were drawn to the Cycladic isle, forcing Zorzos to limit cruise-ship passengers disembarking daily to 8,000 people. A growing number of tourists are from the newly wealthy Asian middle classes, with many flocking to the destination to get married or renew vows against its backdrop of famous orange skies, white chalk houses, and the volcanic sea-filled crater. The increase is such that local officials increasingly speak of tourism as more of a curse than a blessing. Authorities, fearing the strain that it puts on the natural resources and infrastructure of the island, have been sounding the alarm. Although the island is only 76km2 in size, more than 5.5million overnight stays were recorded there last year, with consumption levels of energy and water skyrocketing. “It’s a radical rise and we are forever playing catch-up,” Zorzos lamented, rattling off the figures. “We have built numerous desalination plants and are in the process of erecting the biggest one in Greece, but in five years’ time I worry even that won’t be enough.” Greece’s growing appeal as a global destination comes despite the rebound in popularity of Turkey, Egypt and other regional neighbours badly hit by security concerns. Few would contend that the sector has not also been beneficial. At least one in five Greeks work in tourism. As the engine of an economy that has shrunk by more than 25% under fiscal retrenchment, tourism is among the few success stories of a country that came perilously close to insolvency during the euro crisis. Industry figures speak of foreign visitors as a lifejacket in the hardest of times. Tourism is the nation’s biggest foreign currency earner, generating nearly a quarter of its output. The necessity to survive has made the sector more inventive. On the remotest of islands, boutique hotels and have begun to appear. For many, they are antidotes to the gruelling austerity that has been the price of emergency bailouts from Germany and other international creditors for propping up an economy encumbered by staggering debt. The striking growth of tourist numbers is also the result of hard work. Greek officials have done much to improve services and, after decades of focusing on mass sun, sand and sea holidays, the industry has become more eclectic and diverse, with the season extending into the winter and spring. Asia has also been targeted, with bookings from China ballooning since direct flights between Athens and Beijing were launched last September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/03/assisted-dying-law-is-about-choice-not-getting-rid-of-disabled-people","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T16:59:33Z","webTitle":"Assisted dying law is about choice, not getting rid of disabled people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/03/assisted-dying-law-is-about-choice-not-getting-rid-of-disabled-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/03/assisted-dying-law-is-about-choice-not-getting-rid-of-disabled-people","fields":{"headline":"Assisted dying law is about choice, not getting rid of disabled people","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Disabled people are too self-regarding when, like Jamie Hale, they make out that legalising assisted dying is all about getting rid of disabled people (We’re told we are a burden. No wonder disabled people fear assisted suicide, 1 June). Nor is it, as Jamie suggests, about licensing the deliberate taking of someone else’s life. It is about giving terminally ill, mentally competent people the choice of an assisted death when palliative care no longer suffices. All importantly, the terminally ill person has to ask and two independent doctors have to agree. Though they may overlap, terminally ill and disabled people are distinct groups. Being disabled myself and a lifelong campaigner for disabled people’s rights, I can testify that not all disabled people are opposed to assisted dying. In a 2015 Populus poll, 86% of disabled people supported the choice of assisted dying for terminally ill people. Recent proposals for assisted dying legislation actually contain more safeguards against disabled people being officiously treated as terminally ill against their wishes than exist at the moment. Assisted dying legislation is about giving people choice and control at the end of life. This is what disabled people campaign for in every other aspect of life. Why would they not also wish for it at the end? Colin Low House of Lords • On assisted dying, Jamie Hale correctly says there is already a right to refuse medical treatment. This means that people who are dying and are kept alive by interventions can refuse them, and die. Yet those who are dying but are not reliant on medical interventions still cannot control the timing and manner of their death. This is surely unfair. Why should their only choice be to starve themselves to death? The Oregon law on assisted dying has not been widened in scope since 1997, and there is no evidence of abuse. That’s all we are asking for in UK: the same choice for a good death for people with terminal illness. It seems a contradiction that the disability rights movement campaigns for autonomy in every other area of life except this one, where it claims that dying disabled people are vulnerable and cannot decide for themselves. Tom Shakespeare Professor of disability research, University of East Anglia • I read with great disappointment Jamie Hale’s article on assisted dying. As so often is the case, the law change being proposed is being misunderstood. I have incurable cancer, and once I become terminally ill, in the last few weeks of my life, I wish I could have the choice to reduce my period of suffering by requesting an assisted death. The proposed law would safeguard against anyone other than a terminally ill, mentally competent adult from being able to request an assisted death. Safeguards would include two doctors to confirm diagnosis and mental competency and a high court judge to grant permission. I find it incredible that so many people believe they have the right to decide how my life will end.

As the council of attorney generals prepared to meet in Perth on Friday the federal social services minister, Dan Tehan, told Guardian Australia that sticking points with WA, including who was responsible for redress for 3,000 Commonwealth child migrants settled in WA after the second world war, had been resolved. “We have agreed on all remaining issues and the WA attorney general is now seeking approval to join the scheme through their cabinet processes,” Tehan said. The redress scheme and how it should operate formed a significant part of the recommendations handed down by the child sexual abuse inquiry in December. While the commission made some 400 recommendations, much work since then has focused on establishing the redress scheme and getting the state and territory governments, churches, charities and other non-government institutions to sign up. With the Catholic, Anglican and Uniting churches all on board, and the states and territories reaching agreements with the federal government, most eligible survivors will now be covered by the scheme set to start on 1 July. A Senate inquiry into the scheme is due to report on 15 June. Survivors met Malcolm Turnbull’s office in Canberra this week to have their say on a national apology, which the prime minister has committed to make by the end of the year. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The president of the Blue Knot Foundation, Cathy Kezelman, said abuse advocacy groups and survivors were keen to see other key recommendations addressed, such as the proposal for a National Office for Child Safety and a national framework to prevent child sexual abuse. More than 50 other recommendations require intergovernmental collaboration. But redress had been a priority for survivors, Kezelman said. “Redress is only a part of survivors receiving the right support but it is an important part,” she said. “I know the federal government has been working very hard to get everything in place for redress to happen. This is a great result, as it was looking dismal, at times, in terms of it truly being a national scheme.” But she said support groups and governments needed to brace themselves for the thousands of victims who would race to sign up and who would be seeking information about their eligibility from July. “There will be a lot of work to do to communicate how to go about this process,” she said. State governments have begun reforming their laws to meet the royal commission recommendations. On Wednesday NSW introduced a bill establishing new offences for failure to report and failure to protect against child abuse, and requiring courts not to take into account an offender’s good character when sentencing for historical offences where their reputation facilitated the offending, among other amendments. The NSW attorney general, Mark Speakman, has committed to respond to all of the royal commission’s recommendations relevant to NSW by the end of the month. “The royal commission laid bare the appalling abuse inflicted on children in the very institutions within which they were entitled to feel safe,” he told Guardian Australia. “NSW recognised this by being the first state to pass legislation enabling the national redress scheme to proceed and recently introducing a bill responding to the royal commission’s criminal justice report.” In May, Victoria passed new laws quashing a legal loophole preventing child abuse survivors from suing some organisations for their abuse. Under the new laws, unincorporated organisations – including religious institutions – will be given an opportunity to nominate a legal entity with sufficient assets for child abuse survivors to sue.

He predicted MPs would demand the government seek the EU’s agreement for the UK to remain in the EU to give time for further talks beyond the March 2019 deadline. He admittted the request for more negotiating time may be rejected by the EU, forcing the UK out of the EU without any clear agreement in place. Mandelson, one of the main remain strategists, said the true crisis for the government was likely to come in the autumn if it emerged that the Conservatives’ internal fault lines meant the party had not found the time or means to negotiate a deal, especially over the prevention of a hard border in Ireland. The EU wants a deal settled by the October EU heads of government meeting so as to give time for the agreement to be ratified by national parliaments ahead of the UK’s planned formal departure in March next year, the deadline for the two-year negotiating period allowed in the Article 50 negotiating process. Speaking at a meeting of the Labour centre-left group Progress, Mandelson said: “The UK government is not going to be able to complete this process in the prescribed two-year period, and Britain needs to ask, and I hope the EU 27 can agree, to stop the clock and allow more time to have a serious thrashing out of the issues and a proper confrontation of the trade offs.” He said Theresa May had dug herself into a deeper hole with a set of red lines that had made it impossible for the UK to reciprocate to concessions made by the EU. He said: “It now means the UK has run out of time to dig Britain’s negotiating position out of the hole, which is why we need to ask for time-out, suspension of the timetable and more time for further scales to fall from more people’s eyes, including in the cabinet, about the colossal economic price we will pay if we continue on the current course.” He said there was no majority in the Commons for a no-deal option in which the UK left with no agreement on its future economic relationship with the EU. He admitted many EU leaders will resist an extension of the article 50 deadline of March 2019 partly because the European parliamentary elections next spring are due to be held without UK involvement. He said: “the EU would love the UK to change its mind, or meet it half way, but now they now feel the best thing is to have done with it, to get it done with, so they can get on with their lives. So they would like a smooth glide path of the UK out of the EU, if that is going to remain the settled view of the British people.” “Therefore to postpone the date of leaving is not attractive to them,” he admitted. It has been argued that, as a compromise, the EU and UK could agree a blind Brexit in which the two sides agree a two-year standstill transition in the autumn, but only sign a limited heads of agreement very broadly setting out the future economic relationship between the EU and the UK. Mandelson argued that if the UK left on those terms, the UK would be negotiating its future trading relationship with the EU from a weaker bargaining position outside the EU. But he remained optimistic that British public opinion was beginning to shift towards a rethink as the sheer complexity of Brexit was becoming ever more clear. He said: “Sometimes I wonder whether Brexit is going to defeat Brexit.”Mandelson, who is reviled in sections of the modern Labour party, insisted he was agitating about Brexit not to undermine Corbyn but because he cared about the future of the UK. At the same time he said: “Labour did not yet have a programme, or the planks of a manifesto, coming together that people will vote for at the moment. We have to engage in a process of public inquiry, innovation and rebuilding, which is all too absent in our party. There is a policy vacuum in the party.” Supporters of Corbyn believe his manifesto in the 2017 election was one of the sources of his stronger than expected election showing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/04/breast-screening-errors-may-have-caused-74-premature-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T19:54:51Z","webTitle":"Breast screening errors may have led to 74 premature deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/04/breast-screening-errors-may-have-caused-74-premature-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/04/breast-screening-errors-may-have-caused-74-premature-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Breast screening errors may have led to 74 premature deaths","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Mistakes in the breast screening process had a “devastating impact” on the lives of a large number of women and may have led to the premature deaths of as many as 74, the health secretary has admitted. While the estimate – initially feared to be in the hundreds – was lowered on Monday, Jeremy Hunt nevertheless acknowledged the harm caused to tens of thousands of people by IT failings that persisted for nearly a decade. “I would like to repeat my wholehearted and unreserved apology to the women affected and their families,” he said in a written statement to parliament. Hunt said that, while England’s cancer screening programme is “widely recognised as world-leading”, women were “let down” by the failing, which led to “thousands of women aged between 68 and 71 not being invited to their final breast screening between 2009 and May 2018”. He said: “It is now clear that this may have resulted in significant harm for a small number of women, while thousands more have faced unnecessary distress and anxiety as they waited to hear if they have been affected. Fiona Hazell, a director at the charity Breast Cancer Now, said: “It’s good to hear that fewer women have been affected by the screening error than previously announced, but this will be no more reassuring to those who missed their invitations. She added that, for those women who developed breast cancers that could have been picked up, “this remains a devastating failure”. NHS records show as many as 174,000 women were affected by failures in the programme – of whom, 130,000 are still alive. Between 135 and 270 were feared to have had their lives cut short as a result of the mistake, Jeremy Hunt warned when he revealed the problem in May. The estimate has now been revised down to fewer than 75. Hunt said he wanted to “reassure [those affected] that we are working hard to understand what went wrong and what we need to do to stop similar incidents from happening in the future”. Public Health England contacted 195,565 women registered with a GP in England by the end of May who had missed their screening. All the affected women known to have moved to other parts of the UK – 503 women in Scotland, 94 women in Wales and 72 women in Northern Ireland – were also written to. Nearly 27,000 women have now received an appointment for screening and an emergency helpline set up to speak to women concerned they had been affected has received 46,000 calls. All those affected who want to be screened will be seen by the end of October, Hunt promised. Hazell said: “While this more complete information offers some much-needed clarity, further action from the government is needed urgently. With tens of thousands of women having rightly been offered catch-up appointments, we need to see screening workforce expanded to cope with the increased demand while maintaining routine screening.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/04/canada-poo-plane-blame-town-hit-by-slops-from-sky","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T20:51:58Z","webTitle":"Canada: anguished drivers say plane to blame for poo that fell from sky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/04/canada-poo-plane-blame-town-hit-by-slops-from-sky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/04/canada-poo-plane-blame-town-hit-by-slops-from-sky","fields":{"headline":"Canada: anguished drivers say plane to blame for poo that fell from sky","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Susan Allen and her son were just driving home from lunch with her mother in the city of Kelowna, British Columbia, when she pulled up at a red light. It was a cloudless summer afternoon, so the car’s windows were down and sunroof open when it was abruptly deluged with what Allan described as a “pile of mud falling from the sky”. The pair were quickly overwhelmed by a foul smell, which confirmed that it was not mud that had struck them, but liquid human faeces. “It looked like slops of wheaty, lumpy poo,” Allen told the Guardian. She quickly concluded that the brown liquid had fallen from a plane as it landed at the airport nearby. “You could feel the drops hitting you. We were both pretty upset. I cried and couldn’t sleep until four in the morning,” she said. Transport Canada – which oversees aviation in the country – is investigating the 9 May incident, declaring that it “takes all reports of possible debris coming from aircraft very seriously”. Allan eventually managed to clean out her car with the help of family, but the incident left her with an eye infection which her doctor said was the result of “being inundated with overhead sewage”. Allan’s suspicion that the deluge of waste came from a plane has been supported by experts. It is not uncommon for human waste to fall from planes in the form of hazardous ice chunks – called “blue ice”. But the environmental scientist Robert Young told the Kelowna Capital News that the incident could have begun with a leak from a plane’s plumbing system which froze on the underside of the fuselage. “If it started as being kind of a ‘poopsicle’ on the bottom of a plane, then it could easily thaw and become liquid as it came down,” Young said. It is unclear how common such episodes are, but Allen’s traumatic story has prompted others to come forward: three days later, another car was struck with similar waste. Transport Canada told the Guardian it does not compile statistics on these types of incidents. The Kelowna international airport previously told reporters it was not aware of a flight in the area at the time of the reported incidences. Allan said it was the most disgusting moment of her life. “It’s definitely not something anybody should experience. Ever.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/04/charlie-appleby-aidan-obrien-masar-derby-godolphin","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T17:40:26Z","webTitle":"Charlie Appleby throws down gauntlet to Aidan O’Brien at Masar’s Derby party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/04/charlie-appleby-aidan-obrien-masar-derby-godolphin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/04/charlie-appleby-aidan-obrien-masar-derby-godolphin","fields":{"headline":"Charlie Appleby throws down gauntlet to Aidan O’Brien at Masar’s Derby party","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A kind of admission came from Godolphin’s Derby-winning trainer, Charlie Appleby, as he reflected with relish on Masar’s win at Epsom on Saturday. Surrounded by dozens of gleeful staffers here at his Newmarket stable, where a good part of Monday was taken up by celebratory photographs with the horse, Appleby conceded that Godolphin had for years been failing to punch its weight in high-profile clashes with Aidan O’Brien’s runners. “People in racing want to see competition,” Appleby said. “Unfortunately we haven’t been competitive enough. That’s the honesty of it. I can flower it up as much as I want but we haven’t been competitive. We know that. “We’re not in a bubble. I know what people are saying outside these gates. But that just gives us more determination and drive to prove people wrong. We’re going into the rest of the season with a horse that they’ve got to beat.” He expects to choose between the Eclipse and the Irish Derby for Masar’s next target. Appleby’s wife, Aisling, used to transport Ballydoyle-based horses to race in France and further afield and the trainer now takes the view that that willingness to send horses abroad has been part of the reason for O’Brien’s success. “They travel their horses all round the world and they just seem to get stronger. I think mentally they strengthen. And if you’re mentally strong, the rest of your body is strong. If you see people who panic, they’re generally pretty lightweight. Those who don’t stress as much put condition on.” Masar raced in the US last autumn, a venture to the Breeders’ Cup which was thoroughly disappointing at the time, as he could finish only sixth. But Appleby now feels it may have been the making of the colt. “It’s definitely helped him; there’s no doubt about it,” he said, adding that the horse has developed an even temperament that proved invaluable in the Epsom hubbub. Pointing to where Masar was relaxed amid the taking of a thousand selfies, Appleby added: “Not too many horses would stand there with 100 people around them. He’s got a great head on him.” Appleby’s five-year training career could now be interpreted as one of steady progress towards Saturday’s summit and he was happy to point to his excellent strike-rate in the Derby, having only ever had three runners in the race. That sparing approach did not feel so good two years ago, when he did not have a runner and opted to stay at Moulton Paddocks when all of Godolphin’s other senior figures were climbing into helicopters to go and watch the big race at Epsom. “But I’ll never forget the boss, Sheikh Mohammed, put his arm round me and said: ‘Don’t worry, Charlie, there’s a Derby next year for you.’ That’s the person he is.” “I think this is a great confidence-boost for Charlie,” said Godolphin’s managing director, Hugh Anderson. “We’ve all known that he has got the potential. He’s desperate to be successful. “This is an absolute credit to him and he did come in in difficult circumstances,” Anderson added, alluding to the doping scandal that disgraced Mahmood al-Zarooni, Godolphin’s trainer at Moulton Paddocks until 2013. “It seems a long time ago now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/05/costa-rica-russia-2018-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T09:00:40Z","webTitle":"Costa Rica wonder how to top a World Cup underdog fairytale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/05/costa-rica-russia-2018-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/05/costa-rica-russia-2018-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Costa Rica wonder how to top a World Cup underdog fairytale","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It feels much longer than four summers ago from the moment – in the 121st minute of a scoreless World Cup quarter-final – that the Holland coach, Louis van Gaal, took off first-choice goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen for penalty specialist Tim Krul. Had it backfired, Van Gaal’s decision would have gone down as one of the great World Cup gaffes. Instead, the swap rattled the opposing Costa Ricans, and Krul made two stops to vindicate his coach. Because the Dutch limply bowed out one round later, the episode has mostly been forgotten. In Costa Rica, though, Van Gaal’s tactics, and the mind game they clearly played on Los Ticos, features prominently in the modern history of the national team. For four long years, the feeling of unfulfilled promise has festered. “We want to get to that stage again,” says defender Kendall Waston, “and even one further. We want to make it to the semi-finals.” Give Costa Rica credit: Los Ticos are not shirking from the raised expectations they have set for themselves. Having reached the quarters as the tournament’s underdogs in 2014, Costa Rica were always going to struggle with the encore. That was before the draw for Russia 2018, where they are in a group alongside the world’s sixth-best team (according to Fifa, at least) Switzerland, five-time champions Brazil and Serbia. Even if they manage to survive the group stage, Germany are likely to await in the last 16. And yet Los Ticos are not tempering hype. Far from it: they view their exploits in 2014 as a launch pad toward grander accomplishments. After all, Costa Rica are not unfamiliar with unkind draws. Last time around, they were allotted into what many considered the Group of Death with Uruguay, Italy and England. Somehow, they finished ahead of each of those past champions, beating the Uruguayans and Italians before earning the draw they needed against the English on the final day to win the group. Greece were edged out on penalties in the last 16, making history and national heroes of the players even before the near miss against the Dutch. Costa Rica became just the third country from Concacaf to ever reach the quarter-finals. Regional powerhouse Mexico have never made it any further. The United States once played in the semis, but that was way back in the event’s infancy in 1930. Costa Rica’s Cinderella story was unprecedented in Central American soccer history – and they technically went unbeaten in the tournament. Such feats were celebrated back home in a country that is all too accustomed to being overshadowed by much larger nations up north. “That support that the team received pushed them,” said midfielder Rodney Wallace of New York City FC, who missed the 2014 tournament but has been named to the 23-man roster for Russia. “Costa Rica is a country that, when it gets together, does special things. It’s a small country, and we know how to take care of our own.” Such solidarity would come in handy – and could be tested. Again, the draw is brutal. And though Los Ticos comfortably qualified for Russia, with is more than the US can say, recent friendly results are cause for concern. Costa Rica were blasted 5-0 by Spain last November, and though they have beaten Scotland and Northern Ireland in recent months, they also suffered defeats to Hungary and Tunisia. Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas is a legitimate superstar, and a powerful role model in a country of fewer than five million people. A team can ride a strong keeper a long way. “You feel safer knowing that he’s in goal,” Wallace said. “It means a lot to the country. It’s great for the players to see, not only us but the younger players, to know what Costa Ricans are capable of.” Added Waston: “Having Keylor behind us is huge. We know what he represents. He makes us proud. Having him playing with our national team is an honor.” The leading goalscorer from the 2014 run, midfielder Celso Borges of Deportivo La Coruna, is still around, as is forward Joel Campbell, then of Arsenal and now of Real Betis. Captain Bryan Ruiz might be 32, but on his day, the Sporting Lisbon attacker still possesses the quality to change games. Overall, however, this team is probably too reliant on domestic-based and Major League Soccer talent to realistically dream of a push late into the knockout rounds. Instead of injecting the quarter-final team with fresh blood, Costa Rica’s squad has remained mostly stagnant. As far as key difference makers, this remains the same group, more or less, just four years older. It is possible, a decade or so down the road, that the 2014 team will be looked at as the one that inspired a golden generation of Costa Ricans. Four years on, though, their legacy is too close to have made that kind of a difference– but then again, plenty of similarly pessimistic outlooks were undoubtedly penned in the weeks leading up to Brazil, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/04/two-arrested-in-bury-under-terrorism-act","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T17:30:49Z","webTitle":"Two arrested in Bury under Terrorism Act","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/two-arrested-in-bury-under-terrorism-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/two-arrested-in-bury-under-terrorism-act","fields":{"headline":"Two arrested in Bury under Terrorism Act","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Counter-terrorism investigators have arrested two men after “suspicious items” were found at a house in Bury, Greater Manchester.

Elizabeth Denham, the head of the Information Commissioner’s Office, said that her organisation’s forthcoming report into the use of personal data for political purposes “will change the behaviour and compliance of all of the actors in the political campaigning space”. She also told a hearing at the European parliament that social networks such as Twitter and Facebook would have to take greater responsibility for the material hosted on their sites in future. “Online platforms can no longer say that they are merely a platform for content,” she warned the tech companies. “They must take responsibility for the provenance of the information that is provided to users.” Denham told MEPs her organisation’s year-long investigation into the use of personal data and analytics by political campaigns was “unprecedented in its scale” and thought to be the largest ever undertaken by any data protection authority in the world. The organisation has more 40 investigators working full-time on the inquiry, aided by 20 external legal and forensic digital recovery experts. The investigation, which will incorporate the one being undertaken into Cambridge Analytica, is looking at 30 separate organisations and the actions of around a dozen individuals. However, she warned that misuse of data was widespread across the internet and was not confined to the Facebook platform or this particular case. “We have seen that the behavioural advertising ecosystem has been applied across political campaigning to influence how we may vote,” she told MEPs. “I am deeply concerned about the fact that this has happened without due legal or ethical considerations of the impacts on our democratic system.” Denham said her organisation was one of the best-resourced data regulators in Europe and warned MEPs from other countries that they should provide more funding to their national equivalent. “I recognise that some aspects of our legal systems have failed to keep up with the unforeseen pace of the internet.” Denham was giving evidence to the European parliament alongside Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie, Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, former Facebook employee Sandy Parakilas, and US professor David Carroll. Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica whistleblower who went public with his concerns earlier this year, told MEPs the issue helped cause Brexit: “This crisis is not just one of privacy, it is one that may have led the EU to losing one of its largest member states. “What I witnessed at Cambridge Analytica should alarm everyone. Cambridge Analytica is the canary in the coal mine of a new Cold war emerging online.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/05/march-brexiters-afraid-remain-peoples-will-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Time to march.

Because now it’s the Brexiters who are afraid","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Is the date in your diary? The march for a people’s vote on 23 June marks the second anniversary of the Brexit referendum, that day of national meltdown and the harshest social rift of our lifetime. This week the Commons corridors are filled with intensive lobbying of MPs before next week’s pivotal Brexit votes. As amendments to the EU withdrawal bill are made in the Lords, whips demand maximum party tribalism. Meanwhile, rebels call on consciences to save the nation in its hour of peril. The vote on giving parliament a “meaningful say” on the deal was only won by four votes in December, so the decisions on staying in a customs union, a frictionless Irish border and joining the European Economic Area (EEA) hang by a whisker. But there’s a new spring in the step of the soft Brexiters and no-Brexiters. The crunch moment has come. A wind of change is blowing through parliament. The cabinet’s shocking failure over two wasted years to resolve anything means that the baton passes to MPs. As rival cabinet groups debate impossible options that are not seen as viable by EU negotiators, nothing has changed, and still the clock ticks down to the 28 June summit in Brussels. On this epoch-defining issue there is no government at the helm. Even Conservative party members say so; two-thirds told ConservativeHome they had lost confidence in their government’s handling of Brexit. With no one at the wheel, MPs must take back control. Peter Kellner, a cautious pollster, says remain is now five percentage points ahead among voters, according to data from Delta. A majority would avoid the risk of a weaker economy in exchange for losing some sovereignty. By far the biggest gulf, greater than class or region, is between old and young voters: the retired and near-retired are still Brexiters, but by a margin of 65% to 35% working-age voters put the economy ahead of leaving the EU. That five-point remain lead is tight, but so was the four-point referendum victory that gave leavers such confidence that only the hardest Brexit is “the people’s will”. To gauge the level of change, one need only note the growing fury of the Brexiters. Jumping up and down like raging Rumpelstiltskins, they sense the argument is slipping away. The leak of the Brexit department’s assessment of a no-deal scenario was splashed across the Sunday Times – that arch-Brexit paper. The second-worst scenario – not even their worst imagining of “armageddon” – warned that the port of Dover would collapse on day one, with food, petrol and medicines running out within days. Cue apoplectic indignation from the Daily Mail, which calls the report “project fear on speed … tendentious rubbish”. It sneers at this report as emanating from Whitehall. But always remember that it was David Davis who commissioned it from the civil servants he appointed to his department. This was not even their worst prediction for the no-deal walkout favoured by the Rees-Moggites. Indeed, the worse the picture that emerges from every industry, the Bank of England, research scientists, the NHS, security and crime agencies – everywhere that matters – the more the Rees-Moggites rage with their fingers-in-the-ears, no-deal denial. They seem to be losing it, in every sense. The Mail wills MPs to defeat the 15 Lords amendments “all designed to stall, dilute or reverse the referendum result”; all from the “unelected upper house stuffed with cronies and party hacks”. Hear that fear. “Unless Mrs May seizes back the initiative, they may succeed in wrecking the bill,” laments the Mail. And it looks increasingly possible that they will. If so, expect MPs themselves to be branded “traitors”, “saboteurs”, “enemies of the people”. Expect democracy to be threatened by the Brexit fanatics. And know that this is the moment when each and every MP has to decide if they are merely subservient, or if – as Edmund Burke told the electors of Bristol – each, irrespective of party, has a higher duty. “His unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living.” What are the odds? It looks possible, maybe probable, that parliament will support a customs union and a frictionless Irish border, which means a close agreement on single market rules too. Sadly, Labour is deeply split on the Lords amendment for joining the EEA. Some 60 Labour MPs of the Caroline Flint, tough-on-immigration variety would vote against – even if the leadership swung to support it – despite enough Tory votes to win this too: 10 Tory MPs have spoken in favour of the EEA. Even so, if the Commons votes for a customs union and a frictionless border, Brexit does take a far softer shape. And what will May do then? Breathe a secret sigh of relief, declare her hands are tied and pursue the least-damaging Brexit possible? The fanatics and the Mail will explode in fury, her party will be riven. What then? Does she turn to the people to vote on her deal? Do MPs insist that she does what they say? Some remainers fret about a people’s vote but tellingly, it’s the leavers who fear that vote most. The shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, says Labour is keeping its options open on the issue of a people’s vote. It all depends on the question: is it a soft or hard Brexit versus remain or leave? Or a three-way choice? I will join the march on 23 June because if, as I hope, parliament votes for the softest Brexit, the claim that the people’s will is denied will need another popular vote to resolve it. And if parliament votes for a hard Brexit, then a vote is the last hope of saving us all. Above all, because I think the no-Brexit position could win. But please God, let there be no other referendum ever again: never forget the near-mortal damage done to Britain by an irrevocable vote on an unfathomably complex question.

The latest chapter in a story that runs through so much US music is the debut album by Josiah “serpentwithfeet” Wise, an artist who fuses avant garde R&amp;B with the devotional beauty of gospel, skirting easy classification. Soil is a beautiful, shape-shifting debut made by a former choirboy who, tangentially, identifies as a pagan. It is, at its heart, an album about love: the intimacy of it, the rapture of it, the loss of it. Its forthcoming track Cherubim riffs hard on the quasi-religious potential of homoerotic adoration. Wise’s ecstatic voice ranges from falsetto flutter to proclamatory thrum on songs like Invoice – a grandiose, dramatic composition. Mourning Song, by contrast, finds Wise, a classically trained singer, grieving a relationship, using vocal manipulation techniques to “sound like the demon”; imagine Perfume Genius remixed by Arca. After his breakout 2016 EP blisters, made with Björk’s collaborator the Haxan Cloak, Soil has contributions from sound-makers as diverse as Katie Gately, digital hip-hop hand Clams Casino, and even Paul Epworth (Adele), taking Wise’s vision into glorious sonic HD."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/06/why-no-rape-crisis-centres-northern-ireland-belfast","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T06:30:06Z","webTitle":"Why are there no rape crisis centres in Northern Ireland? | Dawn Foster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/06/why-no-rape-crisis-centres-northern-ireland-belfast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/06/why-no-rape-crisis-centres-northern-ireland-belfast","fields":{"headline":"Why are there no rape crisis centres in Northern Ireland?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When a 19-year-old student was injured in 2016, she walked up and down a road in Belfast desperately trying to find the Rape Crisis centre she had looked up online. But she never found it: the centre, on Donegall Street, had closed a decade previously due to lack of funding. Eventually the student and her friend managed to find a sexual health clinic, where a nurse recorded her injuries and counselling was provided. The subsequent trial of two Ulster international rugby players for rape ended in protests in Belfast after the jury returned a not-guilty verdict: the nine-week trial forced a number of uncomfortable conversations on rape, misogyny, sporting culture and attitudes towards women into the public sphere in Northern Ireland and beyond. The statistics make for grim reading. Reported rapes have doubled in the decade to 2016/17, with 823 rapes reported to the police in Northern Ireland during this period. Of these, only 15 cases resulted in conviction – a rate of just 1.8%, compared to 5.7% in England and Wales. Only 5% of reported rapes in the year to April 2018 have resulted in a charge or summons, compared to 8.6% the previous year. “Every organisation has seen an increase in call volume on complaints of sexual violence since the trial began,” says Jan Melia, chief executive of Women’s Aid Federation Northern Ireland. But anecdotal evidence suggests there has been a sharp increase in women withdrawing complaints since the trial, due to a collapse in confidence in the judicial system and the fear of public attention. “We had women calling and saying they were going to withdraw cases as a direct result of the trial and the verdict,” Melia admits. The reaction of victims’ groups to the trial has prompted the Department of Justice to review how the criminal justice system handles rape and sexual assault cases in Northern Ireland. It is expected to report in January. Well-intentioned laws make it hard for women to report assault or rape. It is illegal in Northern Ireland not to report a crime you have knowledge of – which means that women disclosing rape but not reporting the incident to the police risk prosecution themselves. This puts many women off talking about sexual assault and rape. “It has a huge effect, says Clare Bailey, a Green member of the legislative assembly at Stormont. “I think trained professionals understand that law, but regular people don’t.” So if people discuss historical cases of rape, this has serious implications, she says. “When these conversations happen, people don’t know there’s a legal duty to disclose a serious crime. For all the good intentions behind that legislation, it needs to be looked at – and victims put front and centre.” Meanwhile, anger over the not-guilty verdicts has helped fuel efforts to get a dedicated sexual violence service in Belfast. Northern Ireland is the only region in the United Kingdom and Ireland without a single Rape Crisis centre. Although some organisations offer limited help as an additional service to their main work, there is no obligation in Northern Ireland to provide dedicated independent sexual assault services. But now a group of charities plan to re-establish a centre in Belfast to give women the support they so badly need. Women’s Aid Federation Northern Ireland, the sexual violence charity Nexus and the domestic abuse charity Men’s Advisory Project had already been developing plans for a new centre, but the increase in public attention prompted the group to bring forward their plans. “The rape trial exposed a gap we already knew was there – and that exposed gap meant a response was needed. We’d been having the discussion in-house and with other services,” Melia explains. With £100,000 funding from the Tudor Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Trust, the Belfast Rape Crisis Centre is due to open in the coming months, offering specialised counselling, advocacy and support to women, men, girls and boys who say they have experienced rape and sexual violence. The centre will initially have a dedicated support worker, but the charities hope further fundraising will allow them to expand and offer more specialist services. The trial also revealed deeply embedded myths, stereotypes and misinformation around sexual relationships that are not being discussed in schools, regardless of religious background or school type. “Education is a huge issue. There’s little knowledge of how consent works and what it entails – and there were endless myths about rape repeated in the trial,” Melia says. “We need a very direct discussion with young people about what a good relationship is, and what coercion is. We need to empower boys to stand up if they’re in a laddish group and say, ‘That’s not OK’.” The collapse of the power-sharing executive has also stalled much-needed progress on women’s and girls’ rights in Northern Ireland. Bailey, who previously worked for Nexus, is frustrated at the limitations on her work while Stormont sits empty. Prior to the collapse, she worked extensively on domestic and sexual violence, and sat on the justice committee. “It’s really hard. I wanted to get elected and work on this, on the justice committee and it’s been taken away.” Melia says they are about to set up the website for the new centre, based between the Women’s Aid and Nexus offices until they secure funding for a dedicated space, and is enthused by the level of support. “It’s great that there are so many people who want to do something: everyone who has applied to volunteer has said the same thing. We cannot have a situation in Northern Ireland where victims of rape are left to their own devices: that’s not acceptable in any way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/04/trump-500-days-president-american-greatness","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T18:06:14Z","webTitle":"Trump brags of '500 days of greatness'  – but how do his boasts stack up?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/04/trump-500-days-president-american-greatness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/04/trump-500-days-president-american-greatness","fields":{"headline":"Trump brags of '500 days of greatness'  – but how do his boasts stack up?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The White House issued a grandiose statement on Monday morning celebrating “President Donald J Trump’s 500 days of American greatness”. Trump made a series of claims about his first 500 days in office, celebrating his economic policies, touting his success in adding jobs, and claiming to have made communities safer. As ever with Trump, many of these boasts are inaccurate or misleading. Here, under his own four main headings, we appraise some of his key 500-day declarations. ‘America’s economy is stronger … thanks to President Trump’s pro-growth agenda’ CLAIM “Three million jobs have been created since Trump took office,” booms Trump’s news release. He made the same claim at a rally in April. REALITY What Trump does not tell people is that the rate of job creation under him is actually slower than the last four years under Obama. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2.188m jobs were added in 2017. Obama added 2.3m in 2013, 2.99m in 2014, 2.71m in 2015, and 2.24m in 2016. Trump claimed that the unemployment rate has dropped to 3.8%. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics did indeed report the unemployment rate for May was 3.8%. But what Trump ignores is that the unemployment rate is declining in part because of large numbers of people leaving the workforce rather than getting jobs. The percentage of workers in jobs or looking for work dropped from 62.9% in March, to 62.8% in April to 62.7% in May. Those levels have not been seen since the 1970s. CLAIM “American families received $3.2tn in gross tax cuts.” REALITY Trump has been making this claim since 2017, when he signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law. In fact, the bill delivers $1.5tn in tax cuts – and that number includes cuts that corporations will receive. The disparity is because Trump does not include aspects of the bill which will actually increase taxes. Factcheck.org pointed out that the non-partisan joint committee on taxation estimates the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will result in $1.456tn less in taxes over the next 10 years. Some of that comes from the corporate income tax rate being cut from 35% to 21%, while the tax rate for wealthy individuals has been cut from 39.6% to 37%. The tax cut for corporations is permanent; the tax cuts for individuals will expire in 2026. The bill is projected to add $1.46tn to the nation’s debt over the next decade. And the Washington thinktank the Center for American progress predicts that Trump will save $11m to $15m a year under the tax bill, while Jared Kushner will save between $5m and $12m per year. CLAIM “President Trump has rolled back unnecessary job-killing regulations such as the Clean Power Plan.” REALITY Trump hails the government’s October 2017 decision to scrap the Clean Power Plan, which was introduced by Obama and was designed to cut US carbon dioxide emissions by 32% by 2030. The Environmental Protection Agency had previously estimated the plan would prevent 90,000 child asthma attacks and 3,600 premature deaths a year by 2030. While Trump claims the Clean Power Plan has already been rolled back, as of May 2018 the EPA was yet to finalize its repeal, and 19 states are challenging the government’s move to scrap the plan – giving hope that Trump and Pruitt could be thwarted, or at least delayed. ‘America is winning on the world stage’ CLAIM “The president has taken action to confront aggression by Iran and its proxies.” REALITY Trump has withdrawn from the landmark international deal on Tehran’s nuclear programme. In doing so he drew condemnation from the leaders of the UK, Germany and France, who made clear that Iran was abiding by the terms of the agreement. ‘America’s government is more accountable’ CLAIM “President Trump has confirmed the most circuit court judges of any president in their first year.” REALITY Unfortunately for those not aligned with the president’s political views, this is correct. Republicans have rushed through the appointment of 21 such judges, and Trump plans to add 20 more by the end of 2018. Most of those appointments are white men, and almost one-third have anti-LGBT records. The majority of Trump’s appointments are under 50 – meaning they could influence decision-making in the US for decades to come. ‘America’s communities are safer and more secure’ CLAIM Immigration and Customs Enforcement – Ice – has “made 110,568 arrests of illegal aliens – a 42% increase for the same timeframe in 2016”. REALITY There is no mention of the disruption this has had on communities across the country – and on the terrible toll Trump’s actions have had on families. Between 6 and 19 May, 658 children were taken away from their parents at the border, after the Trump administration announced that parents detained while entering the US without documentation would be separated from their children and prosecuted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/04/grenfell-fire-took-three-hours-to-encircle-the-building-inquiry-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T18:12:13Z","webTitle":"Grenfell fire took three hours to encircle the building, inquiry hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/grenfell-fire-took-three-hours-to-encircle-the-building-inquiry-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/grenfell-fire-took-three-hours-to-encircle-the-building-inquiry-hears","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell fire took three hours to encircle the building, inquiry hears","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The fire started in the kitchen of flat 16 on the fourth floor. Within three hours, it had spread around the whole perimeter of Grenfell Tower, the inquiry has heard. Bahailu Kebede was woken by the sound of his smoke alarm. Going into his kitchen he saw smoke in the area of the tall fridge freezer by the window. He woke the two other occupants in the two-bedroomed flat and dialled “999” on his mobile. “I call straight away, ‘please, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire,’” he said in a statement. He alerted other residents on the fourth floor and, as he fled his flat, he switched off the electricity supply at the fuse box by the door, the inquiry heard. “On the basis of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the area of origin of the fire was in or around the tall fridge freezer in the southeast part of the kitchen,” Prof Niamh Nic Daéid, a fire and forensic investigations expert based at Dundee University, said in a report to the inquiry. The exact cause remains undetermined, she said. The area of origin also included a space between the fridge freezer and window that had contained materials that were currently unknown. Four fire engines were initially dispatched. The first two firefighters at the scene broke down the door and “black smoke billowed out”. The fire appeared to be in the top left corner of the kitchen, described by one firefighter as “an isolated curtain of flame from about two to three feet in the air to the ceiling”. Images taken on their thermal imaging camera appeared to show falling embers outside the window. Another firefighter, John O’Hanlon, said in a statement: “You wouldn’t recognise it as a fridge, just a charred rectangle with a bit of melted stuff at the bottom that was still alight.” “The window had gone by then, broken … that’s when we noticed that the window had completely gone. Even the frame wasn’t there and we noticed that it was on fire, that the window surround was on fire. “We walked over to the window and started spraying the window frame. It didn’t have any effect on it, at which point I sat on the window sill and was leaning out and trying to hit what I thought was the window surround”. In total, the time between the firefighters first opening the door of flat 16 and their final entry into the kitchen, which resulted in them extinguishing the fire within the kitchen, was estimated to be 11 minutes and 35 seconds, according to Daéid’s report. There are four stages to major fires such as this, Prof Jose Torero of the University of Maryland, said. In Grenfell Tower, the first had been this “relatively minor” local fire. But this fire had compromised the uPVC window fittings. It had ignited one of the flammable components of the cladding. This was the second phase, the jump from the kitchen through the window to the cladding. It was likely to have happened before the first firefighters even entered flat 16. From that moment on, London Fire Brigade’s stay put strategy was compromised, said Torero. Once it had established on the outside of the facade system, “fire spread up the facade was inevitable”, he said. Even though evacuation – or egress – was “not free of risk” at this stage it was still a better strategy than “stay put”, he said in his expert report. The structural integrity of the building would not be in question at this stage. The fire was observed to have spread to the cladding by 01.09. It then spread vertically upwards on the east face of Grenfell Tower. It took just 20 minutes for the fire to spread from the fourth floor to the roof. The vertical spread had started slowly, but accelerated as the fire grew in size, said Prof Luke Bisby of the University of Edinburgh’s school of engineering. By 01.36 it had spread laterally on to the north face, then it went southwards on the east face. This lateral fire spread initially occurred mostly at the top of the building. Smoke and heat had reached the stairwell early on in the fire, probably aided by occupant and firefighter movements, Torero said. This had impeded escape in the regions around floor 12 and above floor 20. There was “generalised untenable conditions” throughout the tower by approximately 01.50 to 02.30. By this point, he said, firefighters’ operations were “outside the bounds of conventional practice”. This was the third stage. By 02.49 the fire had spread from the north face to the west face. The cladding at the south-west corner was the last part, and was consumed by fire coming from two directions, spreading southwards along the west face and westwards along the south face. It took approximately three hours and four minutes for it to spread around the full perimeter. After this time, it continued to spread downwards and ingress into the building and burn within the building. “Beyond this is the fourth stage, firefighting activities are governed by conditions in the building and performed in an ad-hoc manner,” said Torero. “There is considerable risk to those rescuing and being rescued.” However, egress or evacuation remains the “preferred option”, he said. His report provided a breakdown of where victims were recovered. Most were discovered in their own flats. Others had tried, too late, to escape. There were 29 victims found in other parts of the tower. Nineteen victims had been able to reach the stairs, but went upwards rather then downwards. Three were found either in the stairs or in the adjacent lobby, suggesting they were attempting to travel down the stairs, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/04/john-bercow-speaker-commons-investigated-stupid-woman-row-andrea-leadsom","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T17:07:07Z","webTitle":"John Bercow will not be investigated over 'stupid woman' row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/04/john-bercow-speaker-commons-investigated-stupid-woman-row-andrea-leadsom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/04/john-bercow-speaker-commons-investigated-stupid-woman-row-andrea-leadsom","fields":{"headline":"John Bercow will not be investigated over 'stupid woman' row","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, will not be investigated by the standards watchdog over allegations that he described the cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom as a “stupid woman”. The Conservative MP James Duddridge, a long-standing critic of Bercow, had called for the standards commissioner to secure video and audio footage of the alleged incident in the Commons chamber last month before it was destroyed. However, Kathryn Stone, the commissioner, is prevented from investigating the alleged conduct because under parliamentary rules it is the Speaker’s responsibility to rule on behaviour in the chamber. Bercow has sought to defuse the row by admitting he muttered the word “stupid” during a disagreement with the leader of the house about the timetabling of legislation, but denied insulting her personally. He offered no apology and insisted he would “continue to speak out firmly” for the interests of the Commons. He was accused of having said in an aside that Leadsom was a “stupid woman”, and swearing before describing her as “useless”, prompting Downing Street to say such language was unacceptable. The incident came on the day an inquiry into allegations Bercow bullied two former private secretaries, Angus Sinclair and Kate Emms, was blocked by MPs. The Commons standards committee voted three to two against allowing parliament’s watchdog to investigate the allegations, which Bercow has consistently denied. An allegation of misconduct in public office against the Speaker is being assessed by the Metropolitan police. In a statement, Duddridge said: “It is ludicrous that bullying allegations cannot be investigated because they are seven years old, because a non-disclousure agreement was signed, because it was in the chamber, because it was a current member of staff or because the person bullied is so traumatised. Enough is enough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/04/may-tells-trump-that-us-tariffs-on-eu-steel-are-unjustified","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T18:37:42Z","webTitle":"May tells Trump that US tariffs on EU steel are unjustified","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/may-tells-trump-that-us-tariffs-on-eu-steel-are-unjustified","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/may-tells-trump-that-us-tariffs-on-eu-steel-are-unjustified","fields":{"headline":"May tells Trump that US tariffs on EU steel are unjustified","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May has told Donald Trump that US tariffs on EU steel are “unjustified and deeply disappointing”, speaking by phone with the American president for the first time since the levies were imposed last week. Downing Street said the 30 minute call on Monday afternoon was constructive and stressed the close national security relationship between the two countries. May will not push for a UK exemption to the new US border tariffs of 25% on EU imports of rolled steel and 10% on aluminium as the UK will join the bloc’s push for European exemption. “The PM said that the US, UK and EU are close national security allies and we recognise the importance of the values of open and fair trade across the world,” May’s spokesman said. “The prime minister also underlined the need to safeguard jobs that will potentially be affected by this decision. They agreed to discuss this, and wider issues of free and fair global trade, further at the G7 summit later this week.” The EU, Canada and Mexico were granted exemptions when Trump imposed the tariffs in March, saying a reliance on imported metals threatened national security. Last week however, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said the US had made insufficient progress with its allies to reduce America’s trade deficit, and lifted the waiver. May’s spokesman stressed that the UK was not trying to strike its own deal with Washington. “We are members of the European Union and we have been clear that we and our EU allies are seeking an EU-wide exemption,” he said. In a speech on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn will suggest the prime minister’s hesitancy to use stronger terms to condemn Trump’s actions was May trying to “appease” the US president in the hope of getting a better trade deal with the US in the wake of Brexit. The Labour leader will tell the GMB union that the move to impose further steel tariffs would risk hurting workers in America and around the world. “The Tories are too weak to stand up to the powerful, and too in hock to them even if they wanted to. Theresa May is appeasing Donald Trump in the hope of getting a race-to-the-bottom trade deal with the US after we leave the European Union. The Trump trade tariffs show that’s a Tory pipe-dream,” he said. Corbyn will say that US workers have long suffered from a “completely rigged system” that shifts more power and wealth to a tiny financial and political elite. “Trying to hold back the tide with one hand and giving eye-watering handouts to the super-rich with the other is no substitute for a government taking a proactive role in modernising and upgrading industry,” he will add. Speaking in the House of Commons earlier however, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, said he hoped once the UK had left the EU, “we’ll have no problems with a UK exemption.” He suggested he was cautious about some of the retaliatory tariffs under discussion at the EU, including classic American products such as Levi’s jeans, bourbon whiskey, cranberries and peanut butter. “We still want to see what the measures themselves are, specifically we have been talking to the Irish government about the issue of bourbon being on the list because of the potential implications for the Scotch whisky industry and the Irish whiskey industry,” he said. The shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, said the issue must be given a formal place on the agenda at the forthcoming G7 summit in Canada. “The UK must insist that this matter is given a high priority on the formal agenda and not relegated to the sidelines,” he told the Commons. May is expected to discuss the tariff with Trump at the summit this week. Gardiner said there would be “no winners” if the EU and the US entered a full-scale trade war. “Only President Trump has said he believes he can win one. The UK and the EU must stand up to this behaviour and restore the rules-based system,” he said. MPs called for even tougher retaliatory steps, with Labour MP John Mann suggesting the UK impose “golf tariffs” aimed at Trump’s properties. “Giving into this, the only language that Trump understands, is people fighting back, and it’s about time this country fought back,” he said. “We can do it. Golf – he likes golf – let’s have some golf tariffs on golf owners in Scotland. Let’s bring them in immediately and stand up for our steel communities and our steel workers instead of this rubbish about how we can do nothing about it. Fight him.” Fox said his suggestion was “a tirade of nonsense” but added the UK did not have the authority to set out its retaliatory measures. “When we leave the European Union we will have greater freedom to do so. But I say in all seriousness that escalation is not what we require – we need a proportionate response done calmly, with time to give the United States some reflection to change its mind.” Commenting on the phone call between May and Trump, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: “The president feels very confident in his decision and will continue to make sure that the unfair trade practicies that have gone on for decades will not continue and that he is protecting the interests of American workers and American business.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/04/northern-rail-closure-of-lakes-line-brings-misery-to-tourist-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T17:02:06Z","webTitle":"Suspension of Lakes Line brings misery to tourist firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/northern-rail-closure-of-lakes-line-brings-misery-to-tourist-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/04/northern-rail-closure-of-lakes-line-brings-misery-to-tourist-firms","fields":{"headline":"Suspension of Lakes Line brings misery to tourist firms","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Late on Monday morning, a steady stream of tourists wheeling large suitcases were making their way out of the Lake District’s Oxenholme station and on to a cluster of buses destined for Windermere. For the next two weeks these buses will stand in for the Lakes Line, a train line first opened in 1847, which was suspended by operator Northern on Monday, after weeks of mass cancellations and delays. “The key is to keep smiling and to keep talking to people and telling them what’s going on,” said arail worker, wearing a high-vis jacket and helping to load people’s suitcases on to a bus. “These guys are doing their best,” said one woman as she climbed off the bus for the next leg of her journey down the length of the country to Penzance. It has not been an ideal start to her journey. Failure by rail operator Northern to properly prepare for the introduction of a new timetable on 20 May has caused chaos on the rail network across the north of England over the past two weeks. On Monday, the operator began running an emergency timetable with the planned cancellation of 165 daily services, including the suspension of the Lakes Line. Speaking to BBC Cumbria on Monday, David Brown, managing director for Northern, said the bus replacement service on the Lakes Line was an “alternative that people can plan and use and understand it’s going to be there for a period of time”. Jack Eldon, 65, from London, was on his way to meet his friend in west Cumbria. He had already missed a series of connections on his way up the country. “Trains are dire in this part of the world,” he said. “I travel up the main line from London to Carlisle a bit and that’s not bad, but the branch lines are really bad. Once you get off that main line, it’s anybody’s guess what’s going to happen.” Samina Ansari, 37, and her colleague Sarah Todd, 28, had travelled from Glasgow to Windermere for a conference. “We’d planned our journey so that we would get to the conference on time,” she said. “This bus journey will take longer than the train, so we’ll be delayed. Timing-wise, it might have been better to drive.” Although the Lakes Line was only suspended on Monday, locals say it has failed to provide a reliable service for months. The line was re-franchised to Northern in April 2016 after being managed by First TransPennine Express since 2005. “I can’t think of anywhere in the country that has seen such a deterioration in the train service on a series of measures from reliability to the quality of the rolling stock to the capacity of the services,” said Nigel Wilkinson, managing director of Windermere Lake Cruises. He remembers when, under First TransPennine Express, there were five trains a day straight through to Manchester airport. Under Northern, there are two direct services, which will only take you as far as Manchester city centre. The transfer to Northern also came with a decline in the quality of the trains, said Ben Barry, Conservative councillor for Windermere. “We lost the modern three-carriage trains and got the old two-carriage trains and they are horrendous,” he said. “The toilets literally deposit onto the track so that you can’t use them in the station. You don’t think that sort of thing could happen nowadays.” Apart from the difficulties the line’s suspension is causing locals – including GCSE and A Level students who are sitting exams – the effect it will have on the tourists who pour into the region every summer is at the forefront of many people’s minds. “In the Lake District we literally have 10 weeks to make a year’s worth of money and to be turning so many people away because they can’t get a train is not helpful,” said Barry, who has heard rumours that the line could be suspended for six months. This is the first year that the Lake District has enjoyed Unesco world heritage status and Barry says that the region attracts a disproportionate number of tourists from south east Asia. “For a Japanese visitor to turn up and see this problem would be bizarre for them, so it’s not a very good advert for us at all,” he said. Speaking from an office with a view over the glistening lake Windermere, Wilkinson said that those responsible – whether it’s Northern, Network Rail or the Department of Transport – should be forced to pay for a marketing campaign to promote the Lakes and offset the damage the rail problems have caused.

And maybe I would laugh, if only I weren’t more bemused than amused by the perplexing way “vagina” appears to have expanded to embrace not just the vagina itself, but the vulva and the female pubic area in general. But Hollywood, as ever, is all talk. In an industry run by overgrown schoolboys, breasts remain the primary female erogenous zone. Despite the pioneering work of Sharon Stone crossing her legs in Basic Instinct (1992), visible vulva is, unsurprisingly, a rarity in mainstream cinema, possibly because it’s not considered as titillating as big bazoomas. Perhaps this is for the best, though, since the last thing we need are gross-out comedies in which women’s nether regions get the same treatment as testicles: Ben Stiller’s caught in his zip in There’s Something About Mary (1998) or Will Poulter’s grotesquely inflamed by a spider bite in We’re the Millers (2013). “Closeups make us anxious about things,” Jean-Luc Godard once said, and he had a point. Lad-com producer and director Judd Apatow, having already discovered the comic potential of gratuitous todger in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) and the criminally underrated Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007), inserted a closeup of a baby being squeezed out of a real vagina in Knocked Up (2007), but one suspects this was more in a quest for male adolescent yucks than an attempt to even things up. For the real money shots, as usual, we must look to the Europeans, whose fearlessness in the gynaecological sector rivals men’s top-shelf magazines in their pre-Pornhub heyday. The French film-maker Catherine Breillat, for example, out-Apatows Apatow with an explicit cervical examination and birth sequence in Romance (1999). Then, in Anatomy of Hell (2004), she got porn actor-director Rocco Siffredi (AKA “the Italian Stallion”) to apply lipstick to the labia and anus of his leading lady’s vulva double, though in both films the characters’ tendency to earnestly debate gender politics undercuts potential shock value, let alone any hint of eroticism (which is presumably the intention). Meanwhile, her compatriot François Ozon’s preposterous but delicious thriller L’Amant Double (2017), kicks off its daft plot with a speculum’s-eye view of the female protagonist’s internal couloir: about as sexy as a smear test, but a witty invitation into its heroine’s psyche. The Eisenstein of the arty obstetric shot is Gaspar Noé, who in Enter the Void (2009) and Love (2015) inserts trippy, semi-abstract imagery of penises penetrating vaginas, shot from the vaginal perspective in glorious red and orange with sporadic strobe effectx. Typically, Lars von Trier is more mean-spirited with his full-on frontal scenes in Antichrist (2009), where Charlotte Gainsbourg no sooner exposes her lady parts than she’s snipping away at them with scissors. More lyrically, The Invader (2011) by Belgian director Nicolas Provost, begins with a medium closeup of a pudendum posed like Gustave Courbet’s 1866 painting L’Origine du Monde, followed by a two-minute Steadicam shot of its serene white owner getting to her feet and strolling across a nudist beach towards the sea – where half-drowned African migrants are being washed up on the shore. Presenting the case for more playful vaginal action, albeit in a film that elsewhere features stalking and rape, Pedro Almodóvar’s adorable pastiche of a silent-movie dream sequence in Talk to Her (2002) shows a tiny man shedding his vest and pants to crawl inside a gigantic simulacrum of his lover’s vagina, which looms over him like a dirigible fringed in AstroTurf. More bonkers still is Ken Russell’s Lisztomania (1975) in which Roger Daltrey, dressed in a purple crinoline, gets sucked into an outsize replica of Sara Kestleman’s gusset before re-emerging with an eight-foot erection. But this is merely a prelude to a Busby Berkeley-esque musical number in which his former mistresses commandeer his phallus for a maypole dance before chopping off the glans with a guillotine. Vagina for the win! And to think Russell was never offered a knighthood.

Phones will get performance boosts and services aiming to help people fight compulsive use, Macs will get iOS apps and new machine learning technologies, and even the Apple Watch sees an upgrade or two. But some changes didn’t make it on the main stage, either because they’re a bit too technical, a little embarrassing for the company, or just plain old bad news. The war against Facebook is even bigger than it looks If there was one theme running throughout Apple’s presentation, it was that the company is taking on Facebook on all fronts. The new Screen Time app, which aims to help users cut back on their device use, was demonstrated using Facebook’s Instagram as the test case, and Safari’s new anti-tracking tech is positioned squarely against Facebook’s use of Like buttons and comment boxes to track users around the net. But the specific details of ITP2, the updated version of the anti-tracking technology, are even more aggressively targeted at two of Apple’s biggest rivals, Facebook and Google, than the company let on on stage. ITP works by segregating the cookies dropped by websites so that they can only be read by that specific website, ensuring that an ad provider cannot, for instance, use those cookies to track your browsing across every single website on which it runs ads. Previously, that segregation had only kicked in 24 hours after a user visited the specific website. That was a handy out for sites such as Facebook, Google and YouTube, which users visit regularly enough to spend a lot of their time in that day-long window. Now, that grace period is gone, and Apple’s tracking prevention kicks in immediately. When ITP1 was launched last year, ad-tech firm Criteo saw an immediate 22% drop in revenue; what will Facebook see? Your £10,000 watch is now obsolete The new version of Apple’s watchOS brings with it a few nice features, including the ability to play audio from services other than Apple Music during workouts, and a nice auto-start feature for when you forget to tell the fitness tracker that you have begun your training. But Apple’s richest customers will have to shell out more for the privilege of acquiring those new features, because the update is the first version of watchOS not to run on Apple’s first-generation watches – including the £10,000+ solid gold Apple Watch Edition. In recent generations, Apple has dropped the price of its most expensive watch, fashioning it from ceramic rather than gold and selling it for “just” £1,299. But when it launched, it had ambitions for high fashion, and the solid gold watch was one manifestation of that goal. Those watches should carry on running for a while, but they’ll be cut off from more and more new features as time goes on. Have they been worth more than £3,000 per year of operation? For that, you’d have to ask one of the (select few) customers. Law enforcement’s secret weapon against iPhones got disabled Police forensics departments the world over have had a slight edge over Apple for the past year or so, thanks to a mysterious technology called Greyshift, which is able to crack the pin-lock on the latest iPhones. It is not clear how the service, which is packaged as a nondescript box that investigators can plug in to seized devices, actually works, but Apple has apparently worked out how to stop it: disable USB. From iOS 11.4.1 – coming very shortly – a new feature disables access to the phone from USB devices once the device has been locked for more than an hour. That means police will have to work fast if they’re going to extract usable information from phones taken in as evidence, or get the co-operation of the suspect and have them unlock it the old-fashioned way. It’s an odd game of cat and mouse, since Apple doesn’t enjoy being perceived as the enemy of the forces of justice, but when push comes to shove, it will protect its users’ security over anyone who seeks to compromise it. There’s probably going to be an iPad with FaceID Just because no new hardware was announced at Apple’s event, doesn’t mean there was no information about new hardware hidden away in yesterday’s releases. The beta version of iOS 12 for iPads appears to contain references to FaceID, the tech that the company first launched with the iPhone X to replace the old fingerprint-based touchID. That also explains, perhaps, why iPads now have the same gestures as the iPhone X, asking users to swipe down from the top corners to access notifications and control centre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/06/utility-review-emily-schwend-orange-tree-richmond","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T07:40:45Z","webTitle":"Utility review – slow-burning drama about a mother under pressure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/06/utility-review-emily-schwend-orange-tree-richmond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/06/utility-review-emily-schwend-orange-tree-richmond","fields":{"headline":"Utility review – slow-burning drama about a mother under pressure","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Watching Emily Schwend’s prize-winning play about the daily pressures facing a working mother, I was reminded both of The Flick and John by her fellow American, Annie Baker. Even if Schwend’s play, at a mere 95 minutes, seems positively headlong in comparison with Baker’s epics, there is the same patient attention to detail and delight in what William Blake called “the holiness of minute particulars”. Schwend’s focus is on Amber, an east Texan who has to cope with three kids, two jobs and the return of her unreliable husband, Chris. In fact, Chris is an extra burden on Amber’s life since he brings in little money, forgets to pay the electricity bill and is barely capable of blowing up the balloons for an eight-year-old’s birthday party. There were times when I wished Amber would break free from her shackles or at least rage against her jerk of a husband, but I guess Schwend’s point is that, given there are always school lunches to pack and household jobs to be done, there is little room for manoeuvre. Caitlin McLeod’s production rightly never rushes things and Robyn Addison avoids the temptation to play Amber as a joyless drudge. Instead, she makes her a bright, attractive woman who, recalling her younger self, wistfully remarks: “I miss that person I used to be.” What Addison makes you feel, as she cuts yet another round of peanut butter sandwiches, is the sense of Amber’s wasted potential. She is well supported by Robert Lonsdale as her feckless husband, Jackie Clune as her disapproving mother and Matt Sutton as her taciturn brother-in-law and, even if it’s a slow-burn play, Schwend pays moving homage to female endurance. • At Orange Tree, Richmond, until 7 July.

It is dirty and decaying, its maze of corridors a haven for drug addicts. Abel, who fled Eritrea 10 years ago, doesn’t like working here but says he does it for his kids. It is Sunday afternoon and other Eritreans are crowding the phone kiosk where he has worked for seven years. “Every day [the bus station] gets worse,” Abel says. “They don’t do improvements. It used to be great. It’s not advancing now, I don’t know why.” When architect Ram Karmi began work on the central bus station in 1967, it was to be one of the hallmarks of Tel Aviv: the largest bus station in the world, a brutalist colossus with seven storeys and a modern shopping centre and theatre. Karmi, who also designed Israel’s supreme court building and the third terminal of its main Ben Gurion airport, envisioned that two million people would pass through a year. He also designed it to be vast and confusing to navigate, thinking lost shoppers would spend more. But by the time it opened in 1993 following decades of delays, Tel Aviv’s centre had shifted north. The southern neighbourhood surrounding the station, long a gathering place for newly arrived migrants, was increasingly neglected. Today south Tel Aviv is regarded by most Tel Avivians as the underbelly of the city, and the station “the monstrosity.” The station’s ambitious vision and flawed realisation – and the way it reflects the priorities and problems of modern Israeli society – are the focus of Central Bus Station, a documentary by Czech director Tomáš Elšík. “I realised there’s a society inside the building,” he tells Guardian Cities. “The building itself is empty without the people.” From the late 2000s on, the Israeli government began sending African asylum seekers straight from the border with Egypt to nearby Levinsky Park. They soon they made the neighbourhood theirs, much to the chagrin of other Israeli residents from marginalised communities, like the long-standing Mizrachi and newer Russian Jews. With the African and Asian people who work in the station largely shunned by mainstream society, the building fosters a community like no other in Israel. Amid the shops selling clothes and knick-knacks are a Yiddish book centre, a Filipino church, refugee health clinics, a military command centre. On Saturdays, when public transport shuts down for the Jewish Sabbath, the fourth floor transforms into a Filipino food market. Nearly two decades ago Yonathan Mishal, an artist and activist, started exploring the station and became hooked by its hidden urban subculture. “Little by little I started gathering information mainly by walking around and talking to people,” he says. “There isn’t any information where all of this is covered in one place.” Mishal and others in a collective offer tours of the station every Friday at 2pm, alternating weekly between Hebrew and English. Israelis do not consider their society to be as diverse as the station shows it to be, he says. “When you think about Israeli society, of course it’s very diverse, but no one thinks about it that way. People think you’re unified, you’re Israeli.” Mishal appears in Elšík’s documentary and praises the film as accurately capturing the “kind of weird” atmosphere inside the station, as though there is no sense of time or direction. He compares it to the military in that both are “connected to every part of society” in Israel. The station serves as a gathering point, bomb shelter and command centre for people during times of war, as well as a transit hub for soldiers passing through to their base, work or home. “In times of conflict it kind of transforms instantly into its military function,” says Mishal. “But it’s always in the background, like everything else.” Now there are plans to revitalise – and gentrify – south Tel Aviv, and local leaders want the central bus station closed in favour of smaller bus hubs around the city. But the “white elephant” won’t be budged: it is made from so much cement that it is next to impossible to safely and economically tear down. So the station will remain for the foreseeable future. It is “not only a weird space”, Mishal says at the end of Elšík’s film – the neglected urban space is also, somewhat paradoxically, a site of escape. “The central bus station is not interested at all in who you are or what you want to do,” he says. “It takes some effort but if you cross that line and step inside, you get an opportunity to have a safe space to be whoever you want to be.” The world premiere of Central Bus Station screens at Sheffield Doc/Fest on Saturday 9 June and Tuesday 12 June, followed by a Q&amp;A with director Tomáš Elšík and producer Jitka Kotrlová Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/08/jazz-cd-of-the-month-joshua-redmanron-milesscott-colleybrian-blade-still-dreaming-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T07:30:05Z","webTitle":"Jazz CD of the month: Joshua Redman/Ron Miles/Scott Colley/Brian Blade: Still Dreaming review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/08/jazz-cd-of-the-month-joshua-redmanron-milesscott-colleybrian-blade-still-dreaming-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/08/jazz-cd-of-the-month-joshua-redmanron-milesscott-colleybrian-blade-still-dreaming-review","fields":{"headline":"Jazz CD of the month: Joshua Redman/Ron Miles/Scott Colley/Brian Blade: Still Dreaming review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 2009, after his unforgettable Meltdown performance, a multi-generational Royal Festival Hall crowd queued long after the last encore to shake the 79-year-old Ornette Coleman’s hand. The self-taught Texas saxophonist’s music without regular song chords or orthodox pitch had been ridiculed in his early career, but his faith in it proved emphatically justified. Today, three years after Coleman’s death, a trenchantly personal tribute is being paid by one of the 21st century’s finest jazz improvisers – Joshua Redman, saxophonist son of the late Dewey Redman, Coleman’s tenor-sax partner in the early 1970s. When Coleman went electric with Prime Time in that decade, Redman Sr formed the Old and New Dreams quartet (with Coleman alumni Don Cherry, Charlie Haden and Eddie Blackwell) to play his former boss’s acoustic work. This is a homage both to that group, and to its inspiration’s free and capricious spirit. Joshua Redman, trumpeter Ron Miles, bassist Scott Colley, and drummer Brian Blade play six apposite but vibrantly contemporary originals, and one track each by Coleman and Haden. The springy New Year, a blend of fanfare and a childlike song that becomes a fast-bop sprint, draws a typically swift and swerving tenor solo from Redman against Blade’s tingling cymbal beat. The staccato yet folksy Unanimity features an even better Redman improvisation, and a Don Cherry-reminiscent fusion of fluency and fierce bluster from Miles. Coleman’s classic 1969 lament Comme Il Faut is a highlight, as is a voice-like slow blues (Blues for Charlie) that smoulders with a melancholy majesty. This is a supergroup at work, but – as with Coleman’s own bands and Old and New Dreams themselves – they never sound as if they’re trying to make an issue out of that. This month’s other jazz picks Swiss pianist-composer Nik Bärtsch has been injecting electronica and minimalism with soul, jazzy hipness and danceable bounce with his Ronin Ensemble since 2001, and Awase – with bass recruit Thomy Jordi adding a new fluidity – deepens the group’s famous expressiveness of tone and texture. Norma Winstone-inflected but intimately original singer Brigitte Beraha and pianist Frank Harrison make a beautiful partnership on the low-key but affecting The Way Home, and the Bill Evans-inspired American pianist Lynne Arriale shows how sensitively she always cares for good songs (such as those of Joni Mitchell, Tom Waits, and Lennon-McCartney) on the trio album Give Us These Days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/07/william-wordsworth-orchestral-music-volume-i-cd-review-forgotten-voice-of-quiet-assurance","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T14:00:44Z","webTitle":"William Wordsworth: Orchestral Music Volume I CD review –  forgotten voice of quiet assurance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/07/william-wordsworth-orchestral-music-volume-i-cd-review-forgotten-voice-of-quiet-assurance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/07/william-wordsworth-orchestral-music-volume-i-cd-review-forgotten-voice-of-quiet-assurance","fields":{"headline":"William Wordsworth: Orchestral Music Volume I CD review –  forgotten voice of quiet assurance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The great-great-grandson of the poet’s brother Christopher, William Wordsworth (1908-88) belonged to that mid-20th-century generation of British composers whose works are almost entirely forgotten today. Even during his lifetime, he sometimes struggled to get the attention he thought his music deserved, though after he settled in Scotland in 1961, Wordsworth seems to have enjoyed more success and recognition. He had studied with Donald Tovey in Edinburgh in the 1930s, and apart from a period working on the land as a conscientious objector during the second world war, Wordsworth was able to devote his life entirely to composition. His output included a wide range of instrumental works, including six string quartets, but it was his orchestral music that attracted most attention, especially his eight symphonies. Toccata Classics begins its series with two of them, the single-movement Fourth Symphony, from 1953, and the two-movement Eighth, subtitled Pax Hominibus, which was his last completed work, in 1986. Wordsworth may have been born in the same year as both Messiaen and Elliott Carter, but his music remained almost defiantly untouched by musical developments during his own lifetime. Perhaps there are occasional traces of neoclassicism of the Hindemith variety in the wiry contrapuntal passages, but it’s Sibelius who lurks most obviously between the often austere surfaces of Wordsworth’s music, especially in the lonely string and solo wind lines of the Eighth. Above all, like Sibelius again, there’s a quiet assurance about the orchestral writing, and a total avoidance of unnecessary rhetoric, even in the brassier outbursts that punctuate the Fourth. On this evidence, the Leipāja Symphony Orchestra are a fine band, conducted by John Gibbons (who seems to have a fondness for neglected mid-century British music). There’s certainly enough in their performances of these symphonies, and the two substantial fill-ups, the Divertimento in D Major Op 58 and the Variations on a Scottish Theme Op 72, to make subsequent instalments in this Toccata series well worth following. This week’s other picks Edward Gardner and the BBC Symphony Orchestra follow last year’s impressive account of Elgar’s First Symphony with an equally thoughtful and refined version of the Second, paired with the Serenade for Strings. As with the First, Gardner adopts a slow-burn approach to the symphony, which if anything serves him even better in this troubled and psychologically complex score than it did in its more straightforward predecessor. Nothing is rushed or overdone, and the tender way handles the coda, with its final appearance of the “Spirit of Delight” theme, is as moving as any on disc."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/06/fast-tracked-tasmania-resort-plan-raises-fears-over-chinese-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T03:53:56Z","webTitle":"Fast-tracked Tasmania resort plan raises fears over Chinese investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/06/fast-tracked-tasmania-resort-plan-raises-fears-over-chinese-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/06/fast-tracked-tasmania-resort-plan-raises-fears-over-chinese-investment","fields":{"headline":"Fast-tracked Tasmania resort plan raises fears over Chinese investment","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A proposed mega-development on Tasmania’s east coast has prompted concerns about fast-tracked development and foreign investment in the island state. The Cambria Green proposal was announced to the public in late April, four days before a local council meeting which voted to progress an application to create a special development zone that could house 550 accommodation units and hotel rooms, two golf courses, and an 80-bed health spa that could one day be used as a palliative care unit. The proponent, Cambria Green Agricultural Tourism Management, helmed by Shandong businessman Liu Kejing and Melbourne-based Ronald Hu, says on its Facebook page — it does not have a website — that it wants to “bring the surrounding community along our long-term journey” to support the “integrated, eco-tourism development”. But some say a lack of details around what the final development would look like, combined with the lack of public disclosure prior to the council meeting and a complicated paper trail, has highlighted issues with the state’s planning processes. The property overlooks Freycinet National Park, which rims Wineglass Bay and is home to more than 80 species of native orchid. The park is the biggest tourist drawcard on the east coast and attracted almost 300,000 visitors last year. The Glamorgan Spring Bay council, which voted four-to-three to progress the rezoning application, has been accused of rushing the proposal and of not investigating the community and environmental impact before putting it out to public comment. And the Tasmanian government has been accused by the Greens of putting its growing investment relationship with China, spurred on by the visit of Chinese president Xi Jinping in 2014, ahead of community-focused planning strategy. The proposed 3,185-hectare development area covers the old Cambria estate, centred around a heritage-listed 1821 homestead. The land abuts the Moulting Lagoon, a Ramsar-listed wetland and significant black swan breeding site, and is located in the hamlet of Dolphin Sands, a few kilometres north of Swansea. It stretches across 12 titles, which were purchased by nine different entities from April to August in 2015. Nine of the purchases, conducted in the name of seven different entities and Liu himself, were lodged on the same day in April. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon That same month, Liu visited Tasmanian premier Will Hodgman. The meeting is recorded in the official gifts register, which notes that Liu gave Hodgman a paper scroll worth $100 which was retained by government. The application for a special planning area, approved by the council on 24 April this year, would allow for a large and varied development to be built on the site. It is outlined in a report by Tasmanian-based urban planners Ireneinc and includes: an 18-hole golf course; a nine-hole golf course; a runway for light aircraft; a 120 room “Cambria Sky hotel” with associated gourmet bistro; 70 villas; 240 accommodation units; 80 more apartments set off the golf course; and an 80-bed health retreat, which Ireninc founder Irene Duckett told the ABC could include a palliative care unit. Initially, though, Hu says the site will function as a high-end wedding venue. Also in the masterplan is a village precinct with doctors, dentists, shops, and an art gallery. According to Chinese media reports, a signing ceremony was held in Beijing on 21 April — three days before the council meeting — celebrating a partnership between Beijing Lidaohengtong Culture and Art Company and Cambria Green to create three art museums on the property. The report suggested development had already been approved. It has not, and Cambria Green has not even given a firm indication of what the final development would cost, with reported estimates ranging from $50m to $250m. Most quotes sit around $100m. Hu said in a statement to Guardian Australia that the value of the development could not be confirmed until after the rezoning application had been finalised. “Upon approval, the scale of the Cambria Green development will be very similar with what has been tabled in the master plan,” he said. Britt Steiner was one of three councillors to vote against the rezoning application, demanding more time to read the 100-page application and take expert advice. “People should have been consulted and given the information before the application for rezoning was heard,” Steiner told Guardian Australia. “It really changes the nature of the community and the environment should something like this go ahead.” The application to amend the scheme has now gone out for public comment, with submissions to close on 15 June. But council’s opportunity to veto the rezoning has passed: it will now be decided by the Tasmanian planning commission. If the rezoning is approved, the proposal will not go back to council for a vote unless Cambria Green submits a development application which is outside the new zoning provisions, or unless a member of the public raises an objection to a future development application from the company. Debbie Wisby, who was absent from the meeting but said she would have voted to delay, said the proposal was now out of local government hands. “If everyone comes back and there’s 5,000 noes and there are very good reasons behind them, then we can do a submission from council, but it’s only a submission,” she said. “I don’t think that everyone realised that once they put it out they couldn’t pull it back.” Deputy mayor Cheryl Arnol, who voted in favour, said she wanted to get all the information about the development “on the table”. Senior executives and planning officers at Glamorgan Spring Bay Council had known about the proposal for two years, Arnol said, but were not allowed to discuss it because it was commercial-in-confidence. Progressing the special planning area application broke that cone of silence. “We perhaps could have deferred it for four weeks, but would the decision have been different?” she said. “By initiating the [special area plan] we have put everything on the table for the community to look at.” Councillors all said that constituents had raised concerns with them about foreign ownership of the Cambria Estate land. Tasmania has the highest level of foreign ownership of any Australian jurisdiction, and China has become its largest investor. Recent high-profile acquisitions include the $280m purchase of the Van Diemen’s Land Company by Chinese firm Moon Lake Investments and the purchase of award-winning wedding venue Villa Howden by Chinese millionaire William Wei in 2017. In 2014 the state signed a memorandum of understanding with the China Development Bank to “establish a strategic cooperation relationship in planning,” and facilitate Chinese investment in Tasmania. The three-year agreement expired in November and has not been renewed. Foreign ownership was a significant concern for Tasmanian Greens leader Cassy O’Conner, who said Tasmanian governments reflexively leapt on the next big development as the investment that will save the state. A spokesman for the Tasmanian government said the state was “open for business” and all proposed developments would go through the “appropriate planning processes”. Guardian Australia contacted Cambria Green for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/05/eu-countries-recognise-rights-gay-spouses-european-court-of-justice-ecj","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T13:25:21Z","webTitle":"All EU countries must recognise rights of gay spouses, ECJ rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/eu-countries-recognise-rights-gay-spouses-european-court-of-justice-ecj","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/05/eu-countries-recognise-rights-gay-spouses-european-court-of-justice-ecj","fields":{"headline":"All EU countries must recognise rights of gay spouses, ECJ rules","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"EU countries that have not legalised gay marriage must respect the residency rights of same-sex spouses who want to live together in their territory, the European court of justice has ruled, in a move hailed as a victory for human dignity. The ECJ said member states must recognise the rights of all married couples to free movement, no matter their gender or sexual orientation. The ruling came in response to a case in which Romanian authorities were accused of discriminating against Adrian Coman, who wanted to be able to live in his home country with his American husband, Claibourn Robert Hamilton, with whom he had been living for four years in the US before they married in Brussels in 2010. Romanian authorities refused to grant Hamilton a right of residence on the grounds that he could not be classified in Romania as the spouse of an EU citizen. The men had appealed to Romania’s constitutional court, which referred the case to Luxembourg. Romania is one of six EU member states – along with Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Latvia – that do not legally recognise same-sex relationships. However, the ECJ ruled that while EU countries retain “the freedom whether or not to authorise marriage between persons of the same sex, they may not obstruct the freedom of residence of an EU citizen by refusing to grant his same-sex spouse, a national of a country that is not an EU member state, a derived right of residence in their territory”. The term “spouse” was said to refer to a person joined to another person by marriage. It was, the court said, a gender-neutral term and “may therefore cover the same-sex spouse of an EU citizen”. Responding to the ruling, Coman said: “We can now look in the eyes of any public official in Romania and across the EU with certainty that our relationship is equally valuable and equally relevant, for the purpose of free movement within the EU. “We are grateful to the EU court and to the many people and institutions who have supported us, and through us, other same-sex couples in a similar situation. It is human dignity that wins today.” Hamilton, speaking via video link from New York, said: “We are one step closer to being recognised as a family and I am truly elated.” The court said the ruling did not diminish the democratic choices of Romania, but merely observed that the sexual orientation of the married couple offered no justification for obstructing free movement. Opposition to same-sex relationships can be strong in Romania, where homosexuality was decriminalised in 2002. Coman’s father, Liviu, told the Associated Press he was pleased with the ruling, which would make some aspects of their lives easier. “They are happy together and get on well,” he said. Romanița Iordache, the vice-president of the Romanian gay rights organisation Accept, said: “Starting from this moment onward, Romanian authorities now have an obligation to respect the [ECJ] decision, and ensure residency rights and minimal recognition for all same-sex families in a similar situation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/05/the-problem-with-ubers-new-pr-offensive-its-like-sweatshop-clothes-someone-is-paying","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T13:53:18Z","webTitle":"Is Uber's PR offensive a cynical corporate whitewash?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/05/the-problem-with-ubers-new-pr-offensive-its-like-sweatshop-clothes-someone-is-paying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/05/the-problem-with-ubers-new-pr-offensive-its-like-sweatshop-clothes-someone-is-paying","fields":{"headline":"Is Uber's PR offensive a cynical corporate whitewash?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Near the end of April, Uber dropped a “fireside chat” podcast on to its “partner” channel on SoundCloud. It featured representatives of UberENGAGE (the company’s scheme for soliciting feedback from its drivers) doing a little soul-searching about the taxi app’s toxic public image. Back in 2014, the Guardian had been asking if Uber was the “worst company in Silicon Valley”, and that was before the sexual harassment lawsuits, the #DeleteUber campaign, the employment tribunals over its failure to pay the UK’s minimum wage, Transport for London (TfL) refusing to renew its licence and the forced resignation of its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, last June. On the podcast, Uber London’s marketing strategy boss, Irina Kondrashova, conceded that the company had some “reputational challenges”. But she promised that Uber would come out fighting. “You probably haven’t seen much advertising for Uber in the last six months or so because rebuilding reputation is not just what you say but how you say it,” she said. “Shouting with billboards about how great we are doesn’t feel like the right thing right now. But I have some great news in that [over] the next couple of months we’re going to have some great campaigns coming out.” Uber was ready “to start telling people what we’re about and how we’re doing the right thing and ultimately changing our reputation”. If you are one of the four million or so people in Britain with an Uber account, you may well have seen the results pop up in your inbox recently. Uber has produced a six-part mini-documentary series called Where to, Britain? in collaboration with All 4. It follows Uber drivers and riders in six cities, in an attempt to position hailing an Uber as just another quirky bit of British life – complete with jaunty incidental music and a narration from Dawn French. In the first five-minute-long episode, a driver called Ali picks up the Manchester United players Ashley Young, Juan Mata, Marcus Rashford and Axel Tuanzebe. In the next instalment, Elshan in Bristol picks up a couple of female graffiti artists. “All people featured are genuine Uber users,” says the disclaimer. “While their stories are real, the journeys were created for your enjoyment.” It’s not Uber’s only paradigm-melting marketing strategy. In recent weeks, PRs have pitched to the press the story of one heroic driver with paramedic training who assisted a birth in his car, while another publicity-savvy driver, 53-year-old Manuel Dias, told the Sun last week that Benedict Cumberbatch had jumped out of his Uber to prevent a mugging. Uber was also reportedly among the companies ready to a sign a £500,000 commercial deal with George Osborne’s London Evening Standard to secure “money-can’t-buy” coverage. The Standard has denied the story – but Osborne’s editorship had already raised conflict-of-interest-related questions. In the light of the London mayor Sadiq Khan’s Uber “ban” last year, Osborne published an editorial in defence of Uber that failed to note that one of his other jobs is a £650,000-a-year advisory role at the US fund manager BlackRock, a major Uber investor. He and David Cameron were also noted defenders of the gig economy while in power. Over in Paris, Uber’s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has revealed plans to launch a fleet of flying taxis. And in the US, Uber has appointed the self-described “force of nature in fierce stilettos” Bozoma Saint John as its chief brand officer. “Is this the woman who will save Uber?” asked the New York Times, atop a breathless profile that detailed how the Uber board member Arianna Huffington headhunted Saint John from Apple’s Beats Music. “I felt like she has this incredible capacity for intimacy and for sharing her story and for sharing others’ stories,” Huffington said. “She’s great at social media.” When asked if it wasn’t a little calculating of Uber to hire an African American single mother to repair its image, Saint John responded: “Being present as a black woman – just present – is enough to help exact some of the change that is needed and some that we’re looking for.” It seems unlikely that she can exact the sort of change that some of the 70,000 or so British Uber “driver partners” are fighting for, which is basic recognition of their rights as workers. Uber has lost two court cases brought against it by former drivers Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar, who argued that they were entitled to minimum wage and sick pay. Uber plans to challenge them for a third time. (On the UberENGAGE podcast, one of the company’s legal team, Jonathan Ollivent, complains about the “various obligations” that this puts on Uber. “I don’t know if you’ve read the court order, but it’s really emotive. It’s really nasty about us and the way we work.”) But for Farrar – a member of the IWGB, an independent trade union whose members are predominantly low-paid workers in London – Uber’s “PR shenanigans” amount to little more than an effort to distract users from the fact that the rides are so cheap essentially because it has used 21st-century technology to erode 20th-century workers’ rights. “The point of departure has got to be Uber agreeing to pay the minimum wage to workers. If they can’t deliver that, then what good is all the rest of this stuff?” His argument is that Uber drivers are not in some fancy new category invented by the whiz-kids of Silicon Valley. They are workers (defined legally as “limb (b) workers” under the Employment Rights Act 1996). “You don’t get a lot of rights as a worker, but you do get some,” Farrar says. “Minimum wage, holiday pay, protection against discrimination, whistleblower protection. Not much else. But these rights are really important if you are self-employed as part of someone else’s business, especially at the lower end of the market.” The idea that such rights are incompatible with the flexibility offered by Uber is, he believes, false. All full-time British workers are entitled to 28 days of holiday a year. For part-time workers, holiday accrues at a rate of 12.07%. So for every hour you work, you are entitled to 7.725 minutes of holiday. Rather than rendering this impossible to calculate, Uber’s technology ought to make it much easier. As for pay, while £10-£15 an hour is often cited as a typical driver earning rate, in reality, once a driver has paid 25% commission to Uber, plus about £250 a month to lease a car, £100 a month for petrol, £50 for car washes and so on, earnings often fail to clear the minimum wage threshold. Drivers tell me they only really make proper money on Friday and Saturday nights; they say the idea that you can log off and on between school runs and auditions is a myth. One anonymous blogger, Uber Driver London, calculated his earnings at £23,000 a year (£18,000 after tax) for 60 hours’ work a week with no holidays. At £7.19 an hour, this would be under the minimum wage of £7.83 an hour for workers over 25. Of course, drivers can always take advantage of the limitless overtime afforded by Uber’s “flexibility”. Farrar notes that when Uber dropped rates for drivers waiting at Heathrow from £1.20 a mile to 70p a mile to optimise supply and demand, there was still a huge queue of cars at the airport. “That’s a serious market signal to me,” he says. “You can drop and drop and drop and drop, and people will still work. One, because they’re desperate. They’ll have a fixed number in their head, say, £500, and they will work for 40 hours or 80 hours to get that, whatever it takes. Two, because of the economics of the job; people will take it because they have to pay off those debts. They’ll accept any work.” The reason Uber hasn’t lavished us with heartwarming PR campaigns in the past is because it has adopted a very successful twofold strategy. The first is to make the user experience seamless – as close as possible to Kalanick’s dream of using your smartphone as a “remote control for life” – in the hope that sheer convenience will override any ethical concerns. “What we have to do is just keep reminding them of the awesome experience they have with the app,” says the marketing officer on the podcast. “The amazing experience they have in the car. And then they’ll just keep riding more and more with us.” Considerable effort goes into ensuring that there are plenty of little cars on your smartphone screen when you log on, the fare is cheap, the wait is short, your driver doesn’t talk to you about politics or religion and that he or she will return lost property to you (in their own time) if you leave it in their car (under threat of being reported to the police). When I surveyed friends who use Uber, everyone was aware of the company’s toxicity but were generally reassured by the responses the drivers gave when they asked them how they liked working for Uber. For James Bloodworth, who worked for Uber while researching his book Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain, those conversations need to be set in context. “People asked me if I liked driving for Uber when I was driving and I always felt reluctant to criticise Uber. If you start a negative conversation, you’re more likely to receive a negative rating – and if your reputation falls below 4.4 stars then you’re deactivated.” The conversations that drivers have among themselves are very different in tone, he says. One recent post on the independently run Uber People forum is entitled I Hate Uber: “Guys, do you think is OK 13 hours for £106 after commission working … is it just me or Uber like a cancer destroying drivers mentally and financially?” The consensus is it used to be a lot better for drivers than it is – although one driver shoots back: “No one forced you to be Uber partner driver. You became so on your own free choice. Don’t blame Uber or anyone else.” Bloodworth says that most Uber drivers come from still shadier areas of the economy – and an inscrutable algorithm is often a step up from an exploitative boss. “Overwhelmingly, they’re migrant workers. They have usually come from the back rooms of restaurants or other private hire firms, which are some of the worst industries in London. Restaurant kitchen work is often completely off-grid, no minimum wage. And in regular private-hire firms, you’re at the mercy of the controller. That’s why you have laws around the minimum wage. If you go to Barking [east London], say, you can find someone who will work for £2 an hour. It’s not enough to say: ‘There’s a choice.’ That choice is made in a context.” Which brings us on to the other reason Uber hasn’t offered us much in the way of shiny advertising campaigns. It has instead put its resources into influencing those in power not to mess with a business model that rests on eroding workers’ rights. The company’s head of communications and policy from 2015-2017 was Rachel Whetstone. She is a former Conservative adviser, married to David Cameron’s former aide Steve Hilton, is the godmother of one of Cameron’s children and is the granddaughter of Antony Fisher, the battery-chicken farming magnate who founded the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank. Cameron came under scrutiny for attending a party Whetstone threw at the restaurant Sexy Fish with the lobbying firm Portland in 2015. And last year, leaked emails written by Cameron’s former adviser Daniel Korski showed how No 10 had put pressure on the then London mayor, Boris Johnson, into abandoning proposed legislation to regulate Uber and its rivals. While Johnson’s successor, Khan, has been more critical of Uber, declining to renew its licence last year, he preferred to focus on safety concerns rather than employees’ rights. Last month, as part of the same attempt to change the conversation, Uber revealed an insurance scheme for drivers backed by Axa, promising a £1,000 payout for maternity leave and sick pay, capped at £1,125. For Farrar, that doesn’t begin to redress the balance. “It’s a bit like throwing a toothbrush to a drowning man: ‘I’ll take it, it might come in handy one day. But it’s a bit of a distraction from the crisis I’m in right now.’” Uber is still determined to challenge any attempts to get it to pay basic minimum wage to its drivers. So what’s a cash-strapped millennial to do? It is undeniable that Uber has made the business of getting around London and other cities much more convenient. It’s cheaper than a black cab and more convenient; usually, that’s an either/or choice. But there are already signs that Uber is having unwanted consequences, not only on traffic but on the wider transport ecosystem. TfL recently announced a surprise Tube fare shortfall of £1bn as passengers abandon the service, jeopardising future improvements. But Farrar doesn’t believe that consumers stopping using the app is the answer. “The underlying problem is that the government is not enforcing the law. It’s allowing firms to pay less than the minimum wage. It’s the government’s responsibility, not that of some twentysomething who wants to get home after a night out.” He would like Uber’s business customers to think twice, however. “If you go to Canary Wharf on a weekday night, you’ll see all the bankers going home in private hire vehicles paid for by their companies. They’re the ones I expect more from. We can’t fault low-paid young people for taking an Uber. They shouldn’t be shouldering the responsibility. But we can ask the government. We can ask the regulator. And we can ask businesses.” Bloodworth has similar sympathies with cash-strapped young people. But he asks them to consider the ethics. “There’s a very obvious connection between cheap fares and the low level of money that the drivers are getting. It’s like sweatshop clothes. Someone somewhere is paying for your cheap fare. The internet makes it much easier to ignore that. It’s not just the guy driving your taxi or delivering your pizza who suffers. These conditions spread and become the new normal. Soon, it will be your job, too.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/05/simon-cowell-giving-up-his-phone-is-the-ultimate-show-of-affluence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T11:20:26Z","webTitle":"Simon Cowell giving up his phone is the ultimate show of affluence | Arwa Mahdawi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/05/simon-cowell-giving-up-his-phone-is-the-ultimate-show-of-affluence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/05/simon-cowell-giving-up-his-phone-is-the-ultimate-show-of-affluence","fields":{"headline":"Simon Cowell giving up his phone is the ultimate show of affluence","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Digital detoxes are all the rage these days, but did you know that unplugging from your smartphone suddenly can have severe, occasionally nauseating, side-effects? Within minutes of deciding to disconnect from the modern world to live a purer, more analogue life, some people have reported overwhelming feelings of smug superiority. Many of them appear to transform into modern messiahs, eager to preach the virtues of a smartphone-free life to anyone who will listen. A case in point is Simon Cowell who, apparently, has not touched his smartphone for 10 months. Cowell imparted this news to the Mail on Sunday, which, in an uncharacteristic display of hyperbole, labelled it “an astonishing confession”. The entertainment mogul said that abstaining from his mobile has helped his mental health; it has made him happier and more aware of the people around him. It has also made him more focused, he said. “The thing I get irritated with is when you have a meeting [and] everyone’s on their phone ... You can’t concentrate.” All of that is great for Cowell. But far from being an astonishing confession, I would call his statements astonishingly condescending. Most people don’t have the luxury of abstaining from their smartphones. Many people rely on them to be able to take part in the gig economy. Ever heard an Uber driver talk about giving up their phone? Or a Deliveroo rider? No, because without their phones they would not be able to do their jobs. Just a few years ago, smartphones were a status symbol; today they are the status quo. In our always-on world, it is choosing not to use your phone that is the ultimate show of affluence; you could call this sans phone lifestyle luxury luddism. After all, the easiest way to make a living in the modern economy without a smartphone is to pay an army of assistants with phones to do things for you. I am sure Cowell did not arrange his interview with the Mail on Sunday by carrier pigeon. Cowell is not the only high-profile businessperson to opt out of modern mobile technology; Warren Buffett still uses a flip phone. This is despite his company, Berkshire Hathaway, having bought “more Apple than anything else” in recent years, according to an interview the billionaire did in 2017. In the words of Buffet, Apple is a strong investment because “you are very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally, to the product you are using. [The iPhone] is a very sticky product.” That is the other thing about smartphones, of course. They are engineered to be addictive. The people making mounds of money off them know better than to get high on their own supply. A lot of tech executives are careful to limit their children’s screen time. As smartphones have become ingrained in our lives, tech executives have claimed more concern about the ways in which they have hooked people to their wares. On Monday, Apple unveiled tools to help combat tech addiction at its Worldwide Developers Conference. These include Screen Time, which will let iOS users set daily time limits for apps. But while apps like these may be well meaning, they do little to solve the bigger issue – that, to opt out of the on-demand economy the tech titans helped create, you need to be immensely privileged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/18/royal-wedding-15-key-questions-answered","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T13:32:19Z","webTitle":"Royal wedding: 15 key questions answered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/royal-wedding-15-key-questions-answered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/royal-wedding-15-key-questions-answered","fields":{"headline":"Royal wedding: 15 key questions answered","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What do we know about Meghan’s relatives and who’s turning up? It’s looking light on Meghan’s side. Mother Doria Ragland, 61, appears to be the only close relative inside the chapel since her father, Thomas Markle Snr, is incapacitated due to ill health. Estranged half-siblings, Samantha Markle, 53, a former model writing a memoir entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister, and Thomas Markle Jnr, 51, a window fitter who was arrested earlier this year for allegedly holding a gun to a girlfriend’s head in an argument, are not on the guest list. Their lack of an invite is perhaps unsurprising given they have graced acres of newsprint and hours of airtime venting bile against their sister. The Markle family has become a big attraction in the red-top circus, successfully hijacking the news agenda in the final days. Meghan’s uncle, Michael Markle, 78, a retired US diplomat, is reportedly “upset and surprised” at his lack of an invite. Another uncle, Frederick Markle, 75, who as “Bishop Dismas” reportedly runs a small chapel as leader of the Eastern Orthodox Catholic church in America, has refused to speak to the media – to the undoubted relief of Kensington Palace. Why are all these relatives now wandering around the UK and are they being paid? The lack of an invitation to the wedding hasn’t deterred Thomas Markle Jr – who earlier this year wrote an open letter urging Prince Harry not to marry his half-sister – from hopping on a plane to the UK. Following a sudden charge of heart on the desirability of the ceremony, he appeared on the front page of the Daily Mirror standing outside Windsor Castle under the headline: “My sister will be the perfect modern princess.” His ex-wife, Tracey Dooley, has also been involved, despite her not having seen Meghan for 20 years. She announced her arrival in London – supposedly to appear on ITV’s Good Morning Britain – along with sons (and Meghan’s nephews) Tyler and Thomas. Good Morning Britain now says they will not be appearing on the show. Why is the royal wedding coverage being run by gossip website TMZ rather than Kensington Palace? The royal press office did its best to keep a lid on excessive media coverage of Meghan family, writing to British newspapers and requesting they respect the family’s privacy in the runup to the ceremony. Unfortunately, this arrangement disintegrated when the Mail on Sunday revealed Meghan’s father Thomas Sr had worked with a photo agency to sell staged pictures to the celebrity press. Then the floodgates opened, with the world’s media demanding answers from the palace. Instead, both UK newspapers and the royal palace seem to have been reliant on TMZ for information, as it ran regular interviews with Thomas Sr as he prevaricated over whether to attend to the wedding. Meanwhile, Meghan’s half-sister Samantha claims to have been hospitalised after her boyfriend reportedly crashed their car while trying to avoid a photographer. Who is to blame for this mess? Palace infighting? Weddings, funerals, garden parties, jubilees. Royalty has got them all down to a fine art. Except this one, where it lost its grip on the news agenda. Whispers below stairs, apparently, are that it would never have happened under the experienced and capable Sir Christopher Geidt. He’s the Queen’s former private secretary, who was forced out last year after palace infighting. There are three seats of royal power; Buckingham Palace and the Queen, Clarence House and Prince Charles, and Kensington Palace and William and Harry. In this case, the buck must stop with the latter. “Christopher would have known how to handle things,” one former colleague confided to the Daily Mail. “In particular, he would have known how to handle Harry.” Isn’t Harry’s family also a bit dysfunctional? Yes. This point hasn’t been lost on Australia’s Daily Telegraph, which dedicated Friday’s front page to pictures of the Windsors drinking, under the tagline “Worried about the Markles? Meet the Windsors”. Who else is going to be attending? Meghan’s glossy posse of friends have been jetting in. Jessica Mulroney, Canadian stylist and daughter-in-law of the former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, was spotted shopping near Kensington Palace. The fashion designer Misha Nonoo, the couple’s rumoured matchmaker, shared Instagram snaps of herself in London. The Indian actor Priyanka Chopra and Markle’s former agent Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, are believed en route. Marcus Anderson, the director of upmarket members’ club Soho House in London, where Meghan and Harry had their first date in 2016, is certain to be on the list. Fans of the US legal drama, Suits, can expect to see co-stars Gabriel Macht, Rick Hoffman and Sarah Rafferty, as well as her on-screen husband Patrick Adams. Royal staples will include the Beckhams and Sir Elton John. Is there anything in particular to look out for during the ceremony? The ceremony in Windsor Castle’s chapel is, unsurprisingly, Anglican given Harry is in the line-of-succession to take over as monarch and therefore become head of the Church of England. Although a group of English clergyman will be involved, including the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the breakout star is likely to be Michael Bruce Curry, the first African-American head of the Episcopal church in the US, who is giving the main address. London-based gospel group the Kingdom Choir will also perform, along with teenage cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who was personally invited by Meghan. What if you don’t have an invite? Who’s actually going to turn up to watch this wedding in person? First the royal fanatics, camped out behind the barriers, are decked in union flags – a godsend for desperate foreign TV networks with no one else to interview in the week before the wedding. Secondly, the handpicked extras. They are 1,200 members of the public who have been invited to stand in the Windsor Castle grounds to cheer the couple. They will provide a good TV backdrop but must bring their own picnic. Finally, there are general tourists. Around 100,000 are expected to brave Windsor train queues, airport-style security and ceremonial horse ordure. Huge screens have been set up around town. Have the US networks lost it over the event? Who has been booked to cover it? Around 5,000 journalists and media workers have been accredited to cover the wedding. Interest is particularly enormous in the US, a republic whose endless fascination with the British royal family is boosted by the presence of a California-born bride. US TV networks have responded by bringing in their top presenters for non-stop coverage of the event, despite the time difference requiring an early start. ABC will start its broadcast at 5am for viewers on the east coast. NBC, meanwhile, has flown presenters Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb to the UK, built an enormous temporary studio on the roof of a Windsor hotel and will dedicate its four-hour flagship Today programme to the ceremony. The interest has led to enormous demand for any vaguely authentic royal commentator, who is willing to stand in front of a camera and offer insight while the ceremony is under way. Hang on, how is the British media doing? How will the press be managing it on the day to keep them away? The British media has done its best to keep up, with newspapers promising commemorative photo supplements and raking over the history of the Markle family. The BBC, ITV and Sky News will broadcast live during the day from temporary studios. All footage will be provided by the BBC on a pooled basis, while a representative of the Press Association will be allowed inside the chapel to provide coverage for print. What will they be wearing for the ceremony? The wedding dress is top secret. Designers Ralph &amp; Russo, whose £56,000 couture dress Meghan wore for her official engagement photos, are rumoured to be the chosen ones. One eagle-eyed shopper snapped rolls of ivory silk lying on a wooden table at the London premises of Joel &amp; Sons Fabrics, which holds a royal warrant. They were labelled “Ralph &amp; Russo”, the Sunday Express reported, commenting that ivory would be suitable for a second-time bride. Of course, the silk could have been for a completely different bride. Harry is expected to wear uniform. But maybe not that of the Household Cavalry because of his beard. The army does not like beards – though Harry has previously appeared in his Blues and Royal uniform sporting facial hair. So, bets are on him wearing the uniform of the Captain General of the Royal Marines. It is a more senior title, and one he inherited upon Prince Philip’s retirement last year. The Marines don’t mind beards – as much. How much is this going to cost and who is paying for it? We will never know. Prince Charles is said to be footing the bill for the “core elements” of his younger son’s nuptials. That won’t include security, which is met by taxpayers. For William and Kate’s wedding, at Westminster Abbey, the security bill was £6m, with almost £3m spent on police overtime costs, according to one report. This is a smaller affair. Costs to the council in road closures, parking suspensions and the recent resurfacing of part of the carriage route will undoubtedly add up. What are the worst wedding souvenirs? The choice is endless. Most original goes to Meghan’s nephew Tyler Dooley, 25, a cannabis farmer in Oregon, where marijuana is legal. He is reportedly planning a potent new hybrid strain of cannabis to mark the wedding called Markle’s Sparkle. Should his aunt and Harry ever visit him at home, he will be “more than happy” to offer them a sample. Another inventive gem – away from the mugs, plates, commemorative tea towels and cardboard cutouts – are the “Crown Jewels Heritage condoms”. At £10 for a box of four, described as “fit for a prince” they are sold in a souvenir box that plays God Save the Queen and The Star Spangled Banner when opened. Will the royals be more popular after all of this? A YouGov poll commissioned by the anti-monarchy group Republic said that two-thirds of the British public are not interested in the royal wedding. Judging by the readership for stories involving the wedding, it seems some members of the British public may be saying one thing to pollsters and then acting differently. However, the poll did suggest that while the majority of the British public are fans of the Queen, they are less keen on her heir Prince Charles. As a result, the successful launch of a new generation of royals, including Meghan, could be crucial to ensuring the institution survives long into the future. When is this all going to be over? Once coverage of the wedding, the aftermath and the honeymoon is complete there will be years of coverage of Meghan and Harry setting up their new life together. If you’re looking for them to disappear from the media’s gaze any time soon then you’re probably going to be disappointed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/17/theresa-may-tries-to-rally-support-for-customs-plan-from-eu-leaders","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T18:40:25Z","webTitle":"Theresa May struggles to rally support among EU leaders for new customs plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/17/theresa-may-tries-to-rally-support-for-customs-plan-from-eu-leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/17/theresa-may-tries-to-rally-support-for-customs-plan-from-eu-leaders","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May struggles to rally support among EU leaders for new customs plan","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A bold attempt by Theresa May to crack the Brexit impasse ran into trouble on Thursday as the Irish prime minister warned a new customs plan signed off by her warring ministers could be insufficient to avoid a hard border. The prime minister has persuaded reluctant Brexiters to agree to a plan to continue applying EU tariffs beyond the end of 2020, if no agreement has been reached to alleviate the need for border checks. May is now expected to deliver formal proposals within a couple of weeks, following a frantic day of diplomacy in the margins of an EU security conference that took her to Bulgaria and Macedonia. She sought to rally support from EU leaders for a new plan for the so-called “backstop”, which would kick in if no solution has been found to the challenge of avoiding a hard border. After a 45-minute bilateral, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, reported that he had seen “new thinking”. He said that he welcomed anything that would align all of the EU and the UK in terms of customs into the future. Brussels has made it clear that Ireland must be satisfied before any deal is accepted. But he suggested checks would still be required at the border if the UK left the single market. He said: “Any move on customs with the UK would be welcome but I need to be very clear that avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is about more than customs. The single market and aspects related to regulation are important as well.” On Tuesday, ministers on the Brexit committee agreed to a plan under which Britain would continue to levy EU tariffs, but retain the power to make its own free-trade agreements. On Thursday, May – with her chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins – had a series of meetings with the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the French president Emanuel Macron, and further meetings with the EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and the European council president Donald Tusk, as well as Varadkar. At a press conference in Skopje, Macedonia, at the end of the day, May confirmed she still intended to seek a UK-wide proposal that would avoid the need for the backstop to be invoked, and would take Britain out of the customs union. “We will be, in future, outside that customs union able to develop our own independent trade policy,” she said. It would mean as frictionless trade as possible, she insisted. But while her statement reiterated familiar pledges, it was also compatible with the latest proposal. At a press conference before boarding the plane to return to London, the prime minister said: “In December, when the joint report was published between the European Union and the United Kingdom, we set out clearly options in relation to the commitment that we have given for no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. “We expect that to be dealt with through the overall relationship we have with the European Union. But there were then two further levels of option, including the final fallback option. “The commission then published a fallback option which was not acceptable to to us. And we will be bringing forward our own proposal for that fallback option in due course.”EU sources said the prime minister was firmly told by Tusk, during a meeting that she personally requested, that Brussels and Dublin needed to see the concept on paper before they could give May any confidence about the June European council summit. The prime minister was said to appear anxious to know whether the proposal could lead to Brussels starting work on a political declaration about the future trading relationship with the UK. Varadkar had warned earlier at the summit in Sofia that, without substantial progress on the question of the Irish border, “we need to seriously question whether we’re going to have a withdrawal agreement at all”. The EU official said the meeting with Tusk had been about the UK’s “expectations in June”. He said: “We had to say it was too early to tell. All the news coming from London is very disorientating. Tusk was clear that it is not only about what the commission might recommend. “They have to get all 27 member states to agree, and that includes Ireland. And Tusk is squarely behind Dublin.” Varadkar later told reporters that, during 45 minutes of talks, May had sketched out her hopes for what he described as a “deep customs arrangement”, a phrase which will likely inflame Brexiters in the UK, who fear that their hopes of independent trade policy post-Brexit could be scotched. Varadkar said: “The prime minister gave me an insight into some new thinking that the UK government has in relation to customs, and obviously we’ll see how that develops, we haven’t seen any detail of that yet. “But certainly I think any move on customs which brings the UK closer to the EU is to be welcomed, but I very much emphasised that resolving the issue of a hard border requires more than customs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/23/america-is-not-in-the-heart-elaine-castillo-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T08:01:17Z","webTitle":"America Is Not the Heart by Elaine Castillo review – an impressive debut novel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/23/america-is-not-in-the-heart-elaine-castillo-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/23/america-is-not-in-the-heart-elaine-castillo-review","fields":{"headline":"America Is Not the Heart by Elaine Castillo review – an impressive debut novel","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As titles go, this one is forceful: it proclaims that the book will correct some misconception about either nation or organ. The novel centres on a quiet woman with broken thumbs. Hero lives in Milpitas, a suburb of San Jose, California, where she works in a restaurant, babysits her cousin and flirts with Rosalyn, a cute makeup artist. Slowly, she reveals her past to Rosalyn and to the reader. Hero has travelled far: from a wealthy childhood in the Philippines, to the mountains where she was a doctor for guerrilla revolutionary group the National People’s Army, to the locked room in which she was tortured, and finally to America. The US portions of the book focus on the intricacies of Filipino-American society. Castillo gives us hardworking nurses, snooty upper-class mothers, faith healers and restaurant workers as Hero navigates a web of relationships, some tracing back to grand mansions in the Philippines, others formed in the parking lots and hair salons of Milpitas. Castillo makes this small suburb feel vast, even overwhelming. The sections set in the Philippines are fragmentary. We are given just enough detail to see how that time led to this one. Castillo etches in the class stratifications, civil strife and divide between rich and poor. Yet the emphasis of the narrative is in Milpitas. Hero’s hands were broken by her past, but the most important thing is what she does with them now. Her aunt grew up poor and hungry, yet now she is the one who sends money back. Castillo respects the right of these characters to have a present as important as their pasts. The texture and complexity of this community are represented in part by the number of languages that flit across the page. Throughout, Castillo employs English, a smattering of Spanish and three of the native languages of the Philippines: Tagalog, Pangasinan and Ilocano. Although mixing languages to represent the code-switching of immigrant communities is now quite common in literature, it is rare to see so many in one book. Characters find themselves more or less able to navigate this multilingual maze, and this dipping between fluency and incomprehension is a particularly vivid way of expressing both the difficulty and beauty of belonging to an immigrant community. Hero speaks Ilocano, English and Tagalog, but she lacks Pangasinan. A faith healer begins talking to her “in Pangasinan, a long sentence that sounded inviting, conspiratorial”. But the invitation and conspiracy are lost. Rosalyn, a Filipina-American, grew up with Tagalog, but now she “could barely read a sentence”. As she grew older, the language of her grandparents slipped away, almost without her noticing. Realising this is a source of deep and sudden pain. Despite the barriers of communication caused by trauma, class and language, Hero begins to share tiny bits of herself. She starts to form relationships with her proud and spiky aunt, her bold cousin and with Rosalyn. On one level, the love story is mundane. The pair go to parties, watch a parade, share food. But it also feels radical, if only because such stories are so often ignored or glossed over. As a bisexual Asian American, I was startled by how moved I was. When I was growing up it was common to hear people say there weren’t such things as gay Asian girls, so to see them on the page is deeply gratifying. Castillo’s portrayal of their physical relationship is powerful because it is frank. The first time they have sex is clearly described. We see two women trying to figure out how their minds and bodies might fit together. The book’s epigraph is a quote from Carlos Bulosan’s America Is in the Heart. Published in 1946, Bulosan’s semi-autobiographical novel follows a young Filipino and includes a speech that gives the work its title: America is not a land of one race or one class of men. We are all Americans that have toiled and suffered and known oppression and defeat, from the first Indian that offered peace in Manhattan to the last Filipino pea pickers ... America is in the hearts of men that died for freedom; it is also in the eyes of men that are building a new world. By quoting Bulosan and referencing his novel in her title, Castillo announces that her book is not only the story of Hero, but the story of a country. Hero occupies the new world predicted by Bulosan’s idealistic young man. Her world has indeed been built by Filipinos and Mexicans and black Americans. At one point, Rosalyn reflects that the men who ran a comics store were “the only white people [she] ever came across in Milpitas”. Castillo’s America is not a utopia: there is poverty, unfairness and snobbery. Yet the tenderness of the characters glows. Like Bulosan’s, her America is in the heart. Hero and the reader come to love those she meets in the US. The Bay Area, at first a foreign land, feels like home by the end of the novel. But the heart Castillo describes has room for more than America. It has room for Ilocano, Tagalog, Pangasinan. It stretches out beyond the US borders to comrades in the jungle and to family across oceans. Although the book is thick, it is a small vessel to contain all that Castillo slips in. She has brought a whole community to the page. Rowan Hisayo Buchanan’s Harmless Like You is published by Sceptre. • America Is Not the Heart is published byAtlantic.
